class ArcGISTextIO(gwt.GwtIO):
    """
    Opens, reads, and writes weights file objects in ArcGIS ASCII text format.

    Spatial weights objects in the ArcGIS text format are used in
    ArcGIS Spatial Statistics tools.
    This format is a simple text file with ASCII encoding.
    This format can be directly used with the tools under
    the category of "Mapping Clusters." But, it cannot be used with
    the "Generate Spatial Weights Matrix" tool.

    The first line of the ArcGIS text file is a header including the name of
    a data column that holded the ID variable in the original source data table.
    After this header line, it includes three data columns
    for origin id, destination id, and weight values.
    ArcGIS Spatial Statistics tools support only unique integer ids.
    Thus, the values in the first two columns should be integers.
    For the case where a weights object uses non-integer IDs,
    ArcGISTextIO allows users to use internal ids corresponding to record numbers,
    instead of original ids.

    An exemplary structure of an ArcGIS text file is as follows:
    [Line 1]    StationID
    [Line 2]    1    1    0.0
    [Line 3]    1    2    0.1
    [Line 4]    1    3    0.14286
    [Line 5]    2    1    0.1
    [Line 6]    2    3    0.05
    [Line 7]    3    1    0.16667
    [Line 8]    3    2    0.06667
    [Line 9]    3    3    0.0
    ...

    As shown in the above example, this file format allows explicit specification
    of weights for self-neighbors.
    When no entry is available for self-neighbors,
    ArcGIS spatial statistics tools consider they have zero weights.
    PySAL ArcGISTextIO class ignores self-neighbors if their weights are zero.

    Notes
    -----
    When there are an dbf file whose name is identical to the name of the source text file,
    ArcGISTextIO checks the data type of the ID data column and uses it for reading and
    writing the text file. Otherwise, it considers IDs are strings.
