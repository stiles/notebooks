PySAL, the Python spatial analysis library, is an open source cross-platform 
library for geospatial data science with an
emphasis on geospatial vector data written in Python. It supports the
development of high level applications for spatial analysis, such as

  - detection of spatial clusters, hot-spots, and outliers
  - construction of graphs from spatial data
  - spatial regression and statistical modeling on geographically embedded networks
  - spatial econometrics
  - exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis

PySAL Components
================

* **explore** - modules to conduct exploratory analysis of spatial data, including statistical testing on points, networks, and polygonal lattices.
* **viz** - visualize patterns in spatial data to detect clusters, outliers, and hot-spots. 
* **model** - model spatial relationships in data with a variety of linear, generalized-linear, generalized-additive, and nonlinear models.
* **dynamics** - characterize distributional change, both internally and externally, for spatial and nonspatial distributions.
* **lib** - solve a wide variety of computational geometry problems:

  - graph construction from polygonal lattices, lines, and points.
  - construction and interactive editing of spatial weights matrices & graphs
  - computation of alpha shapes, spatial indices, and spatial-topological relationships
  - reading and writing of sparse graph data, as well as pure python readers of spatial vector data. 

Installation
============

PySAL is available through
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__ (in the `defaults` or `conda-forge` channel) and `Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`__. We recommend installing PySAL from conda-forge:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install pysal

PySAL can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pysal

As of version 2.0.0 PySAL has shifted to Python 3 only.

Users who need an older stable version of PySAL that is Python 2 compatible can install version 1.14.3 through `pip` or `conda`:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install pysal==1.14.3

Documentation
=============

For help on using PySAL, check out the following resources:

* `User Guide <http://pysal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/users/index.html>`_
* `Tutorials and Short Courses <https://github.com/pysal/notebooks/blob/master/courses.md>`_

Development
===========


As of version 2.0.0, PySAL is now a collection of affiliated geographic data science packages. 
Changes to the code for any of the subpackages should be directed at the respective upstream repository, and not made here. 
Infrastructural changes for the meta-package, like those for tooling, building the package, and code standards, will be considered.

Development is hosted on github_.
