  In the nomination hearing of Judge Clarence Thomas to
be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States, held October 13, 1991, published by the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary, some pages were inadvert-
ently omitted from being printed.

  These omitted pages are printed in this publication and
would have appeared in S. Hrg. 102-1084, part 4, p. 346,
after the fifth line.

  The material is reproduced here to provide a complete
record of proceedings.

*  *  *  *       *  *  *

  Three, Anita Hill has asserted the Department of Education was
going to be abolished and that was one factor in her decision to ac-
cept a position with Clarence Thomas at the EEOC.

  Well, at that same time, there was much discussion in Congress
about the abolition of EEOC, as well. It was seriously suggested
that title VII enforcement functions and Age Act responsibilities be
redistributed to other agencies of the Federal Government, and
that the Commission, itself, should be abolished. Anyone involved
with the confirmation proceedings of Clarence Thomas to the
EEOC Chairmanship, as Anita Hill was, surely would have been
aware of this.

  I have known Clarence Thomas in times of his darkest moments,
and in his shining triumphs. I have had a role in most of his con-
firmation battles, none of which have ever been easy. In that capac-
ity, I have been privy to the most intimate details of his life. In
all that time, never, never has anyone raised allegations such as
Anita has.

  Clarence Thomas, whom I admire and greatly respect, is a fine
and decent man. He does not deserve this savaging of his char-
acter, of his reputation, of his honor. He does not deserve this.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much, Ms. Myers.
  The Chair yields to the Senator from Vermont.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, what is the
  The CHAIRMAN. We will work the way we did in the past. We will
have two 15-minute rounds on either side, a total of four 15-minute
rounds if it is the desire of the primary questioners to go that long
and then we will move to 5-minute rounds.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, very much.
  Ms. Alvarez, prior to giving it here, had you discussed your state-
ment with anybody else, before you delivered it here?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. Oh, no.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  And, Ms. Fitch.

            (l)
  Ms. FITCH. I discussed it with counsel, procedural matters, and
was simply advised, the only advice I was given was to tell the
truth and that's what I tried to do.

  Senator LEAHY. Did anybody ask to change any part of your
statement?

  Ms. FITCH. NO, I had my statement with me. It was simply typed
up.

  Senator LEAHY. MS. Holt.
  Ms. HOLT. NO. AS MS. Fitch indicated, I also talked to counsel
on procedural matters and was simply told to tell the truth.
  Senator LEAHY. And nobody asked you to make any changes in
your statement?

   Ms. HOLT. NO.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  And Ms. Berry.
  Ms. BERRY. I talked with staff. I am not known as a woman that
anybody can tell real easily
  Senator LEAHY. That's not my question.
  Ms. BERRY [continuing]. What to do. And nobody changed any-
thing on my testimony, asked me to change anything, just asked
me to tell the truth and the facts as I know them.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, MS. Berry, just for the confusion, I saw a
list on a panel earlier that Phyllis Myers was going to be here and
you say your name you always use professionally is Phyllis Berry.
You made some reference earlier to the fact that Professor Hill said
she didn't know you. Wasn't that a case where she was asked about
Phyllis Myers, and said she didn't know Phyllis Myers, and said
later she understands it was Phyllis Berry and said, yes, she does
know Phyllis Berry, and that she was confused by the name?
  Ms. BERRY. I am not aware of that.
  Senator LEAHY. Let me ask Ms. Alvarez, when you worked with
Clarence Thomas, how much of a typical day did you spend with
him?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Sometimes I saw him once a day, sometimes I
didn't see him at all, sometimes more than once. There was really
no typical day. We did not spend a lot of time in his office or with
him.
  Senator LEAHY. And you certainly did not see him all day long,
though, that's my point?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO; I mean I would see him come into the office.
I would occasionally see him during the day, not all day.
  Senator LEAHY. And so there could have been times he could
have had discussions with Anita Hill that you would not have been
there?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Oh, absolutely.
  Senator LEAHY. SO you don't know, from personal knowledge,
whether Professor Hill is telling the truth or not, from personal
knowledge?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  And Ms. Fitch, when you worked with Clarence Thomas, how
much of a typical day did you spend with him?
  Ms. FITCH. My schedule was rather unusual because I was out
in research libraries and out in the school system so there were
days, there might be weeks when I did not see him or touch base
with Ms. Holt to let her know what I was doing.

  Senator LEAHY. SO it would be fair to say that, from personal
knowledge, you would not know whether Ms. Hill was telling the
truth or not?

  Ms. FITCH. Personal knowledge, no.
  Senator LEAHY. And Ms. Holt, you probably were as close to
Judge Thomas as anybody, you were his personal secretary, is that
correct?
  Ms. HOLT. That's correct.
  Senator LEAHY. And the door between your office and his
  Ms. HOLT. I am sorry?
  Senator LEAHY. I said there was a door between your office and
his?

   Ms. HOLT. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. And there were times when people would go in
and meet with him, the door would be closed, is that correct?

  Ms. HOLT. That's true.
   Senator LEAHY. And times when Anita Hill, for example, might
be in the office and it would be just the two of them and the door
would be closed, is that correct?
  Ms. HOLT. That's correct.
   Senator LEAHY. And so you would not know, from personal
knowledge, whether Professor Hill was telling the truth or not?
  Ms. HOLT. NO, I would not.
   Senator LEAHY. And Ms. Berry, how about you, would you have,
from personal knowledge, knowledge of whether Professor Hill is
telling the truth or not?
   Ms. BERRY. I would not have personal knowledge.
   Senator LEAHY. NOW, let me ask this of each of you. As I told
Judge Thomas, and I think other people who are here did, I don't
really have any interest in what he does in the privacy of his home,
nor do I have of any of the rest of you, but as you are probably
aware, a supporter of his, Lavita Coleman, is quoted in the New
York Times as saying that at Yale Law School Judge Thomas "At
least once humorously described an X-rated film to me and other
colleagues." Then the Times story continues and says, "elaborating
beyond the statement, she acknowledged that this had occurred
more than once."
   I will start with you, Ms. Alvarez, have you ever heard Judge
Thomas engage in such conversation with colleagues in the work
place?
   Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, never.
   Senator LEAHY. MS. Fitch.
   Ms. FITCH. Never, ever.
   Senator LEAHY. MS. Holt.
   Ms. HOLT. Never.
   Senator LEAHY. MS. Berry.
   Ms. BERRY. Absolutely not.
   Senator LEAHY. Have you ever heard or do you have others that
will tell you of Judge Thomas talking about pornographic films, Ms.
Berry?
   Ms. BERRY. Absolutely not.
   Senator LEAHY. MS. Holt.
   Ms. HOLT. NO.

  Senator LEAHY. MS. Fitch.

   Ms. FITCH. NO.

  Senator LEAHY. MS. Alvarez.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, did Judge Thomas ever engage--let me be
more specific, I want to speak of social activities with the staff--
did he ever go out to lunch with members of the staff, Ms. Alvarez?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes; he went to lunch with members of the staff,
that was not unusual, but not frequently, very rarely.
  Senator LEAHY. Would you ever go out--Ms. Fitch, you said you
were gone a lot, but would your answer be the same?
  Ms. FITCH. There were occasions when I was in the office, and
I would be walking through and he would look for someone to go
accompany him to lunch so two or three of us might accompany
him at that time.
  Senator LEAHY. And, Ms. Holt, that was your experience also?
  Ms. HOLT. Absolutely.
  Senator LEAHY. And Ms. Berry?
  Ms. BERRY. The same.
  Senator LEAHY. Did you ever go out for beers or drinks or social-
ize after work, Ms. Alvarez?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes, very, then again, very infrequently. It would
be something like, you know, it would be 5:30 or 6 o'clock and we
would still be talking over something and we would just go grab
a beer.
  Senator LEAHY. MS. Fitch.
  Ms. FITCH. I am not aware of that.
  Senator LEAHY. MS. Holt.
  Ms. HOLT. Not with me, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. MS. Berry.
  Ms. BERRY. NO; the only social functions that we had at all would
be in connection with my job when I became Director of the Office
of Congressional Affairs and there was some reception or some-
thing like that that we had to attend.
  Senator LEAHY. Did you ever know of Judge Thomas dating any
member of the staff, Ms. Alvarez?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir.

  Senator LEAHY. YOU never dated him, for example?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir.

  Senator LEAHY. MS. Fitch.
  Ms. FITCH. NO, sir, and I never dated him either.
  Senator LEAHY. Same answer. Ms. Holt.

   Ms. HOLT. NO, sir.

  Senator LEAHY. And Ms. Berry.
  Ms. BERRY. I never dated him and I guess my husband would
have a lot to say about that if I did. [Laughter.]
  Senator LEAHY. I just didn't want to leave--I knew what your
answer would be but I didn't want, having asked the same question
of the other three, to leave you out and leave some inference.
  Ms. BERRY. That's a legitimate question.
  Senator LEAHY. But did you ever know of him dating anybody
else
  Ms. BERRY. NO, never.
  Senator LEAHY. Either at EEOC or at the Department of Edu-
cation?

  Ms. BERRY. Or at the Department of Education, no.
  Senator LEAHY. And your answer from each of the rest would be
the same.
  Now Professor Hill, I think by the feelings of most people here,
was a quite believable witness and so now we hear a lot of Judge
Thomas' supporters saying that well, that it must be the press or
it is some kind of outside groups, or who are really the villains in
this process. At least the telephone calls to my office seem to be
this and I hear a number of his supporters speaking virtually from
the same fire book in that regard. We even had a suggestion that
her testimony was lifted from the "Exorcist," I guess this is sort of
the "Devil made me do it" defense here.
  Do you have any personal knowledge that Professor Hill is a part
of a conspiracy to stop this nomination, Ms. Alvarez?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO personal knowledge, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. MS. Berry?
  Ms. BERRY. I don't have any personal knowledge that Anita is a
part of a conspiracy. I think she has allowed herself to become a
pawn in this process.
  Senator LEAHY. And Ms. Holt.
  Ms. HOLT. NO, sir, I don't.
  Senator LEAHY. MS. Fitch.
  Ms. FITCH. NO personal knowledge, no.
  Senator LEAHY. MS. Myers, in the statement that you issued in
response to Anita Hill's press conference, you said--and I want to
make sure I am quoting you correctly--"At the Commission I was
Clarence Thomas' political eyes and ears and that meant that I
knew a great deal about his personal life, as well."
  Is that an accurate characterization of what you said?

   Ms. BERRY. Yes, it is.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Ms. BERRY. It's exactly what I said.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you know Angela Wright?
  Ms. BERRY. I certainly do.
  Senator LEAHY. And in what--let me ask you this--Angela
Wright attributed the following comment about Judge Thomas, and
attributed this to you in her statement to the committee, and she
attributed you has having said this, "Well"--speaking of Clarence
Thomas--"he's a man, you know, he's always hitting on everybody."
  Did you ever make that comment to Angela Wright?
  Ms. BERRY. Absolutely not. By the time--I know Angela Wright
in this way. Angela and I are from North Carolina and Angela and
I both served on the staff of Congressman Charlie Rose. I was re-
sponsible for getting Angela a position at the Republican National
Committee. I was not responsible for her having a position at the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. By the time Angela
was hired at the EEOC she and I were not friends.
  One thing that I am not in the habit of doing in the capacity of
being Clarence Thomas' political eyes and ears and sharing many
confidences with him, is discussing him with anybody. I was not in
the habit of discussing Clarence Thomas with anybody.
  Senator LEAHY. Did you
  Ms. BERRY. And I certainly was not in the habit of saying any-
thing to Angela Wright. Her staff and my staffs could confirm that
we were barely on professional speaking terms.

  Senator LEAHY. SO you would say that the comment that she at-
tributes to you, that, "Well, he's a man, you know, he's always hit-
ting on everybody," you never made that comment either to her
first, yes or no, you never made that comment to her?

   Ms. BERRY. NO.

  Senator LEAHY. Did you ever say anything even like that to her?
  Ms. BERRY. That doesn't even sound like me.
  Senator LEAHY. Or to anybody else.
  Ms. BERRY. Never.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, MS. Fitch, one of the things that all of us
have asked in here, and I am sure that you and everybody else has
gone through in their mind is what motivates all of this? And if a
woman--well, just let me ask you this--you know Professor Hill
very well.
  Ms. FITCH. I know Professor Hill, we were collegial and friendly.
I never said I knew her very well, but we were friendly, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. She worked hard to get where she was
  Ms. FITCH. I am sorry?
  Senator LEAHY. Would it be a fair statement that she worked
hard to get where she was?
  Ms. FITCH. I think she did, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Did you ever witness at any time when she
would take an action that would jeopardize her career?
  Ms. FITCH. NO, I never did.
  Senator LEAHY. And did you ever have an occasion where she
lied to you?

   Ms. FITCH. NO.

  Senator LEAHY. What can she possibly gain from speaking out
against Judge Thomas? I mean what could she possibly gain by
making up a story and speaking out against him?

  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I have no idea. I am not a psychiatrist,
though I admit I wanted to be one for a long time. But I have no
idea. I cannot speak to her motivation. It may very well be that
Professor Hill believes what she says.

  That's not to say that, therefore, she's telling a falsehood, but it
doesn't mean that the situation ever happened. Those two things
can exist together.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, we have two such diametrically opposed
stories. There is one thing that both agree on in testimony here.
Professor Hill agrees that what she has described would be sexual
harassment. I asked Judge Thomas exactly the same question. I
said, on these set of facts, of course he categorically denies them,
but on these set of facts would that be sexual harassment? And he
said, yes, it would. So they both agree on that.

  Is it possible that each of them believes he or she is telling the
truth?

  Ms. FITCH. Of course, it is possible, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. I mean you know them both.
  Ms. FITCH. I know them both. I believe because of his past per-
formance, because of the way he has treated me, I have been at
meetings with him in his office with the door both closed and open.
When I do come back from my sojourns in libraries, we did talk
about my reports. I believe him to be telling the truth. There has
never been anything in his character, or in his interaction with me
or anyone else that I saw him interacting with, that would suggest
even the remotest possibility that this could be true.

  Senator LEAHY. And, Ms. Holt, you have known Professor Hill,
would you say she worked hard to get where she was?

  Ms. HOLT. I would say she worked hard, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Did you ever see her do something that would
jeopardize her career during the time that you knew her?
  Ms. HOLT. Not to jeopardize her career, no.
  Senator LEAHY. Did she ever lie to you that you know of?
  Ms. HOLT. Not that I know of.
  Senator LEAHY. What does she gain by doing this?
  Ms. HOLT. I have no idea. I think she would be the only person
that could answer that question for you.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, you have not worked for Judge Thomas for
some time. When did you stop working for him?
  Ms. HOLT. September 1987.
  Senator LEAHY. Of 1987?

   Ms. HOLT. Yes.

   Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Now, he was nominated in the first part of July, the 4th of July
weekend, I believe it was, and after he was nominated when was
the first time that anyone showed you phone logs or any portion
thereof or talked to you about phone logs?
  Ms. HOLT. After he was nominated?
   Senator LEAHY. He was nominated in July and there have been
discussions of phone logs that you kept. When was the first time
that somebody came to you and said, hey, by the way, I want to
talk to you about these phone logs?
   Ms. HOLT. It was last week.
   Senator LEAHY. Last week, that was the first time?
  Ms. HOLT. Right.
   Senator LEAHY. And who first showed the phone logs to you?
   Ms. HOLT. I don't know who first showed them to me. I was
shown the phone logs by a person from the Justice Department and
I was also shown the phone logs by the Vice Chairman at the
EEOC.
   Senator LEAHY. And who is that, please?
   Ms. HOLT. Ricky Silberman.
   Senator LEAHY. DO you know where the Vice Chairman obtained
the pages she showed you or how she determined they were perti-
nent?
   Ms. HOLT. I have no idea.
   Senator LEAHY. NOW, you said in your staff interview that the
Vice Chairman asked you if a caller were returning a Clarence
Thomas call you would have entered returned your call.
   Now, callers did not always indicate whether they were returning
his call or not, did they?
   Ms. HOLT. Usually they did, sir.
   Senator LEAHY. But not always.
   Ms. HOLT. I can't think of an instance when one didn't.
                                                 8

  Senator LEAHY. Did you ever use a tear-out pad or a phone mes-
sage book with individual message sheets and carbons?

  Ms. HOLT. I never did.
  Senator LEAHY. When Vice Chairman Silberman brought you
pages from the log, were any particular messages asterisked, did
they have some asterisks on them?
  Ms. HOLT. Asterisked? No.
  Senator LEAHY. None?
  Ms. HOLT. YOU said an asterisk?
  Senator LEAHY. Yes. Or a special mark?
  Ms. HOLT. There were messages with check marks and with X's.
  Senator LEAHY. Were those check marks that you had made?

   Ms. HOLT. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. Were there any marks on the pages that they
brought back to you that you do not recall having made?

  Ms. HOLT. NO, there is a phone call, a message that I did not
take.

  Senator LEAHY. I notice my time is up. Mr. Chairman I--I know
you are going to keep all questioners to tight time limits, I will
wait until the next go-around.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  What I suggest now is Senator Thurmond will assign somebody
to question you for 15 minutes.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I have asked Senator Hatch
to question this panel.
  Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, Senator Thurmond.
  Welcome to these proceedings. I am just going to ask a series of
questions I would like to get out of the way first. All four of you
have worked very closely with Clarence Thomas, is that right?
  We will start with you, Ms. Alvarez, and just go across the table.

   Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes, sir.
   Ms. FITCH. Yes, sir.
   Ms. HOLT. Yes, sir.

  Ms. BERRY. That's correct.
  Senator HATCH. Bring your mikes a little bit closer so that every-
body can hear you. Tell me the number of years each of you have
worked closely with Chairman Thomas, Ms. Alvarez?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I worked closely with him for 4 years and have
known him for 13 years.
  Senator HATCH. Four years and have known him, yes, that's
good, give both.
  Ms. FITCH. I worked for him for 7 years and have known him in
the subsequent 2 years, 9 years.
  Senator HATCH. SO, 9 years.
  Ms. HOLT. I was his personal secretary for a total of 6 years, but
I have known him for 10.
  Senator HATCH. OK, Ms. Berry.
  Ms. BERRY. I have known him since 1979 but I worked most
closely with him at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion and that was about 5 years.
  Senator HATCH. Have any of you ever seen anything or seen him
do anything or have heard him accused of doing anything like what
Professor Hill has articulated here, before this committee, Ms. Al-
varez?
Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir.
Ms. FITCH. NO, sir.
Ms. HOLT. NO, sir.
Ms. BERRY. NO, sir.

                                        O
