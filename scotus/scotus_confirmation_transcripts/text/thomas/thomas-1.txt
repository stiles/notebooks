NOMINATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                      TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1991

                                                                        U.S. SENATE,
                                                  COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                               Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice at 10:05 a.m., in room
325, Senate Caucus Room, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon.
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chairman of the committee) presiding.
  Present: Senators Biden, Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini,
Leahy, Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley,
Specter, and Brown.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., A
           U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Good morning, Judge.
  Judge THOMAS. Good morning, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome. Welcome to the blinding lights. It is a
pleasure to have you here.
  Let me begin also by indicating that the morning is going to be
painless, Judge--or maybe the most painful part of the whole proc-
ess because you are going to hear from all of the committee who
have an opening statement, and then a half a dozen Senators who
are going to introduce you. So you will hear from about 20 Sena-
tors before you get to speak. It could be the most painful part of
the process.
  But let me begin today, Judge, on a slightly more serious note.
This committee begins its sixth set of Supreme Court confirmation
hearings held in the last 5 years, a rate of change that is un-
equaled in recent times. If you are confirmed, Judge Thomas, you
will come to the Supreme Court in the midst of this vast change.
  In 4 years, Justices Powell, Brennan, and Marshall will have
been replaced by Justices Kennedy, Souter, and Thomas. Because
of these changes, many of the most basic principles of constitution-
al interpretation of the meaning that the Supreme Court applies to
the words of the Constitution are being debated in this country, in
a way they haven't for a long time, in a manner unlike anything
seen since the New Deal.
  In this time of change, fundamental constitutional rights which
have been protected by the Supreme Court for decades are being
called into question. In this time of change, the Supreme Court's

                                                          (l)
self-restraint from interference in fundamental social decisions
about the regulation of health care, the environment, and the econ-
omy are also being called into question.

  Judge Thomas, you come before this committee in this time of
change with a philosophy different from that which we have seen
in any Supreme Court nominee in the 19 years since I have been in
the Senate. For as has been widely discussed and debated in the
press, you are an adherent to the view that natural law philosophy
should inform the Constitution. Finding out what you mean when
you say that you would apply the natural law philosophy to the
Constitution is, in my view, the single most important task of this
committee and, in my view, your most significant obligation to this
committee. This is particularly true because of the period of vast
change in which your nomination comes before us.

  Judge, to explain why this is such an important question, at least
to me, we need only look at the three types of natural law thinking
which have, in fact, been adopted by the Supreme Court of the
United States in the past and which are being discussed and debat-
ed by constitutional scholars today.

  The first of these views: Seize natural law as a moral code, a set
of rules saying what is right and what is wrong, a set of rules and
a moral code which the Supreme Court should impose upon the
country. In this view, personal freedom to make moral choices
about how we live our own lives should be replaced by a morality
imposed on the conduct of our private and family lives by the
Court.

  The Supreme Court, as you know, Judge, actually took such an
approach in the past, holding in 1873, for example, that women
could not become lawyers because it was not, in the Court's phrase,
"in their nature."

  Now, no one wants to go back to 1873; no one wants to go back
that far today. But there are natural law advocates who extol the
20th century version of this philosophy, for they believe that it is
the job of the courts to judge the morality of all our activities,
wherever they occur, paying no respect to the privacy of our homes
and our bedrooms. They believe the Court should forbid any activi-
ty contrary to their view of morality and their view of natural law.

  Those who subscribe to this moral-code view of natural law call
into question a wide range of personal and family rights, from re-
productive freedom to each individual's choice over procreation, to
the very private decision we now make about what is and what is
not a family. They want to see the Government make these choices
for us by applying, to quote one report, "their values and norms";
or, if the legislature doesn't do it, by judges applying their values
and norms.

  Needless to say, Judge Thomas, this sort of natural law philoso-
phy is one which I believe this Nation cannot accept. But it is not
the only radical natural law philosophy that is being debated as we
sit here today--it is being debated in the law schools and among
the philosophers of this country--for there is another group that
wants to reinvigorate another period of the Supreme Court's past.

  When the Court used natural law to strike down a whole series
of Government actions aimed at making the Nation a better place
for Americans to live, those natural law rulings struck down such
laws as the child labor laws, minimum wage laws, and laws that
required safe working conditions. They held that the natural law of
freedom of contract and the natural law right to property created
rights for businesses and corporations that rose above the efforts of
Government to prevent the ills they created. They put these so-
called economic rights into a zone of protection so high that even
reasonable laws aimed at curbing corporate excesses were struck
down.

  Now, again, no one is proposing to take us all the way back to
the so-called Lockner era. But there are those who wish to employ
the same reasoning that was used in that era. Today, natural law
proponents of what they term new economic rights and new prop-
erty rights have called into question many of the most important
laws enacted in this century: Laws protecting the environment, our
water and our air; laws regulating child care and senior citizen fa-
cilities; and even called into question the constitutionality of the
Social Security system.

  Now, Judge Thomas, you have made it abundantly clear that you
do not subscribe to the most extreme of these views. But you have
said that you find some of these views, to quote you, "attractive,"
and that you support the idea "of an activist Supreme Court that
would strike down laws regulating economic rights."

  Again, this is a vision of natural law that we have moved far
beyond and that most Americans have no desire to return to.

  And there is a third type of natural law, Judge. It is the one that
mirrors how the Supreme Court has understood our Constitution
for the bulk of this century, and it is the one that I believe most
Americans subscribe to. It is this view of natural law that I be-
lieve--I personally, to be up front about it, think is appropriate. In
this view of natural law, the Constitution should protect personal
rights falling within the zone of privacy, speech, and religion most
zealously. Those rights that fall within that zone should be most
zealously protected. These personal freedoms should not be restrict-
ed by a moral code imposed on us by the Supreme Court or by
unjust laws passed in legislative bodies.

  Indeed, the Supreme Court has protected these freedoms by
striking down laws that would prohibit married couples from using
contraception, deny the right of people to marry whomever they
wish, or laws that tell parents that they could not teach their chil-
dren a second language or could not send them to a private school.
They struck down those legislative initiatives in the past.

  While recognizing that natural law and our Constitution protect
these rights, the same Court has also recognized that Government
must act to protect us from many of the dangers of modern life,
that Government should stop polluters from polluting, stop busi-
nesses from creating unsafe working conditions and so on.

  Yes, these Government actions do limit freedom. They do limit
freedom. They limit the freedom to contract. They limit the free-
dom to use one's property exactly as they would wish. They limit
the freedom to pollute. They limit freedom. Or, as we saw in North
Carolina recently, they limit the freedom of a factory manager to
lock his employees into a building where 25 of them perished in a
fire.
   But this limitation on property, recognized as constitutional by
the Court, is a balanced liberty that we have come to expect our
Government to provide. This is the balance, in my view, that the
Framers of our Constitution enshrined in that great document.
They wanted, to use their words, "an energetic Government." But
they also wanted a Government to protect fundamental personal
freedom, and today we have achieved that balance by having the
Supreme Court extend great protection to personal freedom while
declining to block laws that reasonably regulate our economy, our
society, our property.

   Now, adopting a natural law philosophy that upsets that balance,
either by lessening the protection given those rights falling within
the zone of personal and family privacy and speech and religion or
adopting a natural philosophy that lessens the power of Govern-
ment to protect the environment, lessens the power of Government
to regulate corporate excesses, or lessens the power of Government
to create institutions like Social Security, would, in my view, be a
serious mistake and a sharp departure from where we have been
for the last 40 years.

  Judge Thomas, there are signs in your writing and speeches that
you accept the present balance, but there are also signs that you
would apply natural law to effect changes in the balance I have
just referred to; changes to replace our freedom to make personal
and family choices without Government imposing their moral code,
and to thrust the Court into economic and regulatory disputes that
it now stays out of.

  Judge, if this committee is to endorse your confirmation to the
Senate, we must know--in my view, we must know with certainty
that neither of these radical constitutional departures is what you
have in mind when you talk about natural law. So, Judge, over the
course of these hearings, I will be asking you about how your natu-
ral law philosophy applies to each of these areas, both to the areas
of personal freedom and to the areas of economic issues. We will
take some time to cover it, Judge, and some of it, as you know as
well or better than I, is somewhat esoteric. But cover it we will,
and we will cover it carefully.

   In closing, Judge Thomas, I want to return to where I started:
the importance of your nomination. Some people say that the Su-
preme Court is already conservative, and they ask what difference
it makes to have an additional conservative on the bench. Well, I
think that is the wrong question. I reject that argument.

   First of all, I do not deny the President the right to appoint a
conservative. As a matter of fact, I would be dumfounded if he
didn't. And so I fully expect the Supreme Court to be a more con-
servative body after Justice Marshall's successor is confirmed than
before Justice Marshall retired. But such an additional move to the
right, which I expect, pales in comparison to the radical change in
direction some are urging on the Court under the banner of natu-
ral law; pales in comparison to some of the changes that some of
the people who are your strongest supporters have been urging on
the philosophic thought and the notion of constitutional interpreta-
tion for the past decade.

   Thus, we are not seeking here to learn--at least I am not seeking
here to learn whether or not you are a conservative. I expect no
less, and I believe you when you say you are. Instead, what we
must find out is what sort of natural law philosophy you would
employ as a Justice of the Supreme Court, for that Court is in tran-
sition and if you are confirmed, you will play a large role in deter-
mining what direction it will take in the future.

  Judge, because of your youth and, God bless you for it--I never
thought I would be sitting here talking about the youth of a nomi-
nee to the Supreme Court, but I am. Heck, you are 6, 7 years
younger than 1.1 am 48. How old are you, Judge? Forty-two? Forty-
three?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I have aged over the last 10 weeks. [Laugh-
ter.]

  But I am 43.
  The CHAIRMAN. Forty-three years old. Because of your youth,
Judge, you will be the first Supreme Court Justice the Senate will
ever have confirmed, if it does, that will most likely write more of
his opinions in the 21st century than he will write in the 20th cen-
tury. To acknowledge that fact alone, Judge, is to recognize the
unique significance of your nomination and the care with which
this committee must look at it.
  In closing, Judge Thomas, let me say that this committee's obli-
gation is to be open and to be fair, and I hope you believe we have
been that way thus far. We have many serious questions to ask
you, Judge, and it will take time to get them all answered. So any-
time you need a break, anytime you just get tired sitting there, let
us know because we are testing the content of your mind, not your
physical constitution to be able to sit there for a long time.
  In welcoming you to these hearings, Judge, I welcome you also to
a dialog, I believe, that will have historic impact on the Supreme
Court, the country, and a historic impact for all Americans. We are
pleased to have you join us here today, Judge, in what I consider to
be a great endeavor and the most serious obligation this committee
can undertake.
  Again, welcome, and I will now yield to my senior colleague from
the State of South Carolina and the ranking member, Senator
Thurmond.
  [The prepared statement of Senator Biden follows:]
                              OPENING STATEMENT
                       SENATOR JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.
               CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
                    HEARING ON THE CONFIRMATION OF

                           CLARENCE THOMAS TO BE
       AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

                               SEPTEMBER 10, 1991
TODAY THIS COMMITTEE BEGINS ITS SIXTH SET OF SUPREME
COURT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS HELD IN THE PAST FIVE
YEARS, A RATE OF CHANGE AT THE SUPREME COURT
UNEQUALLED IN RECENT TIMES.

IF YOU ARE CONFIRMED, JUDGE THOMAS YOU WILL COME TO A
SUPREME COURT IN THE MIDST OF THIS VAST CHANGE.
IN FOUR YEARS, JUSTICES POWELL, BRENNAN AND MARSHALL
WILL HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY JUSTICES KENNEDY, SOUTER
AND THOMAS.

BECAUSE OF THESE CHANGES, MANY OF THE MOST BASIC
PRINCIPLES OF CONSTITUTION INTERPRETATION-
OF THE MEANING THAT THE SUPREME COURT GIVES TO OUR
CONSTITUTION--
Openina Statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing

ARE BEING DEBATED IN THIS COUNTRY IN A
MANNER UNLIKE ANYTHING WE HAVE SEEN
SINCE THE NEW-DEAL ERA.

IN THIS TIME OF CHANGE, FUNDAMENTAL
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WHICH HAVE BEEN
PROTECTED BY THE SUPREME COURT FOR
DECADES ARE BEING CALLED INTO QUESTION.

IN THIS TIME OF CHANGE, THE SUPREME
COURT'S SELF-RESTRAINT FROM INTERFERENCE
IN FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL DECISIONS ABOUT
REGULATION OF OUR HEALTH CARE,
ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY IS ALSO BEING
CALLED INTO QUESTION.

JUDGE THOMAS, YOU COME BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE, IN THIS TIME OF CHANGE, WITH A
PHILOSOPHY DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH WE
HAVE SEEN IN ANY SUPREME COURT NOMINEE
DURING MY 19 YEARS IN THE SENATE,
Opening Statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing

FOR, AS HAS BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED AND
DEBATED, YOU ARE AN ADHERENT OF THE VIEW
THAT "NATURAL-LAW" PHILOSOPHY SHOULD
INFORM THE CONSTITUTION.

FINDING OUT WHAT YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY
YOU WOULD APPLY A "NATURAL-LAW"
PHILOSOPHY TO THE CONSTITUTION IS, IN MY
VIEW, THE MOST IMPORTANT TASK OF THESE
HEARINGS.

THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE BECAUSE OF THE
PERIOD OF VAST CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE IN
WHICH YOUR NOMINATION COMES BEFORE US.

TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT
QUESTION, WE NEED ONLY LOOK AT THREE
TYPES OF NATURAL-LAW THINKING WHICH HAVE
IN FACT BEEN ADOPTED BY THE SUPREME
COURT IN THE PAST -

AND WHICH ARE BEING DISCUSSED BY
CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS TODAY.
Ooenlna statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing

THE FIRST OF THESE VIEWS SEES NATURAL LAW
AS A "MORAL CODE" - A SET OF RULES SAYING
WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG - WHICH
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD IMPOSE UPON
THE COUNTRY.

IN THIS VIEW, PERSONAL FREEDOM TO MAKE
MORAL CHOICES ABOUT HOW WE LIVE OUR OWN
LIVES SHOULD BE REPLACED BY A MORALITY
IMPOSED ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR PRIVATE
AND FAMILY UVES BY THE COURT.

THE SUPREME COURT ACTUALLY TOOK THIS
APPROACH IN THE PAST, HOLDING IN 1873, FOR
EXAMPLE, THAT WOMEN COULD NOT BECOME
LAWYERS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT, AS THE COURT
PUT IT, "IN THEIR NATURE."

NOW, NO ONE WANTS TO GO BACK THAI FAR
TODAY, BUT THERE ARE NATURAL-LAW
ADVOCATES WHO EXTOL A 20TH-CENTURY
VERSION OF THIS PHILOSOPHY,
                                   10

Ooenlna Statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing

FOR THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE JOB OF THE
COURTS TO JUDGE THE MORALITY OF ALL OF
OUR ACTIVITIES, WHEREVER THEY OCCUR -
PAYING NO RESPECT TO THE PRIVACY OF OUR
HOMES AND BEDROOMS.

THEY BEUEVE THAT COURTS SHOULD FORBID
ANY ACTIVITIES CONTRARY TO THEIR VIEW OF
MORALITY OR NATURAL LAW.

THOSE WHO SUBSCRIBE TO THIS "MORAL-CODE"
VIEW OF NATURAL LAW CALL INTO QUESTION A
WIDE RANGE OF OUR PERSONAL AND FAMILY
RIGHTS -

FROM REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, TO EACH
INDIVIDUAL'S CHOICE OVER PROCREATION, TO
THE VERY PRIVATE DECISION WE NOW MAKE
ABOUT IS OR IS NOT A FAMILY.

THEY WANT TO SEE THE GOVERNMENT MAKE
THESE CHOICES £QB US, BY APPLYING THEIR
"VALUES AND NORMS" - OR BY JUDGES
APPLYING NATURAL LAW.
                                11

Opening Statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing

NEEDLESS TO SAY, JUDGE THOMAS, THIS SORT
OF NATURAL-LAW PHILOSOPHY IS ONE THE
NATION CAN NOT ACCEPT.

BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY RADICAL NATURAL-LAW
PHILOSOPHY THAT IS BEING DEBATED BY
SCHOLARS,

FOR THERE IS ANOTHER GROUP THAT WANTS TO
RE-INVIGORATE ANOTHER PERIOD IN THE
SUPREME COURTS PAST,

WHEN THAT COURT USED NATURAL LAW TO
STRIKE DOWN A WHOLE SERIES OF
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS AIMED AT MAKING THIS
NATION A BETTER PLACE FOR ALL AMERICANS.

THOSE NATURAL-LAW RUUNGS STRUCK DOWN
CHILD LABOR LAWS, MINIMUM WAGE LAWS, AND
LAWS THAT REQUIRED SAFE WORKING
CONDITIONS.
                                   12

Opening Statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing

THEY HELD THAT THE NATURAL-LAW "FREEDOM
OF CONTRACT1 AND "RIGHT TO PROPERTY"
CREATED RIGHTS FOR BUSINESSES AND
CORPORATIONS THAT ROSE ABOVE OUR
EFFORTS TO PREVENT SUCH ILLS.

THAT PUT THESE SO-CALLED "ECONOMIC RIGHTS"
INTO A ZONE OF PROTECTION SO HIGH THAT EVEN
REASONABLE LAWS AIMED A CURBING CORPORATE
EXCESSES WERE STRUCK DOWN.

NOW, AGAIN, NO ONE IS PROPOSING TO TAKE
US ALL THE WAY BACK TO THAT ERA,

BUT THERE ARE THOSE WHO WISH TO EMPLOY
THE SAME REASONING THAT WAS USED IN THAT
ERA.

TODAY'S NATURAL-LAW PROPONENTS OF WHAT
THEY TERM "NEW ECONOMIC RIGHTS" AND "NEW
PROPERTY RIGHTS" HAVE CALLED INTO
QUESTION MANY OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
LAWS ENACTED IN THIS CENTURY:
                                    13

ODenina Statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing 8

* PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, OUR
       AIR AND WATER;

* REGULATION OF CHILD-CARE AND SENIOR-
       CITIZEN FACILITIES;

* EVEN THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SOCIAL
       SECURITY.

NOW, JUDGE THOMAS, YOU HAVE MADE IT
CLEAR THAT YOU DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO THE
MOST EXTREME OF THESE VIEWS,

BUT YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU FIND SOME OF
THESE VIEWS "ATTRACTIVE11 AND THAT YOU
SUPPORT THE IDEA OF AN "ACTIVIST SUPREME
COURT THAT WOULD STRIKE DOWN LAWS
REGULATING ECONOMIC RIGHTS."

AND AGAIN, THIS IS A VISION OF NATURAL LAW
THAT WE HAVE MOVED BEYOND AND THAT MOST
AMERICANS HAVE NO DESIRE TO RETURN TO.
                                    14

Opening Statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing

THERE IS A THIRD TYPE OF NATURAL LAW - IT IS
THE ONE THAT MIRRORS HOW THE SUPREME
COURT HAS UNDERSTOOD OUR CONSTITUTION
FOR THE BULK OF THIS CENTURY, AND IT IS THE
ONE THAT I SUBSCRIBE TO.

IN THIS VIEW OF NATURAL LAW, THE
CONSTITUTION SHOULD PROTECT PERSONAL
RIGHTS FALLING WITHIN THE ZONE OF PRIVACY,
SPEECH AND REUGION MOST ZEALOUSLY.

THESE PERSONAL FREEDOMS SHOULD NOT BE
RESTRICTED BY A MORAL CODE IMPOSED ON US
BY THE SUPREME COURT, OR BY UNJUST LAWS
PASSED BY LEGISLATURES.

INDEED, THE SUPREME COURT HAS PROTECTED
THESE FREEDOMS BY STRIKING DOWN LAWS
THAT WOULD:

* PROHIBIT MARRIED COUPLES FROM USING
       CONTRACEPTION;

* DENY THE RIGHT OF PEOPLE TO MARRY
       WHOMEVER THEY WISH;
                                    15

Openlna Statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing 10

* TELL PARENTS THEY CAN NOT TEACH THEIR
       CHILDREN A SECOND LANGUAGE OR SEND
       THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS.

BUT WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT NATURAL LAW
AND OUR CONSTITUTION PROTECT THESE
RIGHTS, THE COURT HAS ALSO RECOGNIZED
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST ACT TO PROTECT US
FROM MANY DANGERS OF MODERN LIFE -

THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STOP POLLUTERS
FROM POLLUTING, STOP BUSINESSES FROM
CREATING UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS, AND
SOON.

YES, THESE GOVERNMENT ACTIONS DO UMIT
FREEDOMS - THE "FREEDOM TO POLLUTE;"

OR AS WE SAW IN NORTH CAROUNA RECENTLY,
THE "FREEDOM" OF A FACTORY OWNER TO LOCK
HIS EMPLOYEES INTO HIS BUILDING, WHERE 25
OF THEM PERISHED IN A FIRE.

BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF BALANCED LIBERTY
WE EXPECT OUR GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE.
                                   16

Opening Statement: Clarence Thomas Hearing 11

THIS IS THE BALANCE THAT THE FRAMERS OF
OUR CONSTITUTION ENSHRINED IN THAT GREAT
DOCUMENT.

THEY WANTED, TO USE THEIR WORDS, AN
"ENERGETIC GOVERNMENT1 - BUT THEY ALSO
WANTED THAT GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT
FUNDAMENTAL PERSONAL FREEDOMS.

TODAY, WE HAVE ACHIEVED THAT BALANCE BY

IF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO ENDORSE YOUR

BOTH TO OUR PERSONAL FREEDOMS AND TO

IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO COVER IT ALL, BUT
IT IS IMPORTANT AND WE WILL COVER IT
CAREFULLY.

ODenlna Statement; Clarence Thomas Hearing 14

SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE SUPREME COURT
IS ALREADY "CONSERVATIVE," AND THEY ASK
WHAT DIFFERENCE THE ADDITION OF ONE MORE
CONSERVATIVE CAN MAKE TO THE COURT.

I REJECT THIS ARGUMENT.

FIRST, I DO NOT DENY THE RIGHT OF THE
PRESIDENT TO NOMINATE A CONSERVATIVE - I
FULLY EXPECT HIM TO DO SO.

AND SO I FULLY EXPECT THE SUPREME COURT
TO BE A MORE CONSERVATIVE BODY AFTER
JUSTICE MARSHALL'S SUCCESSOR IS
CONFIRMED THAN IT WAS BEFORE HE
RESIGNED.

BUT SUCH AN ADDITIONAL MOVE TO THE RIGHT,
WHICH I EXPECT, PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE
RADICAL CHANGE IN DIRECTION THAT SOME
ARE URGING ON THE COURT UNDER THE
BANNER OF NATURAL LAW.

THUS, WE ARE NOT SEEKING HERE TO LEARN IF
YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE -- WE EXPECT NO
LESS.

INSTEAD, WHAT WE MUST FIND OUT IS WHAT
SORT OF NATURAL-LAW PHILOSOPHY YOU
WOULD EMPLOY AS A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
COURT,.

FOR THAT COURT IS IN TRANSITION AND IF YOU
ARE CONFIRMED, YOU WILL PLAY A LARGE ROLE
IN DETERMINING WHAT DIRECTION IT WILL TAKE
IN THE FUTURE.

BECAUSE OF YOUR YOUTH, JUDGE THOMAS, YOU
WOULD BE THE FIRST SUPREME COURT JUSTICE
APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE WHO WILL
PROBABLY DECIDE MORE CASES IN THE 21ST
CENTURY THAN YOU WILL IN THE 20TH CENTURY.

TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FACT ALONE IS TO
RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE SIGNIFICANCE OF YOUR

     OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STROM THURMOND, A U.S.
          SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Today, the committee begins hearings to consider the nomination
of Judge Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States.
  This makes the 7th nominee to the Supreme Court that this com-
mittee has considered in the past 10 years and, once confirmed,
will be the 106th person to serve as a Justice, as well, I might say,
as the 24th Supreme Court nomination that I have had the oppor-
tunity to review during almost my 37 years in the Senate.

  As these hearings begin, we must remain keenly aware that we
face a solemn responsibility. This committee undertakes no greater
responsibility than the review of nominees to the Federal judiciary.

  When a nominee is considered for the Supreme Court, our re-
sponsibility is an enhanced one. Those chosen for a seat on our Na-
tion's highest court occupy a position of great authority, trust, and
power, as this appointment is one of life tenure, without account-
ability by popular election.

  Members of the Supreme Court make vitally important decisions
and can only be removed in very limited circumstances. A Supreme
Court Justice must be an individual who understands the responsi-
bility to the people of this Nation, the concept of justice, and the
magnificence of our Constitution.

  Mr. Chairman, I have always believed that our Constitution is
the most enduring document ever penned by the hand of man. It
certainly remains the finest, most significant political document
ever conceived. It creates the basic institutions of our National
Government and spells out the powers of these institutions, the
rights of our citizens, and the basic freedoms we all deeply cherish.

  At an early age, I developed a deep and abiding respect for this
document which stands as the centerpiece of mankind's struggle
for self-determination. The fact that our Constitution has survived
since its adoption in 1787 is a true testament to its remarkability.

  When a vacancy occurs on the Supreme Court, it is one of the
few times that all three branches of Government are so greatly im-
pacted at the same time. The head of the executive branch, the
President of the United States, elected by the people, chooses a
nominee. This nominee will sit on the highest, most prestigious,
and most powerful Court within our judicial branch. The Senate, as
part of the legislative branch, is called upon to review the nominee
to ensure that he or she is qualified to serve on the most important
court in America.

  I believe this process which embraces all three branches of Gov-
ernment signifies the majesty of our system and underscores the
brilliance of our Founding Fathers. Clearly our magnificent Consti-
tution confers tremendous responsibility on the Senate in a vast
number of areas. In the confirmation process, the Senate alone
holds exclusive authority to advise and consent on all judicial
nominations. While the President of the United States has the con-
stitutional authority to appoint judges of the Supreme Court, the
advise and consent role of the Senate is one of the most important
ones we undertake.
                                              23

  The Senate has assigned the task of holding hearings and the de-
tailed review of judicial nominees to the Judiciary Committee. It is
a task that this committee has undertaken with a clear awareness
of the importance of our role in the confirmation process. The sig-
nificance of this committee's role cannot be underestimated. In this
century, no nominee to the Supreme Court has been confirmed by
the full Senate after failing to attain a majority vote of the mem-
bers of this committee.

  Mr. Chairman, the role of the Supreme Court in our history has
been vital because the Court has been called upon to solve many
difficult and controversial problems, using its collective intellectual
capacity, precedent, and constitutional interpretation to solve
them. Throughout the course of our Nation's history, the Court has
been called on to administer justice. As George Washington said,
and I quote, "The administration of justice is the firmest pillar of
good government." There is every reason to expect that the Court's
role in the administration of justice will continue to be a major
factor in the future.

  For this reason, an individual chosen to serve on the Supreme
Court must be one who possesses outstanding qualities. The impact
of the decisions of the Court requires that a nominee is eminently
qualified to serve.

  During my consideration of the previous 23 nominees to the high
Court in my almost 37 years, I have often reflected on the at-
tributes I believe a Supreme Court Justice should possess. As we
again consider a nominee to the Supreme Court, I believe these
special qualities warrant reiterating:

  First, unquestioned integrity. A nominee must be honest, abso-
lutely incorruptible, and completely fair.

  Second, courage. The courage to decide tough cases according to
the law and the Constitution.

  Third, compassion. While the nominee must be firm in his deci-
sions, he should show mercy when appropriate.

  Fourth, professional competence. The ability to master the com-
plexity of the law.

  Fifth, proper judicial temperament. The self-discipline to base de-
cision on logic, not emotion, and to have respect for lawyers, liti-
gants, and court personnel.

  And, sixth, an understanding of the majesty of our system of gov-
ernment. The understanding that only Congress makes the law,
that the Constitution is only changed by amendment, and that all
powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to
the States.

  I believe an individual who possesses these qualities will not fail
the cause of justice. As we begin these hearings, there is every indi-
cation that Judge Thomas possesses the necessary attributes to be
an outstanding member of the Supreme Court.

  Mr. Chairman, upon reviewing the decisions Judge Thomas
wrote and in which he participated on the Court of Appeals, I have
concluded that Judge Thomas has exhibited an adherence to the
rule of law and the true principles upon which our Nation was
founded. Without question, the decisions he has written are within
the mainstream of judicial thinking. He has articulated a clear and
                                              24

concise understanding of the law and conformance to established
principles of constitutional interpretation.

  Some have stated that Judge Thomas has articulated a personal
philosophy of law and constitutional interpretation which would
curtail individual rights. I strongly disagree with those who have
reached that conclusion. In fact, Judge Thomas has stated that he
believes, and I quote, "that equality is the basis for aggressive en-
forcement of civil rights laws and equal opportunity laws designed
to protect individual rights."

  Those are words stated by a person who truly believes in the
civil rights of the individual and a commitment to the principles of
fairness and equality, not a nominee who is out of the mainstream
of judicial interpretation and analysis.

  An examination of the professional record of Judge Thomas pro-
vides no valid reason to believe he would seek to diminish the
rights of any American citizen. Judge Thomas acknowledges that
he has been a beneficiary of the diligent work of individuals such
as Justice Thurgood Marshall and others involved in civil rights ef-
forts.

  Mr. Chairman, the issue of judicial philosophy or ideology has
often been raised in relation to recent nominees to the Supreme
Court. Some argue that philosophy should not be considered at all
in the nomination process, while others state that philosophy
should be the sole criteria. It is not appropriate that philosophy
alone--I repeat, alone--should bar a nominee from the Supreme
Court, unless that nominee holds a belief that is contrary to the
fundamental, long-standing principles of our Nation.

  Clearly if a philosophical litmus test can be applied to defeat a
nominee, then the independence of the Federal judiciary would be
undermined. Judges are not politicians put in place to decide cases
based on the views of a political constituency, but are sworn to
apply constitutional and legal principles to arrive at decisions that
do justice to the parties before them.

  The prerogative to choose a nominee to the Supreme Court be-
longs to the President, an individual elected by the people of this
country. The full Senate has the opportunity to review that nomi-
nee who comes to this body with a presumption--and I repeat, with
a presumption--in his favor. To reject a nominee based solely on
ideology is inappropriate. Requiring a nominee to pass an ideologi-
cal litmus test would seriously jeopardize the efficacy and inde-
pendence of the Federal judiciary.

  In closing, I believe Judge Thomas is well qualified to serve as a
Justice of our Nation's highest Court. He possesses the integrity,
intellect, professional competence, and judicial temperament to
make an outstanding Justice. In addition, his personal struggle to
overcome difficult circumstances early in his life is admirable. A
review of his background shows he is a man of immense courage
who has prevailed over many obstacles to attain remarkable suc-
cess.

  Mr. Chairman, the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of our Na-
tion's most important legal disputes. Its authority is immense. This
immense authority places a great responsibility on each of us as we
begin the thorough review of Judge Thomas to be an Associate Jus-
                                              25

tice of that Court. I look forward to a fair hearing, with swift con-
sideration of this nominee by the committee and the full Senate.

  Judge Thomas, we welcome you to the committee and look for-
ward to your testimony.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 STATEMENT BY SENATOR STROM THURMOND (R-S.C.) BEFORE THE COMMITTEE
 ON THE JUDICIARY REFERENCE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS ON CLARENCE
 THOMAS TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED
 STATES, SR-325, SENATE CAUCUS ROOM, 10:00 A.M., SEPTEMBER 10,
 1991.

 MR. CHAIRMAN:
          Today, the Committee begins hearings to consider the

 nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of
 the Supreme Court of the United States. This makes the seventh
 nominee to the Supreme Court that this Committee has considered
 in the past ten years and, once confirmed, will be the 106th
 person to serve as a justice. As well, I might say, it is the
 24th Supreme Court nomination that I have had the opportunity to
 review during my almost 37 years in the Senate.

         As these hearings begin, we must remain keenly aware that we
 face a solemn responsibility. This Committee undertakes no
greater responsibility than the review of nominees to the federal
 judiciary. When a nominee is considered for the Supreme Court,
our responsibility is an enhanced one. Those chosen for a seat

is the most enduring document ever penned by the hand of man, and

 certainly remains the finest, most significant political document
 ever conceived. It creates the basic institutions of our
 national government and spells out the powers of these
 institutions, the rights of our citizens, and the basic freedoms
 we all deeply cherish. At an early age, I developed a deep and

embraces all three branches of government signifies the majesty

         Clearly, our magnificent Constitution confers tremendous
responsibility on the Senate in a vast number of areas. In the
confirmation process, the Senate alone holds exclusive authority
to "advice and consent" on all judicial nominations. While the
President of the United States has the constitutional authority
to "appoint...judges of the Supreme Court," the "advice and

 consent role" of the Senate is one of the most important ones we
 undertake. The Senate has assigned the task of holding hearings
 and the detai.led review of judicial nominees to the Judiciary
 Committee. It is a task that this Committee has undertaken with
 the clear awareness of the importance of our role in the
 confirmation process. The significance of this Committee's role
 cannot be understated. In this century, no nominee to the
 Supreme Court has been confirmed by the full Senate after failing
 to attain a majority of the votes of members of this Committee.

         Mr. Chairman, the role of the Supreme Court in our history
has been vital because the Court has been called upon to solve
many difficult and controversial problems - using its collective
 intellectual capacity, precedent, and Constitutional
interpretation to solve them. Throughout the course of our

                                     29

 Supreme Court, I believe these special qualities warrant
 reiterating:

          First - Unquestioned integrity. A nominee must be
                        honest, absolutely incorruptible, and completely
                        fair.

          Second - Courage. The courage to decide tough cases
                          according to the law and the Constitution.

          Third - Compassion. While a nominee must be firm in
                        his decisions, he should show mercy when
                        appropriate.

          Fourth - Professional Competence. The ability to master
                          the complexity of the law.

         Fifth - Proper Judicial Temperament. The self-discipline
                        to base decisions on logic, not emotion, and to
                        have respect for lawyers, litigants, and court
                        personnel.

         Sixth - An understanding of the majesty of our system
                       of government. The understanding that only Congress
                       makes the laws, that the Constitution is only
                       changed by amendment, and that all powers not
                       delegated to the federal government are reserved
                       to the States.

         I believe an individual who possesses these qualities will
not fail the cause of Justice.

        As we begin these hearings, there is every indication that
Judge Thomas possesses the necessary attributes to be an

                                       30

 outstanding member of the Supreme Court. He was born in
 Pinpoint, Georgia, on June 23, 1948, and raised in Savannah by
 his grandparents, Myers and Christine Anderson. In his youth,
 Judge Thomas overcame difficult economic conditions and excelled
 in his studies. He later attended the Immaculate Conception
 Seminary for two years before transferring to Holy Cross College.
 At Holy Cross, Judge Thomas distinguished himself as a member of
 the Honors Program, receiving his undergraduate degree in 1971.
 He then attended Yale Law School, one of our Nation's top law
 schools, graduating in 1974.

          In addition to his impressive academic background, Judge
 Thomas has vast practical experience. Following law school, he
worked for Senator Danforth, then the Attorney General for the
 State of Missouri. As an Assistant Attorney General for three
years, Judge Thomas represented the State of Missouri before the
trial courts, appellate courts, and the State Supreme Court on
matters ranging from taxation to criminal law. From 1977-1979,
he worked for the Monsanto Company handling corporate, antitrust,
contract, and government regulation law.

         In 1979, Judge Thomas again went to work for Senator
Danforth in Washington, this time as a legislative assistant,
responsible for energy, environment, federal lands, and public
works issues. President Reagan nominated Judge Thomas to the
position of Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights for the
Department of Education in 1981. He was confirmed by the Senate
for this position. Then, in 1982, President Reagan nominated him
to serve as Chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity

                                                     -5-
                                     31

 Commission where he ably served almost two terms, being confirmed
 by the Senate for each term. He was then nominated by President
 Bush for a position on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
 Circuit, called by many the Nation's second highest court. Since
 his confirmation, Judge Thomas has participated in over 140
 decisions, writing opinions in areas such as criminal law,
 antitrust law and trade regulation, as well as constitutional and
 administrative law. Without question, Judge Thomas has
distinguished himself on the D.C. Circuit, and has served in an
 exemplary capacity as a member of this Court.

         Mr. Chairman, upon reviewing the decisions Judge Thomas
wrote and in which he participated on the Court of Appeals, I
have concluded that Judge Thomas has exhibited an adherence to
the rule of law, and the true principles upon which our Nation
was founded. Without question, the decisions he has written are

stated by a person who truly believes in the civil rights of the
individual and a commitment to the principles of fairness and

                                      32

 equality, not a nominee who is out of the mainstream of judicial
 interpretation and analysis. An examination of the professional
 record of Judge Thomas provides no valid reason to believe he
 would seek to diminish the rights of any American citizen. Judge
 Thomas acknowledges that he has been a beneficiary of the
 diligent work of individuals such as Justice Thurgood Marshall
 and others involved in civil rights efforts.

          Mr. Chairman, the issue of judicial philosophy, or ideology,
 has often been raised in relation to recent nominees to the
 Supreme Court. Some argue that philosophy should not be
 considered at all in the nomination process, while others state
 that philosophy should be the sole criteria. It is not
 appropriate that philosophy alone should bar a nominee from the
 Supreme Court unless that nominee holds a belief that is contrary
to the fundamental, longstanding principles of our Nation.

         Clearly, if a philosophical "litmus test" can be applied to
defeat a nominee, then the independence of the Federal judiciary
would be undermined. Judges are not politicians put in place to
decide cases based on the views of a political constituency, but
are sworn to apply Constitutional and legal principles to arrive

prerogative to choose a nominee to the Supreme Court belongs to
the President -- an individual elected by the people of this
Country. The full Senate has the opportunity to review that
nominee who comes to this Body with a presumption in his favor.
To reject a nominee based solely on ideology, is inappropriate.
Requiring a nominee to pass an ideological "litmus test" would

                                                    -7-
                                        33

 seriously jeopardize the efficacy and independence of the Federal
  judiciary.

          Mr. Chairman, I want to comment briefly on the tenure of
 Judge Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
 Commission. When he was before the Judiciary Committee for a
 position on the Court of Appeals, an exhaustive evaluation of his
 role as Chairman of the EEOC was undertaken. Some of the issues
 related to the EEOC have again been raised since his nomination
 to the Supreme Court was announced. These issues were fully
 reviewed and discussed in detail when Judge Thomas was under
 consideration for a position on the D.C. Circuit. At that time,
 this Committee was informed that Judge Thomas was responsible for
 implementing policies designed to reform the EEOC, invigorating
 its mission to assure the fair treatment of all persons m the
workplace, and injuring the vigorous enforcement of our equal
 employment laws. I strongly believe that Judge Thomas performed
admirably as Chairman of the EEOC. His successor, Mr. Evan Kemp,
stated that the EEOC "made a miraculous turnaround... under
 [Judge] Thomas." while Judge Thomas was Chairman, the Washington
Post ran an editorial piece entitled "The EEOC is Thriving" and
praised him for his "quiet but persistent leadership." I commend
Judge Thomas for his diligent, successful efforts while Chairman
of the EEOC.

         In closing, I believe Judge Thomas is well qualified to
serve as a justice on our Nation's highest court. He possesses
the integrity, intellect, professional competence, and judicial
temperament to make an outstanding justice. In addition, his

                                                    -8-
                                      34

personal struggle to overcome difficult circumstances early in
his life is admirable. A review of his background shows he is a
man of immense courage who has prevailed over many obstacles to
attain remarkable success.

         Mr. Chairman, the Supreme Court is the final arbiter of our
Nation's most important legal disputes; its authority is immense.
This immense authority places a great responsibility on each of
us as we begin the thorough review of Judge Thomas to be an
Associate Justice of that Court.

         I look forward to a fair hearing with swift consideration of
this nominee by the Committee and the full Senate.

        Judge Thomas, we welcome you to the Committee and look
forward to your testimony.

        Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD M. KENNEDY, A U.S.
           SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning,
Judge.

  I would just mention at the outset we come to the nomination on
the basis that the President makes the nomination but it is a
shared responsibility, an important responsibility for us to make a
judgment on this. I might have some difference with my good
friend and colleague from South Carolina on whether there is the
presumption. I think any fair reading of the Constitutional Conven-
tion would show that this was to be a shared responsibility. I think
at least I and other members of the committee would look so.

  Two hundred years ago this year, the Bill of Rights became part
of the Constitution. The Constitution itself confers upon the Feder-
al Government the powers necessary to govern the country. But
the Bill of Rights protects the fundamental rights that enable us to
be truly free and to enjoy the full benefits of our democracy. Most
important, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights preserve our in-
dividual liberty, and they are the Nation's promise to the people
that no American will ever be forced to stand before a column of
tanks in any battle to keep our democracy. It is our guarantee that
majority rule is limited and that each individual has certain basic
rights that the government cannot invade.

   As we celebrate the bicentennial of the Bill of Rights, as we
watch brave citizens in the Soviet Union and other lands struggle
to attain similar rights and liberties, we feel justifiably proud of
our system of government and the enduring achievements of the
past two centuries. But we cannot permit our pride to diminish our
commitment to preserving and strengthening our own democracy
or dealing with the serious challenges that continue to confront us.

   The nomination which we begin considering today is an essential
part of the process by which we safeguard the Constitution, the Bill
of Rights, and our democracy itself. If confirmed, Judge Clarence
Thomas will become one of nine Supreme Court Justices with the
ultimate power to define the Constitution, interpret the Bill of
Rights, and ensure that the limited powers of government stay lim-
ited.

   Many of us are concerned about the direction the Supreme Court
has taken in recent years. It has increasingly abandoned its role as
the guardian of the powerless in our society. It has repeatedly
sought to turn back the clock on civil rights. It has relaxed the
rules prohibiting the use of coerced confessions obtained by law en-
forcement officers. It has begun to retreat on the right to privacy.
It has ruled that government officials can prohibit doctors in pub-
licly funded clinics from practicing their profession to the best of
their ability in giving their patients full medical advice.

   The Court has not hesitated to overrule earlier decisions with
which the new majority disagrees. Justice Thurgood Marshall
warned us in Ms final Supreme Court opinion that power, not
reason, is the new currency of the Court's decision-making. Justice
                                              36

Marshall has been one of the greatest Justices in the history of the
Supreme Court. His courageous career is an inspiration to the
Nation, and his vision of the rule of law is an example to the world
of the best in American justice.

  The person who replaces Thurgood Marshall on the Court will be
deeply involved in fundamental decisions that will affect the rights
of all Americans in the years ahead and may well determine the
very nature of our democracy and the future of the Bill of Rights.
For this reason, the Senate has a special responsibility: to assess
Judge Thomas' view of the Constitution and his dedication to indi-
vidual rights and the separation of powers. We must decide wheth-
er he possesses a clear commitment to the fundamental values at
the core of our democracy.

  In his life and in his career, Judge Thomas has overcome large
barriers of poverty and injustice, and he deserves great credit for
the eminence he has attained. In many ways, he exemplifies the
promise of the Constitution and the American ideal of equal oppor-
tunity for all.

  But much more is at stake than Judge Thomas' background.
Statements he has made and actions he has taken raise significant
issues that must be addressed if he is to be confirmed by the
Senate.

  For example, on the right to privacy, Judge Thomas has strongly
commended an article entitled "The Declaration of Independence
and the Right to Life." One leads unmistakably from the other.
That article refers to the constitutional right to abortion in Roe v.
Wade as a conjured right with not a single trace of lawful author-
ity. According to the article, which Judge Thomas has called
"splendid," abortion is the constitutional equivalent of murder.

  If this view is accepted by the Supreme Court, not only Roe v.
Wadewill be overruled, neither the Congress nor any State legisla-
ture will have the power to protect a woman's right to choose an
abortion even in cases of rape or incest. And Federal and State gov-
ernments will have an engraved invitation to invade other basic as-
pects of individuals' private lives.

  Judge Thomas' record also raises serious questions about his
view of ongoing efforts to end discrimination in our society against
women and minorities. The civil rights revolution of the past gen-
eration has been called the "Second American Revolution." But it
is a revolution that is far from complete. Millions of our fellow citi-
zens are still left out and behind because of unacceptable condi-
tions of discrimination based on race, sex, age, disability, and other
forms of bigotry that continue to plague our society.

  As Congress and the administration struggle to deal with these
urgent challenges, we will need a Supreme Court that is sensitive,
not hostile, to our efforts. At the same time, Judge Thomas has
stated that the Constitution protects economic rights as much as
any other rights. Until the 1930's, a similar doctrine was used by
the Supreme Court to strike down attempts by Congress and the
States to protect the rights and very health and safety of workers
against unfair abuses of power by unscrupulous employers and cor-
porations. Few Americans today would want the Supreme Court to
revive that discredited doctrine of constitutional protection for the
rights of business at the expense of working men and women.
                                              37

  Finally, Judge Thomas' role as Chairman of the Equal Opportu-
nity Commission has given him extensive experience in dealing
with Congress. As a result of that experience, however, he has
made some harsh statements about congressional oversight of exec-
utive agencies. Obviously, such oversight is an essential part of the
constitutional system of checks and balances. It has served the
Nation well, and it must continue to do so.

  The Senate's constitutional role in confirmation of Justices to the
Supreme Court is one of our most important functions. I look for-
ward to these hearings and to working with my colleagues on the
committee and in the Senate to address these complex issues as
thoroughly and as fairly as possible. The country deserves no less.

  Senator Hatch.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN G. HATCH, A U.S. SENATOR
                         FROM THE STATE OF UTAH

  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I begin my
statement, let me say that I hope that Justice Marshall is well, and
I wish him well. His career and service to our country throughout
his life marks him, in my view, as the single most influential
lawyer in the 20th century, and maybe one of the most influential
lawyers of all time.

  Judge Thomas, welcome to the committee. This is your fifth con-
firmation before the U.S. Senate. I don't know many people who
have had that experience or who have been able to endure that
kind of an experience.

  I just want to say that I have known you for over 10 years, and I
don't think President Bush could have made a better decision or
better judgment than to nominate you for the Supreme Court of
the United States of America. You are eminently qualified to be a
Supreme Court Justice.

  Judge Thomas has an excellent educational and legal back-
ground. He has served in all three branches of the Federal Govern-
ment, and in so serving, as I have mentioned, he has already won
Senate confirmation 4 times in less than 9 years, perhaps more
than any other person during a similar period of time.

  Judge Thomas has also served as an assistant attorney general of
the State of Missouri under our distinguished colleague, Jack Dan-
forth. He has also worked in the private sector as a lawyer in Mon-
santo Co.'s legal department.

  I share President Bush's view that a Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States should interpret the law according to
the original meaning and not legislate his or her own policy prefer-
ences from the bench. Based on a careful review of Judge Thomas'
writings and judicial opinions and my personal knowledge of the
man, I am confident that Judge Thomas will interpret the law ac-
cording to its original meaning, rather than substitute his own
policy preferences for the law.

  I am also confident that Judge Thomas will zealously safeguard
the principle of equal justice under law for all Americans; not just
white Americans, not just black Americans or Hispanic Americans
or Asian Americans, but for all Americans, without unfair prefer-
ence.

  Judge Thomas' opinions also indicate that he is a sound law-and-
order jurist, tough but fair to criminal defendants.

  Those who have known Judge Thomas over the years know that
he is a man of fierce independence. When he is confirmed, he will
be nobody's man but his own, as I know he has been throughout
his life. That I know.

  And the judge's independence in not bounded by ideology. For
example, when asked his views about establishing enterprise zones
in inner cities, a principal element of conservative urban policy,
Judge Thomas politely poured cold water on the idea. In so doing,
here is part of what he said in 1985:
                                         41

  The first priority is to control crime. The sections where the poorest people live
aren't really livable. If people can't go to school or rear their families or go to
church without being mugged, how much progress can you expect in a community?
Would you do business in a community that looks like an armed camp, where the
only people who inhabit the streets after dark are criminals? There were lots of
black businesses before enterprise zones, but blacks cannot stay in business if they
are mugged or if customers are mugged going in and out of the establishment or if
people are hanging out selling drugs in front of it. If you want to encourage busi-
ness in these areas, then stopping crime has got to be at the top of the list.

  Judge Thomas' independence, however, does not sit well with
some special interest groups and some liberal academics and pun-
dits. These critics would like to impose their liberal policy agenda
on the American people through the judiciary. They fear Judge
Thomas will be faithful to the Constitution and Federal laws as en-
acted instead of to their political agenda.

  We have heard criticism from some groups that Judge Thomas
isn't strong on civil rights. Nonsense. Judge Thomas has an excel-
lent record on civil rights and a deep personal commitment to
equal opportunity. As he wrote in 1986,

  I am a black Southerner. I grew up under the heel of segregation, and I have
always found it offensive for the Government to treat people differently from others
because of the color of their skin.

  At his confirmation hearing just last year for the judgeship he
now holds, Judge Thomas testified, "The reason I became a lawyer
was to make sure that minorities, individuals who did not have
access to this society, gained access."

  He took over the chairmanship of an Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission in 1982 that was left in a shambles by his
Carter administration predecessors. The Washington Post, no shill
for the Reagan administration civil rights record, praised "the
quiet but persistent leadership of Chairman Clarence Thomas" in
an editorial on May 17, 1987, entitled "The EEOC is Thriving." The
July 15, 1991, U.S. News and World Report wrote, "Overall, it
seems clear that he [Thomas] left the [EEOC] in better condition
than he found it." He has favored strong remedies for discrimina-
tion, including many affirmative steps, such as increased recruit-
ment and outreach to minorities and women. This is the kind of
nondiscriminatory affirmative action which we all favor.

  No, it isn't his civil rights record that these liberal critics are
really concerned about; that is just a smokescreen. These critics
really object to Judge Thomas having spoken out against what is
popularly called reverse discrimination. He has, on a number of oc-
casions, voiced his objections to preferences, to numerical devices
whether labeled quotas, goals, or set-asides. This is the kind of af-
firmative action which is discriminatory itself. Here is one way he
has put his views:

   I am proud to defend the principle that people should be judged on the basis of
what they can do, not on the basis of irrelevant personal characteristics. [Some be-
lieve] that the laws should be read to prohibit only some discrimination and to
permit, or even require, other discrimination--the prohibited and permitted types of
discrimination to be determined, apparently, by the governing elites. Since the
memory of when the governing elites favored discrimination against black people is
still so clear in my mind, I prefer not to leave to the elites the discretion to catego-
rize race discrimination into permitted and prohibited classes. All discrimination
must be prohibited.
                                              42

  Now, just as our society had finally enacted long overdue laws to
prohibit racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination, new forms of dis-
crimination were invented, ostensibly in the name of civil rights.
Innocent persons were made new victims of discrimination as a
purported means of remedying discrimination against others and
as redress for a history these new victims had not created.

  Now, we all know that discrimination and bigotry still persist in
this country. It is a shame. Indeed, a tiny portion of my mail re-
garding Judge Thomas is another unfortunate reminder that some
people in this country want to keep black people down. One satis-
factory result of Judge Thomas' confirmation to the Supreme
Court, for this Senator, will be the powerful rebuke it delivers to
these un-American bigots. But the answer to discrimination is to
end it, make whole its victims, take steps to ensure that it does not
recur, and require the guilty party to recruit more minorities and
women into its applicant pool and consider them fairly along with
the rest of the applicants. The answer is not engage in discrimina-
tion against other innocent persons. Two wrongs do not make a
civil right.

  The overwhelming majority of the American people favor equal
opportunity--not equal results; not preferences for or against
anyone because of their race, ethnicity, or gender; not reverse dis-
crimination. They are well familiar with the variety and scope of
the devices, however euphemistically labeled, used to embed prefer-
ences and reverse discrimination in employment and elsewhere.

  The advocates of preference and reverse discrimination know
that these policies are extremely unpopular with the American
people. Accordingly, supporters of these unfair policies couch their
attacks on Judge Thomas in other language. Thus, they criticize
him for his "civil rights record" or alleged lack of sensitivity, or for
being against all affirmative action rather than only the preferen-
tial, unfair aspects of affirmative action, as reflects his true posi-
tion while in the executive branch. In my view, it is really the
judge's expressed belief in the equal rights of all Americans that
some of these critics are really upset about.

  Now, I do not know how Judge Thomas will vote on specific as-
pects of affirmative action. As a Supreme Court Justice, he will be
in a new and a unique role. But because he has spoken out while in
policy-making positions against preferences and what has become
popularly known as reverse discrimination, the supporters of these
unfair policies want to punish him. I trust, however, that the
Senate will not sacrifice Judge Thomas on the twin altars of prefer-
ences and reverse discrimination.

  I will not dwell on my frequently expressed concern that the
Senate has been infringing on the independence of the judiciary
when it seeks direct or indirect commitments on specific legal
issues from judicial nominees. Issues in the courts must be resolved
in the courts. This judicial resolution should occur after parties
have presented the facts of a specific case, deployed their legal ar-
guments for the judges to consider, and the judges have done their
own research and internal consultation. Such issues are not to be
decided based on what a nominee tells a Senate committee in ad-
vance. Confirmation of a nominee should not turn on a commit-
ment to prejudge an issue.
                                             43

  I do wish to express two special concerns about this nomination
process. Some interest group advocates of particular policies want
this committee to insist that Judge Thomas answer questions and
meet certain litmus tests, such as on abortion, that Justice Souter
did not answer or meet just 1 year ago, 1 year ago this week. Last
year, we were told that Justice Souter held the key to Roe v. Wade,
yet virtually no one in the Senate made his discussion of that issue
a condition of their vote.

  Now, Judge Thomas is before us, and some would have us believe
he now holds the key to Roe v. Wade. I note that Judge Thomas
casts only one vote, not five. It is inappropriate enough that he is
expected to answer some of the questions Justice Souter did not
answer. But if Judge Thomas is held to a higher standard and even
more rigorous litmus tests than Justice Souter, I think many
Americans will be deeply troubled and will want to know why this
particular nominee is being singled out at this time.

  Moreover, we are here to determine Judge Thomas' fitness to be
a Justice of the Supreme Court, not to conduct oversight on the
EEOC or the Office for Civil Rights. We are not here to test his
memory on events and documents constructed years ago. I would
also note that after every matter in which Judge Thomas was in-
volved in the executive branch, this Senate later confirmed him to
a very responsible position at least once, and, in some cases, three
times.

  Finally, I just wish to mention my own delight at Judge Thomas'
success. That success says a great deal about our country and about
Judge Thomas, the man. Having grown up in the era of Jim Crow
and gone barefoot in the unpaved streets of his community, he will
soon be able to put his feet under the bench in the highest court in
this land, as he contemplates the finer points of the law.

  I understand this. I was born into a family where we didn't have
indoor facilities either during the early years of my life. And I un-
derstand what it is like in this great country. And I have to tell
you, Judge Thomas, I am so doggone proud of you I can hardly
stand it. I think it is a terrific thing that you are nominated to this
position, and I personally will support you with every fiber of my
being.

  As you yourself said when nominated, only in America could
such a thing happen. It is wonderful to be a citizen in this country,
and it is wonderful to see you sitting there before us this day. And
it just reconfirms what all of us already know. This is the greatest
country in the world.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

         It is a particular pleasure for me to welcome Judge Thomas
to this Committee. I have known Judge Thomas for over 10 years.
President Bush could not have made a finer nomination to the
Supreme Court. This nominee is eminently qualified to be a
Supreme Court Justice.

        Judge Thomas has an excellent educational and legal
background. Judge Thomas has served in all three branches of the
federal government. In so serving, he has already won Senate
confirmation four times in less than nine years, perhaps more
than any other person during the same period.

        Judge Thomas has also served as an Assistant Attorney
General of the State of Missouri, under our distinguished
colleague, John Danforth. He has also worked in the private
sector as a lawyer in Monsanto Company's legal department.

         I share President Bush's view that a Justice of the Supreme
Court should interpret the law according to its original meaning
and not legislate his or her own policy preferences from the
bench. Based on a careful review of his writings and judicial
opinions, and my knowledge of the man, I am confident Judge
Thomas will interpret the law according to its meaning, rather
than substitute his own policy preferences for the law.

         I am also confident that Judge Thomas will zealously
safeguard the principle of equal justice under law for all
Americans -- not just white Americans, not just black Americans
                                      45

or Hispanic Americans or Asian Americans, but for all Americans,
without unfair preference.

         Judge Thomas' opinions also indicate that he is a sound law-
and-order jurist -- tough but fair on criminal defendants.

         Those who have known Judge Thomas over the years know that
Judge Thomas is a man of fierce independence. When he is
confirmed, he will be nobody's man but his own, as he has been
throughout his life.

         The Judge's independence is not bounded by ideology. For
example, when asked his views about establishing enterprise zones
in inner cities, a principal element of conservative urban
policy, Judge Thomas politely poured cold water on the idea. In
so doing, here is part of what he said in 1985: "The first
priority is to control crime. The sections where the poorest
people live aren't really livable. If people can't go to school,
or rear their families, or go to church without being mugged, how
much progress can you expect in a community? ' Would you do
business in a community that looks like an armed camp, where the
only people who inhabit the streets after dark are criminals?
There were lots of black businesses before enterprise zones...But
blacks cannot stay in business if they are mugged, or if
customers are mugged going in and out of the establishment, or if
people are hanging out selling drugs in front of it. If you want
to encourage business in these areas, then stopping crime has got
to be at the top of the list."

         Judge Thomas' independence, however, does not sit well with
                                      46

some special interest groups and some liberal academics and
pundits. These critics would like to impose their liberal policy
agenda on the American people through the judiciary. They fear
Judge Thomas will be faithful to the Constitution and federal
laws as enacted, instead of to their political agenda.

         We have heard criticism from some groups that Judge Thomas
isn't strong on civil rights. Nonsense. Judge Thomas has an
excellent record on civil rights and a deep personal commitment
to equal opportunity. As he wrote in 1986, "I am a black
Southerner, I grew up under the heel of segregation and I have
always found it offensive for the government to treat people
differently from others because of the color of our skin." At his
confirmation hearing just last year for the judgeship he now
holds, Judge Thomas testified: "...the reason I became a lawyer
was to make sure that minorities, individuals who did not have
access to this society, gained access..."

         He took over the chairmanship of an Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission in 1982 that had been left in a shambles
by his Carter Administration predecessors. The Washington Post,
no shill for the Reagan Administration's civil rights record,
praised "the quiet but persistent leadership of Chairman Clarence
Thomas" in an editorial on May 17, 1987, entitled, "The EEOC is
Thriving." The July 15, 1991 U.S. News and World Report wrote:
"Overall, it seems clear that he left the [EEOC] in better
condition than he found it." He has favored strong remedies for
                                      47

discrimination, including many affirmative steps, such as
increased recruitment and outreach to minorities and women. This
is the kind of nondiscriminatory affirmative action which we all
favor.

         No, it isn't his civil rights record that these liberal
critics are really concerned about, that is just a smokescreen.
These critics really object to Judge Thomas having spoken out
against what is popularly called reverse discrimination. He has,
on a number of occasions, voiced his objections to preferences,
to numerical devices whether labelled quotas, goals, or set-
asides. This is the kind of affirmative action which is
discriminatory itself. Here is one way he has put his views:
"I... am proud... to defend the principle that people should be
judged on the basis of what they can do, not on the basis of
irrelevant personal characteristics. [Some believe] that the
laws should be read to prohibit only some discrimination and to
permit, or even require, other discrimination -- the prohibited
and permitted types of discrimination to be determined,
apparently, by the governing elites. Since the memory of when
the governing elites favored discrimination against black people
is still so clear in my mind, I prefer not to leave to the elites
the discretion to categorize race discrimination into permitted
and prohibited classes -- all must be prohibited."

        Just as our society had finally enacted long overdue laws to
prohibit racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination, new forms of
discrimination were invented, ostensibly in the name of civil
                                      48

rights. Innocent persons were made new victims of discrimination
as a purported means of remedying discrimination against others
and as redress for a history these new victims had not created.

         Now, we all know that discrimination and bigotry still
persist. Indeed, a tiny portion of my mail regarding Judge
Thomas is another unfortunate reminder that some people in this
country want to keep black people down. One satisfactory result
of Judge Thomas's confirmation to the Supreme Court, for this
Senator, will be the powerful rebuke it delivers to these un-
American bigots. But the answer to discrimination is to end it,
make whole its victims, take steps to ensure that it does not
recur, and require the guilty party to recruit more minorities
and women into its applicant pool and consider them fairly along
with the rest of the applicants. The answer is not to engage in
discrimination against other, innocent persons. Two civil wrongs
do not make a civil right.

         The overwhelming majority of the American people favor equal
opportunity -- not equal results; not preferences for or against
anyone because of their race, ethnicity, or gender; not reverse
discrimination. They are well familiar with the variety and
scope of the devices, however euphemistically labelled, used to
embed preferences and reverse discrimination in employment and
elsewhere.

        The advocates of preference and reverse discrimination know
that these policies are extremely unpopular with the American
people. Accordingly, supporters of these unfair policies couch
                                     49

their attacks on Judge Thomas in other language. Thus, they
criticize him for his "civil rights record" or alleged lack of
sensitivity, or for being against all affirmative action rather
than only the preferential, unfair aspects of affirmative action,
as reflects his position while in the Executive Branch. In my
view, it is really the Judge's expressed belief in the equal
rights of all Americans that some of these critics are really
upset about.

         I do not know how Judge Thomas will vote on specific aspects
of affirmative action. As a Supreme Court Justice, he will be in
a new, and unique role. But because he has spoken out while in
policy-making positions against preferences and what has become
popularly known as reverse discrimination, the supporters of
these unfair policies wish to punish him. I trust, however, the
Senate will not sacrifice Judge Thomas on the twin altars of
preferences and reverse discrimination.

         I will not dwell on my frequently expressed concern that the
Senate has been infringing on the independence of the judiciary
when it seeks direct or indirect commitments on specific legal
issues from judicial nominees. Issues in the courts must be
resolved in the courts. This judicial resolution should occur
after parties have presented the facts of a specific case,
deployed their legal arguments for the judges to consider, and
the judges have done their own research and internal
consultation. Such issues are not to be decided based on what a
nominee tells a Senate Committee in advance. Confirmation of a
                                       50

nominee should not turn on a commitment to prejudge an issue.
         I do wish to express two special concerns about this

nomination process. Some interest group advocates of particular
policies want this Committee to insist that Judge Thomas answer
questions, and meet certain litmus tests, such as on abortion,
that Judge Souter did not answer or meet just one year ago this
week. Last year, we were told that Judge Souter held the key to
Roe v. Wade, yet virtually no one in the Senate made his
discussion of that issue a condition of their vote.

         Now, Judge Thomas is before us and some would have us
believe he now holds the key to Roe v. Wade. I note that Judge
Thomas casts one vote, not five. It is inappropriate enough that
he is expected to answer some of the questions Judge Souter
answered. But, if Judge Thomas is held to a higher standard and
even more rigorous litmus tests than Judge Souter, I think many
Americans will be deeply troubled and will want to know why this
particular nominee is being singled out.

         Moreover, we are here to determine Judge Thomas' fitness to
be a Justice of the Supreme Court, not to conduct oversight on
the EEOC or the Office for Civil Rights. We are not here to test
his memory on events and documents constructed years ago. I
would also note that after every matter in which Judge Thomas was
involved in the Executive Branch, this Senate later confirmed him
to a very responsible position at least once, and in some cases,
three times.

         Finally, I wish to mention my own delight at Judge Thomas'
                                     51

success. That success says a great deal about our country and
about Judge Thomas, the man. Having grown up in the era of Jim
Crow, and gone barefoot in the unpaved street of his community,
he will soon be able to put his feet under the bench in the
highest court in the land, as he contemplates the finer points of
the law. As Judge Thomas said when nominated, only in America
could such a thing happen.

                            The Nominee's Judicial Experience
         Let me lay to rest, here, any criticism that Judge Thomas'
less than two years on the bench somehow renders him less than
the best for the job. Of the 105 people who have served on the
Supreme Court, 41 had no prior judicial experience whatsoever.
Another 10 Justices had less than two years of State or federal
judicial experience. Thus, Judge Thomas has as much or more
judicial experience as nearly half of those who served on the
Supreme Court, including many of the most distinguished and well-
regarded Justices ever to serve. The use of double-standards to
hold down blacks in well known. I am confident that the Senate
will not impose an unconscious double-standard on this nominee
with respect to judicial experience.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Metzenbaum has been kind enough, I am told, to yield to
Senator Leahy because he has an appointment with the President
to discuss the next five nominees to the Supreme Court. [Laughter.]
  I will yield to Senator Leahy.

     OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK J. LEAHY, A U.S.
               SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF VERMONT

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you, but I es-
pecially want to thank Senator Metzenbaum. Because of the Presi-
dent's schedule, the time of the meeting is such that I probably
would not be able to make an opening statement if he did not yield,
and I appreciate the courtesy of both of you.

  Judge Thomas, I am pleased to welcome you and your family to
these hearings, and I was delighted to have a chance to meet,
albeit briefly, Mrs. Thomas this morning.

  The Constitution's advise-and-consent process established a
method of assuring the fitness of Supreme Court nominees. That
really has to be the most important function this committee can
serve. It was at such committee hearings as we are having today
that Justice Thurgood Marshall was approved for a seat on the
Court some 24 years ago.

  If you look at the distinguished career of Justice Marshall, you
see him serving as the able guardian of rights, rights that affect
the welfare of every man, woman, and child in this country, rights
like personal privacy, rights like a woman's right to choose, free-
dom of speech, the separation of church and State, and school de-
segregation. He fought for those issues during those 24 years and
those issues are no less important today.

  The nominee who replaces Justice Marshall on the Court is going
to be with us long after many at this table today have moved on.
When children born this year become eligible to vote in the year
2009, Judge Thomas, if you are confirmed, you will still be a rela-
tively youthful 61 years old. So your nomination comes at a pivotal
time in Supreme Court history.

  In little over a year, two of the Court's great defenders of individ-
ual liberties--William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall--have
both retired. Now, their departure gives cause for public concern
about the direction of the Court, and that concern is reflected in
the hundreds of letters and phone calls I have received from Ver-
monters this summer. Many fear that we are witnessing the cre-
ation of a monolithic, right-wing Court that is going to favor the
State and the power of the State and its bureaucracies over individ-
ual and minority rights.

  Now, you speak passionately about individual freedom, and your
concerns are well placed, for it is the courts, and preeminently the
Supreme Court, that must defend those freedoms.

  Judges are often targets of public disdain because they rule ac-
cording to the law; they don't rule according to popular opinion or
public opinion polls. That takes courage, especially when decisions
run counter to shifting political winds. Our Founding Fathers an-
ticipated this by insulating judges from the majority will, granting
them lifetime tenure. Laws may be made by majorities, but minori-
                                         53

ties are safe only if those laws are tempered by justice and a pas-
sion for the liberties of the individual.

  The next Supreme Court nominee that the Senate confirms must
be dedicated to the proposition that personal freedom is the birth-
right of every single American. In exercising our advise-and-con-
sent responsibility, we have to consider a nominee's threshold
qualities of judgment, temperament, experience, intellectual dis-
tinction, and moral fiber.

  But having done that, we look beyond to probe a nominee's judi-
cial philosophy. Does he or she have an expansive or a narrow view
of the Constitution? Does the nominee regard the Constitution as a
safeguard for civil rights and liberties, as it was for Thurgood Mar-
shall and so many great conservative and liberal Justices of the
Court? Or does the nominee espouse a narrow and guarded ap-
proach that ultimately limits the freedoms of all Americans?

  Finally, we have to assess a nominee's willingness to answer
questions. No nominee should be asked to discuss cases pending
before the Court. I accept that. That is a given. Neither should a
nominee feel free to avoid questions about established constitution-
al doctrine on the ground that a case on that subject may eventual-
ly come before the Court. Far too much is at stake.

  The Senate and the public have a right to know what a nominee
thinks about critical issues before that nominee is confirmed to a
lifetime seat on the Court. Let me make this very clear, Judge
Thomas. In recent years, we have danced around the question of
where nominees stand on a woman's fundamental right to choose
an abortion. This is one of the burning social issues of our time. It
is the single issue about which this committee and the American
people most urgently wish to know the nominees' views. And yet
the Senate and the Nation have been frustrated by polite--albeit
respectful--stonewalling. To the extent that Judge Souter declined
to answer pertinent questions last year, I was disturbed, and I told
him so.

  In light of your warm praise for Louis Lehrman's essay arguing
that all abortions should be unconstitutional, I believe the burden
is on you to explain that view. I will expect forthright answers
from you. If not, then I will have no choice but to assume that you
agree with what Mr. Lehrman said.

  Judge Thomas, let me also say that I look forward to getting to
know you better in these hearings. I am impressed, and I believe
the country is impressed, by the less-traveled road that you have
taken from Pin Point, GA, to the threshold of the Supreme Court.
Your self-discipline, your diligence, and your hard work are exem-
plary.

  At the same time, you must understand that your record and
some of your writings trouble me. I have no clear idea of what your
approach is to the Constitution. You describe yourself as conserva-
tive. Well, most Vermonters are conservative, too. But Vermont
conservatives believe first and foremost in limited government, a
government that stays out of people's personal affairs, leaves us
alone. They understand what Justice Louis Brandeis described as
"the right to be let alone."

  But many conservative activists contend that Justices should
defer invariably to majority rule, somehow to put blind faith in the
                                          54

infallibility of whatever the legislature does. You were part of a
White House working group on the family which went so far as to
argue that the jurisdiction of the Federal courts might have to be
curtailed. Why? To ensure that the majority automatically rules.

  I think the model becomes "my government, right or wrong,"
and I find that a chilling abandonment of individual and minority
rights. Let us never forget that history has been written time and
again by those who dare to challenge conventional wisdom.

  You often allude to what the Declaration of Independence calls
the laws of nature and of nature's God. Well, natural law, we all
know, is an elastic concept. It can be used to defend but also to
deny basic rights. In a case alluded to already at this hearing
today, the famous case from the 1870's, one Supreme Court Justice
would have upheld a law in Illinois that barred a Vermont woman
from becoming a lawyer. And why would this Vermont woman be
barred from becoming a lawyer? Because under the laws of nature,
according to this Justice, women were granted the noble and
benign offices of wife and mother, and that was it. He wanted to
make certain we knew that natural law would never accept a
woman as a lawyer.

  Now, that might seem like a very quaint and dated reference,
but the natural law problem is anything but dated. It can be used
to argue for or against rights like abortion and privacy. I want to
know what natural law means to you, Judge. How would you use it
to interpret the Constitution and the Bill of Rights? And I will ask
questions along that line.

  In the hearing this committee held last year to consider your
nomination to the D.C. circuit, you said that you were not "some-
one who has had the opportunity or the time to formulate an indi-
vidual, well-thought-out constitutional philosophy." Well, that is
fair enough. I don't have any problem with that answer. Every
nominee to the Court of Appeals need not come armed with a fully
coherent constitutional jurisprudence. They have to follow what is
already in the law, what is already decided by the Supreme Court.
But nominees to the Supreme Court should be prepared to tell this
committee and, through us, the American people how they are
going to approach the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.

  I am troubled by your open admiration for those willing to de-
ceive and defy Congress and by the hostility you have demonstrat-
ed toward Congress, both in action and in words in your speeches.
You have attacked Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion that upheld
the special prosecutor law for Watergate-style investigations. You
have questioned Congress' power to enact civil rights legislation.
You have suggested repeatedly that Congress has no business car-
rying out its oversight function, one of the most important func-
tions of this body.

  I have always considered the separation of powers to be the
surest guarantor of the limited government you claim to prefer. So
when you state a clear preference for executive branch power over
congressional authority, it gives me some pause.

  Finally, I am concerned about some of your ideological views.
You have wholeheartedly endorsed the statement that America is
careening with frightening speed toward a statist dictatorial
system. Well, I cannot accept that, and these words seem more
                                          55

than a little strange as we watch the unfolding drama of Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union, where countries that truly suffered
under statist dictatorial systems throw off their shackles. And
when they throw off their shackles, where do they look? They look
toward a free and compassionate America as an example of how a
democracy is run.

  But, more disturbingly, your words strike me as the views of a
combative, hard-line ideologue. The last thing I seek in a Supreme
Court Justice is ideology. I value intelligence and wisdom, compas-
sion, a willingness to listen to all sides of an argument. I want
someone on the bench who is going to give every litigant a fair
shake, without bias or predisposition of any kind. Ideological fervor
plays no part in a judicial temperament.

  So I look forward to discussing these and other issues with you. I
welcome you to these hearings. I hope that you will be forthcoming
in your responses to the committee because ultimately we have to
make the fully informed recommendation to the Senate and to the
rest of this country. I welcome you here, and, Mr. Chairman, again,
I thank both you and Senator Metzenbaum for the courtesy.

                                 TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
                                               SEPTEMBER 10, 1991

           Judge Thomas, I am pleased to welcome you and your family to
   these hearings.

           The Advice and Consent process established by the framers of the
   Constitution to assure the fitness of Supreme Court nominees is one of
   this Committee's most solemn responsibilities. It was at such
   committee hearings that Justice Thurgood Marshall was approved for a
   seat on the Court 24 years ago.

            During his distinguished career. Justice Marshall served as an
   able guardian of rights that affect the welfare of every man, woman
   and child in this country -- rights like personal privacy; a woman's
   right to choose; freedom of speech; the separation of church and
   state; and school desegregation. These issues are no less important
   today. The nominee who replaces Justice Marshall on the Court will be
   with us long after many around this table today have moved on. When
   children born this year become eligible to vote in 2009, Judge Thomas,
   you will, if confirmed, still be a relatively youthful Justice of 61.

           Your nomination comes at a pivotal time in Supreme Court history.
   In little over a year, two of the Court's great defenders of
   individual liberties -- William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall -- have

           Laws may be made by majorities, but minorities are safe only if
   those laws are tempered by justice and a passion for the liberties of
   the individual.

            The next Supreme Court nominee that the Senate confirms must be
   dedicated to the proposition that personal freedom is the birthright
   of all Americans.

            In exercising our advice and consent responsibility, we must
   first consider a nominee's threshold qualities of judgment,
   temperament, experience, intellectual distinction and moral fiber.

            But we must look beyond that, probing a nominee's judicial
   philosophy. Does he or she have an expansive or narrow view of the
   Constitution? Does he regard the Constitution as the safeguard for
   civil rights and liberties, as it was for Thurgood Marshall and so
   many great conservative and liberal Justices of the Court, or does he
   espouse a narrow and guarded approach that will limit our freedoms?

        Finally, we have to assess a nominee's willingness to answer

forthcoming in your responses to this Committee so we can make a fully
informed recommendation to the Senate and to the American people.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Simpson.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ALAN K. SIMPSON, A U.S.
               SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING

  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I see you were trying to throw me off of my usual pattern there.
The tenor of my remarks were somewhat dependent upon the com-
mentaries that might emanate from my friend and senior colleague
from Ohio.
  The CHAIRMAN. It will make it harder for you to attack, before
attacked, but give it a shot anyway, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you. I was citing there a natural law of
the Judiciary Committee. [Laughter.]
  Judge Thomas, we welcome you to this important step in this
process. Some of my colleagues have already spoken very clearly of
your impressive and truly inspiring life story. I will not reiterate
those remarkable accomplishments, and yet they certainly do stir
one.
  I would only point out a clear irony, congratulations, and be-
cause of your tremendously successful career to date, you now have
the opportunity to be subjected to a very rigorous process that can
be unpleasant and sometimes rancorous, but, hopefully, never
unfair. I do not believe our Chairman would ever allow that.
  Let me emphasize that these hearings can also be, quite clearly,
courteous and thoughtful, and I believe that was indeed the case
when we heard testimony and comments from Judge Souter and
Judge Kennedy, before this committee voted to elevate them to the
Supreme Court.
  On the other hand, I think Judge Bork might choose to undergo
a medieval torture chamber, rather than to be presented again
before this committee, and that was a very unfortunate situation in
my mind, whether you liked him or whether you didn't.
  So, Judge Thomas, unlike some nominees we have faced, and I
think, again, in particular, of Justices Kennedy and Souter, you
are really not a great mystery to any of us. You have been here
before the U.S. Senate four times. No one I can ever imagine would
have that type of exposure before this committee.
  So, no mystery to us. You have twice been confirmed by the U.S.
Senate here on the EEOC, by this very committee, after extensive
hearings before the Senate, we confirmed your nomination to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Four
times, members of the Senate have voted for or against you, very
few in the negative.
  What is different now, I suppose will be told to us is being a
"higher standard." I think it will be really a higher degree of plain
old politics. There is nothing wrong with that, but I think we ought
to stay with reality as to what it will be.
  There will be some witnesses who will appear after you who will
be very critical of you, extremely critical. They certainly have that
right to express any type of opinion they may wish. However, for
those Americans who are not as familiar with your record as we
are in the Senate after four separate hearings, let me emphasize

         56-270 O--93 3
                                          60

that some criticisms of you have already been well considered and
rejected by the Senate, and I think that is important to keep in
mind.
Some groups will be here to criticize your tenure, as Chairman of
the EEOC or as Director of the Education Department's Office of
Civil Rights. This committee and the full Senate has had all of
those criticisms squarely before us on more than several occasions,
including one which was not of great record, before the Senate
Select Committee on Aging, which was a real rake-around job in
ancient days, and not much came of that, either.

So, we rejected all of those previous when we confirmed your
nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court by a voice vote. I think there
was a quite audible "nay," perhaps from one on the panel who is
not a faint-hearted man and who speaks very clearly on the issues.
So, I would hope that this hearing does not simply dwell on all
these previously thoroughly debated and already decided issues.
That laundry has been well-washed.
Some critics will be here to say and will say here that the ABA
found you to be only qualified for the Supreme Court, and that is
the American Bar Association. I assume some on that committee
apparently would have preferred that you had more experience on
the appeals court. But let us clearly remember that most of those
in the ABA are of the same critics who opposed the nomination of
Robert Bork, even though a majority of the ABA committee had
found Judge Bork to be "well-qualified." So much for that.

Let us also recognize the ABA rating for exactly what it is, help-
ful at times, irrelevant at others, and always subject to political
manipulation and pressure of special interest groups within the
bar--yes, that does occur.
Some special interest groups will be here to say some pretty
harsh and even some very arrogant and patronizing and even
nasty things about you, from the testimony I can envision coming
from them in some of the material I have seen. You might not
even be able to recognize yourself when they are finished portray-
ing you. I know that was the case with Robert Bork.
I do not come back on that to express any unfairness by the
Chairman. There are many who feel the other way. That is not
even the issue. But what I saw happen, this Senator from Wyo-
mforing5,x/2wayseawrse,  watched a  man   who  had been on  the Federal bench
                         who had    done  and  written 104  decisions, none of
them ever overturned on appeal, and 6 of his dissents became ma-
jority opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court, and whether one liked
him or not, he was portrayed to this committee and to the U.S.
people as a gargoyle, a sexist, a racist, an invader of the bedroom, a
sterilizer of women. I sat right here and watched it all happen--a
very, very troubling procedure.
So, from what I have come to discern, you will also be portrayed
by some as being hostile to privacy rights, as being an apologist for
segregated schools, and a promoter of wild, dramatic, and un-
checked theories of natural law that will cause the U.S. Constitu-
tion to come undone, it seems. One writer, I think who aspires to
this Court under some other administration, has said that the
Senate cannot avoid sharing the responsibility for the fate of self-
government in the United States--pretty dramatic.
                                           61

  I thought, as I heard the discussion, I think you might come to
see that natural law will become but a pseudonym for natural op-
position or natural partisanship or natural frustration, at having to
place an independent, thoughtful, bright conservative on the U.S.
Supreme Court. That will become quite evident to the American
public.

  Now, there is a natural solution for that, elect a natural Demo-
crat as President of the United States. The American public has
not chosen recently to do that, but, naturally, they could. [Laugh-
ter.]

  So, some groups have actually portrayed you as being hostile to
civil rights issues, and that is patently absurd and demeaning and
arrogant. It is clearly known that you are a powerful supporter of
antidiscrimination laws. We also well know that other groups are
most afraid of other groups who do not like the fact that you
oppose remedies which themselves cause reverse discrimination,
when actually most types of reverse discrimination do indeed vio-
late the Constitution and most Americans really do strongly oppose
reverse discrimination.

  So, I believe these criticisms of you to be inaccurate and off-base,
and some writers I think have been in some cases somewhat hys-
terical. And one can be a fine and strong supporter of civil rights,
while being very strongly opposed to unfair preferences, and many
here feel that way. I know I fit that category, too.

  So, Judge Thomas, there will be a number of us here who listen
to seek the truth. If we are here just to hear some of the special
interest groups parrot some of the old sale lines of criticism I have
just recited, well, we have our opportunity to rebut that.

  But for now, I earnestly recommend that you sit back and relax
as much as is possible. The Chairman will handle it with equanimi-
ty and care and fairness, and allow the American public to come to
know you in the same way that many of us on this committee
know you. And through tough, hard, serious and, yes, even parti-
san questions by this committee, I believe all Americans will come
to know you for what you are, an uncommonly bright, articulate,
and qualified judge, with significant and impressive legal and life
experiences, who is ready, fully ready, willing, and able to serve
our country on the Nation's highest court.

  Let me conclude by saying that not only do I believe you will be
good for the Supreme Court, but, Judge Thomas, I think you will
also be very good for America on the broader level. You yourself
have noted that is some risk, obviously, that there are too many
people today giving groups excuses for various things that hap-
pened in their lives. I am not even going to comment on that. You
can. You have.

  But I think the last thing anyone needs right now in this coun-
try, white, brown, yellow, or black, is more excuses for everything.
Excuse time is over. It is important to run out of scape goats. It is
time for all Americans--and that is what we are in this pluralistic
society--to focus again on what has made this country great, and
we must all reacquaint ourselves, all of us, every race, color and
creed, with those distinctly American and, yes, even corny notions
of hard work and decency and kindness and fairness to our fellow
                                          62

humans, and we must strive to provide every single individual with
an equal opportunity to realize his or her full potential.

  You exemplify what all of us might be able to accomplish, good
things if we were to stop making excuses, and I was awfully good
at that. I was known as "Alibi Al" in high school, and it worked. I
could fake anybody out except myself. Finally, creeping maturity
overcame me, and there was some progress.

  So, you are an inspiration to us all. Mr. Chairman, I thank you
and I sincerely welcome Judge Thomas to our committee, and I
thank you for your past and present courtesies.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator, for once again not disap-
pointing. I think you will soon find out that Judge Thomas' views
are so different from Judge Bork's that you will be surprised to
find that this is not about conservatives; rather, this is about how
people think.

  Senator SIMPSON. I have an opportunity for rebuttal, thank you.
[Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HOWARD M. METZENBAUM, A U.S.
                   SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF OHIO

  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, this is the fifth Supreme Court vacancy in the
Reagan-Bush era. Once Justice Marshall's seat is filled, Presidents
Reagan and Bush will have filled a majority of seats on the Su-
preme Court.
  A judicial nominee cannot become a member of the High Court,
simply because the President and his advisers are comfortable with
that nominee's views and judicial philosophy. The Supreme Court
is not an extension of the Presidency. The Constitution makes it
clear that the Supreme Court is a separate and independent
branch of government. That same Constitution assigned the Senate
a role in the confirmation process, to help preserve the independ-
ence of the judiciary.
  The importance of the Senate's role has grown in recent years,
because, quite frankly, Presidents Reagan and Bush have made no
bones about using the Court to advance their political and social
agenda.
  A core element of the Reagan-Bush political program has been
reversal of Supreme Court decisions in the areas of abortion, civil
rights, individual liberties, and the first amendment. The Reagan
and Bush administrations have used the courts to achieve policy
outcomes on social issues which they could not obtain through the
legislative process.
  Make no mistake about it, the Reagan and Bush administrations
have succeeded. You only have to look at the Court's astonishing
decision last term in the abortion gag rule case, to realize that the
Rehnquist court is intent on implementing the Reagan-Bush social
agenda.
  An omen of things to come from the Rehnquist court was con-
tained in a paragraph in Payne v. Tennessee, a 1991 case in which
the Court reversed itself on a question of constitutional liberties.
The majority in that case stated that adherence to precedent is
                                       63
 most important in cases involving property and contract rights.
 But with respect to constitutional rights and liberties, a majority of
 the Rehnquist court stated that adherence to precedents "is not an
 inexorable command, particularly in constitutional cases."

   In other words, the Reagan-Bush Supreme Court thinks that Jus-
 tices should be more respectful of precedent, when a business per-
 son's contractual rights are at stake than when a woman's consti-
ytutional right to choose or an African-American's right to equal
 treatment is at stake.

   As Justice Marshall wrote in his dissent in Payne, this statement
 by the Reagan-Bush court sends "a clear signal that scores of es-
 tablished constitutional liberties are now ripe for reconsideration,
 thereby inviting open defiance of our precedents," said Justice
 Thurgood Marshall.

   It is in that context that the current nominee comes before the
 Judiciary Committee.

   The nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas has provoked debate
 and differences of opinion throughout the country. But there is one
 thing upon which everyone, including this Senator, agrees: Judge
 Thomas' life story is an uplifting tale of a youth determined to sur-
 mount the barriers of poverty, segregation, and discrimination. It
 was an extraordinary journey from hardscrabble Pin Point, GA, to
 the promise and privileges of Yale Law School.

   It would be easy, and probably smart politically, for Senators to
 vote in favor of this nomination, because of Judge Thomas' person-
 al triumph over adversity. Frankly, I suspect the President and his
 advisers believe that some Senators will do just that. But the
 Senate must evaluate the nomination based upon the career and
 record of the nominee, Judge Thomas. The question for this com-
 mittee is not where does Judge Thomas come from, rather, the
 question for the committee is this: Where would a Justice Thomas
 take the Supreme Court?

   I am deeply concerned about the answer to that question. The
 record suggests that Judge Thomas may be an eager and active
 participant in the Rehnquist court's assault on established judicial
 precedents which protect civil rights and individual liberties. Judge
 Thomas has harshly criticized important court decisions which
 have protected voting rights for blacks and promoted equal treat-
 ment for minorities and women. Indeed, he has suggested that
 many of these decisions be overturned.

   Virtually every public statement which Judge Thomas has made
 regarding the issue of abortion indicates that he does not believe
 the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose. Judge Thomas
 even signed onto a White House report which urged the appoint-
 ment of new Supreme Court Justices who would overturn decisions
 such as Roe v. Wade.

   There are those who suggest that because of his extraordinary
 background, Judge Thomas will bring a different perspective to the
 Court. That may be true. It also may not be true. I am concerned
 that the nominee's statements and record indicate that, rather
 than bring a different perspective to the Court, he will fit in all too
 well with the Court that has spurned its special duty to protect the
 rights of women and minorities, the elderly, and the poor.
                                          64

  During his tenure as Chairman of EEOC, Judge Thomas failed to
fulfill his duty to protect the legal rights of older workers. Now,
some argue that this failure as EEOC Chairman is irrelevant in de-
termining his qualifications for the Court.

  I believe that his disregard for the rights of older workers is very
relevant. It directly relates to his sensitivity and to his duty to pro-
vide judicial and constitutional protection for the aged. Unfortu-
nately, while Judge Thomas was head of the EEOC, thousands of
older workers who believed that they were victims of age discrimi-
nation lost their right to bring age bias suits in Federal court, be-
cause his agency failed to process their claims in a timely manner.
Despite assurances from Clarence Thomas that he would correct
the problem, Congress found it necessary, in 1988 and again in
1990, to pass legislation to restore the rights of these older workers.

  In his career with the Federal Government, Clarence Thomas
was appointed to jobs designed to protect and enforce the rights of
the disadvantage^. Yet, in speech after speech, Clarence Thomas
rails against governmental efforts to aid minorities and the disad-
vantaged. In one article, Judge Thomas even asserted that it was
"insane" for African-Americans to expect the Federal Government
to help relieve the harmful effects of decades of discrimination.

  Judge Thomas benefited both from affirmative action and from
the work of civil rights leaders and government officials who have
tried to break down the barriers of poverty and discrimination.
Yet, Judge Thomas condemns government efforts to give other
people the same chance he had to climb over those barriers to suc-
cess.

  One other area of concern is Judge Thomas' constitutional phi-
losophy. Judge Thomas' speeches and writings suggest that he
might read the Constitution as forbidding the minimum wage law,
banning affirmative action, and severely restricting constitutional
power.

  In addition, Judge Thomas has asserted that the Constitution
must be interpreted in light of natural law. As has already been
pointed out, natural law is a broad, vague concept which means dif-
ferent things to different people. Over 50 years ago, conservative
judges used natural law arguments to uphold antiunion practices
by employers and strike down health and safety legislation.

  Similarly, a 19th century Supreme Court decision relied upon
natural law arguments about "the paramount destiny and mission
of women" to justify an Illinois law which banned women from
practicing law. Today, antiabortion advocates have cited natural
law as the basis for their argument that a fetus has a constitution-
ally protected right to life which overrides a woman's right to
choose. In 1987, Judge Thomas called one article which made that
argument "a splendid example of applying natural law."

  So, Judge Thomas, I begin this hearing with a great deal of re-
spect for your accomplishments, but also with a great deal of con-
cern about your record and about the direction in which the Court
has been moving.

  You have been nominated for a seat on the Supreme Court
which can no longer be counted on as a force to promote racial har-
mony, equal treatment, and social justice. A majority of the Su-
preme Court has taken a sharp right turn and declared open
                                          65

season on a number of constitutional liberties and civil rights
which Americans hold dear.

  While the President may celebrate the Court's movement in this
direction, I lament it. Ultimately, Judge Thomas, I must examine
your record and determine whether you will be a Justice who will
accelerate this movement, or a Justice who will help to restore bal-
ance to the Court, and once again make it a force for equal justice,
fair treatment, and individual liberty.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Grassley.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S.
                   SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF IOWA

  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for sched-
uling this hearing so soon after the recess is over so that we have
an opportunity to get through this and to get Judge Thomas sworn
in and serving on the Court when it opens its fall term. So, thank
you, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Congratulations, Judge Thomas, and I wel-
come you, and, primarily, I want to also welcome your family. This
is for you and for us on this committee a really historic moment,
because there has been only 105 Supreme Court Justices since the
Supreme Court was set up in accordance with the Constitution. So
that will put you, Judge Thomas, in a very small prestigious group.
But somehow I feel it is a group you have prepared yourself for
diligently.
   I hope that my fellow Americans know that Judge Thomas has
served with distinction in both Federal and State governments. At
the Federal level he has substantial experience in all three
branches of government, and I would venture to guess that few
nominees have ever had such a breadth of experience before being
nominated to the highest court in the land.
   I would hope that this background has given Judge Thomas an
appreciation for the appropriate role of courts that they have
within our democratic government. Our American governmental
system is, of course, a delicate one, with a structure of checks and
balances and defined roles for each branch of our government.
   Sometimes Justices haven't always understood that they are not
policymakers. For example, some have criticized Judge Thurgood
Marshall for continuing to be an advocate even after he donned the
robes of an umpire.
   One of the architects of article 3, Alexander Hamilton, wrote
that the courts must declare only the sense of the law, and if they
should be disposed to exercise will rather than that judgment the
consequence would be the substitution of their pleasure to that of a
legislative body.
   To be faithful to our Constitution's framers, Judge Thomas will
actually be required to step away, step back from his past involve-
ment in the shaping of public policy. Being a judge, as he has said
since assuming his position on the Court of Appeals, requires disci-
pline. Rather than making policy, he will be called upon to inter-
                                          66

pret the policies of the elected branches of government, of course
all the while guided by the Constitution.

  This confirmation hearing will give the Senate, and at the same
time the American people, the chance to become acquainted with
Judge Thomas and to assess whether he possesses the qualities that
a Justice should have--fairness, open-mindedness, and objectivity.

  I suspect that we will all see an individual unlike any other who
has come before us as a nominee for the High Court. Judge
Thomas spent the first 17 years of his life in strict segregation of
the South, directed as to what water fountain he could drink from
and what public restroom he could use. Judge Thomas has de-
scribed this "as close to totalitarianism as he would ever hope to
get."

  He grew up without material comforts and even conveniences.
We have heard from him and people who have known him well
that it wasn't until he was 7 years old that he lived in a home with
indoor plumbing. His home was run quite strictly by his grandpar-
ents who, in his words, had "Ph.D.'s in life earned at the university
of experience with hard times as their advisor."

  They instilled in him discipline and respect. It seems to me that
discipline is a shortcoming in too much of American society today.
So, having that in Judge Thomas puts him a cut above average
American society.

  He was inspired by his grandfather and his teachers. They were
Catholic nuns. They gave him his personal foundation--"God,
values, morality, and education"--and these are the words that he
told the nuns when he paid tribute to them in 1986.

  In the Senate we have some who have started from humble be-
ginnings and many who were born in great wealth and privilege.
None of us, however, has had to surmount the obstacles Judge
Thomas confronted. Racism and prejudice from his cruel teenage
classmates in the seminary to supposedly enlightened employers he
encountered as a young law school graduate.

  As he has noted, he has been "deterred and preferred" by racial-
ly conscious policies. Many others with his experiences would
become cynical and selfish, I am sure. But rather we have before
us in Judge Thomas a man who has devoted his professional life to
work on behalf of equal rights and opportunities for all individuals.
He sees the respect for individual rights as a great and overriding
tradition of our Nation. What is most important, and he knows
while saying that that there is still a lot of work that needs to be
done in this great country of ours.

  Now some find Judge Thomas to be threatening because he chal-
lenges the liberal orthodoxy of special preferences and group enti-
tlements. That has become, as columnist William Raspberry has
said, "black political orthodoxy." But Judge Thomas' message of
self-reliance is a reminder to all Americans that while govern-
ment's responsibility is to ensure equal opportunity, reliance, let
me say too much reliance upon government-mandated preferences
won't solve each and every problem.

  Now we will have the opportunity in the next few days to ex-
plore many topics with Judge Thomas. However, he is no stranger
to the Senate, and I think I am the fourth person this morning who
                                          67

has said that he has been before this confirmation process of the
Senate on four separate occasions, and I guess this is the fifth one.

  Moreover, I think that Judge Thomas in many different ways,
both in public and before this body, has already been very forth-
coming. In response to the Committee's request for certain docu-
ments, Judge Thomas has provided, I have been told, some 36,000
pages of documents, and I understand that it has been cataloged in
some 10 boxes of documents. I don't know, I suppose there could be
others because we confirm a lot of people. But I really don't know
of any other nominee who has been so scrutinized and so analyzed
as you have been Judge Thomas in preparation for this hearing.

  This document request is just an example of how far the Senate
has strayed in the nomination process. I suppose I say that in a his-
torical context. Some have stated that the Senate s "advise and
consent" role in the elevation of Supreme Court Justices, of any
Supreme Court Justice, for that matter, is the most important
power that we in the Senate here exercise. Now, I don't happen to
share that view, as important as I take my responsibilities today
and through this process, because I happen to feel that confronting
the issue of war--as we did only last January, and attempting to
bring government spending under control are among the more sig-
nificant responsibilities that we have.

  And, of course, I think the Constitution doesn't elevate the con-
firmation process quite this high. The Constitution shows this be-
cause the "advise and consent" role is spelled out in chapter 2 with
executive powers, and not with the legislative powers in Article 1.
So I think the Constitution itself indicates it is not a preeminent
legislative power.

  It is really only in recent years that the Senate has redefined its
role. When Justice White was nominated, just 29 years ago, he
came to this Judiciary Committee and was asked only eight ques-
tions. What has changed to require all these long hearings over the
last quarter century? Well, something has lengthened the process,
and to some extent I feel it has been lengthened needlessly. I don't
know exactly why, but this is how the process works today, and I
am a Member of the Senate and I am going to make sure the proc-
ess works. But I think once in a while maybe we ought to take
some--reanalyze how we do things.

  And, of course, saying this doesn't mean that the Senate should
be a rubber stamp. I don't believe that.

  Judge Thomas, I look forward to talking with you over the next
few days about the role of the courts in our democracy, how you
approach cases, and the differences that you see between judicial
restraint on the one hand and judicial activism on the other hand.
And I will have some questions for you like my colleagues are
going to have questions about how you see this whole issue of natu-
ral law. We should also have an understanding as to whether you
bring a very personal philosophy to the job and the responsibilities
of judging.

  Finally, Judge Thomas, I wish you well in the process which lies
ahead, and I caution very much against a quest for commitments
on very specific issues, particularly issues that will come before the
Court. For if you were to lay out any particular positions on the
legal issues of the day, the independence and the integrity of the
                                              68

judiciary would be compromised. We expect you to be a policeman
for that integrity and independence, and I believe that you have
been already.

   Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
   Senator Heflin.

       OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HOWELL HEFLIN, A U.S.
                SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ALABAMA

   Senator HEFLIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I would like to welcome you, Judge Thomas, to this historic con-
firmation hearing. Your nomination by the President is a continu-
ation of a constitutional process begun over 200 years ago, and
there are few duties that I take more seriously than the "advise
and consent" function entrusted to the Members of the U.S.
Senate.

  As I have with every nomination hearing, I will use this occasion
to listen and learn. Through the media, we have all seen and heard
and read a great deal about your nomination and its uniqueness.
But it is during these hearings where spontaneity and unpredict-
ability are common so that those of us charged with the duty of
advice and consent are able to make an informed decision.

  I have often stated that the Supreme Court is really a people's
court. But, while the Court deals with such abstract legal princi-
ples as justiciability, collateral estoppel, comity, due process, and so
forth, the Court must ultimately deal with real people, their rights,
duties, property, and most importantly, their liberty. The Justices
of the Supreme Court are the final guarantors of the sacred text of
the Constitution and its Bill of Rights and the liberties and free-
doms which are enshrined therein and developed therefrom.

  If confirmed, you will have vast power over the lives of Ameri-
cans as to their rights of speech, religion, press, association, as well
as their property rights. You will participate in decisions which
will affect the rights of those accused of a crime, as well as the
rights of a lawful society to be protected from the criminal ele-
ment, and you will have an important say as to what degree of pri-
vacy the American people are entitled.

  The list could go on, of course, but my point is that before we are
called on to exercise our confirmation function, we in the Senate
must explore what is in your heart and what is your basic judicial
philosophy, because if you are confirmed you will serve a lifetime--
for perhaps the next 30 years, thus well into the 21st century. We,
on behalf of the American people, must investigate if you will zeal-
ously guard the freedoms and the liberties that provide a legacy
and framework for generations to come.

  In reviewing the qualifications of a nominee, I am of the opinion
that an individual should possess at least the following three crite-
ria: First, an understanding on the proper role of the judiciary
under our Constitution; second, an abiding belief in an independent
judiciary; and third, a deep commitment to equal justice under the
law.

   To some, you are the very embodiment of the American Dream--
you have overcome the bonds of poverty and racial segregation and
                                          69

deprivation and have risen to the top. To others, you have succeed-
ed, but forgotten your past and turned your back on others now
less fortunate than you.

  I and my colleagues will attempt to look into your heart and
mind. I will be looking to see if you intend to bring a rigidly ideo-
logical agenda to the Court. I will want to know if you respect the
principles of stare decisis and judicial restraint, and, most impor-
tantly, if you intend to turn the clock back on almost 30 years of
racial progress and harmony which have occurred, albeit imperfect-
ly, in the diverse society known as America.

  Under the "advise and consent" function it is our solemn duty to
explore any doubts about you and your thinking.

  The theme of this hearing could be entitled "Doubting Thomas."
The term "Doubting Thomas" has been applied to individuals from
biblical times, but it is applied today in a different context. You are
not the doubter. It is we in the Senate who are the doubters. This
hearing can remove, clarify, increase, or decrease the doubts and
the doubters.

  There are many who have expressed doubts that you are sensi-
tive to equal rights and equal justice under the law for all Ameri-
cans; doubts about your commitment to achieving the legitimate
aspirations of all Americans from whatever walk of life and regard-
less of their political persuasions; doubts about your concept of nat-
ural law, its standards, restrictions, breadth and application;
doubts as to whether your judicial thinking is within the main-
stream of judicial thought; and many other doubts as well.

  Judge Thomas, if the Senate is persuaded that you will pursue
an ideological agenda, have a closed mind, and will be a judicial
activist ignoring the will of elected bodies, then the doubts will
become impediments to your confirmation. On the other hand, if
your testimony persuades us that you will dispense justice fairly
and impartially and that you will listen and be open-minded, then,
in my judgment, doubts will be alleviated.

   President George Washington told his first Attorney General,
Edmund Randolph, "The administration of justice is the firmest
pillar of government and if justice is the ultimate goal and indis-
pensable for the survival of a free republic, we best ensure it by
the people we select as its custodians." We will now have the op-
portunity to learn if you are worthy of that admonition, and I look
forward to hearing from you.

  Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
   Senator Specter.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ARLEN SPECTER, A U.S. SENATOR
                  FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA

   Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much.
   Judge Thomas, I join my colleagues in welcoming you here this
morning. I have read extensively on your opinions and your
speeches and your background, and I congratulate you on a very
remarkable career.
   As I have read about your roots and about the instructions and
guidance which you got from your grandfather, I could not help
                                              70

but think that your grandfather and my father would have been
good friends. You have really pulled yourself up, perhaps without
bootstraps, perhaps by your kneecaps. You come to the Senate, for
what we have an obligation to do, is to make a very careful analy-
sis of your background and record, as we will attempt to make an
evaluation as to what kind of a Supreme Court Justice you would
be, if confirmed.

  The importance of your nomination is overwhelming. At the age
of 43, if you serve as long as Justice Thurgood Marshall did, that
would be until 83 or 40 years, which is the equivalent of 10 Presi-
dential terms. And when you consider that in the last Supreme
Court session, out of 121 decisions, that 19 were decided by a 5-to-4
vote, where the Court is on the cutting edge of the most important
issues which confront our country, a Justice who can provide that
fifth vote for 40 years, 10 presidential terms, may really be more
important than a President.

  The opening statements, Judge Thomas, I think are useful, to
give some idea as to what the individual Senators think are impor-
tant, as we proceed with the questioning. A major concern that I
have involves the functioning of the Court as a super legislature.

  You have already heard many say that we want the laws inter-
preted and not made, and I am concerned by a major case on feder-
alism handed down by the Supreme Court in 1984, where two Jus-
tices in the minority, on a 5-to-4 decision, said they only awaited a
fifth Justice to change the complexion of the Court. That case
could be reversed, placing ideology at the forefront. And I could
cite many cases, but only one more within the confines of limited
time here, the interpretation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

  In 1971, a unanimous Supreme Court, with an opinion written by
Chief Justice Burger, a noted conservative Justice, interpreted the
Civil Rights Act in a very meaningful way. In 1989, that decision
was changed, as a matter of judicial interpretation, even though
the Congress of the United States had allowed that decision to
stand for some 18 years.

  Four of the Justices who voted to change the law, not to inter-
pret the law, but to change the law, have appeared before this com-
mittee during the past decade and have placed their hands on the
Bible and have said that they would not make new law, but only
interpret the law, but they changed a view of congressional intent
in the context that Congress allowed that law to stand for some 18
years.

  I think it is fair to take a look at your writings and your deci-
sions as a basis for questioning. I do not believe that you ought to
be called upon--I say this, speaking for myself, because there are
no conclusive parameters to what a Senator may ask, but I do not
believe you ought to be asked for the ultimate decision as to how
you will decide any case, because in our judicial process, that really
calls upon a specific statement of facts, briefs, arguments, delibera-
tions among the Justices, and then a decision.

  But as I read through your readings, Judge Thomas, and take a
look at what deference you will give to constitutional process and
the congressional will, as I evaluate your judicial temperament in
carrying out congressional will, I have noted a number of your
writings--and this is not an isolation, but illustrative of one of
                                          71

your speeches, that you say Congress is no longer primarily a delib-
erative or even a law-making body, that there is little deliberation,
and even less wisdom in the manner in which the legislative
branch conducts its business.

  Now, I have noted your critical view of the Congress that would
pass an ethnic set-aside law, I have noticed your critical view of a
major case interpreting affirmative action in a context where the
Congress could have changed those decisions, but did not, and I
have noted your recognition of the Congress leaving those cases in
place. I think it is appropriate to analyze your approach to our con-
stitutional continuum in that context.

  At one point in your writings, although you don't endorse it as a
conclusion, you refer to a quick-fix of additional Supreme Court
nominees. In another place, you talk about the preference of
haying additional nominees change the minority opinion into a ma-
jority opinion, and I believe that these are important issues, as we
see the role of a nominee, a prospective Supreme Court Justice in a
critical role, as to whether we may expect you to interpret the law,
which I believe is the role of the Court, as opposed to making new
law.

  In terms of the questions which are appropriate to ask you, that
has been an evolving matter. There is a fascinating article written
by Chief Justice Rehnquist, when he was a lawyer in 1958, which
admonished the Senate in the confirmation proceedings for Justice
Whittaker for asking mundane questions about his experience as a
skunk trapper and the fact that he brought honor to two States,
being born in Kansas and I think appointed from Missouri, and
Chief Justice Rehnquist admonished the Senate for not really going
into the very substantive questions on equal protection of the law
and due process of law.

  When we come to the question of separation of powers, that is
rockbed in our society, and the Senate has a duty to make an inde-
pendent evaluation. I for one continue to believe that deference is
due to the President's nomination, but even that could be subject
to question, Judge Thomas, if the trend of the Court continues as a
super legislature establishing policy.

  There has already been some discussion here today, and I think
it is worth nothing that an early draft of the Constitution gave the
Senate the authority to appoint Supreme Court Justices. And going
back to Chief Justice Rehnquist's observations in 1958, he is very
pointed in approving an editorial which said that the Senate would
have the authority, if it chose to exercise it, to insist on balance on
the Court.

  As I say, I for one believe that, at this point in our constitutional
evolution, we have not come to a point of equal partnership be-
tween the President and the Senate, so deference is still owed to
the President, but this could be a more complex question, if the
Court continues to function as a super legislature.

  The issue of affirmative action, I think, will be very important in
these hearings, for two reasons. One is to test your own develop-
ment as a lawyer and your own philosophy of life, your philosophy
of law, your philosophy of justice, because at one point you had
sanctioned affirmative action in terms of standards and goals, and
there has been a change in your thinking, and you are certainly
                                          72

entitled to that, but I think that is an issue which will bear some
scrutiny.

  I have noted in your writings, Judge Thomas, your conclusion
that the Dred Scott decision, which upheld slavery, and the opinion
of Chief Justice Taney put a backdrop of racism and discrimina-
tion, which are deeply rooted in the history of the United States
and remain even to the present time, which is a very strong state-
ment. Unfortunately, I agree with you. I think it is an accurate
statement about racism and discrimination.

  I noted your comment in a fairly recent writing about you in the
Atlantic Monthly, by Mr. Juan Williams, "There is nothing you
can do to get past black skin. I don't care how educated you are,
how good you are at what you do, you'll never have the same con-
tacts and opportunities, you will never be seen as being equal to
whites." That again is a very strong statement and raises the ques-
tion in my mind as to whether we should be promoting affirmative
action, and I think our discussion here will move far beyond the
surface labels of what are quotas, which we hear to much about
today, and what affirmative action really means.

  I know that there are some who are critical of any person who
takes the benefit of affirmative action and then rejects it for
others. I have read the newspaper accounts, and I don't know first-
hand whether you were the beneficiary of affirmative action. But
even if you were, you may be the best witness on the subject to
really delve into this issue which is on the cutting edge of one of
the most important issues facing our society today, and that is
equality of employment opportunity.

  Beyond these issues, Judge Thomas, there are many, many other
questions which we are going to have to go into. As Senator Grass-
ley commented, the war powers issue is a big one. We just went
through a heated debate just a few months ago which involves the
question of Congress' authority to declare war versus the Com-
mander-in-Chiefs authority, the President's authority, as Com-
mander-in-Chief, very big issues on freedom of speech, freedom of
religion, the exercise clause, the establishment clause, so I think
we will have subjects of real great importance, and I approach this
hearing totally with an open mind.

  Speaking for myself and others who disagree and have already
announced positions, I believe that separation of powers calls for
independence of the Senate, repeating what I have already said,
with deference to the President's views. But I think we ought to
listen to you carefully, in a very friendly way, in a very construc-
tive way, and clear out the other witnesses before coming to a judg-
ment of the case.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator Simon.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PAUL SIMON, A U.S. SENATOR
                       FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS

  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

  Judge Thomas, I join in welcoming you and your family here.
                                              73

  No responsibility this committee faces is heavier than the deci-
sion on a nominee for the Supreme Court. That is always true, but
its truth is underscored when the retiring Justice is 83 and the
nominee is 43. There are nominees for high positions, such as a
Cabinet member, to which all of us in the Senate resolve limited
doubts in favor of the President. Doubts in the case of a Supreme
Court nominee must be resolved in favor of protecting the public.

  While there are some who are looking for an outstanding legal
scholar for the nomination, such nominations have been rare in
the history of the Court, though when that has happened the
Nation benefited.

  The American Bar Association rating of the nominee is not high,
but among those who have developed into superior Justices are
people whose legal background cannot be characterized as stellar.
My conclusion is that the nominee has the basic ability to make a
good Justice. And the fact that he is an African-American brings
diversity to the Court. That is a plus.

  But I have unanswered questions that these hearings should clar-
ify. What is Judge Thomas' understanding of the role of the Court?
In criticizing a 6-to-3 Supreme Court decision, Johnson v. Transpor-
tation Agency, on the employment rights of women, the nominee
applauded Justice Scalia's dissent, which he has every right to do,
but then said he hoped the dissent--I am quoting--"would provide
guidance for lower courts." What did he mean by that? Does he be-
lieve the lower courts need not follow the lead of a majority on the
Supreme Court?

  A fundamental question the committee must weigh is: Are we de-
stabilizing the law by creating a Supreme Court that swings back
and forth, depending on the whims of an administration?

  While the history of the Supreme Court appointments often re-
flects the political philosophy of the President making the nomina-
tion, Presidents have also considered the stability of the law in
making appointments. And so Herbert Hoover named Justice Ben-
jamin Cardozo, Dwight Eisenhower selected Justices Earl Warren
and William Brennan, Richard Nixon nominated Justice Harry
Blackmun, and Gerald Ford nominated Justice John Paul Stevens.
And Democratic Presidents appointed conservative Court members.
John F. Kennedy named Justice Byron White, and Harry Truman
named a Republican Senator, Justice Harold Burton.

  In each case, the President, at least once, nominated people who
were of a differing political philosophy. At least eight times in this
century, Presidents have nominated Justices who were of a differ-
ent political party than the President. The law has been well-
served through this balance, but in recent years, this sense of bal-
ance has diminished. Will the current nominee add to a balance or
an imbalance? The law should not be a pendulum, swinging back
and forth, depending on the philosophy of a President.

  I am concerned that the Court is shifting from its role of being
the champion of the less fortunate. It is easy for any government to
become too cozy with the wealthy and powerful. Once on the Court,
Justices do not rub shoulders with society's unsuccessful at Wash-
ington cocktail parties and dinners. But the test of whether we are
a civilized society is not whether we treat the elite well, but how
                                          74

responsive we are to those who do not have the political or finan-
cial reins of power, the least fortunate among us.

  The nominee has, to his great credit, overcome major obstacles to
be where he is today. But what about those who have been less for-
tunate or less able in overcoming obstacles? What does he mean,
when he writes--and I quote--"I do not see how the government
can be compassionate; only people can be compassionate and then
only with their own money, their own property or their own effort,
not that of others."

  I join Judge Thomas in lauding self-help, but not to the exclusion
of Government's proper role. Does Judge Thomas mean that we
should not have student aid programs, a Head Start Program?
Does that suggest there is something unconstitutional or morally
wrong with Government seeing to it that no one falls through the
cracks in our health care delivery system?

  Was Government not compassionate when we passed Federal leg-
islation outlawing segregation? Yes, it affected the property rights
of hotel and restaurant owners and many others, but does anyone
really believe that this Government action was morally wrong?
Was this comment of the nominee a throw-away line, or does it
suggest a philosophical mindset?

  Aside from the natural laws that have been referred to here, do
the nominee's views differ in any marked respect from those of
Judge Robert Bork, whom this committee rejected by a 9-to-5 vote?

  I am also concerned with the erosion of basic liberties that is
taking place on the present Court. The Rust v. Sullivan decision is
potentially the most significant assault on our basic liberties since
the Supreme Court, during World War II, approved the Federal
Government taking from their homes Japanese-Americans who
had committed no crime.

  If the logic of the Rust decision is upheld, that the Federal Gov-
ernment can restrict speech if it provides financial support, then
libraries that receive Federal support can be told what books they
may have, and universities can be told what they may teach. This
decision will be revisited both by the Congress and the Court. I do
not expect the nominee to tell me how he would rule on Rust v.
Sullivan, but I want to sense the philosophical moorings that will
shape how he votes.

  A Thomas address that comments on the ninth amendment, was
it a casual speech, like Senators too often make, or does it accu-
rately reflect his thinking?

  The Court will soon make decisions on sensitive church-State
issues. Where does the nominee stand on these traditions? Freedom
is much easier to give away than to preserve. I want a nominee
who understands not only the letter of our Constitution, but also
the spirit of it.

  What does Judge Thomas sense is his mission on the Court? That
is the fundamental question we need answered to make our deci-
sion.

  Judge Thomas, in my opening statement for the Souter nomina-
tion, I used these words to that nominee that are just as appropri-
ate today: I want someone to whom every American can look and
say, "There is a champion of my liberty." That should be true of
men and women, the old and the young, the able and the disabled,
                                          75

for people of every religion and color and national background and
station in life. This is an extremely high standard, but it is an ex-
tremely high court to which you aspire.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Brown.

  OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HANK BROWN, A U.S. SENATOR
                     FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO

  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, it is a pleasure for me to join with others on this
committee to welcome you here, along with your beautiful family. I
don't know how this committee will resolve the question before it
as to your judicial competence, but in terms of your ability to be an
excellent listener, I think you have already passed the test. I sus-
pect a further trial is ahead of you, though, in that regard.

  You have perhaps enjoyed so much your other four Senate con-
firmation process that you have been anxious to go ahead with a
fifth. You have come here before us a husband, as a father, as a
son, and a brother. I only hope at the end of this deliberation that
your family feels that you have had a full and a fair opportunity to
present your viewpoint. I think that is important for us to make
the right kind of decision.

  Mr. Chairman, as we consider Judge Thomas for the position of
the 106th Justice of our Supreme Court, we fulfill an important
constitutional duty. Over the course of the next several weeks, the
American people will have an opportunity to witness the three
branches of our Government coming together to fulfill those duties
and to chart the course for our judicial history in the future of this
Nation.

   I think it is important that we gather and do this job in a thor-
ough manner that has been laid out. We judge not only the nomi-
nee, but I think in some measure we judge ourselves as well.

  The American people are unique in the history of mankind. We
are unique in our commitment to individual and personal rights. It
is perhaps a phenomenon that the Constitution and its amend-
ments deal as much with preserving individual freedom from the
powers of Government as they deal with establishing the very
framework of that Government itself. That approach, that unique-
ness, says a great deal about us as Americans, and I think says a
great deal about what has made us so extraordinarily successful.

   I am one of those that believes it is appropriate for this commit-
tee to inquire into the judicial philosophy of the nominee. Mr.
Chairman, your own op-ed piece that appeared in the Washington
Post I thought was not only a very thoughtful work but one that
set forth many of the important questions that we ought to be deal-
ing with. But I also believe for us to request specific answers to po-
tential cases before the Court would be a great disservice to the
American people. It would be a disservice because I think all of us
would feel how wrong it would be to have a judge sit in judgment
of us when he has already made up his mind or pronounced a deci-
sion. A willingness to have an objective review of the facts in any
                                          76

case is at the very foundation of the American commitment to jus-
tice.

  I believe we ought to seek a Court committed to constitutional
principle. Our judges must be guardians of individual rights wheth-
er they agree with the cause or the issue or not. Their job is to
stand up and protect our rights, sometimes even for us to make
mistakes.

  I hope also, Judge Thomas, that you and the other judges who sit
on the Supreme Court will understand clearly and firmly that
amending the Constitution and legislating are not the province of
the Court, are not now and never should be the province of the
Court, but that these are reserved under our Constitution to others
and ultimately to the people that they serve.

  This committee has approved a number of judicial nominees who
I think could fairly be called judicial conservatives. Those approv-
als have come in recent years as a variety of nominees have come
before this committee.

  I am very concerned that, unlike Justice Souter and some other
nominations, special interest groups in our country have an-
nounced their decision on your nomination, have come out in oppo-
sition to your nomination, even before this committee has had a
chance to delve into the facts and the issues before it. This process
of sentencing someone before they have a trial I think is a bad
practice. It is a bad practice for members of this committee. It is a
bad practice for interest groups in our society. Frankly, it is a prac-
tice that I hope you, Judge Thomas, will never engage in.

  We must ask ourselves, I think, if Judge Thomas is to be held to
a different standard than that of Justice Souter or Justice Kennedy
or Justice Scalia or Justice O'Connor. I hope he will not be held to
a different standard. I hope the standards that ruled the delibera-
tions with regard to those Justices will be the same ones that we
use with regard to your nomination.

  In short, this committee should not prejudge Judge Thomas, as
unfortunately some have done already.

  Some discussion has already been laid before the committee with
regard to the qualifications and the judgment of the American Bar
Association. I believe it's important to have their determination of
the qualified status of Judge Thomas in the record because I think
the standard they use in determining if a judge is qualified I think
is so important. Here is that standard as presented by the Ameri-
can Bar Association: To merit the committee's evaluation of quali-
fied or well qualified for the Supreme Court, the nominee must be
in the top of the legal profession, have outstanding legal ability
and wide experience, and meet the highest standards of integrity,
professional competence, and judicial temperament.

  The question has already been raised in the opening statements
about your commitment to equal justice. In that regard, the Ameri-
can Bar Association has considered that. To quote from the Bar As-
sociation themselves, in investigating temperament the committee
considers, among other factors, the prospective nominee's compas-
sion, decisiveness, open-mindedness, sensitivity, courtesy, patience,
freedom from bias, and commitment to equal justice. I don't know
if anyone has ever accused the American Bar Association of being
the spokesman for President Bush. Far from it. But I believe the
                                          77

question of commitment to equal justice has been considered by the
American Bar Association and Judge Thomas found qualified.

  Mr. Chairman, it was 28 years ago that Martin Luther King
stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and gave a speech that
I believe helped shape the conscience of this Nation. He said, "I
have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a
nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but
by the content of their character."

  We are here to learn more about the judicial philosophy of Judge
Thomas. But I must say I am flatly and frankly impressed with the
personal background and the character of Judge Thomas. He
knows what it is like to work for a living. He understands what it
is like to truly help others. Throughout his life, he has rolled up
his own sleeves to help those in need. Whether serving breakfast to
disadvantaged children or tutoring school children, Clarence
Thomas has been there.

  He understands our legal system from a wide variety of experi-
ences, and I think that variety of experiences is important in
making a Justice of the Court. He has worked in a legal aid clinic
and practiced corporate law, from drafting legislation for the U.S.
Senate to hearing cases on the District of Columbia Circuit Court
of Appeals.

  Clarence Thomas brings to the Court an understanding of segre-
gation as one who has felt its oppression. He brings to the Court an
understanding of poverty as one who has experienced it firsthand.
And I believe he brings to the Court an understanding of the
American dream as one who has lived it.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                            OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BROWN

         Thank you, Mr.-Chairman. Judge Thomas, I am pleased to join
with my colleagues in welcoming you and your family here today.

         Four times before you have successfully appeared before the
Senate for confirmation for increasingly important positions of
trust within our government. I hope this week will end with you
feeling that you have had a full and fair opportunity to address
the questions asked of you.

         Mr. Chairman, today we consider Judge Thomas' qualifications
to become the 106th Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
In so doing, we fulfill our constitutional duties. Over the
course of the next several weeks, the American people will
witness the three branches of government meeting within the
corners of the constitution to chart the future of our country.

         We gather here not only in judgment of the nominee, but in
judgment of ourselves as guardians of the constitutional process.

        As a people we are unique in history in protecting the
rights of the individual. The very foundation of our social
compact - the Constitution and its Amendments - focus as much on
preserving individual freedom from government as it does in
establishing the framework for that government.

         It is appropriate for us to inquire into the judicial
philosophy of a nominee, but to demand rulings on cases yet to be
heard would be a disservice to the American people. How would
any of us feel about going before a judge who had prejudged the
issues in their case?

         We should seek a court committed to constitutional
principle. Our Justices must be guardians of the rights of
individuals whether they agree with their cause or not. Finally,
Supreme Court Judges must understand that amending the
Constitution and legislating are not the province of the Court.
Over the course of this hearing I hope to learn more about Judge
Thomas' judicial philosophy and his approach toward interpreting
the Constitution.

                        1
         This commjittee has approved several other judicial
conservatives ;in the past decade who have advocated judicial
restraint. In' those cases, the nominees were given a fair and
just opportunity to express their opinions and ideals.

         I am concerned that, unlike Justice David Souter's
nomination, several special interest groups announced their
opposition to Judge Thomas before the Senate and the country
could assemble a record upon which to fairly assess his
qualifications. This despite pledges from these groups to
conduct their reviews in the same manner as others had been
evaluated.
                                    79

         Is Judge Thomas being held to a different standard than that
of Justice Souter, Justice Kennedy, Justice Scalia and Justice
O'Connor? I hope not!

        This Committee should not prejudge Clarence Thomas, as some
have done.

         Dr. Martin Luther King stated on the steps of the Lincoln
Memorial, on a hot summer Washington day in August 1963,
"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in
a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their
skin, but by the content of their character."

        Mr. Chairman, I am impressed with the background and
character of Judge Thomas. He knows what it's like to work for a
living. He understands what it's like to truly help others.
Throughout his life he has rolled up his own sleeves to help
those in need. Whether serving breakfast to disadvantaged
children youth or tutoring school children, Clarence Thomas has
been there.

        He understands our legal system from a wide variety of
experiences: from working in a legal aid clinic to practicing
corporate law -- from drafting legislation for the U.S. Senate to
hearing cases on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of
Appeals.

         Clarence Thomas brings to the court an understanding of
segregation as one who has experienced its oppression. He brings
to the Court an understanding of poverty as one who has
experienced it first hand. And he brings to the Court an
understanding of the American dream as one who has lived it.

         Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HERBERT KOHL, A U.S. SENATOR
                     FROM THE STATE OF WISCONSIN

  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, the next few days are going to be important for
you, but they will be even more important for the American
people. On their behalf, we will be talking with you about basic
constitutional principles, which means we will be talking about the
values at the core of our country. If you are confirmed, this will be
the only such conversation the American people will ever have
with you. So we must make an extra effort, Judge Thomas, to get
to know you, and you must make an extra effort to help us do that.
  By design, we give the Supreme Court great independence. Its
members are unaccountable to the people and, absent severe dere-
liction of duty, unrecallable by the Congress. Members of the Court
sit for life, and they shape the life of this country. We give them
this freedom and independence because we expect them to remain
above the puil of politics and the flow of fashion.
  Justice Black put that point clearly when he observed, and I
quote, "Under our constitutional system, courts stand against any
ill winds that blow as havens of refuge for those who might other-
wise suffer because they are weak or helpless or outnumbered, or
because they are nonconforming victims of prejudice and public ex-
citement."
  Judge Thomas, you are 43 years old. If confirmed, you may serve
for 30 or 40 years, decades in which you will shape the nature of
our country. Before we decide whether to entrust you with this
power, we ask you to stand before the public and explain your
views, express our hopes, and expound on your approach to the
bedrock principles that guide us as a Nation. We have an obliga-
tion to find out where you will take us before we decide whether
we want you to lead us there.
  So as we begin this process, let me identify three of the qualifica-
tions which I believe we should look for in a Justice. First, we
should seek a nominee with exceptional character, and that you
clearly have. You grew up in poverty and experienced segregation.
Despite that, or perhaps because of it, you went on to Yale Law
School. You worked for and earned the support of one of the most
distinguished and demanding Members of the Senate, John Dan-
forth. You served as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, and you now sit on a Federal court of appeals.
  So yours, indeed, is a story we want to tell about America in the
20th century. It testifies to our achievements in creating opportuni-
ty for all from a social contract written for just a few.
  More than that, it is evidence of your own intelligence, dedica-
tion, and commitment. No one can read the story of your life and
your success and not be impressed. Nevertheless, as I am sure you
would agree, that alone does not justify your confirmation.
   Second, we should look for someone who can read the law and
relate it to the competing interests of American culture. We want a
nominee whose values reflect the diversity of American life, where
                                          81

the Constitution protects all of us, those who live in high-rise
condos and those who live in the depths of the tenements, those
who work for wages and those who retire on investment, those who
call for orthodoxy and those who champion revolution. All of these
strains of American life must be protected if we are to keep spin-
ning the fabric of renewal and regeneration which has clothed
American history for more than 200 years.

  Third, we want a nominee with an open mind but a firm sense of
direction. When you came before this committee last year, in re-
sponse to a question I asked you said, and I quote, that you did not
have "a fully developed constitutional philosophy." That did not
disqualify you for a seat on the court of appeals where you are re-
quired to follow precedent. But the Supreme Court sets precedent.
It interprets the Constitution in which we as a people place our
faith and on which our freedoms as a Nation rest. In my judgment,
if you cannot articulate a constitutional philosophy, one that in-
cludes full safeguards for individuals and minorities and that also
squares with your past statements, then in my judgment you are
not qualified to sic on the Supreme Court.

  I realize that is a strong requirement, Judge Thomas, but it is, I
believe, a fair one. So during these hearings, we will want to deter-
mine what your philosophy is. We will want to learn what you
really believe, and we will want to know how and when and why
you came to believe it.

  Let me give just a few examples of the themes running through
your speeches and writings which trouble me. You have openly
criticized decisions like Griswold and Roe which go to the heart of
a woman's right of choice. You have been an outspoken admirer of
natural law, a doctrine largely dismissed for the past half-century.
In fact, you have suggested that, and I quote, "it provides the only
firm basis for a just, wise, and constitutional decision."

  You have opposed nearly all forms of affirmative action, and yet
when we met in my office, you told me that you supported affirma-
tive action. And you have frequently expressed disdain for Con-
gress, its Members, and the legislative process, yet your oath as a
Federal judge requires that you faithfully execute our laws.

  Your own record raises serious questions. Since you have such
low esteem for Congress, how can you expect us to believe that you
will defer to congressional intent? And since you have criticized
past Court decisions about the right to privacy, what credence
should we give to your pledge to follow precedent in this area of
the law? And since you said that natural law is the only basis for
constitutional decisions, why wouldn't you overturn rulings which
you believe conflict with natural law principles?

  I am hopeful that you can resolve these and other questions to
our satisfaction, and, Judge Thomas, in order for you to do that,
you will need to be perfectly candid before this committee. When
you came to my office in July, you told me not to believe what I
had read about you; that we would see "the real Judge Thomas" at
the confirmation hearings. This statement suggests that you recog-
nize, as many of us do, that these proceedings are the only way the
country and the Congress will be able to assess your qualifications
and to determine your fitness to sit on our Nation's highest Court.
                                          82

  You can only help your cause by being forthcoming, so please
don't hedge, please don't give us answers prepared for you by
others, and don't hide behind the argument that you cannot pre-
judge issues.

  Judge Thomas, we do not have to agree with you on everything,
but we do have to be sure that you have firm beliefs and reasoned
conclusions about the role of the courts, the Congress, and the Con-
stitution. And we do have to be sure that what you say to this com-
mittee today comports with what you have said to others in the
past. And we do have to be sure, Judge Thomas, that we know
what is in your heart and what is in your mind before we decide
upon your nomination.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Kohl.
  Judge, that concludes the opening statements of the Senators. It
is now 12:30. As you and I discussed and as I have informed my
colleagues on the committee, let me briefly explain what will be
the way in which we will proceed after we break.
  We will shortly break for lVfe hours. We will reconvene at 2
o'clock, at which time the Senators who have requested the honor
of introducing you to the committee will come to the table at your
side, one at a time, and make their statements of introduction to
the committee. When those six Senators conclude their remarks, I
will then ask you to stand and be sworn.
  After that time, I will then ask you if you would be kind enough
to introduce your patient family who is sitting behind you for the
committee to be formally introduced to your family. Then we will
ask for an opening statement from you.
  At the conclusion of your opening statement, I will begin ques-
tioning. Each Senator will have a 30-minute dialog with you.
  There is a very important meeting in the Senate today that will
take place, as we have discussed with you and your staff. We will
break every day around 5 o'clock but there is a very important
meeting today in the Senate. One of our Members, a very beloved
member, Senator Pryor, who was almost fatally stricken with a
heart attack, has returned and is in good health. There is a recep-
tion for him, which you are welcome to attend if you would like.
You know so many of us so well.
  The Senator asked the time and place. The time is 5 or 5:30.1 am
not certain. It will depend on how far along we are whether or not
one of the members begins his questioning. If it takes us much
beyond 5 o'clock, we will not begin, and we will conclude before
5:00.
  So, again, the committee will recess until 2 p.m.
  [Whereupon, at 12:30 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 2 p.m., the same day.]

                                           AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will please come to order.
  Welcome back, Judge, and I say welcome to all our colleagues
who are here to introduce you.
  Judge, it has been a very difficult task for the Chair to decide
which of the 74 Senators you have introducing you should go first,
                                          83

so we decided we would start based on the State you were born in,
and we would work our way from there. And so we will begin by
welcoming the Senators from Georgia: our senior Senator, Senator
Nunn, and Senator Fowler. We will yield the floor now to the dis-
tinguished Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn.

   STATEMENT OF HON. SAM NUNN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE
                              STATE OF GEORGIA

  Senator NUNN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to appear before your committee
today to introduce to you my fellow Georgian, Judge Clarence
Thomas. If confirmed, Judge Thomas will become the fifth native
Georgian to serve on the Supreme Court and, according to my read-
ing of history, the first Georgian in over 75 years.
  As most Americans now know from hearing the inspiring story
of his life, Clarence Thomas was born in the small community of
Pin Point, GA, and was raised by his mother and his grandparents.
He attended school in the nearby city of Savannah, where he expe-
rienced both the exhilaration of academic accomplishment and the
pain of racial discrimination and economic hardship. While he pur-
sued higher education outside the South at Holy Cross and Yale
and pursued his profession of law in Missouri and here in Washing-
ton, Judge Thomas' roots remain in Georgia.
  Mr. Chairman, I know this committee will be placed under great
pressure from those opposing and those supporting this nomina-
tion. Many advocacy groups tend to focus narrowly on the nomi-
nee's likely vote on upcoming cases affecting their primary cause
or causes. Some organizations complain that Judge Thomas has not
generated a sufficient "paper trail" of judicial decisions and law
review articles to enable them to determine with certainty how he
will vote on a particular issue that captures their full attention.
Others piece together details of his education and his personal life
and speculate as to his likely vote on complex and complicated con-
stitutional issues.
   Mr. Chairman, I confess, in introducing Judge Thomas, that I do
not know how he will vote on a reconsideration of Roe v. Wade or
on other constitutional decisions that may soon come before the
Court, nor do his opponents or supporters. I expect that Judge
Thomas will not himself make such decisions until the case or
cases are before the Court, the arguments have been heard, and he
has had an opportunity to study the issues in considerable detail.
   A narrow perspective is understandable for those who focus on
only one or two issues, but I believe that those of us who have the
constitutional responsibility of advice and consent must take a
much broader view. Our duty is not to create or deny another vote
on abortion or sex discrimination or affirmative action, or any
other particular issue. Our duty, as I see it, is to confirm a Su-
preme Court Justice who, subject to good behavior, under the Con-
stitution may serve for many years on the Court--indeed, may
serve for life.
   I doubt seriously, Mr. Chairman, that many of today's, maybe
most of today's burning issues will still be raising the blood pres-
sure of our Nation 7 years from now when Judge Thomas is 50,
                                              84

much less when he reaches the still relatively young judicial age of
60. While our Constitution is a source of great stability for our
Nation, our constitutional law is not immune from the incredible
pace of change that is affecting so many aspects of our public as
well as our private lives.

   With the literal explosion of computers and information technol-
ogy, biotechnology and genetic engineering, medical science and
medical technology, the cases Judge Thomas will face in applying
such constitutional concepts as privacy, human rights, equal pro-
tection, and due process may not be those envisioned today, or even
those that we can imagine today.

  On these and many other issues which we can barely glimpse on
the horizon, even full-time professors of constitutional law do not
have a completely settled view.

  When all is said and done, Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee, I believe that the Senate should vote on Clarence
Thomas' nomination not based on his position on any one or two or
three issues, but first on his ability to reason clearly, to reason
fairly, and to reason wisely, as reflected in his answers to your
questions which will be propounded before this committee; and
second on his character, as indicated by his background, his values,
his life experience, and the judgment of those who know him best.

   Mr. Chairman, I hope that this committee and the Senate will
take the long view of this nomination and the long view of the role
that this 43-year-old nominee will play on the Supreme Court for
years to come if he is confirmed.

  Those who know Clarence Thomas best--and I have talked to
many of them--make a powerful case as to his values, his legal and
judicial abilities, his integrity, and his determination.

   I am certain that some will judge Clarence Thomas by trying to
pin him down on some fixed point of the ideological spectrum. I
hope, however, that the majority of this committee and the majori-
ty of the U.S. Senate will vote on our perception of his character,
his judicial abilities, his independence, and, most importantly, his
willingness to learn and develop from experience and from reflec-
tion.

   Mr. Chairman, I introduce Clarence Thomas with pride, in part
because he was born in Georgia, spent his childhood in Georgia,
graduated from high school in Georgia, practiced law in Georgia,
and has family and many friends in Georgia.

   Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, Clarence Thomas
has climbed many jagged mountains on the road from Pin Point,
GA, to this Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe that if he is con-
firmed, Judge Thomas will remember his own climb and will
always insist on fairness and equal justice under law for those who
are still climbing.

   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to introduce to this committee Judge
Clarence Thomas, a native of the State of Georgia.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Nunn.
   Senator Fowler.

    STATEMENT OF HON. WYCHE FOWLER, JR., A U.S. SENATOR
                      FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA

  Senator FOWLER. Mr. Chairman, I certainly join in the pride of
my senior colleague that a Georgian has been nominated for the
highest judicial office in the land. In fact, I cannot think of a time
of similar pride both for myself and for Georgians, except for the
nomination of Georgian Martin Luther King, Jr., for the Nobel
Peace Prize.

  As Senator Nunn has said, we have had visits and trips, and
there is remarkable enthusiasm, not the least because Judge
Thomas has already succeeded not only in putting Pin Point, GA,
on the map, but so swelled their breasts with pride that they are
seeking to annex Savannah and Hinesville and half of the Georgia
coast.

  The second reason, though, and far more important in joining in
this introduction is that it means that political speculation about
this nominee should be over. It is now through your offices, the
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, that we can begin the
thorough examination of the nominee and his beliefs that the Con-
stitution requires of us.

  Judge Thomas has already shown himself to be a man who has
broken many molds and defied many labels. It seems to me that we
have no less an obligation, a constitutional obligation, to not
submit ourselves to easy categorization as we fulfill our constitu-
tional obligations which I believe Judge Thomas would agree with
were he in your position.

  I know that you and members of the committee all join me in
putting some of the unsavory political campaigning that has gone
on behind us. That has been at the least a rude distraction both to
the constitutional process and to Judge Thomas' nomination. Now
we can get on to the real responsibilities of the Senate confirma-
tion process.

  Judge Thomas is perfectly able to express himself, present his
case. I know he will do it, and the American people deserve the
thorough examination of those views before a decision is made.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Gentlemen, I know you have other obligations. We appreciate
your taking the time to come and introduce Georgia's native son.
  Now we will hear from the Senators who are going to introduce
Virginia's adopted son. We will begin, as we have a wont to do here
in the Senate, in order of seniority and begin with the distin-
guished senior Senator from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Sena-
tor Warner.

  STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN W. WARNER, A U.S. SENATOR FROM
                           THE STATE OF VIRGINIA

  Senator WARNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee. Like our Georgia colleagues, Senator Robb and I like-
wise consider it a privilege to appear here today on behalf of Judge
Thomas and, in a way, on behalf of the constituents we represent
in the Commonwealth of Virginia.

  Mr. Chairman, I would like to have my statement inserted in the
record in full. I want to be brief.
                                          86

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, your entire statement will be
placed in the record as if read.

  Senator WARNER. I will be brief such that we can move along
with these proceedings.

  I wish to acknowledge that my personal preparation for this
hearing has been a very valuable learning experience for me. I
have traveled

  The CHAIRMAN. I know what you mean, Senator.
  Senator WARNER. It is not over for you yet, Mr. Chairman.
  I have traveled throughout my State, finishing yesterday the last
of some 14 meetings, most of these meetings dominated by minority
individuals, minority background. And I listened and learned very
carefully, I say to my colleagues. It was a profitable experience.
  This procedure we are undertaking now, mandated by the Consti-
tution under the advise-and-consent clause, will, I hope, end up in
two ways: First, I say to you, my friend, Judge Thomas, most re-
spectfully, I hope that it is a learning experience for you and that
you emerge from this a stronger, a wiser, and a more compassion-
ate person; and, secondly, that these hearings and the floor debate
and the final vote will be perceived by citizens across our land as
being fair and objective, and that that will constitute a record and
indicate support for this fine American to go forward and take on
his responsibilities with great unity across our country.
  The hearing has the opportunity to dispel a number of concerns
that were voiced to me by conscientious individuals, but we have
that opportunity as Senators in this free and deliberative process
to dispel those concerns.
  This is a very interesting nomination in the sense that the U.S.
Senate has already acted in confirming Judge Thomas as a Federal
Circuit Court judge. We rendered our judgment. Therefore, we are
being examined. And to the extent that some of us may wish to re-
examine that, I say to you most respectfully, you have a very
heavy, if not the highest, of burdens of proof. The burden of proof
has shifted to the Senate since we have already spoken on behalf of
the credentials of this man.
  It is for those reasons that, again, I conclude by saying that I
hope these Senate proceedings will be perceived and accepted as
fair and objective, and that the final conclusion, which I hope will
be confirmation, will be in the best interest of our United States.
  I thank you.

             BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

                          ON THE NOMINATION OF
                             CLARENCE THOMAS AS

ASSOCIATE JUSTICE TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
                             SEPTEMBER 10, 1991

        Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am pleased to
join my colleagues from Georgia, Missouri and Senator Robb in
introducing Judge Clarence Thomas, who has been nominated to be
an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

        Judge Thomas and his family now reside in Northern Virginia.
Judge Thomas serves on the United States Circuit Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia.

        Clarence Thomas' career, now known to Americans, has been
varied and extensive. He has held jobs ranging from legislative
assistant for Senator Danforth to Chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). At this time I will
not dwell on the details of his impressive professional
background, which have been fully covered by members of this
committee in their opening statements today.

         I do, however, wish to make a fewcomments regarding Judge
Thomas' early life, as the values I hope he will bring to the
Supreme Court, if confirmed, are a direct reflection of his
background -- a background of which he speaks to me with pride.
                                88

                                                      -2-
   Clarence Thomas was raised in a poor, segregated environment in
a small town in Georgia. His grandfather, a strong, self
educated man who was determined that his grandson would have more
opportunities than he himself had experienced, firmly instilled
in Clarence the virtues of hard work, diligence, tenacity, and
religious values. Most importantly, he impressed upon him that
he should not use the circumstances of his upbringing as an
excuse for not striving to achieve excellence in his own goals.

        Judge Thomas further expresses with humility and gratitude
the support given by religious teachers throughout his lifetime.
Judge Thomas has truly experienced poverty, prejudice and racism
in his lifetime, but, true to those who have inspired him, he has
set his own goals.

        Mr. Chairman, I believe Clarence Thomas has the education,
character, experience and temperament to serve as a member of the
Supreme Court, and I am pleased to have had the opportunity to
present him to the Committee.

        Mr. Chairman, my preparation for this hearing has been a
rewarding experience. I have travelled throughout my state
listening to a diverse cross section of Virginians. They have
freely, forcefully expressed their views for and against this
nomination. It has been a learning experience for me.

         It is my hope that this "advise and consent" procedure,
mandated by the Constitution will conclude in such a manner that,
first, Judge Thomas will become a stronger and wiser person; and
second, that many of the concerns that exist today about him
                               89

                                                     -3-
will, by the time the floor debate is concluded and the final
vote taken, be resolved.

        Despite the conscientious efforts over the years of the
Executive and Legislative branches of our government, the
judicial branch is viewed by minority groups as the strongest
bastion against racism and discrimination.

        It is for that reason that I hope these Senate proceedings
will be perceived as fair, objective, and having reached a
conclusion in the best interest of our Nation.

        We, the Senate, are also being judged in this confirmation
process. For we, as a body, have already exercised our
Constitutional responsibility by confirming Judge Thomas as
qualified to become a member of the federal judiciary. To now
reverse that finding would impose on this body a burden of proof
of the highest magnitude.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator Robb, welcome.

 STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES S. ROBB, A U.S. SENATOR FROM
                           THE STATE OF VIRGINIA

  Senator ROBB. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond,
other members of the Judiciary Committee.

  As a Virginian, Senator Warner and I are frequently extended
the courtesy of introducing for Senate confirmation residents of our
State that the President has nominated to high level positions in
the Federal Government, notwithstanding the fact that in most
cases they have burnished their credentials while bearing true
faith and allegiance to a political party other than the one that at
least I happen to represent. In that capacity, I was pleased to intro-
duce Judge Thomas when he was nominated to his current judge-
ship with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit.

  Recognizing the importance of a lifetime appointment to the
highest Court in our land, however, and the prospect that, if con-
firmed Associate Justice of the Supreme Court at his age, he could
well serve for 30 years or more, I don't suggest that any prior ex-
amination of his credentials ought to substitute for the thorough
examination you are about to begin or that our prior vote to con-
firm Judge Thomas ought to obligate us necessarily to confirm Jus-
tice Thomas.

  Therefore, like most of our Senate colleagues, I am going to with-
hold final judgment until these confirmation hearings have been
completed and your committee has acted. I would be less than
candid, though, if I didn't observe at the outset that I have had two
very good meetings in my office with Judge Thomas, one for each
of his nominations, and I am very much impressed with the way he
has dealt with the challenges that he has faced. I am impressed
with his life story and the way he has persevered against the odds.
I am impressed by the way he has thought about the way society
works--and doesn't work--and I am impressed by his sense of con-
viction about the ideas and principles in which he believes.

  I care deeply about the issues most often cited by those individ-
uals and organizations that have announced their opposition to
Judge Thomas. And because I am more often aligned with them
than against them, I simply ask that they join me in withholding
final judgment until they have actually heard Judge Thomas re-
spond to direct questions about those issues which concern all of
us.

  I believe based on my own conversations with him that he will
respond to many of those questions and concerns in ways that will
be far more reassuring than inferences that have been drawn
solely from fragmented comments and speeches where the ques-
tions have not been squarely joined.

  In short, I find Judge Thomas more difficult to stereotype than
his public image might suggest, and I believe almost everyone will
discover a few surprises during the confirmation process.

  Mr. Chairman, you have an important responsibility to fulfill,
and I wish you well.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, gentlemen.
  Now, we will move west of the Mississippi, to a State in which
our distinguished nominee has worked and has friends, and one of
his friends is the junior Senator from the State of Missouri, Sena-
tor Bond.
  Senator Bond, welcome. We are very anxious to hear what you
have to say.

  STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTOPHER S. BOND, A U.S. SENATOR
                      FROM THE STATE OF MISSOURI

  Senator BOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and mem-
bers of the committee.

  It is a great honor and a pleasure for me to come before this
committee today to join in the multifaceted presentation of Judge
Clarence Thomas, the President's nominee for Associate Justice to
the United States Supreme Court.

  Coming from Missouri, I have to make a major effort to claim
him for the State of Missouri, but we do so with a great deal of
pride.

  I had the real pleasure first of meeting Judge Thomas when we
both worked in Jefferson City, MO, in the early 1970's. Both of us
began our career in State government as assistants attorney gener-
al under Jack Danforth. It was an exciting and intellectually chal-
lenging place for a young lawyer to work. The outstanding caliber
of the other people that Jack Danforth brought to that office is best
illustrated by the jobs that some of them now hold--Federal judges,
Chairman of the FCC, and we hope soon a Supreme Court Justice.

   Even among a cast of stars like that, Clarence Thomas shone as
a lawyer. He was not content simply to move cases through the
office, but, instead, worked to use his position to accomplish change
and to improve the lives of people in our State.

   His legal work and his intellect were noticed, not just by Jack
Danforth, but by many others, as well. When Jack was elected to
the Senate, Clarence Thomas came to Washington and applied his
skills to a series of jobs, ranging from corporate lawyer to the
Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
giving him the opportunity to learn firsthand about a wider range
of legal areas than most recent nominees to the Court.

   I say, Mr. Chairman, that if you look at the group of people who
know Clarence Thomas best, you will find his most ardent support-
ers. I only hope that those who do not know him as well as we do
may have the opportunity during the course of these hearings to
gain the knowledge and the respect that we have.

   Though his skills as a lawyer and a judge are obvious, they are
not, in my view, the only reason that this committee should vote to
approve Judge Thomas' nomination. Just as important is his com-
passion and understanding of the impact that the Supreme Court
has on the lives of average Americans.

   We are all familiar with Judge Thomas' background as outlined
by our distinguished colleague from Georgia. It is an inspiring
story. There is no doubt that he can be proud of his achievements.

   But it is also important to focus on his continuing efforts
throughout his life to live up to the values and principles that his

        56-270 0--93-
                                          92

grandfather instilled in him, which I know were strengthened by
the many years he spent living in Missouri. The strength of charac-
ter is every bit as important as his professional qualifications, and
I urge you to consider it as you proceed with these hearings.

  Mr. Chairman, there have been many accusations and straw men
raised over the course of the past few months. Unfortunately, that
has become a part of the nomination process. Though we cannot
stop people from voicing their opinion or attacking a nominee or
even members of the committee, unfair or groundless as the at-
tacks may be, we can disregard those charges and focus on the im-
portant details, the nominee's fitness for the job.

  I urge the members of the committee to do just that. I know that
when they do, they will find Judge Thomas to be well qualified to
serve as the newest member of the United States Supreme Court.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                                                    9/10/91

        Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, it is a great pleasure
to come before you today to join in the presentation of Judge
Clarence Thomas, the President's nominee for Associate Justice of
the United States Supreme Court.

         I first met Judge Thomas when we both worked in Jefferson City
in the early 70s. Both of us began our careers in state government
as assistant attorneys general under Jack Danforth. It was an
exciting and intellectually challenging place for a young lawyer to
work; and the outstanding caliber of peoDle that Jack Danfcrth
brought to that office is best illustrated by the jobs that some of
them now hold -- federal judge, chairman of the FCC, and soon,
Supreme Court justice.

         Even amonq such a cast nf stars, Clarcr.ca Thomas shone as a
lawyer. He was not content to simply move cases through the
office, but instead worked to use his position to accomplish change
and to improve the lives of people in our state. His legal skills
and his intellect were noticed not just by Jack Danforth, but by
many others as well. When Jack was elected to the Senate in 1976,
Judge Thomas applied his skills to a series of jobs ranging from
corporate lawyer to chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission -- giving him the opportunity to learn firsthand about a
wider range of legal areas than most recent nominees to the court.
                                       94

        Though his skills as a lawyer and a judge are obvious, they
are not the only reason that this committee should vote to approve
Judge Thomas' nomination. Just as important is his compassion and
understanding of the impact that the Supreme Court has on the lives
of average Americans. We are all familiar with Judge Thomas'
background -- it is an inspiring story, and there is no doubt that
he can be proud of his achievements· But it is also important to
focus on his continuing efforts throughout his life to live up to
the values and principles that his grandfather instilled in him --
and which I know were strengthened by the many years he spent
living in Missouri. This strength of character is every bit as
important as his professional qualifications, and I urge you to '"!"
consider it as you proceed with these hearings.

        Mr. Chairman, there have been many accusations and straw men
raised over the course of the past few months. Unfortunately, that
has become part of the nomination process. Though we cannot stop
people from voicing their opinion or attacking a nominee -- unfair
or groundless as those attacks may be -- we can disregard such
charges and focus on the important details -- the nominee's fitness
for the job. I urge the members of the committee to do that and I
know that when they do, they will find Judge Thomas to be
well-qualified to serve as the newest member of the United States
Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  I might add, Judge Thomas, I had the occasion to spend about 7
or 8 days with the junior Senator from Missouri in the month of
August, and when he was not lobbying me on matters relating to
the North Slope and others, he was lobbying me with regard to
you. You are probably the only Supreme Court Justice nominee
who has ever been discussed on the North Slope of Alaska in the
middle of nowhere. [Laughter.]
  Everyone was talking about the precedents being set, Judge
Thomas. I do not know whether or not we should call this the
Rudman precedent or not, but you have one of the strongest and
most ardent supporters, I suspect you have anywhere, including
your mother and your wife and your son and your sister, in the
person of the senior Senator from Missouri.
  We are all supposed to be limited to 10 minutes. I want you to
know at the outset that I have no illusion that this is going to be a
10-minute introduction. [Laughter.]
  For my respect for our colleague from the State of Missouri, I
will do what the former chairman of this committee, Senator East-
land used to do. He would say we have to end this meeting at 2:00
o'clock or we are not able to meet beyond that time. Some would
say, "I notice it is 2:00 o'clock, Mr. Chairman," and he would turn
around and open up the face of the clock and turn the clock back
and say, "It doesn't look like 2:00 to me." [Laughter.]
  So, we will invoke the rule of the former chairman of this com-
mittee. Jack, try to keep it under an hour, if you can. [Laughter.]
  Senator DANFORTH. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. I am
sorry that the North Slope gambit did not occur to me during the
hearing.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I assume you put your junior colleague up
to it.

STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN C. DANFORTH, A U.S. SENATOR FROM
                           THE STATE OF MISSOURI

   Senator DANFORTH. Mr. Chairman and members of the commit-
tee, other than the nominee himself, I know Clarence Thomas
better than anyone who will appear before this committee. I hired
him 17 years ago, when he was a law student. He worked for me
twice, as an assistant State attorney general and as a legislative as-
sistant, and we have kept in touch since he left my office.

   His life story is public knowledge, and I will not review it for
you. Instead, this will be a personal testimony about the Clarence
Thomas I know, and a reflection on the case that is being made by
various groups that oppose his confirmation.

   Let me begin with the most fundamental points. Clarence
Thomas is intelligent, hard-working, honest, and fair. Because
these are the minimum qualifications we expect of a nominee for
any position, I will not dwell on them. It is enough to assure the
committee on the basis of personal knowledge that Clarence
Thomas possesses each of these requisites to serve on the Supreme
Court.

   As the ABA will testify, he is certainly qualified for the job. But
he has more than these fundamentals. The Clarence Thomas I
                                          96

know has special qualities which convince me that he is more than
the average nominee. He would be an extraordinary Justice on the
Supreme Court.

  What are these special qualities? First, Clarence Thomas is his
own person. President Bush had it absolutely right when he called
him "fiercely independent." This quality struck me when I first
interviewed him in the faculty lounge at Yale Law School. Clar-
ence made it clear that he was his own person, to be judged on his
own merits. He was not to be the special case, given special treat-
ment, and he was not to be given special work within my office. He
was uniquely Clarence Thomas, and his goal was to be the best
Clarence Thomas he could possibly be. He has reached that goal,
and that to me is his most striking attribute.

  Repeatedly, he has said that, as a judge, he has no personal
agenda and that he will call them as he sees them. That pledge is a
function of his independence and it is completely consistent with
the Clarence Thomas I know. It is consistent with the young assist-
ant attorney general who, to my political dismay, insisted that my
constituents had no legal right to keep their low-numbered license
plates. It is consistent with the Chairman of the EEOC, who excori-
ated his own administration for favoring tax-exempt status for a
racially exclusive college, and for opposing extension of the Voting
Rights Act.

  I have no doubt whatever in giving the committee this assurance:
Just as Clarence will resist any effort to impinge on his independ-
ence by seeking commitments on how he will decide cases before
the Court, so he will never become a sure vote for any group of
Justices on the Court.

  For 2 months, I have noted with wonder the certainty of various
interest groups, as they have predicted how the nominee would
vote on an array of issues. They do not know Clarence Thomas. I
do. I cannot predict how he would vote on any issue. He is his own
person. That is my first point.

  Second, he laughs. To some, this may seem a trivial matter. To
me, it is important, because laughter is the antidote to that dread
disease "federalitis." The obvious strategy of interest groups trying
to defeat a Supreme Court nominee is to suggest that there is
something weird about the individual. I concede that there is some-
thing weird about Clarence Thomas, it is his laugh. It is the loudest
laugh I have ever heard. It comes from deep inside and it shakes
his body, and here is something at least as weird in this most up-
tight of cities, the object of his laughter is most often himself.

  Third, he is serious, deeply serious in his commitment to make a
contribution with his life. I will never forget visiting with Clarence
after he had been nominated for a second term at the EEOC. I
pressed him on why he would accept a second term. It is a thank-
less job, one that, when done well, makes everyone mad. It is a
career blind alley. He answered simply, "I haven't yet finished the
job."

  I pondered that statement many times over the past 5 years. Un-
doubtedly, he meant that he had not yet finished the job of trans-
forming the EEOC from the administration basket case he inherit-
ed to the first-rate agency it is today. But I think he meant more
than that. I think he meant the discrimination he has known in
                                          97

his own life is still too much with us. There is so much more to do,
if we are to end it.

  This is the seriousness of Clarence Thomas. It is not anger, as
some have suggested. It is not a bitterness that eats away at him,
but it is profound and it forms the person that he is and the Jus-
tice he will become.

  I hope that sometime in the days Judge Thomas will be before
this committee, someone will ask him not about unenumerated
rights or the establishment clause, but about himself, what was it
like to grow up under segregation, what was it like to be there
when your grandfather was humiliated before your eyes, what was
it like to be laughed at by seminarians because you are black.

  Everyone in the Senate knows something about the legal issues
before the Supreme Court. Not a single member of the Senate
knows what Clarence Thomas knows about being poor and black in
America.

  For more than 2 months, interest groups have been poring over
the volume of speeches made by the nominee, looking for the word
here or phrase there that could be used against him. I hope all of
us will read some of his speeches in their entirety. They are elo-
quent statements of his deep commitment to justice in America. It
is better to read the whole speech, but if we are piercing together
sayings, here is my compendium of the words of Clarence Thomas.

  He said--and these are his words--"What is more amoral than
the enslavement of an entire race? What is more amoral than the
vicious cancer of racial discrimination? What is more amoral than
the fabrication of a legal and political system which excludes, de-
means and degrades an entire race?"

  He said, "Discrimination holds out a different life for those who
do not happen to be the right race or the right sex. It is a world in
which the have's continue to reap more dividends than the have-
not's, and the powerful wield more influence than the powerless."

  He said, "It exists in the factories and the plants and the corpo-
rate board rooms, it makes a lie of our pledge of freedom. It is the
great fault that sends tremors through the bedrock of our nation-
hood."

  He said, "I never understood the logic behind the division of
labor that decreed that women be restricted to certain jobs, such
waste of talent, such infringement of individual rights."

  He said, "Today, the civil rights law often appear to be without
teeth to insure nondiscrimination." He said, "There is something
less than equitable about a system that subjects an individual to
stronger sanctions for breaking into a mailbox than for violating
the basic civil rights of another human being."

  Those are the words of Clarence Thomas. Name one other
member of the Supreme Court that talks like that. Name one other
person who could conceivably be nominated by President Bush who
talks like that.

  The obvious question is: Why do some civil rights leaders, good
people, oppose the nominee with such a strong commitment to
equality? The answer lies in a major debate now taking place in
America which divides good people, who share a common commit-
ment to equal justice.
                                          98

  With respect to the black community, William Raspberry has de-
scribed the debate as follows: "At issue is whether it is wiser to
pursue government policies that target blacks generally--contract
set-asides, affirmative action, hiring and promotion, race-based spe-
cial admissions, and so on--or to fashion approaches based on spe-
cific social, educational and economic conditions."

  "Over-simplified," Raspberry continues, "the two opposing propo-
sitions can be stated this way: One, race-specific approaches; two,
approaches that target the conditions, joblessness, drug abuse,
family dissolution, and under-education."

  Before becoming a judge, while he was in the executive branch,
Clarence Thomas was a leading advocate for one side of this
debate. At that time, he argued that race-based preferences are not
helpful to the most disadvantaged citizens, that they stigmatize
and sometimes even victimize the beneficiary, and that they create
destructive animosity among unfavorite citizens. In their place, he
advocated affirmative action based on disadvantage, rather than
race, with special emphasis on education and job training, coupled
with strict enforcement and tough penalties in cases of specific dis-
crimination.

  I do not understand why the nomination of a Supreme Court Jus-
tice should be the occasion for arguing the best political strategy
for advancing the cause of civil rights. Whether one strongly sup-
ports or strongly opposes race-based preferences should not trigger
an attack on the person's motives or fitness to serve on the Court.

  Nearly a third of black families are now living in poverty.
Nearly a third of young black men do not have jobs. The average
income of blacks is not much more than half that of whites.
Against this background, we should welcome, not penalize a diver-
sity of opinion on solving the problem of inequality. We should wel-
come a diversity of opinion among blacks as well as whites.

  If support for race-based preferences becomes a litmus test for
the Supreme Court, that test would rule out a majority of the
American people and a majority of the Members of the Senate, as
well.

  Mr. Chairman, throughout this process, you and all members of
this committee have been characteristically considerate and fair to
the nominee. I join him in thanking you for your kindness. I am
convinced that, like the President, you will not judge Clarence
Thomas on the basis of litmus tests, you will judge him on the
basis of his ability and character and the special qualities he would
bring to the Court.

  It is a proud day in my life to present for the Supreme Court a
person I know so well and believe in so strongly.

of the American people and a majority of the members of the
Senate as well.

        Mr. Chairman, throughout this process, you and all
members of this Committee have been characteristically
considerate and fair to the nominee. I join him in thanking you
for your kindness. I am convinced that, like the President, you
will not judge Clarence Thomas on the basis of litmus tests.
You will judge him on the basis of his ability and character and
the special qualities he would bring to the Court.

        It is a proud day in my life to present for the Supreme
Court a person I know so well and believe in so strongly.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Danforth. I know
the nominee knows how fortunate he is to have a friend like you.

  While you are on your feet, Judge, we will swear you.
  Senator DANFORTH. Can you still see the nominee, Mr. Chair-
man? [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, while we are just passing some time here,
I just want you to know up until a few nominees ago this is what
you would have faced the entire time of your questioning. They are
all gentle souls, but they are anxious to see you, and we agreed
that we would do this so they could have you sworn in.
  Judge Thomas, do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
  Judge THOMAS. I do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Please be seated.
  [Pause.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, Jack Danforth said--talked about
what is at issue. I want to make it clear at the outset of my ques-
tioning that there is a great deal more at issue than whether or
not your view on how to deal with the civil rights of Americans de-
viates from the view of any single group of people.
  I beg your pardon?
  So I would now like to invite you to--having been sworn, to, if
you would, please introduce your family to us, who have been wait-
ing patiently all morning and the committee is anxious to meet
them, as I am sure everyone else is. So, would you please introduce
your family to us, Judge?
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like first to introduce my wife Virginia.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome, Mrs. Thomas. It is a pleasure to have
you here.
  Judge THOMAS. My mother, Leola Williams; my sister, Emma
May Martin; and my son Jamal.
  The CHAIRMAN. Jamal, welcome. You look so much like your
father that probably at a break you would be able to come back in
and sit in there and answer questions. So, if he is not doing it the
way you want it done, you just slide in that chair.
  Judge THOMAS. He may not take it as a compliment if you say he
looks like me.
   The CHAIRMAN. He is young. He has a chance to grow out of it,
as my father says about my sons.
  Judge THOMAS. I would like to also introduce my mother-in-law
and father-in-law, Donald and Marjorie Lamp, who are in the audi-
ence here.
   The CHAIRMAN. Would you please stand, Mr. and Mrs. Lamp.
Welcome to the hearing. Thank you very much for coming.
   Do you have an opening statement, Judge?
   Judge THOMAS. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Please.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. CLARENCE THOMAS, OF GEORGIA, TO BE
          ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

   Judge THOMAS. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurman, members of
the committee, I am humbled and honored to have been nominated
                                         108

by President Bush to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States. I would like to thank the committee, especial-
ly you, Chairman Biden, for your extraordinary fairness through-
out this process, and I would like to thank each of you and so many
of your colleagues here in the Senate for taking the time to visit
with me.

  There are not enough words to express my deep gratitude and
appreciation to Senator Danforth, who gave me my first job out of
Yale Law School. I have never forgotten the terms of his offer to
me: more work for less pay than anyone in the country could offer.
Believe me, he delivered on his promise, especially the less pay.

  I appreciate his wise counsel and his example over the years, and
his tireless efforts on my behalf during the confirmation process.

  And I would like to thank Senators Bond, Nunn, Fowler,
Warner, and Robb, for taking the time to introduce me today.

  Much has been written about my family and me over the past 10
weeks. Through all that has happened throughout our lives and
through all adversity, we have grown closer and our love for each
other has grown stronger and deeper. I hope these hearings will
help to show more clearly who this person Clarence Thomas is and
what really makes me tick.

  My earliest memories, as alluded to earlier, are those of Pin
Point, GA, a life far removed in space and time from this room,
this day and this moment. As kids, we caught minnows in the
creeks, fiddler crabs in the marshes, we played with pluffers, and
skipped shells across the water. It was a world so vastly different
from all this.

  In 1955, my brother and I went to live with my mother in Savan-
nah. We lived in one room in a tenement. We shared a kitchen
with other tenants and we had a common bathroom in the back-
yard which was unworkable and unusable. It was hard, but it was
all we had and all there was.

  Our mother only earned $20 every 2 weeks as a maid, not
enough to take care of us. So she arranged for us to live with our
grandparents later, in 1955. Imagine, if you will, two little boys
with all their belongings in two grocery bags.

  Our grandparents were two great and wonderful people who
loved us dearly. I wish they were sitting here today. Sitting here so
they could see that all their efforts, their hard work were not in
vain, and so that they could see that hard work and strong values
can make for a better life.

  I am grateful that my mother and my sister could be here. Un-
fortunately, my brother could not be.

  I attended segregated parochial schools and later attended a sem-
inary near Savannah. The nuns gave us hope and belief in our-
selves when society didn't. They reinforced the importance of reli-
gious beliefs in our personal lives. Sister Mary Virgilius, my eighth
grade teacher, and the other nuns were unyielding in their expec-
tations that we use all of our talents no matter what the rest of the
world said or did.

  After high school, I left Savannah and attended Immaculate Con-
ception Seminary, then Holy Cross College. I attended Yale Law
School. Yale had opened its doors, its heart, its conscience to re-
cruit and admit minority students. I benefited from this effort.
                                         109

  My career has been delineated today. I was an assistant attorney
general in the State of Missouri. I was an attorney in the corporate
law department of Monsanto Co. I joined Senator Danforth's staff
here in the Senate, was an Assistant Secretary in the Department
of Education, Chairman of EEOC, and since 1990 a judge on the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

  But for the efforts of so many others who have gone before me, I
would not be here today. It would be unimaginable. Only by stand-
ing on their shoulders could I be here. At each turn in my life,
each obstacle confronted, each fork in the road someone came
along to help.

  I remember, for example, in 1974 after I completed law school I
had no money, no place to live. Mrs. Margaret Bush Wilson, who
would later become chairperson of the NAACP, allowed me to live
at her house. She provided me not only with room and board, but
advice, counsel and guidance.

  As I left her house that summer, I asked her, "How much do I
owe you?" Her response was, "Just along the way help someone
who is in your position." I have tried to live by my promise to her
to do just that, to help others.

  So many others gave their lives, their blood, their talents. But
for them I would not be here. Justice Marshall, whose seat I have
been nominated to fill, is one of those who had the courage and the
intellect. He is one of the great architects of the legal battles to
open doors that seemed so hopelessly and permanently sealed and
to knock down barriers that seemed so insurmountable to those of
us in the Pin Point, GA's of the world.

  The civil rights movement, Rev. Martin Luther King and the
SCLC, Roy Wilkins and the NAACP, Whitney Young and the
Urban League, Fannie Lou Haemer, Rosa Parks and Dorothy Hite,
they changed society and made it reach out and affirmatively help.
I have benefited greatly from their efforts. But for them there
would have been no road to travel.

  My grandparents always said there would be more opportunities
for us. I can still hear my grandfather, "Y'all goin' have mo' of a
chance then me," and he was right. He felt that if others sacrificed
and created opportunities for us we had an obligation to work
hard, to be decent citizens, to be fair and good people, and he was
right.

  You see, Mr. Chairman, my grandparents grew up and lived
their lives in an era of blatant segregation and overt discrimina-
tion. Their sense of fairness was molded in a crucible of unfairness.
I watched as my grandfather was called "boy." I watched as my
grandmother suffered the indignity of being denied the use of a
bathroom. But through it all they remained fair, decent, good
people. Fair in spite of the terrible contradictions in our country.

  They were hardworking, productive people who always gave back
to others. They gave produce from the farm, fuel oil from the fuel
oil truck. They bought groceries for those who were without, and
they never lost sight of the promise of a better tomorrow. I follow
in their footsteps and I have always tried to give back.

  Over the years I have grown and matured. I have learned to
listen carefully, carefully to other points of views and to others, to
think through problems recognizing that there are no easy answers
                                         110

to difficult problems, to think deeply about those who will be af-
fected by the decisions that I make and the decisions made by
others. But I have always carried in my heart the world, the life,
the people, the values of my youth, the values of my grandparents
and my neighbors, the values of people who believed so very deeply
in this country in spite of all the contradictions.

  It is my hope that when these hearings are completed that this
committee will conclude that I am an honest, decent, fair person. I
believe that the obligations and responsibilities of a judge, in es-
sence, involve just such basic values. A judge must be fair and im-
partial. A judge must not bring to his job, to the court, the baggage
of preconceived notions, of ideology, and certainly not an agenda,
and the judge must get the decision right. Because when all is said
and done, the little guy, the average person, the people of Pin
Pqjnt, the real people of America will be affected not only by what
we as judges do, but by the way we do our jobs.

  If confirmed by the Senate, I pledge that I will preserve and pro-
tect our Constitution and carry with me the values of my heritage:
fairness, integrity, openmindedness, honesty, and hard work.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very, very much for a moving state-
ment, Judge.
  Let me begin at the very outset by pointing out to you I, for one,
do not in any way doubt your honesty, your decency, or your fair-
ness. But, if I could make an analogy, I am interested in what you
think, how you think. I don't doubt for a moment the honesty, de-
cency, or fairness of Senator Hatch. I don't doubt for a moment the
honesty, decency, or fairness of Senator Metzenbaum. But I sure
have a choice of which one I would put on the bench.
  Because they are both honest--I mean this sincerely now. It is
an important point. At least you understand what I have in mind.
The fact you are honest and the fact you are decent and the fact
you are fair, the fact you have honed sensibilities mean a lot to me.
But what I want to do the next half hour and the next several days
is to go beyond that.
  I will concede easily those points because it is true. No question.
As we lawyers say, let's stipulate to the fact you are honest, decent,
and fair, and let's get about the business of finding out why anyone
who ever had the nuns can remember their eighth grade nun.
Mine was Mother Agnes Constance. I don't know why I remember
it so vividly. I suspect we both know why we remember so vividly.
  Judge THOMAS. Dare not forget.
  The CHAIRMAN. And we both know they never forget.
  I made a speech not too many years ago, a commencement
speech, at St. Joseph's University. After the speech was over I felt
that finger that I am sure you felt in the middle of your back, and
I heard, "Joey Biden, why did you say T instead of 'me' " in such
and such a sentence. It is a true story. I turned around and it was
my seventh grade nun. So we both have at least that in common,
and let's see what we can find out about whether or not we have in
common, if anything, about the broader philosophic constructs
upon which the Constitution can and must be informed.
  Judge, as Senator Danforth said, he hopes we have read your
speeches. I assure you I have read all of your speeches, and I have
                                         Ill

read them in their entirety. And, as I indicated in my opening
statement, what I want to talk about a little bit is one of the things
you mention repeatedly in your speeches so that I can be better in-
formed by what you mean by it.

  Whether you are speaking in the speech you delivered on the oc-
casion of Martin Luther King's birthday, a national holiday and
whether it should be one, to a conservative audience, making the
point that he should be looked to with more reverence or whether
or not it was your speech to the Pacific Institute or whether or not
it is the Harvard Journal, whatever it is you repeatedly invoke the
phrase "natural rights" or "natural law."

  And, as I said at the outset, here is good natural law, if you will,
and bad natural law in terms of informing the Constitution, and
there is a whole new school of thought in America that would like
very much to use natural law to lower the protections for individ-
uals in the zone of personal privacy, and I will speak to those later,
and who want to heighten the protection for businesses and corpo-
rations.

  Now, one of those people is a Professor Macedo, a fine first-class
scholar at Harvard University. Another is Mr. Epstein, a professor
at the University of Chicago. And, in the speech you gave in 1987
to the Pacific Research Institute you said, and I quote: "I find at-
tractive the arguments of scholars such as Stephen Macedo who
defend an activist Supreme Court that would"--not could, would--
"strike down laws restricting property rights."

  My question is a very simple one, Judge. What exactly do you
find attractive about the arguments of Professor Macedo and other
scholars like him?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, it has been quite some time since
I have read Professor Macedo and others. That was, I believe, 1987
or 1988. My interest in the whole area was as a political philoso-
phy. My interest was in reassessing and demonstrating a sense that
we understood what our Founding Fathers were thinking when
they used phrases such as "All men are created equal," and what
that meant for our form of government.

  I found Macedo interesting and his arguments interesting, as I
remembered. Again, it has been quite some time. But I don't be-
lieve that in my writings I have indicated that we should have an
activist Supreme Court or that we should have any form of activ-
ism on the Supreme Court. Again, I found his arguments interest-
ing, and I was not talking particularly of natural law, Mr. Chair-
man, in the context of adjudication.

  The CHAIRMAN. I am not quite sure I understand your answer,
Judge. You indicated that you find the arguments--not interest-
ing--attractive, and you explicitly say one of the things you find
attractive--I am quoting from you: "I find attractive the argu-
ments of scholars such as Steven Macedo who defend an activist
Supreme Court that would strike down laws resisting property
rights."

  Now, it would seem to me what you were talking about is you
find attractive the fact that they are activists and they would like
to strike down existing laws that impact on restricting the use of
property rights because, you know, that is what they write about.
112

  Judge THOMAS. Well, let me clarify something. I think it is im-
portant, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Please.
  Judge THOMAS. AS I indicated, I believe, or attempted to allude
to in my confirmation to the Court of Appeals, I don't see a role for
the use of natural law in constitutional adjudication. My interest
in exploring natural law and natural rights was purely in the con-
text of political theory. I was interested in that. There were de-
bates that I had with individuals, and I pursued that on a part-
time basis. I was an agency chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, judge, in preparing for these hearings,
some suggested that might be your answer. So I went back through
some of your writings and speeches to see if I misread them. And,
quite frankly, I find it hard to square your speeches, which I will
discuss with you in a minute, with what you are telling me today.
Just let me read some of your quotes. In a speech before the Fed-
eralist Society at the University of Virginia, in a variation of that
speech that you published in the Harvard Journal of Law and
Policy, you praised the first Justice Harlan's opinion in Plessy y.
Ferguson,and you said, "Implicit reliance on political first princi-
ples was implicit rather than explicit, as is generally appropriate
for the Court's opinions. He gives us a foundation for interpreting
not only cases involving race, but the entire Constitution in the
scheme of protecting rights." You went on to say, "Harlan's opin-
ion provides one of our best examples of natural law and higher
law jurisprudence."

Then you say, "The higher law background of the American Gov-
ernment, whether explicitly appealed to or not, provides the only
firm basis for a just and wise constitutional decision."  *
  Judge, what I would like to know is, I find it hard to understand
how you can say what you are now saying, that natural law was
only a--you were only talking about the philosophy in a general
philosophic sense, and not how it informed or impacted upon con-
stitutional interpretation.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, let me attempt to clarify. That, in fact,
though, was my approach. I was interested in the political theory
standpoint. I was not interested in constitutional adjudication. I
was not at the time adjudicating cases. But with respect to the
background, I think that we can both agree that the founders of
our country, or at least some of the drafters of our Constitution
and our Declaration, believed in natural rights. And my point was
simply that in understanding overall our constitutional govern-
ment, that it was important that we understood how they be-
lieved--or what they believed in natural law or natural rights.

The CHAIRMAN. For what purpose, Judge?
Judge THOMAS. My purpose was this, in looking at this entire
area: The question for me was from a political theory standpoint.
You and I are sitting here in Washington, DC, with Abraham Lin-
coln or with Frederick Douglass, and from a theory, how do we get
out of slavery? There is no constitutional amendment. There is no
provision in the Constitution. But by what theory? Repeatedly Lin-
coln referred to the notion that all men are created equal. And
that was my attraction to, or beginning of my attraction to this ap-
proach. But I did not--I would maintain that I did not feel that
                                         113

natural rights or natural law has a basis or has a use in constitu-
tional adjudication.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, let's go back to Macedo, then. What
was the political theory you found so attractive that Mr. Macedo is
espousing?

  Judge THOMAS. The only thing that I could think of with respect
to--and I will tell you how I got to the issue of property rights and
the issue of the approach or what I was concerned about. What I
was concerned about was this: If you ended slavery--and it is some-
thing that I don't know whether I alluded to it in that speech, but
it is something that troubled me even in my youth. If you ended
slavery and you had black codes, for example, or you had laws that
did not allow my grandfather to enjoy the fruits of his labor, pre-
vented him from working--and you did have that. You had people
who had to work for $3 a day. I told you what my mother's income
was. By what theory do you protect that?

  I don't think that I have explicitly endorsed Macedo. I found his
arguments interesting, and, again, that is the

  The CHAIRMAN. But he doesn't argue about any of those things,
Judge.

  Judge THOMAS. I understand that. I read more explicit areas. I
read about natural law even though my grandfather didn't talk
about natural

  The CHAIRMAN. But, I mean, isn't it kind of--I guess I will come
back to Macedo. You also said in that speech out at the Pacific Re-
search Institute, you said, "I am far from being a scholar on
Thomas Jefferson, but two of his statements suffice as a basis for
restoring our original founding belief and reliance on natural law,
and natural law, when applied to America, means not medieval
stultification but the liberation of commerce." You speak many
times--I won't bore you with them, but I have pages and pages of
quotes where you talk about natural law not in the context of your
grandfather, not in the context of race, not in the context of equali-
ty, but you talk about it in the context of commerce, just like it is
talked in the context, that context, by Macedo and by Epstein and
others in their various books, a new fervent area of scholarship
that basically says, "Hey, look, we, the modern-day court, has not
taken enough time to protect people's property, the property rights
of corporations, the property rights of individuals, the property
rights of businesses." And so what we have to do is we have to ele-
vate the way we have treated protecting property. We have to ele-
vate that to make it harder for governments to interfere with the
ability of--in the case of Epstein the ability to have zoning laws,
the ability to have pollution laws, the ability to have laws that pro-
tect the public welfare.

  Then you say in another place in one of your speeches, you say,
"Well, look, I think that property rights should be given"--let me
find the exact quote--"should be given the exact same protection
as"--you say, "Economic rights are as protected as much as any
other rights," in a speech to the American Bar Association.

  Now, Judge, understand my confusion. Economic rights now are
not protected as much as any other rights. They are not protected
that way now. They are given--if they pass a rational basis test, in
effect, it is all right to restrict property. When you start to restrict
                                          114

things that have to do with privacy and thought process, then you
have to have a much stricter test. And so you quote Macedo. You
talk about the liberation of commerce and natural law, whatever
you want to call it, natural law or not. And then you say economic
rights--and, by the way, you made that speech to the ABA the day
after you made the speech where you praised Macedo.

  Can you tell me, can you enlighten me on how this was just some
sort of philosophic musing?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, that is exactly what it was. I was interested
in exactly what I have said I was interested in. And I think I have
indicated in my confirmation to the court of appeals that I did not
see a role for the application of natural rights to constitutional ad-
judication, and I stand by that.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, you argue Harlan did just that and that it
was a good thing for him to have done. He applied this theory of
natural rights, as you say, in his dissent in Plessyv. Ferguson.

  Judge THOMAS. I thought that
  The CHAIRMAN. He should have, you say.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, the argument was I felt that slavery was
wrong, that segregation was wrong.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Judge THOMAS. And, again, I argue--and I have stood by that--
that these positions that I have taken, I have taken from the stand-
point of philosophical or from the standpoint of political theory.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, let me find
  Judge THOMAS. Let me, if I could have an opportunity.
  The CHAIRMAN. Sure, oh, please.
  Judge THOMAS. My interest in this area started with the notion,
with a simple question: How do you end slavery? By what theory
do you end slavery? After you end slavery, by what theory do you
protect the right of someone who was a former slave or someone
like my grandfather, for example, to enjoy the fruits of his or her
labor?
  At no point did I or do I believe that the approach of natural law
or that natural rights has a role in constitutional adjudication. I
attempted to make that plain or to allude to that in my confirma-
tion to the court of appeals. And I think that that is the position
that I take here.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK, Judge. Well, look, let's not call it natural
law, natural rights, whatever. What do you mean when you say
economic rights are protected as much as any other rights in the
Constitution? What do you mean by that?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, the simple point was that notions like--for
me, at this point--and, again, I have not gone back and I don't
know the text of all those speeches. But there are takings clauses--
there is a taking clause in the Constitution, and there is also a ref-
erence to property in our Constitution. That does not necessarily
mean that in constitutional adjudication that the protection would
be at the same level that we protect other rights. Nor did I suggest
that in constitutional adjudication that that would happen. But it
certainly does deserve some protection. Certainly the right of my
grandfather to work deserves protection.
   The CHAIRMAN. The right of my Grandfather Finnegan, too, de-
served protection and your grandfather to work. But the issue here
                                     115

is whether or--look, let me explain to you why I am concerned
about this. You know why. Let's make sure other people know
why.

  There is a whole new school of thought made up of individuals
that up until about 5 years ago only spoke to one another. That
school of thought is now receiving wider credence and credibility,
to the point that former Solicitor General Charles Fried, in his
book "Order and Law,"--not a liberal Democrat, Reagan's Solicitor
General--said in his book about this group of scholars to whom
Macedo and others like you refer--maybe you didn't mean the
same thing, but this group of scholars, meaning Macedo and Ep-
stein and others who I will mention in a moment. He says, "Fledg-
ling federalist societies and often devotees of the extreme libertari-
an views of Chicago law professor Richard Epstein had a specific,
aggressive and, it seemed to me, quite radical project in mind,"--
meaning for the administration--"to use the takings clause"--I
don't have much time so I won't go into it, but you and I both
know the takings clause is that portion of the fifth amendment
that has nothing to do with self-incrimination. It says if the govern-
ment is going to take your property, they have to pay for it, except
historically we have said if it is regulating your property, it is not
taking it. If it is regulating under the police power to prevent pol-
lution or whatever else, then it is not taking it and doesn't have to
pay for it.

  And what these guys want to do is they want to use that takings
clause like the 14th amendment was used during the Lockner era.
This is Fried speaking. It says "had a specific, aggressive, and, it
seemed to me, quite radical project in mind to use the takings
clause of the fifth amendment to serve as a brake upon Federal
and State regulation of business and property. The grand plan was
to make government pay compensation for taking property every
time its regulation impinged."

  Now, that is what this is all about, Judge. And, again, I am not
saying that that is your view, but it seems to me when you say,
which nobody else who writes in this area--I don't know any-
body--and I have read a lot about this area. I don't know anybody
else who uses the phrases "natural law," "property," "the takings
clause," who doesn't stand for the proposition that Macedo and Ep-
stein for, which is that we got this a little out of whack. We have
got to elevate the standard of review we use when we look at prop-
erty, just to the same standard, to use your phrase, the same rights
as personal rights, that most Americans think to be personal,
whether they can assemble, whether or not they can go out and
speak, whether or not they can worship, whether or not they can
have privacy in their own bedroom.

   And so these guys want to change that balance, but that is why I
am asking you this. I will come back to it in a minute in my second
round. But let me shift, if I may

  Judge THOMAS. May I just respond?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, please.
  Judge THOMAS. First of all, I would like to just simply say, and I
think it is appropriate, that I did not consider myself a member of
that school of thought. And, secondly, I think that the post-
Lockner era cases were correctly decided.
                                         116

  My interest in natural rights were purely from a political theory
standpoint and as a part-time political theorist. I was not a law
professor, nor was I adjudicating cases. And as I indicated and have
indicated, I do not think that the natural rights or natural law has
an appropriate use in constitutional adjudication.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, I would ask for the record, and I
will make these available to you, that all the references you make
that I have found--and there are pages of them--where you explic-
itly connect natural law with either specific cases or talk about in-
forming specific aspects of constitutional interpretation be entered
in the record. In my second round, I will be able to talk with you
about them. You will have had a chance to read them.

                                         127

  The CHAIRMAN. But let me move, if I may, for a second. As I said
earlier, I mentioned that concomitant with those who want to sort
of raise up the economic protections and business incorporation to
make it harder for government to regulate them without paying
them, which is a multibillion-dollar change in the law--not your
view--where Mr. Epstein's views take place, the multibillion-dollar
expense for the taxpayers if they wanted to continue to regulate
the way we now regulate and consider reasonable. As I mentioned
earlier, there is a second zone of individual rights, a zone which in-
cludes such rights as free speech, religion, and privacy in the
family. These rights are also protected as informed by natural law
principles.

  Now, you say that is not what you mean, informed by natural
law principles. But some of the specific protections are very specif-
ic. For example, the fourth amendment guarantees personal priva-
cy in a particular context, illegal search and seizures, and other
protections are more general, like the 14th amendment that says
"nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law."

  Now, Judge, in your view, does the liberty clause of the 14th
amendment protect the right of women to decide for themselves in
certain instances whether or not to terminate pregnancy?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, first of all, let me look at that in the
context other than with natural law principles.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let's forget about natural law for a minute.
  Judge THOMAS. My view is that there is a right to privacy in the
14th amendment.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, does that right to privacy in the lib-
erty clause of the 14th amendment protect the right of a woman to
decide for herself in certain instances whether or not to terminate
a pregnancy?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that the Supreme Court has
made clear that the issue of marital privacy is protected, that the
State cannot infringe on that without a compelling interest, and
the Supreme Court, of course, in the case of Roe v. Wadehas found
an interest in the woman's right to--as a fundamental interest a
woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. I do not think that at this
time that I could maintain my impartiality as a member of the ju-
diciary and comment on that specific case.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, let's try it another way, Judge. I don't
want to ask you to comment specifically on Roe there. What I am
trying to get at, there are two schools of thought out there. There
is a gentleman like Professor Michael Moore of the University of
Pennsylvania and Mr. Lewis Lehrman of the Heritage Foundation
who both think natural law philosophy informs their view, and
they conclude one who strongly supports a woman's right and the
other one who strongly opposes a woman's right to terminate a
pregnancy.
  Then there are those who say that, no, this should be left strictly
to the legislative bodies, not for the courts to interpret, and they
fall into the school of thought represented by John Hart Healy and
former Judge Robert Bork, for example, who say the Court has
nothing to do with that.
                                         128

  Now, let me ask you this: Where does the decision lie? Does it lie
with the Court? For example, you quote, with admiration, Mr.
Lehrman's article. Mr. Lehrman's article was on natural law and--
I forget the exact title here. Let me find it. "Natural Law and the
Right to Life." And you say when you are speaking at a gathering
that you think that that is a superb application of natural law.
You say, "It is a splendid example of applying natural law."

  Now, what did you mean by that?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, let me go back to, I guess, my first com-
ment to you when we were discussing natural law--I think that is
important--and then come back to the question of the due process
analysis.
  The speech that I was giving there was before the Heritage
Foundation. Again, as I indicated earlier, my interest was civil
rights and slavery. What I was attempting to do in the beginning
of that speech was to make clear to a conservative audience that
blacks who were Republicans and the issues that affected blacks
were being addressed and being dealt with by conservatives in
what I considered a less-than-acceptable manner.
  The second point that
  The CHAIRMAN. In what sense? In that they were not
  Judge THOMAS. That they were not.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. Invoking natural law.
  Judge THOMAS. NO, that--no. The second point that I wanted to
make to them was that they had, based on what I thought was an
appropriate approach, they had an obligation just as conservatives
to be more open and more aggressive on civil rights enforcement.
What I thought would be the best way to approach that would be
using the underlying concept of our Constitution that we were all
created equal.
  I felt that conservatives would be skeptical about the notion of
natural law. I was using that as the underlying approach. I felt
that they would be conservative and that they would not--or be
skeptical about that concept. I was speaking in the Lew Lehrman
Auditorium of the Heritage Foundation. I thought that if I demon-
strated that one of their own accepted at least the concept of natu-
ral rights, that they would be more apt to accept that concept as an
underlying principle for being more aggressive on civil rights. My
whole interest was civil rights enforcement.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, you said in that speech, "The need to re-
examine natural law is as current as last month's issue of Time on
ethics, yet it is more venerable than St. Thomas Aquinas. It both
transcends and underlies time and place, race and custom, and
until recently it has been an integral part of the American political
tradition. Dr. King was the last prominent American political
figure to appeal to it. But Heritage trustee Lewis Lehrman's recent
essay in the American Sector on the Declaration of Independence
and the meaning of the right to life is a splendid example of apply-
ing it. Briefly put, this thesis of natural law is that human nature
provides the key to how men ought to live their lives."
  And then Mr. Lehrman's article goes on, not you, Mr. Lehrman's
article goes on and says, "Because it is a natural right of a fetus,
there is no ability of the legislative body to impact in any way on
whether or not there can or cannot be an abortion at any time for
                                         129

any reason. And the Court must uphold applying natural law, the
principle that abortion is wrong under all circumstances, whether
it is the life of the mother, no matter what, all circumstances."

  Judge THOMAS. It was not my intention, Mr. Chairman, as I have
tried to indicate to you, to adopt--I think I have been explicit when
I wanted to adopt someone or say something, adopt a position or
say something. I think I have done that.

  My interest in the speech I think is fairly clear, or is very clear.
My interest was in the aggressive enforcement of civil rights. Re-
member the context. I am in the Reagan administration. I have
been engaged in significant battles throughout my tenure. It is
toward the end of the Reagan administration. And I feel that con-
servatives have taken an approach on civil rights where they have
become comfortable with notions that it is okay to simply be
against quotas or to be against busing or to be against voting rights
and consider that a civil rights agenda.

  What I was looking for were unifying themes in a political stand-
point, not a constitutional adjudication standpoint, and I used
themes that I thought that one of their champions had in a way
adopted, not adopting his analysis or adopting his approach, but
adopting a theme that he used to serve the purposes that I thought
were very important.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, let me conclude this round by
saying that--picking up that context, that you were a part of the
Reagan administration. In 1986, as a member of the administra-
tion, you were part of what has been referred to here, the adminis-
tration's Working Group on the Family. This group put out what I
think can only be characterized as a controversial report. And you
sign that report which recommends more State regulation of the
family than is now allowed under the law. That report concludes
that the Supreme Court's privacy decisions for the last 20 years are
fatally flawed and should be corrected.

  Judge, did you read this report before it was released?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, let me explain to you how working groups
work in the domestic policy context or the way that they worked in
the administration. Normally what would happen is that there
would be a number of informal meetings. At those meetings, you
would express your--there would be some discussion around the
table. My interest was in low-income families. I transmitted, after
several meetings transmitted to the head of that working group,
my views on the low-income family and the need to address the
problems of low-income families in the report.
  The report, as it normally works in these working groups in do-
mestic policy, the report is not finalized, nor is it a team effort in
drafting. You are submitted your document. That document is
then, as far as I know, it may be sent around or may not be sent
around. But there is no signature required on those.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you ever read the report, Judge?
  Judge THOMAS. The section that I read was on the family. I was
only interested in whether they included my comments on the low-
income family.
  The CHAIRMAN. But at any time, even after it was published?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I did not.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU haven't to this moment read that report?
                                          130

  Judge THOMAS. TO this day, I have not read that report. I read
the sections on low-income families.

  The CHAIRMAN. There was an awful lot of discussion in the press
and controversy about it.

  Judge THOMAS. There was controversy about it. I was interested
in low-income families. If you work with the domestic policy group
or the working groups at the White House, what one quickly learns
is that you send your input, that that input is reduced to what they
want it reduced to, and then the report is circulated in final.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, let me conclude. This is the last thing I
will ask you. This report, which is only 67 pages long, of which
your report is part of--and I acknowledge your suggesting, telling
us that you did not read the report before or after, and your part
was only a small part of this. But in this report, take my word for
it, it says that one of these fatally flawed decisions--and they ex-
plicitly pick out one--is Moore v. City of East Cleveland, where the
city of East Cleveland said a grandmother raising two grandchil-
dren who are cousins and not brothers is violating the zoning law
and therefore has to do one of two things: move out of the neigh-
borhood or tell one of her grandchildren to leave.

  As you know, that case, I believe, was appealed to the Supreme
Court, that grandmother, and the Court said, "Hey, no, she has an
absolute right of privacy to be able to have two of those grandchil-
dren, even though they are cousins, to live with her and no zoning
law can tell her otherwise."

  Now, this report says, explicitly it says, that the city of East
Cleveland and other cities should be able to pass such laws if they
want and they should be upheld. And if we can't get them upheld,
then we should change the Court. That is what this report says.
And they say that the cities and States should be able to establish
norms of a traditional family.

  If you will give me the benefit of the doubt that I am telling you
the truth and accurately characterizing the report on that point, do
you agree with what I suggested to you is the conclusion of that
report in the section you have not read?

  Judge THOMAS. I have heard recently that that was the conclu-
sion, but I would like to make a point there. I think--and I think
the Supreme Court's rulings in the privacy area support--that the
notion of family is one of the most personal and most private rela-
tionships that we have in our country. If I had, of course, known
that that section was in the report before it became final, of course
I would have expressed my concerns.

  The CHAIRMAN. It is kind of outrageous, isn't it? Isn't it an outra-
geous suggestion?

  Judge THOMAS. That would have had direct implications on my
own family, that I could easily have been zoned out of my neigh-
borhood should approaches like that take place. But my point to
you--and I think it is very, very important, Senator--is this: That
when you are involved or were involved in a working group in the
White House, we were more in the nature of resource people. This
was not a committee report. This was not a conference report
which was circulated normally for comment. It was something gen-
erally that you provided your input, and I provided a significant
memo, I believe, on low-income families and families that I felt
                                         131

were at risk in the society and how we should approach resolving
those families. I do not remember there being any discussion of the
final draft.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I have much more to ask you, Judge. We
are going to go back, when I get a chance again, to the Macedo
quote, the ABA speech, and the Lehrman speech, and this report.
But, quite frankly, at this point you leave me with more questions
than answers, but let me yield to my distinguished colleague, Sena-
tor Thurmond.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, before proceeding for-
ward--and I don't wish to interrupt my colleague, Senator Thur-
mond--would you be good enough to ask the Judge to read that
report in order that we might inquire further of him tomorrow in
our questioning period?

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, if you plan on inquiring of him, I will
make sure he has a copy available, and he can decide whether he
wishes to read it or not.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I do intend to inquire of him.
  The CHAIRMAN. I will see to it that he has a copy, and he can
make the judgment whether he wishes to read it.
  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Now, Judge, I think we can move right along. I have about 30
minutes here, and I have approximately 14 questions. I think we
can finish them if you will just make your answers fairly brief.
  Judge Thomas, the Constitution of the United States is now over
200 years old. Many Americans have expressed their views about
the endurance of this great document. With the events in the
Soviet Union, this document takes on an even greater significance
as the foundation of our domestic form of government. Would you
please share with the committee your opinion as to the success of
our Constitution and its distinction as the oldest existing Constitu-
tion in the world today?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it should be clear to all
  Senator THURMOND. Speak in the microphone. Speak out so we
can all hear you.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it should be clear to all of us
that our Constitution, as it has endured, is one of the greatest doc-
uments, not only in our lifetimes, but certainly in the history of
the world. It protects our freedoms as well as provides us with a
structure of government that is certainly the freest government in
the world, and it has certainly been a model for other countries.
  Senator THURMOND. Second question: Judge Thomas, Marbury y.
Madison is a famous Supreme Court decision. It provides the basis
of the Supreme Court's authority to interpret the Constitution and
issue decisions which are binding on both the executive and legisla-
tive branches. Would you briefly discuss your views on this author-
ity?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is important to recognize--and
we all do recognize--that Marbury v. Madison is the underpinning
of our current judicial system, that the courts do decide and do the
cases in the constitutional area, and it is certainly an approach
that we have grown accustomed to and around which our institu-
tions, our legal institutions have grown up.
                                         132

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, the 10th amendment to the
Constitution provides that all powers are reserved to the States or
the people if not specifically delegated to the Federal Government.
What is your general view about the proper relationship between
the Federal and State governments, and do you believe that there
has been an substantial increase in Federal authority over the last
few decades?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that it is clear that our country
has grown and expanded in very important ways. Through the
commerce clause, for example, there has been growth in the na-
tional scope of our Government. Through the 14th amendment,
there has been application of our Bill of Rights, or portions, to the
State governments. Through the growth in communications and
travel, of course, we are more nationalized than we were in the
past.

  I think what the Court has attempted to do is to preserve in a
way as best it possibly could the autonomy of the State govern-
ments, but at the same time recognize the growth and expansion
and the natural growth and expansion of our National Govern-
ment.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, some have discussed your
tenure as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission since your nomination to the Supreme Court. Although
this committee thoroughly reviewed the issues raised about the
EEOC when you were nominated for the D.C. Circuit Court, would
you tell the committee what are the problems you encountered at
the EEOC and the steps you took to resolve them? And if you care
to discuss any major accomplishments now, I would be glad to have
you do so.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, EEOC, of course, was a significant por-
tion of my career in government. It was a most important part.
When I arrived at EEOC in 1982, of course, we had some very, very
difficult problems. We had problems with respect to the infrastruc-
ture of the agency. I felt that we should investigate more cases and
that we should litigate more cases. We were immediately faced
with problems of just managing our own money in the agency.

  Over time, we were able to solve those problems. Over time, we
were able to correct the infrastructure and to develop it and ulti-
mately to improve our enforcement. We litigated more cases than
ever in the history of the agency. We have been able to investigate
cases, and we were able to do more with less in the agency with
fewer resources. So I am very proud of my tenure at EEOC. I think
we made great accomplishments. I think we made great strides. I
think there was a lot to do after I left, and I felt that the agency
was headed in a very positive direction.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, the Supreme Court has ruled
that the death penalty is constitutional. There are hundreds of in-
mates under death sentences across the country. Many have been
on death row for several years as a result of the endless appeals
process. Recently the Senate passed legislation which would reduce
the number of unnecessary appeals by giving greater deference to
State decisions. Additionally, the Supreme Court has ruled in cer-
tain cases that there should be limits to the endless filing of habeas
petitions, especially in death penalty cases.
                                         133

  Would you give the committee your views on the validity of plac-
ing some reasonable limitations on the number of post-trial appeals
in death penalty cases?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, generally I think that there would be a
concern among all of us. The death penalty is the harshest penalty
that can be imposed, and it is certainly one that is unchangeable.
And we should be most concerned about providing all the rights
and all the due process that can be provided and should be provid-
ed to individuals who may face that kind of a consequence.

  I would be concerned, of course, that we would move too fast,
that if we eliminate some of the protections that perhaps we may
deprive that individual of his life without due process. So I would
be in favor of reasonable restrictions on procedures, but not to the
point that individuals--or I believe that there should be reasonable
restrictions at some point, but not to the point that an individual is
deprived of his constitutional protections.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, I believe that tough sen-
tences should be imposed in criminal cases, especially when the
crime committed is one of violence. Over the years, I have favored
tough criminal sanctions. Too often, unfortunately, victims of crime
have not played a prominent enough role in the criminal justice
system. However, recently the number of victims who participate
in the prosecution of criminal cases has increased. In fact, the
Court recently rules in the case of Payne v. Tennessee that the use
of victim-impact statements in death penalty cases does not violate
the Constitution.

  In your opinion, should victims play a greater role in the crimi-
nal justice system? And if so, to what extent should a victim be al-
lowed to participate, especially after a finding of guilt against an
accused?

  Judge THOMAS. Of course, Senator, that is a matter that the
Court has, as you have noted, recently considered. My concern
would be in a case like that that we don't in a way jeopardize the
rights of the victim. Of course, we would like to make sure that the
victims are involved in the process, but we should be very careful,
in my view, that we don't somehow undermine the validity of the
process; that an individual who is a criminal defendant is in some
way harmed by that other than just simply getting it right and
making sure that the total impact of the conduct is known.

  I think that there are concerns on both sides. From the stand-
point of the victims, that is important. But there are also the con-
stitutional rights of the criminal defendant.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge, if I propound any question you con-
sider inappropriate, just speak out and tell me.

  Judge, Congress established the U.S. Sentencing Commission in
1984. Its function is to promulgate sentencing guidelines for Feder-
al judges to ensure uniform and predictable prison sentences. The
Supreme Court ruled in the case of United States v. Mistretta that
the sentencing guidelines are constitutional.

  Judge Thomas, from your experience, do you believe that uni-
form sentencing is more fair to those individuals who commit simi-
lar crimes and in the long run that sentencing guidelines will
create better competence in the criminal justice system?
                                      134

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that the problem, the concern
that many individuals had in the sentencing of criminal defendants
was the apparent unfairness and the disparity of sentences. The
approach and the effort, the purpose of the uniform guidelines, one
of the purposes was to simply provide some sense or to eliminate
that disparity and that sense of unfairness. To the extent that it
has done that in eliminating that disparity, I think it has brought
a sense of fairness to the process.

  The concern, of course, of anyone who is involved in the criminal
justice system is that we do not sacrifice justice or fairness for uni-
formity or for rigidity. But I think that most judges would agree
that the guidelines have eliminated the disparity in sentencing.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, you are currently serving as
a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit. You have participated in some 140 decisions. How benefi-
cial, in your opinion, will your prior judicial experience be to you if
confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that in my own career I have
had the opportunity to work in a variety of positions. I have had an
opportunity to work in the Federal Government, to be engaged in
appellate work there, to represent agencies, as well as in the legis-
lative and executive branches of the National Government. What
has been important to me in those processes is that I have had the
opportunity to grow, to learn, to expand, to mature, to make hard
decisions, and to, I think, become a better person and to become
certainly advanced as someone who is capable of deciding tough
cases or making tough decisions.

  When one moves to the--when I moved to the judiciary, I felt
that I had matured rapidly. But when one goes to the judiciary,
one puts on those robes and realizes the immense responsibility of
being a judge; that at the end of a decision, something is going to
happen. Perhaps a person may stay in prison longer or a person
may leave prison. There may be some economic effects. There may
be a change in a company. Somebody wins or someone loses. So one
becomes more serious and one again matures greatly.

  I think it is also important because one has to--a judge has to
become accustomed to not having views, formed views on issues
that may come before him or her. You become impartial or neu-
tral. You begin to look at problems in a different way, and you rec-
ognize your fallibility.

  I think that my tenure on the court of appeals has been of tre-
mendous benefit to me, and it certainly provided me with an occa-
sion to mature more rapidly and to a larger extent than even my
process of maturation in my previous jobs.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, the doctrine of stare decisis
is a concept well recognized in our legal system and the concept
that virtually all judges have in mind when making decisions, espe-
cially in difficult cases. I am sure that the issue of prior authority
has been a factor which you have considered while on the bench.
Would you please briefly state your general view of stare decisis
and under what circumstances you would consider it appropriate to
overrule a prior procedure?

  Judge THOMAS. I think overruling a case or reconsidering a case,
Senator, is a very serious matter. Certainly, the case would have to
                                         135

be--you would have to be of the view that a case is incorrectly de-
cided, but I think even that is not adequate.

  There are some cases that you may not agree with that should
not be overruled. Stare decisis provides continuity to our system, it
provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decision-
making, I think it is a very important and critical concept, and I
think that a judge has the burden. A judge that wants to reconsid-
er a case and certainly one who wants to overrule a case has the
burden of demonstrating that not only is the case indirect, but that
it would be appropriate, in view of stare decisis, to make that addi-
tional step of overruling that case.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, under our Constitution, we
have three very distinct branches of government. The role of the
judiciary is to interpret the law. However, there have been times
when judges have gone beyond their responsibility of interpreting
the law and, instead, have exercised their individual will as judicial
activists. Would you please briefly describe your views on the topic
of judicial activism?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, that the role of a judge is a lim-
ited one. It is to interpret the intent of Congress, the legislation of
Congress, to apply that in specific cases, and to interpret the Con-
stitution, where called upon, but at no point to impose his or her
will or his or her opinion in that process, but, rather, to go to the
traditional tools of constitutional interpretation or adjudication, as
well as to statutory construction, but not, again, to impose his or
her own point of view or his or her predilections or preconceptions.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, the exclusionary rule is well
known in criminal law. At times, it is applied when there was no
misconduct on the part of law enforcement. For this reason, the Su-
preme Court recognized a good-faith exception to the exclusionary
rule in the case of United States, v. Leon, applying it to only
searches made pursuant to a warrant. Judge Thomas, would you
discuss the effect of the exclusionary rule in preventing police mis-
conduct, and whether or not there is a varied basis for good-faith
exception, especially when there is a search warrant.

  Judge THOMAS. I think in the case of United States v. Leon, of
course, the Court did find the good-faith exception, but the ap-
proach that the Court took and the concern was this, that the war-
rant and the requirement is to make sure that the law enforce-
ment officials are deterred from pursuing in an unlawful way or
obtaining evidence in an unlawful way, it will not be used in the
process.

  In United States v. Leon, as I remember it, the magistrate had
issued a warrant and the police officers or the law enforcement of-
ficials had relied on that warrant in good faith. The Court is
simply saying that it would serve no purpose of deterrence, by pre-
cluding the use of a warrant that was issued by a magistrate, per-
haps by mistake, but relied on, then, in good faith by the law en-
forcement officials.

  Of course, there are exceptions to that, but I think that the
Court and the law enforcement community have come to accept
the use of the exclusionary rule up to a point, and the Court is
looking for ways to make sure that the purposes of the exclusion-
                                          136

ary rule are advanced, as opposed to simply being used in a way
that is rote.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge, concerns have been raised about the
high costs and sometimes lengthy delays to resolve cases in the
Federal courts. Last year, Congress passed legislation that I intro-
duced, along with Senator Biden, that requires each Federal dis-
trict to prepare a proposal to reduce delay and costs in the Federal
civil litigation process. In your view, is there a need to expedite
civil cases and reduce costs, to insure that individuals have confi-
dence in the courts to resolve disputes? And what would you rec-
ommend to improve handling of civil cases in the Federal courts?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that the concern that any of us
would have when the court has a crowded docket is that there
would be individuals who most need the access to our judicial
system who would be squeezed out of that system, and we would
also be concerned that if the costs of civil litigation were to in-
crease, once again, the individuals who most need access to our ju-
dicial system would be eliminated from that system.

  I think that there have been some proposals by the Vice Presi-
dent, there have been approaches that involve dispute resolution in
order to speed up the process. There have even been private indi-
viduals who have established ways to adjudicate cases.

  My concern with the later approach, of course, would be that we
would have separate judicial systems for those who can afford it,
the private system, and for those who cannot, they would have to
wait in line for a crowded governmental system.

  But I think that there are some proposals. Of course, there is
some discussion and I think that all times the judicial system
should be open to all of our citizens. It is one common aspect that
we all have the same judiciary.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, in an opinion written last
year by Justice Scalia concerning the first amendment's freedom of
religion, the Supreme Court ruled in Employment Division v.
Smith that a law which is otherwise valid does not violate the first
amendment if it incidentally affects religious practices. Would you
please briefly discuss the impact this decision has on the compel-
ling State interest test established in Sherbert v. Verner in 1963?

  Judge THOMAS. Of course, Justice Scalia's decision was, in es-
sence, that since the general criminal statutes outlaw the use of
peyote, I think, in that case, that one could not claim that it was a
violation of their first amendment right to exercise their religious
beliefs, that this preclusion by statute had occurred or that you
could not use it in a religious exercise of any sort or religious cele-
bration.

  What Justice Scalia did was actually use a different test than
had been used in the past. He avoided using the Sherbert test. Jus-
tice O'Connor used the compelling interest test. She used the Sher-
bert test and reached the same result, if I remember the case right.

  I think it is an important departure from prior approaches and it
is one that anyone who approaches these cases should be concerned
about or at least be watchful for.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, the issue of capital punish-
ment is a controversial topic, with strongly held views on both
sides. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled that the death penal-
                                         137

ty is a constitutional form of punishment and provided steps to
insure that it is not imposed as unfettered discretion, certainly
there are judges who are personally opposed to the death penalty.
Since the Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty is con-
stitutional, what role, if any, should the personal opinion of a judge
play in decisions he or she may render in case such as the death
penalty?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think as I have indicated, I do not
think that a judge's personal opinions should play a role in decid-
ing cases, and certainly if a judge has strongly held views to a
point that he or she cannot be impartial or objective, then I think
that judge should consider recusal.

  I think, of course, that some judges believe that the death penal-
ty per se may be violative of constitutional rights, and that is one
form of analysis or approach. But I think that if your personal
views are so strong in any area, you should consider recusal.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, there have been complaints
by Federal and State judges regarding the inferior quality of advo-
cacy before the courts. During your service on the bench, have you
found that legal representation in the courts was adequate? And
what in your opinion should be done to insure that individuals get
quality representation in the courts?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, during my own law school years, I
thought it was important that I be involved, as a law student, in
providing some representation for individuals who could not afford
lawyers. I think we would all agree, in our judicial process and in
this complex world, that it is difficult to represent one's self. While
I was in the Attorney General's office, as well as at the Monsanto
Co., I attempted to provide services to individuals who needed as-
sistance.

  I think that the level of representation or the level of advocacy
by the lawyers who have appeared before the court on which I cur-
rently sit has been very, very high. The lawyers' involvement in
the process help us to sharpen the arguments, to understand the
arguments, and certainly to sharpen our inquiry and our analysis
of very, very difficult legal issues.

  I think it is important not only from the standpoint, and I think
it is critical that individuals be represented, but I think it is not
only important from that standpoint, but also from the standpoint
of judges being able to get the cases right.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, prison overcrowding is a
major problem facing Federal and State institutions today. Several
State systems are currently under Federal prisoner cap orders
which limits committing additional inmates to certain prisons. At a
time when violent crime and drug offenses are such a problem,
what other alternatives are available to insure that prison space is
available for those sentenced to serve time?

  Judge THOMAS. That is a difficult question, Senator. I do not
think that those of us in the judiciary have the ability to know ex-
actly how to solve all of the prison overcrowding issues. That, of
course, is a problem that is facing virtually all areas. There have
been efforts to move individuals to areas other than where they are
convicted, to areas where they have additional space, and there
                                          138

have been efforts to use other facilities, perhaps military bases, et
cetera.

  But I think it is a problem that is worthy of reconsideration and
it is one that, with the current prison population, has to currently
be reexamined, not only by this body or similar bodies, but also law
enforcement officials, as well as members of the judiciary.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, as you are aware, public li-
ability cases often involve very complex issues, with large sums of
money at stake. Many argue that Congress should pass reform leg-
islation to modify the burden of proof in certain types of cases and
to limit the amount of damages that jurists would be allowed to
award.

  Based on your experience as a judge, what is your opinion of the
ability of a judge in such complicated trials to comprehend these
intricate issues and award damages reasonably related to the inju-
ries suffered by the plaintiff? And if juries grant unwarranted
awards, can appellate courts correct them?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, those cases are very difficult cases. I
think that when juries and when judges attempt to adjudicate
those cases, they have to sort out a complex set of issues, as well as
determine in difficult circumstances what the appropriate relief
would be.

  At the appellate level, our job is not simply to go back and
impose our views on the trier of fact in those cases, but, rather, to
assure that the appropriate standards of law were employed.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, many people have supported
the enactment of alternative dispute resolution measures such as
arbitration in products liability lawsuits. Do you believe that these
alternative dispute resolution measures will work in a fair manner
and be helpful in resolving complicated issues that are usually con-
sidered by a jury, as well as helping to expedite the handling of
such cases?

  Judge THOMAS. We used, Senator, the alternative dispute resolu-
tion process. We began during my tenure at EEOC to begin to take
a look at those sorts of approaches to resolving very difficult prob-
lems, and I believe that they should be explored. In our own court,
we have explored the use of that process in resolving some of the
appellate cases.

  Again, I think is necessary to make sure that the cases that are
allowed to go through that process are those that are susceptible to
resolution in that manner. I would be concerned that any individ-
ual is deprived of his or her day in court, by using mechanisms
that are not directly in the judicial process.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, the Sentencing Commission
is considering whether current Federal criminal sentences are ade-
quate. In fact, the Commission has promulgated new guidelines for
white collar and corporate offenses. Congress has also seen fit to
increase the term of imprisonment for various white collar crimes,
including those involves financial institutions.

  From your experience, have penalties for white collar crime and
corporate defendants been sufficient, and do you anticipate tougher
penalties for white collar criminals in the future, as a result of the
recent savings and loan offenses and securities related crimes?
                                         139

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, certainly I have not sat as a trial judge
imposing those sentences. I think that the sentences under our
guidelines in the areas in which I have been involved certainly
seem to be adequate. I would be concerned that there would be sig-
nificant differences between serious crimes in one area and serious
crimes in another area, and I think that this body, as well as indi-
viduals who have studied this area, have attempted to reduce the
disparity in those sentences and I think that is an important
project and endeavor.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, the caseload of the Supreme
Court has grown rapidly over the past several decades. Part of this
increase is a result of more cases being filed in the lower courts.
Cases today are more complex, as our laws have become far more
numerous and intricately fashioned. Would you please give the
committee your thoughts on the current caseload of the Supreme
Court and comment briefly on any innovative methods which could
be utilized at the Federal level for handling this increased case-
load?

  Judge THOMAS. I certainly could not, Senator, as much as I prob-
ably would like to advise the Supreme Court on its workload. I
think that the judges on my court, and I would assume that Jus-
tices on the Supreme Court, are working at a level that is very,
very significant. I know that our own investment of time on our
court usually involves 6 or 7 days a week. Of course, we do not
have the option of screening the cases, as the Supreme Court does.

  I think the Supreme Court has the awesome task of making
some of the most difficult decisions in our Nation, and certainly
the most difficult decisions in our judicial system, and it is impor-
tant that they control their workload, I think, in a way that they
can make these decisions in an appropriate manner.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge, the light is red and my time is up.
Thank you very much.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, you have been sitting there a long time. I
am going to try to get finished by 5:30, so why don't we come back
at 20 after. We will recess until 20 after.

  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  The Chair recognizes Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  First of all, Judge Thomas, I want to commend you for an ex-
tremely moving description about your early years, your relation-
ship with your family, your grandfather, and really describing a
situation which has existed for far too many people in our society.
And I found it extremely moving and a very fair characterization
in terms of your own integrity and fairness.
  And I commend my colleague and friend, John Danforth. I had
the good opportunity to serve in the Senate for many years and I
have heard many of the Senate introduce nominees for various po-
sitions and I have never heard one that has been more eloquent or
heartfelt than Senator Danforth's statement. For those of us who
have respect for him and for his values, I want to say how much I
certainly appreciate it.
  As you understand, we have questions of you or about your views
of the Constitution and the role of Government, and I would like
                                          140

to, if I could, start out with the issue of the role of government in
our society.

  In several of your speeches and articles you have taken a broad
view of business rights, of an employer's interest in being free

  The CHAIRMAN. Would the Senator hold for a second?
  Would you close that door, please? Tell people in the hall to
come in or stay out for a while. OK? The Senator cannot be heard.
  Thank you very much. Excuse me.
  Senator KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. Right.
  Well, in a number of speeches and articles you have taken a
broad view of business rights, of an employer's interest in being
free of government regulation. If confirmed, you will be called
upon to interpret the Federal, State and local laws protecting em-
ployees and regulating workplaces. And, if you were hostile to
these efforts and construed them narrowly as a result, you could
seriously undermine our efforts to correct unsafe and unhealthy
conditions that endanger millions of working men and women
across the country, and I would like to ask you about some of your
statements on this important issue.
  In a 1987 interview with a publication called Reason you ques-
tion the need for many important Federal agencies. You said, and I
quote: "Why do you need a Department of Labor? Why do you need
a Department of Agriculture? Why do you need a Department of
Commerce? You can go down the whole list, you don't need any of
them really."
  You were quoted correctly, were you not?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I again don't know the context of that
quote. I don't know what I said before or after. Of course, I think
all of us would certainly be in favor of, and I certainly count
myself among those Americans who are for safe working environ-
ments and who are strongly for protections from abuses and exploi-
tation from individuals who have more clout and more power.
  I am for a safe working environment and I am for the standards
that protect workers. And I am certainly, as I have made clear
during my tenure at EEOC, strongly in favor of laws hat prevent
employers from discriminating against individuals.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I will put the full interview in the
record. You were asked about various departments and agencies
and the necessity for your own agency, I believe, as a matter of
fact, and the response to the--do you remember at all the inter-
view? I have it and I will put it in the record.
  The inquiry is "Should I suspect that we might think that the
EEOC ought not to exist. Why do you think that this agency should
exist in a free society?"
  "While in a free --this is your answer--"free society I don't
think there would be a need for it to exist. Had we lived up to our
Constitution, had we lived up to the principles that we espouse
there would certainly be no need. There would have been no need.
Unfortunately, the reality was that for politics reasons or whatever
there was a need to enforce antidiscrimination laws, or at least
there was a perceived need to do that. Why do you need a Depart-
ment of Labor? Why do you need a Department of Agriculture?
Why do you need a Department of Commerce? You can go down
the whole list, you don't need any of them."
                                         141

  Judge THOMAS. From that quote, Senator, I think the point that I
was trying to make, there are certain individuals who think you
don't need any government involvement, who felt that EEOC
should not exist, for example. Well, in a perfect world you don't
need EEOC. But this is not a perfect world. In a perfect world you
probably wouldn't need a Department of Labor or Department of
Agriculture. This is not a perfect world.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, why--if you take Department of Labor
with enforcement of, say, OSHA regulations, or Department of Ag-
riculture trying to deal with food inspection, Department of Com-
merce trying to ensure that American workers are going to be com-
peting or the fair playing field, I just wondered even why you
might suggest that those agencies as well as others.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, let me explain I think the point that I was
trying to make. I believe, and I would have to go back and look at
the entire question, but the point is this. There are some individ-
uals who say: "Well, we don t need any government." "You don't
need EEOC/' "Why should there be an EEOC?"

  Well, if there were no discrimination in the world, I don't think
you and I would think that there was a need for EEOC. The reality
is, though, that there is discrimination in the world.

  You could ask rhetorically what is the need for other depart-
ments if this were a perfect world. The answer is this is not a per-
fect world. If this were a perfect world, you wouldn't have to en-
force health and safety laws. But the answer is that there are some
people who violate health and safety laws, and you and I, and I
think many others, think that people should be protected from
those sorts of individuals.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, don't statements like these suggest hos-
tility on your part to attempts by Government to help people that
can't help themselves?

  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator. I think I was actually defending the
effort in instances where there is a need for the Government to
participate and for the Government to have a role. There were
many individuals--I remember sitting down with an individual
early in my tenure at EEOC, and his first words were to me, in a
very pleasant way but firm, "You know, I don't think this agency
should exist." But I spend a considerable amount of time defending
the need for this agency and defending the need a specific role of
the Government in certain areas.

  And I think that was the point I was trying to make there.
  Senator KENNEDY. Just to read these final words of yours, after
you said you don't need any of them, "I think though if I had to
look at the role of Government and what it does in people's lives I
see the EEOC as having much more legitimacy than the others if
properly run. Now you run the risk that the authority can be
abused when EEOC or any organization start dictating to people. I
think they go far beyond anything that should be tolerated in this
society."
  Well, now in a speech at the Pacific Research Institute, in 1987,
you criticized entitlement programs. This is what you said: "The
attack on freedom and rights had to be accompanied by their re-
definition. In the socialist view the new freedom was thus only an-
other name for the old demand for an equal distribution of wealth.
                                         142

The new freedom meant freedom from necessity and it was a short
road to what we call today entitlements. Before a right meant the
freedom to do something. Now a right has come to mean, at least
in some unfortunately growing circles, the legal claim to receive
and demand something.

  Which entitlements were you referring to as socialism--Social
Security or Medicare or unemployment insurance?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't think I referred to any of them specifical-
ly, Senator. I think I was trying to make the distinction between
what we traditionally consider rights and freedoms versus pro-
grams that are specifically implemented or initiated by the govern-
ment.

  I don't think that my comment there was one where I was look-
ing at a specific governmental program and saying that this is an
entitlement program that I think is bad or good. I think there is a
comparison, there is a debate, and I thought it was a vibrant
debate, about what our rights and what our freedoms were.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, what is your view about entitlements?
  Judge THOMAS. I think that I have said in speeches and I think
that it is appropriate that many of us
  Senator KENNEDY. Excuse me. I didn't understand.
  Judge THOMAS. I think that I have said in speeches and I think
that programs, there are certain programs in our society that have
helped. I remember visiting my mother in Fellwood Homes, which
is a Federal housing project in Savannah, GA. Fellwood Homes was
seen as what? It was seen--we lived in a tenement. She moved to a
lane, a dirt street and a move up in the world. A steppingstone was
Fellwood Homes before she could then move to something better. I
thought that those programs were good.
  I think we all though in a pluralistic society are concerned that
sometimes when we do something that we hope is good that it may
on some occasions have a negative impact, and I think that it is
not illegitimate to say that some of these programs, or at least
some of the ramifications, may not be what we expected and some
of the consequences may be unintended consequences.
  But I certainly believe that the efforts on behalf of providing
public housing to my mother or the efforts of providing relief to in-
dividuals who could not receive jobs, et cetera, in my neighborhood
were very, very good efforts.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, of course, as you know, there are certain
programs which are entitlements and other programs which are
not, and I think all of us understand some, various programs work
well, others do not. And I am sure we as an institution don't do as
well as we should in sorting out the ones that do not.
  But entitlements have a special position. They certainly do from
a budgetary position, and they have been selected by the Congress
basically in a bipartisan way because they have a certain relevan-
cy, because they have had an evaluation, and when you mention
something like Social Security, student loan programs, various--
crop insurance programs, some of the other half a dozen or so, be-
cause there is only that many, some of the particular programs for
children, those are considered entitlements. And I didn't know--
your bunching those together within the same paragraph that is
talking about the socialist view, the need freedom, was that thus
                                         143

only another name for the old demand for equal distribution, effec-
tively entitlements?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, certainly I again don't remember the full
context of that, but let me just say this, Senator. I was not speak-
ing in a budgetary sense or a more technical sense. I think I was
comparing two views of what rights are today and I thought it was,
as I said, an important discussion and an important debate.

  Senator KENNEDY. In a 1988 article you stated that, and I quote,
"Our current explosion of rights, welfare rights, animal rights,
children's rights, and so on, goes on to the point of trivializing
them."

  You know, which children's rights do you object to?
  Judge THOMAS. I guess I don't object to rights. I was just--the
only point I was making, Senator, and it wasn't in any way under-
mining the need to be concerned about these problems in our socie-
ty. I certainly have been involved with organizations to make sure
that kids are not abused, and I certainly spend my time trying to
make sure that kids are given guidance and help. I think that is
very, very important in our society.
  But my point was that when we talk about rights, rights that we
consider basic or fundamental or freedoms, that when you begin to
attach the word "right" to a particular effort or cause or a pro-
gram that you believe in that then the notion of rights becomes
one that is commonly used, as opposed to reserve for these very,
very important rights that we believe in.
  Again, that is not putting, not in any way saying that there is no
problem, but simply saying that it becomes a common experience
to simply, say, declare a particular right.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, the reason I am pursuing this line of
questioning is to get some kind of sense about your view about var-
ious statutes that will be approved by the Congress to address what
the Congress believes are areas of need, and whether from these
statements that it is fair to draw any implications of some hostility
to statutes which would be drafted by the Congress to try and focus
in the areas of particular needs or protections, for example, the
OSHA for protecting the workplace, or whether it is the food in-
spections, or whether it is in terms of trade, or whether it is in
terms of even parental leave, which you have expressed some
degree of hostility to in your statements.
  The real question is whether we can--we draw any conclusion as
to the degree of hostility that you might have by yourself in inter-
preting statutes given these kinds of statements when perhaps
there is an approach to trying to deal with these kinds of condi-
tions that you may or may not agree with.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, Senator, I think that when one is in a pol-
icymaking function, just as if I were in this body, I could debate
with you on, and I think quite legitimately, about my concerns in
particular areas. I think you have a sort of role, or at least a part
of your function would be an advocate for a particular point of
view.
  But when you make a decision, when you write a statute, when
this body deliberates and concludes, whether I agreed or not in the
policymaking function, when I operate as a judge or when I decide
a case and look at it as a judge, I am no longer an advocate for
                                          144

that policy point of view. My job is to interpret your intent, not to
second-guess your intent. It is not to second-guess what you think
is the appropriate policy. It is not to second-guess whether or not
you are right, not to second-guess whether I think it would be
better to have 10 more rules as opposed to the 5 that you have, but
simply to determine what you felt was right, what you felt was cor-
rect, and what your intent was and to apply that. And that is the
way I see my role now as a judge.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, it is helpful because many of the deci-
sions that are going to be made by the Court over the period of
these next years are going to reflect the basic tension that exists
between an executive and the Congress in the development of legis-
lation and what the Court is going to say on many of these matters
that are increasingly de facto at the present time. So your view
about how you approach this is I think very important, and par-
ticularly in light of these earlier comments.

  Let me move to another subject area, and this is referring to an
article about you in the Atlantic Monthly in 1987. You said that
hiring disparities could be due to cultural differences between men
and women. This is the article "A Question of Fairness," by Juan
Williams.

  That article states that you said that it could be that women are
generally unprepared to do certain kinds of work by their own
choice, it could be that women choose to have babies instead of
going to medical school. Do you still think that that explains the
underrepresentation of women in so many jobs in our economy
today?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, and I think it is important to state this
unequivocally, and I have said this unequivocally in speech after
speech. There is discrimination. There is sex discrimination in our
society. My only point in discussing statistics is that I don't think
any of us can say that we have all the answers as to why there are
statistical disparities.

  For example, if I sit here and I were to look at the statistics in
this city, say with the example of number of blacks, I couldn't--
and compare the number of blacks that are on that side of the
table, for example. I cannot automatically conclude that that is a
result of discrimination. There could be other reasons that should
be explored that aren't necessarily discriminatory reasons.

  I am not justifying discrimination, nor would I shy away from it.
But when we use statistics I think that we need to be careful with
those disparities.

  Senator KENNEDY. Very little I could differ with you on the com-
ment. But I was really driving at a different point, and that is
whether you consider women are generally unprepared to do cer-
tain kinds of work by their own choice; it could be that women
choose babies instead of going to medical school.

  Let me just move on to your comments about Thomas Sowell, an
author whose work you respect and many--whose ideas you have
stated that you agree with. Mr. Sowell wrote a book called the Civil
Rights Rhetoric: A Reality. You reviewed that book for the Lincoln
Review in 1988 as part of a review of the works of Thomas Sowell,
and in particular you praised Mr. Sowell's discussion, chapter 5 of
his book entitled A Special Case of Women," and you called it a
                                         145

much needed anecdote to cliches about women's earnings and pro-
fessional status.

  Mr. Sowell explains that women are paid 59 percent of what men
receive for the same work by saying that women are typically not
educated as often in such highly paid fields as mathematics, sci-
ence, and engineering, nor attracted to physically taxing and well-
paid fields, such as construction work, lumberjacking, and coal
mining, and the like.

  As a matter of fact, there were no women employed in the coal
mine industry in 1973. In 1980, after the Federal Government had
begun an effort to enforce antidiscrimination laws, that 3,300
women are working in coal mines.

  Does that surprise you at all?
  Judge THOMAS. If there is discrimination, it doesn't surprise me.
There were lots of places I think in our society. You know, I used
to when I--I can remember in my own classrooms looking around
and realizing that 7 or 8 of the top 10 students in my classroom in
grammar school were the smartest students and wondering at that
age, If 8 of the 10 of them are the brightest, then why aren't there
women doctors and why aren't there women lawyers.
  But the point that I was making with respect to Professor Sowell
again is a statistical one. There is a difference between the problem
that, say, a 16-year-old or 18-year-old minority kid, female, in this
city or in Savannah or across the country, who is about to--who
has dropped out of high school, there is a difference between the
problems of that child or that student than there is for someone
who has a Ph.D. or someone who has a college degree.
  And I thought that it would be more appropriate, again referring
back to the programs that you talked about, that we talked about
earlier, in looking at how to solve these problems that you disag-
gregate the problems and you be more specific instead of lumping
it all into one set of statistics.
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Sowell goes on to suggest that employers
are justified in believing that married women are less valuable as
employees than married men. He says that if a woman is not will-
ing to work overtime as often as some other workers or needs more
time off for personal emergencies, then they may make her less
valuable as an employee or less promotable to jobs with heavier re-
sponsibilities.
  He says the physical consequences of pregnancy, childbirth alone
are enough to limit a woman's economic option, and then he
reaches some troubling conclusions about women in the workplace
based on stereotyped gender roles. Yet you call those descriptions
of women workers a much needed antidote to cliches.
  Aren't those views the very cliches that women have been trying
to escape for so long?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that someone like a Tom Sowell
is certainly one who is good at engaging a debate, and I think it is
important that there be individuals who look at statistics in his
way.
  I did not indicate that, first of all, that I agreed with his conclu-
sions. But I think this is an important point. I had during my
tenure, I think, the majority of the members of my own personal
staff and the--were women, and the conclusion, for example, about
                                          146

married women I found certainly not supported by my experience
with married women on my staff. That was not the point.

  The point is that I think sometimes that we can be involved in
debate and make generalizations, and it is always good to have
someone who has a different point of view and have some facts to
debate that.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, the reason I raise this is because with
regards to this particular description of women you described that
chapter as a much needed antidote to cliches, and I think many
women would read his description, particularly in that chapter, as
being really a description of the stereotype which--attitude which
has really kept them back in too many instances.

  I am sure you are commendable for what you have done and that
is a powerful factor in relationship, obviously, with other state-
ments or speeches. But nonetheless, that chapter really stands out
and that is why I wanted to bring this up.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I think that--again, Senator, I think it is
important that in our society and as a policymaker that you have
debate. I don't think that Professor Sowell or others are in anyway
sexist or in any way people who would discriminate. I made it a
point, it was very important to me during my tenure at EEOC and
it has been very important to me during my life, to make sure that
these arbitrary stereotypes or these arbitrary discriminatory bar-
riers were knocked down, and I think you can simply look at my
record in promoting women to the Senior Executive Service. I
think it is second to none in the Federal Government. Similarly,
with respect to my personal staff.

  I think it is important. I do think that discrimination exists and
I think it needs to be eradicated. But at the same time, when wedo
have approaches in our society, I think that reasonable people can
disagree, and reasonable people of good will can disagree, without
being characterized in a negative way.

  Senator KENNEDY. In my final area of questioning, I would like
to come back to just an area that was raised by Chairman Biden in
the concluding part of his questions, and that was with regard to
the Lehrman essay.

  In the speech in 1987, called Why Black Americans Should Look
to Conservative Policies, you spoke about natural law, you said,
Heritage Foundation Trust, Lew Lehrman's recent essay, "An
American Spectator," on the Declaration of Independence and the
meaning of the right to life, is a splendid example of applying natu-
ral law.

  The title of the Lehrman article you endorsed is "The Declara-
tion of Independence and the Right to Life: One Leads Unmistak-
ably From the Other." The article makes only one argument and it
is about only one subject, that natural law protects the right to life
and that, as a result, the Constitution must be interpreted to pro-
tect the right to life.

  So, Lehrman's basic position is that abortion violates the consti-
tutional right to life, and he argues that when the Supreme Court
decided Roe v. Wade,it simply conjured up a right of abortion, and
he calls it a spurious right borne exclusively of judicial supremacy,
with not a single trace of lawful authority. He also draws a parallel
between those who support abortion and those who supported slav-
                                          147

ery. He says the decision to protect a woman's right to abortion has
resulted in a holocaust.

  These extreme statements about a woman's right to choose were
all expressed in that article, and you called that article splendid, is
that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, I did not endorse the article, but I
would like to make this point, and it is very important and perhaps
it is one that was missed earlier. My interest toward the end of the
Reagan administration was an important interest to me, and that
was that I had spent almost a decade of my life battling with indi-
viduals who were conservative, and I felt that they should not be
antagonistic to civil rights, and I felt that, in fact, they should be
very aggressive on civil rights.

  In exploring, on a part-time basis during my busy work day, a
unifying theme on civil rights and on the issue of race, I was look-
ing for a way to unify and find a way to talk about slavery and
civil rights, the way that the abolitionists used, the very same ap-
proach that was used and offered in the Brown v. Board ofEduca-
tion brief, authored, among others, by my predecessor, by Justice
Marshall, whose seat I am nominated to fill.

  My point was that I figured or I concluded that conservatives
would be skeptical about the notion of natural law, but one of their
own had endorsed it, and I simply wanted to give some authentici-
ty to my approach, so that I could then move on and get them to
consider being more aggressive on the issue of civil rights. That
was very, very important to me.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, have you ever publicly stated that you
disagree with the article?

  Judge THOMAS. I have never been called on, it has never been
raised as an issue. It was considered, I think by many, as a throw-
away line. I saw it as that, as something to convince my audience
and it has never really come up.

  As I indicated, I don't think that you can use natural law as a
basis for constitutional adjudication, except to the extent that it is
the background in our Declaration, it is a part of the history and
tradition of our country, and it is certainly something that in-
formed some of the early litigation, I guess, with respect to the
14th amendment, but it is certainly something that has formed our
Constitution, but I don't think that it has an appropriate role di-
rectly in constitutional adjudication.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, do you disagree with the article now?
  Judge THOMAS. I do disagree with the article and I did not en-
dorse it before. My point was simply--and I think it was an impor-
tant point--that I endorse natural law, but I use natural law to
make the point that conservatives should aggressively enforce civil
rights.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, do I understand now that you do dis-
agree with the article?
  Judge THOMAS. I disagree in the manner that he used it, yes. I
disagree with the article, yes.
  Senator KENNEDY. Can you elaborate on what
  Judge THOMAS. Well, to the extent that he uses natural law to
make a constitutional adjudication, in that sense, or to provide a
moral code of some sort, I disagree with it.
                                          148

  Senator KENNEDY. But with regards to the other features of the
article?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't know all the other features of the article.
My interest was a very single-minded interest, Senator, and that
was in trying to convince a conservative audience in the Lew Lehr-
man Auditorium of the Heritage Foundation, with a concept that
Lew Lehrman adopted, to make my point, and it was an important
point to me.

  I did not endorse, nor do I now endorse other portions of his arti-
cle.

  Senator KENNEDY. Did you mention in that speech, did you say
anything else about Lew Lehrman, I mean he is a trustee of the
Heritage Foundation, or the work that he has done? Did you say
anything else, other than endorsing this--like most of us in these
kinds of circumstances, you know, perhaps looking about gilding
the lily or so, but there are different ways of doing it, and I am just
asking whether you talked about his work as a trustee of the Herit-
age Foundation or other work that he has done, or was the only
reference to Mr. Lehrman about this article?

  Judge THOMAS. His use of natural law was the only reference.
Again, Senator, this has not been something that has come up in a
way that required explication. The important point for me was a
very simple point, and that was that I was attempting to convince
conservatives, individuals whom I thought would be skeptical about
the notion of natural law and skeptical about aggressive enforce-
ment of civil rights the way that I believe that civil rights should
be endorsed, that here was a basis on which they could be aggres-
sive, and I think it was an important speech, and I saw it, the
manner in which it was quoted prior to my nomination to this
Court was one in which I was criticizing the administration and
criticizing conservatives.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I did not find any reference to civil
rights in the Lehrman article.

  Judge THOMAS. But throughout my speech there is reference.
  Senator KENNEDY. I have read that. Finally, did you agree with
any parts of the article, the Lehrman article?
  Judge THOMAS. My only interest, again, was in the notion that
he used natural law. I do not think that natural law can be used to
adjudicate the issue that he adjudicated.
  Senator KENNEDY. My time is up, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Hatch, and then we will end today's hearing.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  In all due respect, let me just start with the Chairman's excerpt
that he cited to you earlier. That excerpt from the Pacific Research
Institute speech is, in my view, completely out of context, and let
me just read it to you, starting on page 16 of the speech:
  "I find attractive the arguments of scholars such as Stephen
Macedo, who defend an activist Supreme Court which would strike
down laws restricting property rights." You immediately take on
that statement. "But the libertarian argument overlooks the place
of the Supreme Court in the scheme of separation of powers. One
does not strengthen self-government and the rule of law by having
the nondemocratic branch of the government make policy.'
                                         149

  Now, in all honesty, I would ask that the entire speech be placed
in the record, and I would

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.

        THANK YOU, CHIP. I AM HONORED TO HAVE BEEN INVITED TO
ADDRESS YOU. GROUPS LIKE THE PACIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE ARE A
VITAL PART OF AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC LIFE. YOU ENRICH THE DEBATE
WITH YOUR THOUGHTFUL, INDEPENDENT VIEWS ON IMPORTANT PUBLIC
POLICY ISSUES.

        I AM PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL TO ADDRESS SUCH A REFLECTIVE
AUDIENCE, SOME OF WHOM APPRECIATE AN AUTHOR I AM FOND OF, AYN
RAND. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, SHE IS NOT HIGHLY HONORED IN
WASHINGTON, D.C. NONETHELESS, HER BOOKS CONTINUE TO SELL, AND
THAT'S SUCCESS, AT LEAST BY HER STANDARDS.

        IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS WE HAVE SEEN A PERHAPS MORE AMAZING
BEST-SELLER, ALLAN BLOOM'S THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND. IT
HAS BEEN NUMBER ONE ON BEST-SELLER LISTS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. NOW
THIS IS CERTAINLY A DIFFICULT BOOK--AT LEAST FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME
WHO IS NOT SPECIALIST IN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY. IT IS, HOWEVER, A
REWARDING, REASSURING ATTACK ON THE MORAL RELATIVISM THAT
TYPIFIES AND CORRUPTS OUR AGE. BUT WHY SHOULD HIS ARISTOCRATIC
VIEW OF AMERICAN LIFE--IN MANY WAYS MORE ARISTOCRATIC THAN AYN
RAND'S-- BE SO POPULAR? WHAT DO PEOPLE FIND APPEALING ABOUT HIS
ATTACK ON THE UNIVERSITIES?

        SURELY J1UCH OF THE BOOK'S SUCCESS IS DUE TO ITS PUBLICATION
DURING A LONG-SIMMERING DEBATE OVER THE GOALS OF EDUCATION.

BLOOM'S UNCOMPROMISING TOUGHNESS, HIS OBVIOUS LEARNING, CONTRASTS
WITH THE MUSH THAT SO MANY WRITERS ON EDUCATION TYPICALLY DOLE
OUT.

         I SHOULD ADD THAT I HEARTILY APPROVE OF HIS CRITIQUE OF
BLACK STUDIES AND THE DEBILITATING EFFECTS OF PREFERENTIAL
TREATMENT ON BLACK STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE AT ELITE
UNIVERSITIES. BLOOM'S REFLECTIONS ON THE TAKE-OVER ALMOST TWENTY
YEARS AGO AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY COINCIDE WITH THOSE OF ANOTHER
FACULTY MEMBER AT THE TIME, MY FRIEND TOM SOWELL. AS CHAIRMAN OF
THE EEOC I HAVE TRIED TO BASE THE FIGHT AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ON
RECOVERING RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL. IT DOES NOT HELP THE
INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST FOR THAT COMPANY IN
THE FUTURE TO HIRE X NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF HIS OR HER RACE.
JUSTICE BY THE NUMBERS IS GUARANTEED TO PRODUCE INJUSTICE. FOR
EXAMPLE, I THINK WE MAY WELL HAVE SEEN THIS IN DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST ASIAN-AMERICANS AT TOP UNIVERSITIES. BUT I DIGRESS.

        THERE IS A SIDE TO BLOOM'S BOOK WHICH I AM SURE IS NOT FULLY
APPRECIATED. AND IT IS CRUCIAL. LET ME READ A BRIEF PASSAGE
FROM EARLY IN THE BOOK:

         "THE UNITED STATES IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST AND MOST EXTREME
        ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE RATIONAL QUEST FOR THE GOOD LIFE
        ACCORDING TO NATURE. WHAT MAKES ITS POLITICAL STRUCTURE
        POSSIBLE IS THE USE OF THE* RATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL
         RIGHT TO FOUND A PEOPLE, THUS UNITING THE GOOD WITH ONE'S
         OWN. "

        NOW NATURAL RIGHT IS TJi£ CENTRAL THEME OF AMERICAN POLITICS,
FROM THOMAS JEFFERSON TO MARTIN LUTHER KING. UNFORTUNATELY, KING
WAS THE LAST GREAT PUBLIC SPOKESMAN TO ARTICULATE THIS THEME OF A
HIGHER LAW UNDERLYING OUR POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. BLOOM'S SUB-
THEME OF NATURAL RIGHT IS NOT ONLY APPROPRIATE BUT ESSENTIAL FOR
THE CELEBRATION OF OUR CONSTITUTION'S BICENTENNIAL. BUT"WHERE DO
WE RECEIVE EDUCATION IN THE HIGHER LAW? COULD WE DO BETTER THAN
TO RE-READ THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, AND TAKE SERIOUSLY
THE IDEA OF FOUNDING A NATION BASED ON "THE LAWS OF NATURE AND OF
NATURE'S GOD," ESTABLISHED ON SELF-EVIDENT TRUTHS OF HUMAN
EQUALITY AND NATURAL RIGHTS?

        THIS MUST BE OUR ULTIMATE RESOURCE, IF WE ARE TO PRESERVE
POLITICAL FREEDOM. BUT HOW DO WE LEARN ABOUT NATURAL RIGHTS AND
NATURAL LAW? HOW DO WE RESPECT SUCH AN OUTMODED NOTION?

        HERE I THINK BLOOM SELLS THE COUNTRY SHORT. AS IMPORTANT AS
THE UNIVERSITIES ARE, TH-ERE ARE INDEED OTHER SOURCES FOR TEACHING
PEOPLE ABOUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS FOR LIVING. CAREFUL STUDY
OF THE GREAT BOOKS CAN COMPLETE WHAT A DECENT UPBRINGING HAS
BEGUN, BUT IT CANNOT TAKE THE PLACE OF REARING.

         BEAR WITH ME A MINUTE AS I REFLECT BACK ON MY EARLY LIFE.
PICTURE A POORLY EDUCATED, RECENTLY MARRIED YOUNG BLACK MAN
DURING THE DEPRESSION IN SAVANNAH, GEORGIA. ENVISION HIM
                                  154

                                                   -4-

STARTING A WOOD-DELIVERY BUSINESS THEN ADDING COAL, THEN ADDING
ICE, THEN MOVING TO FUEL OIL. PICTURE HIM RISING AT 2:00 OR 3:00
IN THE MORNING TO CUT WOOD AND DELIVER ICE. PICTURE HIM GETTING
ONLY TWO OR THREE HOURS SLEEP PER NIGHT. GO FORWARD IN TIME WITH
HIM AS HE BUILDS HIS OWN HOUSE WITH HIS OWN HANDS AND AS HE
ACQUIRES A MODEST AMOUNT OF PROPERTY. THAT IS THE BRIEF
ENCAPSULATED STORY OF MY OWN GRANDFATHER WHO DURING THE MOST
REPRESSIVE PERIOD OF JIM CROW LAW AND RACIAL BIGOTRY WAS ABLE TO
GAIN SOME DEGREE OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY BECAUSE THERE
WAS AT LEAST SOME ECONOMIC LIBERTY, SOME ECONOMIC FREEDOM, EVEN
THOUGH POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FREEDOM WERE DENIED.

        DO YOU THINK THIS MAN WOULD RAISE HIS GRANDSONS TO IGNORE
ECONOMIC FREEDOM AS A MAJOR PART OF THEIR LIVES? THIS MAN WHO
BELIEVED THAT YOU SHOULD LIVE BY THE SWEAT OF YOUR BROW, THAT YOU
MUST EARN A LIVING, THAT YOU MUST LEARN HOW TO WORK! I REMEMBER
ONE CHRISTMAS WHEN ALL THE OTHER KIDS WERE RUNNING UP AND DOWN
THE ROAD AND ENJOYING THEIR TOYS, SHOOTING FIRECRACKERS, AND
GENERALLY HAVING A GREAT TIME,. MY GRANDFATHER CAME TO ME AND MY
BROTHER (WE WERE 8 AND 9 YEARS "OLD) AND SAID THAT HE HAD WORK FOR
US TO DO. SO, AS USUAL, WE PILED INTO THE 1951 PONTIAC AND RODE.
HE TOOK OS TO A FIELD THAT HAD LAID FALLOW FOR YEARS AND HAD
GROWN UP. HE DROVE DOWN THE REMNANTS OF AN OLD ROAD. WE MADE
OUR WAY ACROSS THE FIELD TO AN OLD OAK TREE. HE LOOKED AT IT,
SURVEYED IT, PACED PENSIVELY AND ANNOUNCED THAT WE WOULD BUILD A
HOUSE THERE. AND, HE MARKED THE SPOT. ON MAY 17, FIVE MONTHS
LATER, WE WERE FINISHING THE STEPS TO THE HOUSE THAT WE BUILT.
                                     155

                                                               -5-

THEN WE FARMED, BUILT FENCES AND BARNS. WE PLANTED MORE AND MORE
EACH YEAR. WE ACQUIRED PIGS, COWS, CHICKENS AND DUCKS. THE
ACHIEVEMENTS GO ON AND ON.

         IN MY GRANDFATHER'S VIEW, A MAN HAD A RIGHT.AND AN
OBLIGATION TO PRODUCE. AND THE RIGHT TO KEEP WHAT HE PRODUCED.
THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THIS MORAL, GOD-FEARING MAN WAS NOT
GENEROUS. INDEED, HE WAS EXTREMELY GENEROUS WITH ALL THAT HE
HAD. BUT, THERE WAS NO SHAME ABOUT WORK, ABOUT THE FREEDOM TO
WORK AND PRODUCE.

        ON THE CONTRARY, IT WAS NECESSARY TO BE FREE TO PRODUCE AND
FREE TO KEEP WHAT HE PRODUCED, TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT AND, HENCE,
PROTECTED FROM SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF BIGOTRY. TO MY GRAND-
FATHER, SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN AN OTHERWISE HOSTILE WORLD, WAS
FREEDOM. WITH FREEDOM TO PRODUCE AND TO OWN, HE COULD AT LEAST
SURVIVE.

        AS THE EVENTS OF THE SIXTIES SWIRLED ABOUT US, PROVISION FOR
SURVIVAL WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY A FAMILY FARM, A FAMILY BUSINESS,
AND A FAMILY EFFORT. THOUGH FULL PARTICIPATION IN THE FREE
ENTERPRISE SYSTEM WAS LIMITED IN MUCH THE SAME WAY, AND FULL
PARTICIPATION IN A FREE SOCIETY WAS LIMITED, MY GRANDPARENTS
FELT THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES WE HAD HERE WERE GREATER THAN
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. AND, IN SPITE OF THE CONTRADICTIONS, WE
FAITHFULLY RECITED THE PLEDGE OF-ALLEGIANCE AND SANG THE STAR
SPANGLED BANNER AT OUR SEGREGATED SCHOOLS. AS WE WERE REMINDED

      56-270 O--93 6

                                                        -6-

EVERY DAY AT THE DINNER TABLE, HARD WORK PRODUCED THE HOUSE WE
LIVED IN, THE CLOTHES WE WORE AND THE FOOD WE ATE. EVEN THOUGH
WE KNEW WE COULD SURVIVE AND DO WELL, IT WAS COMMON KNOWLEDGE WHY
IT WAS SO DIFFICULT ~ WHY THE REWARDS OF OUR EFFORTS WERE NOT
COMMENSURATE WITH THOSE OF WHITES.

         REMINDING OURSELVES THAT BLACKS HAD TO WORK TWICE AS HARD TO
GET HALF AS FAR, MY GRANDPARENTS ALWAYS KNEW THEY WOULD MAKE IT.
THEY KNEW WE WERE INHERENTLY EQUAL UNDER GOD'S LAW -- THE HIGHER
L A W -- AND THAT THE WAY WE WERE TREATED WAS A CRIME AGAINST GOD
EVEN IF NO LAWS OF MAN WERE VIOLATED. THIS BELIEF IN A HIGHER
LAW THAT GUARANTEED OUR NATURAL RIGHTS ENABLED US TO REAFFIRM THE
EXISTENCE AND PRIMACY OF THESE RIGHTS EVEN AS WE WERE BEING
PREVENTED FROM EXERCISING THEM.

        TODAY, THERE APPEARS TO BE A PROLIFERATION OF RIGHTS--
ANIMAL RIGHTS, CHILDREN'S RIGHTS, WELFARE RIGHTS, AND SO ON.
WHAT IS MEANT BY RIGHTS? TODAY, WE ARE COMFORTABLE REFERRING TO
CIVIL RIGHTS. BUT ECONOMIC RIGHTS ARE CONSIDERED ANTAGONISTIC
TO CIVIL RIGHTS -- THE FORMER BEING VENAL AND DIRTY, WHILE THE
LATTER IS LOFTY AND NOBLE. THIS, AS I HAVE NOTED, IS NOT THE WAY
I WAS TAUGHT. AFTER ALL, AREN'T FREE SPEECH AND WORK BOTH MEANS
TO AN EVEN HIGHER END?

        NOW NO ONE WOULD DARE ATTACK MY GRANDFATHER AND HIS
ACHIEVEMENTS. INDEED, PEOPLE MARVEL AT HIM, AND JUSTLY SO. BUT
CONSIDER THE ATTACK ON THE WEALTHY,-OR "THE RICH." WE SEE IT IN
INTELLECTUALS LIKE JOHN KENNETH GALBRAITH OR IN POPULAR
                              157

                              -7-

DEPICTIONS OF AMERICAN BUSINESS. FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT DENOUNCED
THE "MALEFACTORS OF GREAT WEALTH." HIS LATTER-DAY POLITICAL
HEIRS SIMPLY DENOUNCE THE CORRUPTION OF THE WEALTHY. BUT IN FACT
WHAT THE CRITICS REALLY WANT TO DO IS ATTACK THE SOURCES OF
WEALTH, EVEN INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE WEALTH. AND THE
ATTACK ON ECONOMIC RIGHTS IS AN ATTACK ON ALL RIGHTS. OR AS
JAMES MADISON PUT IT IN HIS FAMOUS FEDERALIST PAPER NUMBER 10:
THE FIRST OBJECT OF GOVERNMENT IS THE "PROTECTION OF DIFFERENT
AND UNEQUAL FACULTIES OF ACQUIRING PROPERTY." NOTICE HE DOES NOT
SAY THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD PROTECT AN ALREADY EXISTING, UNEQUAL
DISTRIBUTION OF PROPERTY. MADISON LOOKS FORWARD TO A DYNAMIC
ECONOMY WHICH WOULD UNLEASH HUMAN CAPABILITIES, DESTROYING OLD
ARISTOCRACIES, AND ERECTING NEW ONES, WHICH IN TURN WOULD BE
SUPPLANTED. HENCE IT IS, THAT SOCIALISTS AND THEIR APOLOGISTS
HAVE TO ATTACK THE NOTION OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND REPLACE IT
WITH NOTIONS OF "GROUP RIGHTS" AND "SOCIAL MAN" AND ALL SORTS OF
PRINCIPLES JUSTIFYING ECONOMIC REDISTRIBUTION. AS NOBEL LAUREATE
FRIEDRICH HAYEK SUCCINCTLY PUT IT, "THE STRIVING FOR SECURITY

TENDS TO BECOME STRONGER THAN THE LOVE OF FREEDOM  WITH EVERY

GRANT OF COMPLETE SECURITY TO ONE GROUP THE INSECURITY OF THE

REST NECESSARILY INCREASES." ODDLY ENOUGH SOME CONSERVATIVES AID

AND ABET THE CRITIQUE OF RIGHTS BY AN IRRATIONAL EMBRACE OF

TRADITION AND A MEDIEVAL UNDERSTANDING OF SOCIETY, ANTITHETICAL

TO THE PROTECTION OF RIGHTS.

IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THAT FOR ALL

SOCIALISTS TALK ABOUT EQUALITY, KARL MARX HAD ONLY CONTEMPT FOR

THE NOTION OF EQUAL RIGHTS. THAT'S BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT A FOCUS
                                   158

ON RIGHTS WOULD LEAD INEVITABLY TO INEQUALITIES IN SOCIETY. TRUE
EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY WOULD LEAD TO INEQUALITIES; BUT TO BE
JUSTIFIED ALL INEQUALITIES WOULD HAVE TO BE BASED ON AN ORIGINAL
EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY.

        AS HAYEK HAS NOTED, THE ATTACK ON FREEDOM AND RIGHTS HAD TO
BE ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR REDEFINITION. IN THE SOCIALIST VIEW,
"THE NEW FREEDOM WAS THUS ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR THE OLD DEMAND
FOR AN EQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH." THE NEW FREEDOM MEANT
FREEDOM FROM NECESSITY. AND IT WAS A SHORT ROAD FROM RIGHTS TO
WHAT WE CALL TODAY "ENTITLEMENTS." BEFORE, A RIGHT MEANT THE
FREEDOM TO DO SOMETHING; NOW A RIGHT HAS COME TO MEAN, AT LEAST
IN SOME, UNFORTUNATELY GROWING CIRCLES, THE LEGAL CLAIM TO
RECEIVE AND DEMAND SOMETHING.

        THE ATTACK ON WEALTH IS REALLY AN ATTACK ON THE MEANS TO
ACQUIRE WEALTH: HARD WORK, INTELLIGENCE, AND PURPOSEFULNESS.
AND THAT IN TURN IS AN ATTACK ON PEOPLE LIKE MY GRANDFATHER.
THIS WAS A MAN WHO POSSESSED IN ESSENCE ALL THE MEANS OF
ACQUIRING WEALTH A PERSON COULD NEED. HJS COULD NOT BE ATTACKED;
BUT THE "RICH" AND THEIR CARICATURES ARE EASf TARGETS. THESE
CRITICS OF "THE RICH" REALLY DO" MEAN TO DESTROY PEOPLE LIKE MY
GRANDFATHER, AND DECLARE HIS MANLINESS TO BE FOOLISHNESS AND
WASTED EFFORT.

         BLACKS KNOW WHEN THEY ARE BEING SET UP. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS
HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION IN SOME OF THE RHETORIC
AND STRATEGY ABOUT CIVIL RIGHTS. I HAVE OBJECTED TO THIS THEN,
AS I OBJECT NOW TO THE LEFTIST EXPLOITATION OF POOR BLACK PEOPLE.
THE ATTACK ON WEALTH IN THEIR NAME IS SIMPLY A MEANS TO ADVANCE
                                       159

                                                             -9-

THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OF AJJ, SHOULD BE CAST
A S I D E , TO ADVANCE U T O P I A N S C H E M E S , WHICH I N FACT END IN
DESPOTISM.

          IN MORE RECENT TIMES MY GRANDFATHER WOULD BE PROPOSED BY
SOME WELL-MEANING DEMAGOGUE AS A RECIPIENT OF "ECONOMIC JUSTICE"
OR "SOCIAL J U S T I C E . " THAT WOULD ONLY MEAN THAT HE'D HAVE TO WORK
HARD NOT ONLY FOR HIMSELF BUT FOR A BUNCH OF OTHERS AS WELL. AND
I S N ' T THIS THE VERY DEFINITION OF SLAVERY? SUCH RIGHTS AS WERE
PERMITTED HIM UNDER SEGREGATION HE MADE FULL USE OF. AND HOW
COULD ANYONE TODAY, WHO DOES NOT LABOR UNDER MY GRANDFATHER'S
BURDENS, DO ANY L E S S ? WHY DON'T WE SEE MORE PEOPLE ACTIVELY
PURSUING THE ECONOMIC RIGHTS WHICH HE EXERCISED? (SOME PEOPLE
CALL T H I S SELF-HELP, BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A SPECIAL LABEL.)
I S N ' T I T IRONIC THAT C I V I L RIGHTS ESTABLISHMENT ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE TO PROCLAIM THE NEED FOR SELF-HELP?

          WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE HERE I S THAT WORK I S AN ENORMOUS
MORAL EDUCATOR. SO ARE SPORTS. BOTH HAVE GOALS-- MONEY IN THE
CASE OF WORK, AND HONOR IN THE CASE OF SPORTS. BUT IN PURSUIT OF
THESE-GOALS WE GAIN QUALITIES OF THE S P I R I T HARD TO BRING ABOUT
THROUGH OTHER MEANS. I MEAN QUALITIES SUCH AS S E L F - D I S C I P L I N E ,
S E L F - R E S P E C T , TRUE G E N E R O S I T Y , NOT TO MENTION HEALTH AND
COMRADESHIP.

          SOMETIMES WE GET MEANS CONFUSED WITH ENDS. PEOPLE LIVE FOR
THE SAKE OF WORKING, INSTEAD OF^ MAKING WORK A PART OF THEIR
L I V E S . AND THE CONFUSION OCCURS OFTEN ENOUGH IN THE CASE OF
                                   160

                                                     -10-

SPORTS. YET, THE QUALITIES ONE LEARNS INCIDENTAL TO THE ENDS
(MONEY OR HONOR) OFTEN BECOME MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE ENDS.
TOO OFTEN WE SEE BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL LIFE DERIDED AS
"MATERIALISTIC" AND "CRASS." THESE CRITICS IMPLY WE SHOULD HONOR
IDEALISTIC PROFESSIONS: JOURNALISTS, LAWYERS, AND PROFESSORS.

        BUT I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT A FREE NATION COULD EXIST, IF IT
WERE TO BE COMPRISED SOLELY OUT OF PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE-IR LIVING
BY PRODUCING WORDS. AMERICAN FREEDOM REQUIRES JOURNALISTS,
LAWYERS, AND PROFESSORS, BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ARE THOSE WHO
EXERCISE THEIR ECONOMIC RIGHTS IN COMMERCE. COMMERCE, ALONG WITH
SPORTS, TEACHES US THE CONDITIONS OF FREEDOM. THE UNFAIRLY
RIDICULED CALVIN COOLIDGE KNEW THIS QUITE WELL, WHEN HE CALLED
COMMERCE "THE GREAT ARTISAN OF HUMAN CHARACTER." HE WAS A FAR
CRY FROM A BABBITT BOOSTER OF PETTY AVARICE. "WE MUST FOREVER
REALIZE," HE ONCE DECLARED, "THAT MATERIAL REWARDS ARE LIMITED
AND IN A SENSE THEY ARE ONLY INCIDENTAL, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF
CHARACTER IS UNLIMITED AND IS THE ONLY ESSENTIAL."

        FREEDOM WAS ALWAYS REGARDED AS AN EDUCATOR. THIS IS WHY
TOCQUEVILLE, IN HIS 1835 CLASSIC, DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA. ALWAYS
EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF FREEDOM AS A TEACHER OF A WAY OF
LIFE. FREEDOM WASN'T SIMPLY A LACK OF CONSTRAINTS ON MEN'S
BEHAVIOR. FREEDOM MEANT THAT MEN MOST ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY, OR
LESS THEY WOULD GRADUALLY LOSE THEIR FREEDOM TO A CENTRALIZED
POWER OBLIVIOUS TO THEIR DESIRES.

                                                     -li-

        CERTAINLY THIS VIEW OF COMMERCE AND BUSINESS WAS NOT LOST ON
THE FOUNDING FATHERS. JAMES MADISON, THE MAN WHO MOST
APPROPRIATELY MIGHT BE CALLED THE FATHER OF OUR CONSTITUTION, PUT
IT SUCCINCTLY: "AS A MAN IS SAID TO HAVE A RIGHT TO HIS
PROPERTY, HE MAY EQUALLY BE SAID TO HAVE A PROPERTY IN HIS
RIGHTS." IT IS THIS BROAD NOTION OF PROPERTY-- MEANING ALL THE
HUMAN FACULTIES SUCH AS REASON, PASSION, AND IMAGINATION-- THAT
INFORMED THE WORLD OF THE FOUNDERS.

         EARLIER THIS YEAR, I ADDRESSED AN AUDIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF VIRGINIA LAW SCHOOL. IT WAS INSPIRING TO VISIT, ONCE AGAIN, A
UNIVERSITY FOUNDED TO EDUCATE STATESMEN IN NATURAL RIGHTS. NOW,
I AM FAR FROM BEING A SCHOLAR ON THOMAS JEFFERSON. BUT TWO OF
HIS STATEMENTS SUFFICE AS A BASIS FOR RESTORING OUR ORIGINAL
FOUNDING BELIEF AND RELIANCE ON NATURAL LAW. AND NATURAL LAW,
WHEN APPLIED TO AMERICA, MEANS NOT MEDIEVAL STULTIFICATION BUT
THE LIBERATION OF COMMERCE.

        CONSIDER FIRST, THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE'S RELIANCE
ON THE- "LAWS OF NATURE AND OF NATURE'S GOD." THESE UNDERLIE THE
SELF-EVIDENT TROTHS: "ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL; THAT THEY ARE
ENDOWED BY T1EIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS; THAT
AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS...."
GO FROM THIS TO JEFFERSON'S LAST LETTER. THE DYING JEFFERSON,
ALMOST FIFTY YEARS TO THE DAY AFTER THE DECLARATION WAS
PUBLISHED, REFLECTED FOR THE LAS.T TIME ON THE MEANING OF THE
FOURTH OF JULY:
                                   162

                                                    -12-

                 "THAT FORM tOF GOVERNMENT] WHICH WE HAVE SUBSTITUTED,
        RESTORES THE FREE RIGHT TO THE UNBOUNDED EXERCISE OF REASON
        AND FREEDOM OF OPINION. ALL EYES ARE OPENED, OR OPENING, TO
        THE RIGHTS OF MAN. THE GENERAL SPREAD OF THE LIGHT OF
        SCIENCE HAS ALREADY LAID OPEN TO EVERY VIEW THE PALPABLE
        TRUTH, THAT THE MASS OF MANKIND HAS NOT BEEN BORN WITH
        SADDLES ON THEIR BACKS, NOR A FAVORED FEW BOOTED AND
        SPURRED, READY TO RIDE THEM LEGITIMATELY, BY THE GRACE OF
        GOD."

WHAT CONFIDENCE IN AMERICA! JEFFERSON DOES NOT SPEAK OF THOSE
AMORPHOUS, SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS CALLED "VALUES." THE TRUTH OF THE
RIGHTS OF MAN RESTS ON AN OBJECTIVE TEACHING, A SCIENCE. A
BELIEF IN A HIGHER LAW ENABLES SUCH CONFIDENCE AND PROVIDES
DIRECTION. IF IT DIDN'T FREE THE SLAVES IMMEDIATELY, IT WAS THE
MOST POWERFUL ARGUMENT LINCOLN HAD. IF NATURAL LAW WAS
INSUFFICIENT BY ITSELF TO END THAT LEGACY OF SLAVERY,
SEGREGATION, MARTIN LUTHER KING'S APPEAL TO IT ONCE AGAIN MOVED
AMERICANS. BUT WHERE IS NATURAL LAW TODAY? IS IT GONE, ALONG
 /
 fITH THE SEGREGATED SCHOOLS, BUSES, AND DRINKING FOUNTAINS OF MY
YOUTH?

          WITH MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN MIND, I WOULD LIKE TO USE
THIS OCCASION TO PRESENT A SKETCH OF A THEORY OF NATURAL LAW,
WHICH WOULD DNITE BOTH LIBERTARIAN AND CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES.
I DOUBT THAT WHAT I WILL SAY WILL BE ANYTHING NEW, BUT I THINK IT
I S IMPORTANT TO PRESENT A COHERENT, PRINCIPLED B A S I S FOR
                                    163

                                                      -13-

APPROACHING CURRENT POLITICAL AND ETHICAL QUESTIONS.
         IN AMERICA, THE NATURAL LAW STRENGTHENS THE POSITIVE, OR

MAN-MADE LAW. JUSTICE HOLMES ONCE RIDICULED IT AS A "BROODING
OMNIPRESENCE IN THE SKY." I WOULD LIKEN IT MORE TO A CONSCIENCE
OR, AS LINCOLN PUT IT, A "STANDARD MAXIM" WHICH KEEPS US HONEST.
IT IS, AS BLOOM SUGGESTS, THE ANTIDOTE TO THE RELATIVISM WHICH
CURRENTLY AFFLICTS US. OF COURSE, THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT
VERSIONS OF NATURAL LAW AND NATURAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING SOME IN
SHARP CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER. YET, I THINK ALL OF THEM WOULD
HAVE TO AGREE ON CERTAIN ELEMENTS CONCERNING ECONOMICS. THESE
ARE: FIRST, THE COMMON SENSE OF THE FREE MARKET; SECOND, AS
LINCOLN PUT IT, "THE NATURAL RIGHT TO EAT THE BREAD [ONE] EARNS
WITH [ONE'S] OWN HANDS;" AND THIRD, THE DIGNITY OF LABOR.

        THE FREE MARKET LOGIC OF BUYING LOW AND SELLING HIGH AFFIRMS
COMMON SENSE AND PUNISHES THOSE WHO LACK IT. ITS PRINCIPLES ARE
VIRTUALLY SCIENTIFIC, THOUGH IN PRACTICE PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS
BASED ON SUPERSTITION AND BRIBERY, FOR EXAMPLE. THE FREE MARKET
LOGIC EXISTS WHETHER THE ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS CAPITALISM,
SOCIALISM, OR ANY KIND OF TRADITIONAL ECONOMY. IN FACT, TO HALT
COMPLETELY THE FREE MARKET'S OPERATION REQUIRES TYRANNY. TO
QUOTE THE OLD ROMAN POET, YOU CAN EXPEL NATURE WITH A PITCHFORK,
BUT IT IS 80RE TO RETURN. THOUGH THE FREE MARKET DOES NOT BY
ITSELF GUARANTEE DEMOCRACY, IT DOES REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL
FREEDOM. MOREOVER, THE QUALITIES OF INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT AND
COMPETITIVENESS WHICH IT FOSTERS CERTAINLY POINT TOWARD REGIMES
HONORING FREE ELECTIONS.
                        164

                        -14-

THE SECOND NATURAL LAW PRINCIPLE SUPPORTING THE FREE MARKET

IS THE NATURAL RIGHT TO EARN FROM ONE'S LABOR. JOHN LOCKE, WHOSE

POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY INFORMS OUR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,

MADE THIS A CRUCIAL PRINCIPLE. SLAVERY WAS THUS AN EVIL THAT

THREATENED THE FREEDOM OF ALL IN A SOCIETY THAT TOLERATED IT. IN

OTHER WORDS, THIS PRINCIPLE ELABORATES ON OUR FIRST PRINCIPLE OF

RESPECTING THE IMPULSES OF THE FREE MARKET. THE FREE MARKET

ITSELF RESTS ON CERTAIN ETHICAL ASSUMPTIONS OR AT LEAST ONE MAJOR

ASSUMPTION: ONE CANNOT TRADE IN SLAVES.

I AM REMINDED HERE OF THE GREAT COURT SCENE IN SHAKESPEARE'S

MERCHANT OF VENICE. IN WHICH SHYLOCK JUSTIFIES HIS TAKING A POUND

OF FLESH FROM ANTONIO.

"WHAT JUDGMENT SHALL I DREAD, DOING NO WRONG?

YOU HAVE AMONG YOU MANY A PURCHAS'D SLAVE,

WHICH, LIKE YOUR ASSES AND YOUR DOGS AND MULES,

YOU USE IN ABJECT AND IN SLAVISH PARTS,

BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT THEM. SHALL I SAY TO YOU,

"LET THEM BE FREE       " YOU WILL ANSWER,

"THE SLAVES ARE OURS." SO DO I ANSWER YOU.

THE POUND OF FLESH WHICH I DEMAND OF HIM

IS DEARLY BOUGHT, 'TIS NINE, AND I WILL HAVE IT.

IF YOO DENY ME, FIE UPON YOUR LAW1

THERE IS NO FORCE IN THE DECREES OF VENICE."

BY PERMITTING THE SLAVE-TRADE, VENICE RELINQUISHED ITS RIGHT TO
CONDEMN OTHER FORMS OF BARBARISM, SUCH AS THE TAKING OF THE POUND
OF FLESH. THE VENETIANS FALL SILENT, AND IT TAKES THE CLEVER
                                  165

                                                    -15-

PORTIA TO SAVE THE DAY. SHAKESPEARE HAD SPOTTED A F^TAL
CONTRADICTION IN A SEEMINGLY VERY FREE SOCIETY. AND VENICE WOULD
EXACT ITS EQUALLY IRRATIONAL REVENGE ON SHYLOCK.

        THUS, I WOULD JUSTIFY GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN CASES TO
INSURE THAT THE FREE MARKET IS TRULY FREE. IN MY YEARS AT THE
EEOC I HAVE TRIED TO MOVE TOWARD THIS IDEAL.

        FINALLY, TO THE FREE MARKET PRINCIPLE AND THE PRINCIPLE
FORBIDDING ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS, I ADD THE PRINCIPLE OF THE
DIGNITY OF LABOR. FROM ALLAN BLOOM'S BOOK ONE CAN GET THE
IMPRESSION THAT LIFE IS LED SOLELY IN THE MIND. BUT WITHOUT
LABOR, THE WORK OF ONE'S BODY, ONE CAN FEEL SELF-CONTEMPT. THIS
ATTITUDE CAN IN TURN HAVE OTHER CONSEQUENCES DELETERIOUS TO
FREEDOM AND DECENCY.

        I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PERUSING ONE OF THOSE GREAT BOOKS BLOOM
CITES FREQUENTLY, TOCQUEVILLE'S DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA. ONE OF THE
MOST STRIKING OBSERVATIONS HE MAKES CONCERNS THE RADICALLY
DIFFERING EFFECTS OF SLAVERY AND FREE LABOR. HE CONTRASTS THE
ETHOS IN THE FREE STATE OF OHIO WITH THAT IN THE NEIGHBORING
SLAVE STATE OF KENTUCKY. LET ME READ A BRIEF PASSAGE, JUST TO
GIVE YOU A FLAVOR OF THAT DISCUSSION. IN THE SLAVE STATE

         "WORK IS CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF SLAVERY, BUT [IN THE
        FREE STATE] WITH WELL-BEING AND PROGRESS; ON THE ONE SIDE IT
         IS DEGRADING, BUT ON THE OTHER HONORABLE; ON THE LEFT BANK
        NO WHITE LABORERS ARE TO BE FOUND, FOR THEY WOULD BE AFRAID
        OF BEING LIKE THE SLAVES; FOR WORK PEOPLE MUST RELY ON THE
         NEGROES.... THE AMERICAN [IN THE SLAVE STATE] SCORNS NOT
        ONLY WORK ITSELF BUT ALSO ENTERPRISES IN WHICH WORK IS
                                  166

                                                  -16-

        NECESSARY TO SUCCESS; LIVING IN IDLE EASE, HE HAS THE TASTES
        OF IDLE MEN; MONEY HAS LOST SOME OF ITS VALUE IN HIS EYES;
         HE IS LESS INTERESTED IN WEALTH THAN IN EXCITEMENT AND
        PLEASURE AND EXPENDS IN THAT DIRECTION THE ENERGY WHICH HIS
         [FREE STATE] NEIGHBOR PUTS TO OTHER USE "

WORK HAS A DIGNITY WHICH IN TURN GIVES MEANING TO OTHER SPHERES
OF LIFE. THIS IS A PART OF THE HUMAN CONDITION, AN ELEMENT OF
HUMAN NATURE, WHICH ANY DECENT GOVERNMENT OR SOCIETY MUST
RESPECT.

        NOW I REALIZE THIS IS JUST A BEGINNING OF A PROJECT, BUT I
HOPE IT IS OF SOME USE.

        LET ME SAY THIS IN PASSING ABOUT RECENT ISSUES INVOLVING THE
SUPREME COURT. I FIND ATTRACTIVE THE ARGUMENTS OF SCHOLARS SUCH
AS STEPHEN MACEDO WHO DEFEND AN ACTIVIST SUPREME COURT, WHICH
WOULD STRIKE DOWN LAWS RESTRICTING PROPERTY RIGHTS. BUT THE
LIBERTARIAN ARGUMENT OVERLOOKS THE PLACE OF THE SUPREME COURT IN
A SCHEME OF SEPARATION OF POWERS. ONE DOES NOT STRENGTHEN SELF-
GOVERNMENT AND THE RULE OF LAW BY HAVING THE NON-DEMOCRATIC
BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT MAKE POLICY. HENCE, I STRONGLY SUPPORT
THE NOMINATION OF BOB BORK TO THE SUPREME COURT. JUDGE BORK IS
NO EXTREMIST OF ANY KIND. IF ANYTHING, HE IS AN EXTREME
MODERATE, OMB WHO BELIEVES IN THE MODESTY OF THE COURT'S POWERS,
WITH RESPECT TO THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED BRANCHES OF
GOVERNMENT. I AM APPALLED BY THE MUD-SLINGING CJffl DEBATE OVER
THE BORK NOMINATION. THE VERY IDEA OF THE SUPREME COURT IS TO
DISPENSE IMPARTIAL JUSTICE, ONE ABOVE THE STRUGGLE OF SPECIAL
                                  167

                                                   -17-

INTEREST GROUPS. OF COURSE WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 50 OR
SO YEARS IS A GROWTH OF POWER IN THE NON-ELECTED BRANCHES. AND
MUCH OF WHAT IS DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY WINDS UP IN THE COURTS. SO
THE COURTS AND THE BUREAUCRACY ARE LOBBIED. AND NOW A SUPREME
COURT NOMINATION-- OF A DISTINGUISHED SCHOLAR-- IS TREATED AS
THOUGH IT WERE AN ELECTION FOR THE LOCAL ZONING COMMISSION. IT
IS A TRAGEDY FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE NOTION OF IMPARTIAL
JUSTICE. AFTER ALL, IF IT TAKES A JUDGE TO SOLVE OUR "COUNTRY'S
PROBLEMS, THEN DEMOCRACY AND THE RULE OF LAW ARE DEAD. AND I FOR
ONE, ALONG WITH BOB BORK, AM NOT YET READY TO GIVE UP ON SELF-
GOVERNMENT. IRONICALLY, BY OBJECTING AS VOCIFEROUSLY AS THEY
HAVE TO JUDGE BORK'S NOMINATION, THESE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS
UNDERMINE THEIR OWN CLAIM TO BE PROTECTED BY THE COURT. AGAIN,
THE COURT HAS ITS DIGNITY, AND ITS POWER, BY VIRTUE OF BEING
ABOVE AND BEYOND SUCH CLAMORING.

        LET ME CONCLUDE BY QUOTING AGAIN FROM ALLAN BLOOM'S BOOK.
HERE HE LAMENTS THE PASSING OF A VIEW FORMERLY HELD BY AMERICANS
ON NATURAL RIGHTS:

         "BY RECOGNIZING AND ACCEPTING MAN'S NATURAL RIGHTS, MEN
        ·FOUND A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF UNITY AND SAMENESS. CLASS,
         RACE, RELIGION, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR CULTURE ALL DISAPPEAR OR
         BECOm DIM WHEN BATHED IN THE LIGHT OF NATURAL RIGHTS, WHICH
         GIVE HEN COMMON INTERESTS AND MAKE THEM TRULY BROTHERS."
I WOULD ONLY ADD TO BLOOM'S WISE OBSERVATIONS HERE, THAT A
RENEWED EMPHASIS ON ECONOMIC RIGHTS MOST PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE
REVIVAL OF THE NATURAL RIGHTS POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY THAT HAS
BROUGHT THIS NATION TO ITS SECOND BICENTENNIAL YEAR.

THANK YOU!

  Senator HATCH. I would also suggest that we not pluck a sen-
tence out of context, none of us should do that, from 138 speeches
that you gave. Gee, I would hate to remember all the speeches I
gave in any given period of time, and I think we ought to have it
all in context and you ought to be given a copy of it, so that you
can refer to the actual language. I think that is the only fair way
to do it. The committee has

  The CHAIRMAN. If the Senator would yield for a moment. Before
the hearing even began, on Friday I told the witness that the first
thing I would ask him about was Macedo. I specifically told him, so
he understood that, even back then.

  Senator HATCH. I am not suggesting the Chairman is unfair. I
am saying that the process is unfair, if we do not do at least this.
When we want to quote a line out of context, I am suggesting from
here on in, let us give the Judge a copy of the speech and refer to
the line that you are quoting on, because this one was clearly out
of context, and clearly he was not endorsing the Macedo definition
of an activist Supreme Court. I mean it is very clear to anybody
who reads it.

  This committee has obtained over 30,000 pages of documents or
material from this nominee, and I think if he is asked about one of
his writings, he at least ought to be able to see it in front of him,
and I would suggest we follow that procedure.

  Judge let me ask you this: Will any of the writings or speeches
cited today affect you in your role as a judge or as a Justice in this
particular case, or will you rely on the actual text of the law, the
legislative history, prior case law, et cetera?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I noted, my interest particularly in
the area of natural rights was as a part-time political theorist at
EEOC who was looking for a way to unify and to strengthen the
whole effort to enforce our civil rights laws, as well as questions, to
answer questions about slavery and to answer questions about
people like my grandfather being denied opportunities. Those were
important questions for me.

  When one becomes a judge--and I think I alluded to this in my
confirmation hearing for the court of appeals--there are approach-
es to adjudicating cases and to understanding statutes, to analyzing
statutes and determining meanings in statutes or your intent in
statutes, as well as constitutional adjudication.

  I do not see how my writings in a policy context, I do not see
that they will affect anything that I do on the Supreme Court. As I
noted that the whole notion of natural law, as our Founders be-
lieved it, is a background of our regime, and to the extent that it is
used at all, it is an understanding of the way that they looked at
our regime and at the way that they, in the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, felt that our country should operate, and, of course, that
then is translated into provisions that they drafted for the Consti-
tution itself. It informs us as to the value that they put on individ-
ual freedom, for example. I think that is important, but that does
not play a direct role in adjudicating cases on a constitutional
basis.

  Senator HATCH. I agree with that. In the November 1987 Reason
article cited by Senator Kennedy, it was an interview, an off-the-
cuff interview, I take it. Reason says, "I suspect that he might
                                         169

think that the EEOC ought not to exist," talking about Thomas.
The question put to you was this: "Why do you think that this
agency should exist in a free society?" Your answer was, "Well, in
a free society"--later today, you said, "Well, in a perfect society," I
think that is what you meant by that--"Well, in a free or perfect
society, I don't think there would be a need for it to exist. Had we
lived up to our Constitution, had we lived up to the principles that
we espoused, there would certainly be no need."

  "There would have been no need for manumission either. Unfor-
tunately, the reality was that, for political reasons or whatever,
there was a need to enforce antidiscrimination laws, or at least
there was as perceived need to do that. Why do you need a Depart-
ment of Labor? Why do you need a Department of Agriculture?
Why do you need a Department of Commerce?"

  Those appear to me to be rhetorical questions, in light of the
point you are making, in a perfect world you do not need them, but
here was discrimination and we needed to enforce antidiscrimina-
tion laws.

  You can go down the whole list of Federal agencies, you say, and
you do not need any of them, really. But what you meant was, and
it is apparent, as you read this carefully, in a perfect world. You go
on to say, "I think, though, if I had to look at the role of Govern-
ment and what it does in people's lives, I see the EEOC as having
much more legitimacy than the others, if properly run." That's a
hands-on person-to-person agency that is dealing with the most
common problems in employment law and in discrimination and in
opportunity.

  Is that not correct?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator HATCH. Well, here is what you say: "Now, if you run the
risk that the authority can be abused, when EEOC or any organiza-
tion starts dictating to people, I think they go far beyond anything
that should be tolerated in this society. That is a far cry from
what was implied in the questions to you.
  You go on to say other things that I think you make pretty clear.
Still, it was an off-the-cuff interview with a publishing group.
Frankly, I think it was pretty clear that you were not arguing we
should do away with all of these agencies, unless we had a perfect
world. Is that a fair summary of that?
  Judge THOMAS. That is the point in that interview that I was
trying to make. The question--and that is Reason magazine, if I re-
member correctly, is a libertarian magazine, and some libertarians
believe that there should be no organizations and no governmental
agencies such as the EEOC, so the question then becomes how do
you justify, if you are for the individual, how do you justify a gov-
ernmental agency that, in affairs and relationships, the employ-
ment relationship between individuals, and the response is, well, if
this were a perfect world, you might be right, but this is not a per-
fect world, and if there is a justification for any kind of an agency
in our Government, and there are many, then EEOC is at the top
of that list.
  Senator HATCH. I suspect that you are going to be criticized for
your tenure at the EEOC. I cited the Washington Post praise of
you. I cited U.S. News & World Report's praise of you. As former
                                         170

Chairman of the Labor Committee and currently ranking member,
we had a lot to do with the EEOC, and I have to tell you, you did a
good job running that agency. Was it perfect? No, but you did a
good job. Frankly, you took it seriously and you brought more cases
than any other EEOC Chairman in history, and you recovered over
a billion dollars in those cases, and we could go on and on.

  Tell me, generally, your reaction to these comments, Judge:
"Natural law is not a theory of legal interpretation," according to
Professor Robert George, of Princeton University, who is a lawyer
and holds a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford University.
"Rather," he goes on to say, "it is a theory of law that holds that
there are true standards or principles of morality, that human
beings are bound in reason to respect, and that among these are
norms of justice and human rights that may not be sacrificed for
the sake of social utility. Both liberals and conservatives share a
belief in fundamental principles of justice and right, however much
they disagree about the exact content and implications of some of
these principles. The relevance of natural law to judging, it is that
out of respect for the rule of law, judges are obliged to recognize
the limits of their own authority. The scope of a judge's authority
is settled not by natural law, but the constitutional allocation of
political authority among the judicial and other branches of gov-
ernment."

  Now, as Professor George has written, belief in natural law is
perfectly consistent with fidelity to the Constitution, as the su-
preme law of the land and the commitment to judicial restraint.
Now, whatever may be your views of the rights and wrongs of vari-
ous social issues as a matter of natural law, it seems to me your
commitment to natural law and natural rights neither permits you
nor requires you to treat the Constitution as a vehicle for imposing
those ideas on the rest of the country. Do you agree basically with
that statement?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that is, in part, the point that I
was attempting to make. My interest, for example, was in the fact
that, in our country, you had a stated ideal in the declaration, all
men are created equal.

  Senator HATCH. Natural law means there should not be slaves,
right?

  Judge THOMAS. That is the next step, that if that is true, then
how can one person own another person, and yet you had slavery
existing at the same time the declaration existed. In order to
change that constitutionally, not as a matter of principle in our
regime, but constitutionally you needed an amendment to the Con-
stitution, and I indicated that. There is a difference between the
ideal and the Constitution itself.

  With respect to constitutional adjudication, I do not think that
there is a direct role for natural law in constitutional adjudication.
It is a part of our history and tradition. It is a part of our back-
ground and our country. It is a belief that a number of our drafters
held. It is in our Declaration, and as I mentioned before, it is
prominent in the brief filed by the NAACP in Brown v. Board of
Education, to show the ideals of this country, but even there as an
appendix, I think it is listed as a political philosophy section.
                                         171

  I do not know, I cannot remember whether it was advocated as a
way to adjudicate, but my point is that it does not, it is not a
method of constitutional adjudication. When I was speaking as
Chairman of EEOC, again, I was a policymaker. I was not a litiga-
tor and I was not a constitutional law professor.

  Senator HATCH. That is a good distinction, by the way.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, it was an important one for me and it is an
important one for me now. When one is a judge, from my stand-
point, one does not go into one's own personal philosophies and
apply those personal philosophies in one's effort to adjudicate
cases. I think that there are principles, there are traditional ap-
proaches that have been used, and I have confined myself and
would confine myself to that.
  Senator HATCH. When you are talking about natural law, you
are talking about equality?
  Judge THOMAS. That all men are created equal, that is basic law.
  Senator HATCH. That is right, and you are taking that from the
Declaration of Independence.
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator HATCH. And you are saying that is why we needed the
13th, 14th and 15th amendments.
  Judge THOMAS. That was the most apparent and grossest contra-
diction in our society, that you had declaration declaring all of us
to be equal, and yet the coexistence with that of slavery.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I find it to be interesting, because Judge
Bork was criticized because he did not particularly endorse the
principle of natural law in constitutional adjudication, and now
you are being criticized because you purportedly do. Frankly, it is a
double standard, and, I might add, by the same committee.
  What I interpret you to be saying--and maybe I am wrong, and
you correct me if I am wrong--is that when it comes to natural law
and the Constitution, the Constitution takes preeminence.
  Judge THOMAS. The Constitution is our law, it is the law of our
land. The natural law philosophy is a political theory, my interest
was political theory, it was not constitutional law.
  Senator HATCH. SO, when you become a Justice on the U.S. Su-
preme Court, and I believe you will, you intend to uphold the Con-
stitution of the United States, is that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. With every fiber in my body.
  Senator HATCH. Above anything else?
  Judge THOMAS. My job is to uphold the Constitution of the
United States, not personal philosophy or political theories.
  Senator HATCH. I think that is a pretty good way of putting it.
Some have criticized natural law as being outside the mainstream.
I have seen articles by some of our eminent law professors in this
country, at least one in particular that I can see. If natural law is
outside the mainstream, then so is the Declaration of Independ-
ence, and that is the point you are making, it seems to me. As Pro-
fessor Robert George, of Princeton University, observed, if you be-
lieve that slavery was inherently unjust and should have been
abolished, you believe in natural law of some sort. Throughout our
American history, many of our greatest leaders, Thomas Jefferson,
Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr., they have all invoked
natural law in their struggles against injustices of their times.
                                         172

  Now, I think you are being accused, if you believe in natural law,
then that means that would make you a conservative judicial activ-
ist. Now, I have to tell you, as much as I care for you and as much
as I know you and believe in you, if you are going to go on the
bench to be a conservative judicial activist, I am going to be
against you as much as if you were a liberal judicial activist, be-
cause I do not think that is the purpose of that role on the court.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that was the point, and I have to
go back and read the speech involved, but that was the point of the
criticism of Macedo, that he indeed was an activist and I think
there was some debate about that, and I do not think the role of
the Court is to have an agenda to say, for example, that you be-
lieve the Court should change the face of the earth. That is not the
Court's role.

  There are some individuals who think, for example, as the Chair-
man mentioned earlier, that the whole landscape with respect to
economic rights should be changed, and I criticize that.

  Senator HATCH. AS I understand both of our personal discussions
and also from reading some of the things you have written, you
recognize the natural law principles of the Declaration of Inde-
pendence as reflected in the written Constitution, that they con-
strain both legislative majorities and the courts. Am I correct on
that?

  Judge THOMAS. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. Moreover, many who criticize you today for ac-
knowledging the existence of natural law were the most vociferous
critics of Judge Bork 4 years ago for not acknowledging the exist-
ence of natural law. I just want to make that point.
  By endorsing Lewis Lehrman's article in the American Specta-
tor, some say that you have signaled that you would vote to over-
turn Roe v. Wade. Well, I think you have made it pretty clear. You
were complimenting Lehrman as trustee of the Heritage Founda-
tion in the Lehrman Hall when you made that particular remark
in a nine, single-spaced-page talk that you gave. As Senator Dan-
forth has said, to say that Judge Thomas thereby adopted or en-
dorsed Lewis Lehrman's entire article is like suggesting that any of
our references to a "distinguished colleague" in the Senate is a
full-fledged endorsement of everything that "distinguished col-
league" has ever said. Now, that is ridiculous, and I personally
think the implication is ridiculous as well.
  But let me just ask you the question. Have you made up your
mind, Judge Thomas, on how you will vote when abortion issues
are before the Court as a Justice on the Court?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there is a lesson that I think we all
learn when we become judges, and I think it happens to you after
you have had your first case; that you walk in sometimes, even
after you have read the briefs and you think you might have an
answer. And you go to oral argument, and after oral arguments
you think you might have an answer.
  Senator HATCH. That is right.
  Judge THOMAS. And after you sit down and you attempt to write
the opinion, you thought you had an answer, and you change your
mind.
                                         173

  I think it is inappropriate for any judge who is worth his or her
salt to prejudge any issue or to sit on a case in which he or she has
such strong views that he or she cannot be impartial. And to think
that as a judge that you are infallible I think totally undermines
the process. You have to sit. You have to listen. You have to hear
the arguments. You have to allow the adversarial process to think.
You have to be open. And you have to be willing to work through
the problem.

  I don't sit on any issues, on any cases that I have prejudged. I
think that it would totally undermine and compromise my capacity
as a judge.

  Senator HATCH. I think that says it all. But let me just say this: I
have been interested in some of these questions about substantive
due process issues. As you know, the first substantive due process
case was the Dred Scott case in 1857. That is where the Supreme
Court held that the "Liberty prong" of the due process clause pre-
vented Congress from forbidding slavery in the territories.

  Now, later in the 19th century and the early 20th century, the
Supreme Court employed substantive due process in Lochner v.
New York--that is the case that came up earlier--to strike down
astute law that limited the numbers of hours that bakery workers
could work in a week. The New York legislature passed the law,
and Lochner struck it down.

  There were other substantive due process cases up until the
1930's, and all of those struck down efforts by the States to regu-
late the workplace and the economy. And substantive due process
was basically dormant from that time until the early 1960's when
the Court, of course, began to use substantive due process to
achieve liberal results, or should I say liberal social policy results.

  Now, according to some of my liberal colleagues that was all
right, but the earlier use of substantive due process was wrong. I
am telling you both of them are wrong. The fact of the matter is
that nobody in his right mind believes that you are going to go
strike down all of the social policy results that the Congress has
passed, including OSHA, food safety laws, child care legislation,
welfare laws, fair housing laws, low-income housing, and so forth.

  Is there even any shred of evidence or any shred of thought that
you would be the type of judge that would be a substantive due
process judicial activist that would take us back to the Lochner
days?

  Judge THOMAS. TO my way of thinking, Senator, there isn't. I
think that the post-Lochner era cases were correct. I think that the
Court determined correctly that it was the role of Congress, it was
the role of the legislature to make those very, very difficult deci-
sions and complex decisions about health and safety and work
standards, work hours, wage and hour decisions, and that the
Court did not serve the role as the superlegislature to second-guess
the legislature.

  I think that those post-Lochner era cases were correctly decided,
and I see no reason why those cases and that line of cases should
have been or should be revisited.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I agree with you. I have to note that it is
somewhat ironic for my liberal colleagues to express concern that
judges might start striking down economic regulations the way the
                                          174

liberal judges in some ways have invented criminal rights, struck
down pornography restrictions, have run local high schools, and
imposed taxes on cities and local governments. And you could go
on and on with some of these things that activist courts have been
doing up to today. And I too think that it would be wrong for
judges to strike down economic regulation, just like you do.

  But what the liberals really ought to understand is that no one is
safe when judges depart from the text of the written Constitution,
and that is what has been happening from time to time. What we
need are judges that won't make up the law in order to institution-
alize their own social policy ideas or to impose their own values,
liberal or conservative, on the American people.

  I think the people can choose between liberal and conservative
policies, but they should choose between them where they ought to
choose between them, and that is in the elective process. That is
what we are here for. They can choose by voting for whoever they
want to in the elective process to make these laws, not judges on
the bench. And that is what really is at stake in this.

  I could go on and on. I notice that everybody is probably pretty
tired by now, but let me just say this: In fulfillment of your duties
as a Justice on the Supreme Court, are you going to be guided by
Stephen Macedo and his ideas?

  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely not.
  Senator HATCH. I didn't think so. And I don't think anybody else
thought so.
  Do you intend to elevate property rights over individual rights
and liberties, as was done in the early part of this century under
the Lochner case its whole progeny of cases?
  Judge THOMAS. I certainly have no intention of doing that, Sena-
tor. The Court has attempted to approach rights such as on the eco-
nomic decisions of the legislature, the classifications according to
race, et cetera, in a way that I think is appropriate. It attempts to
accord a value to these.
  The point that I was making is that the notion of property is in
the Constitution. That in no way says how those cases should be
adjudicated.
  Senator HATCH. Well, you know, in those days they elevated the
so-called right of contract above the individual rights of individual
human beings. And the right of contract took precedence over indi-
vidual rights and freedoms where the right of government to ease
the burdens and the pains and the difficulties of the working-class
and the poor through health and welfare programs, wage and hour
legislation, and other matters that they chose to do. The Court at
that time said that that was all outweighed by the right of con-
tract.
  Well, I don't know of anybody that wants to go back to those
days. Now, some can misconstrue Professor Epstein to believe that
that is what he wants to do. I don't believe he wants to do that.
  But to make a long story short, Judge Thomas, I personally am
very proud of your nomination, and I believe that you will bring a
dimension to this Court that really hasn't been there before, be-
cause I don't think you are going to be characterized in any par-
ticular pocket of anybody. And I know you well enough to know
that you are fiercely independent and that you will do what you
                                         175

believe is right within the Constitution. And I believe we have cov-
ered this principle of natural law, at least as much as we could
here today.

  I want to commend you for this opportunity. A lot of us intend to
see that you have this opportunity, and I sure wish you the best in
being able to serve on that Court and to do it in the best interest of
all Americans and in the right way, and within the confines of the
Constitution, and in the way that I think you have been chatting
with us today. So I commend you for what you have said, and I
hope we can enjoy the rest of your testimony tomorrow.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Let me conclude today by pointing out one thing. No one, not-
withstanding my distinguished friend, thus far has criticized your
view on natural law or whether or not natural law is beneficial.
We are just trying to find out if you have a view on natural law
and what it is. For the record, no one is criticizing your view. Pro-
fessor Bork criticizes natural law. I do not. No one has criticized
your view. We are just going to try to find out what it is.
  Senator HATCH. I am sure glad to have that on the record, I will
tell you.
  The CHAIRMAN. With that, the hearing is adjourned until tomor-
row at 10 o'clock.
  [Whereupon, at 5:30 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 10 a.m., Wednesday, September 11, 1991.]
NOMINATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                    WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1991

                                                                   U.S. SENATE,
                                               COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                         Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice at 10:05 a.m., in room
325, Senate Caucus Room, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon.
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chairman of the committee) presiding.
  Present: Senators Biden, Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini,
Leahy, Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley,
Specter, and Brown.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Welcome back, Judge. It is a pleasure to have you back. Let me
very, very briefly explain to you, your family, and everyone else
the process this morning. I expect that we will have four Senators
question before we break for lunch. If I were you, I would probably
want to break after 2, but it is up to you. I will go through four
Senators until lunchtime unless there is some indication from you
or anyone else that you would like to stop and take a break. I will
be glad to give you a break to get a cup of coffee or anything else
you want.
  Now, we need to get started. Do you have a preference, Judge, as
to how you would like to proceed? Really, I am not kidding. Any
way you want to do it.
  Judge THOMAS. We will play it by ear.
  The CHAIRMAN. Play it by ear. I agree with you. All right.
  Now, we will start this morning's questioning in the same format
as before; each Senator will have Vz hour for his questions and
your response. We will start this morning with Senator Metz-
enbaum.
  I might add that we do not plan on going beyond 5 o'clock today
unless we are very close to finshing. We are going to try to end the
hearing today at 5 and we will pick up tomorrow at 10 o'clock no
matter what. I expect we will still have questions for the judge if
people haven't had their second round.
  With that, let me yield the floor to Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Good morning, Judge Thomas. Nice to see you again. You have
an extensive record of speeches and published articles. Judge, I
have made no secret of the fact that I have serious concerns with
many of the things in your record.

                                                          (177)
                                          178

  Yesterday I thought we would finally get some answers about
your views. Instead of explaining your views, though, you actually
ran from them and disavowed them.

  Now, in a 1989 article in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public
Policy, you wrote, "The higher law background of the American
Constitution, whether explicitly appealed to or not, provides the
only firm basis for just, wise, and constitutional decisions."

  Judge you emphasized the word "constitutional" by placing it in
italics. By that emphasis, you made it very clear you were talking
about the use of higher law in constitutional decisions. But yester-
day you said, "I don't see a role for the use of natural law in consti-
tutional adjudication. My interest was purely in the context of po-
litical theory."

  Then in 1987, in a speech to the ABA, you said, "Economic rights
are as protected as any other rights in the Constitution." But yes-
terday you said, "The Supreme Court cases that decided that eco-
nomic rights have lesser protection were correctly decided."

  In 1987, in a speech at the Heritage Foundation, you said, "Lewis
Lehrman's diatribe against the right to choose was a splendid ex-
ample of applying natural law." But yesterday you said, "I disagree
with the article, and I did not endorse it before."

  In 1987, you signed on to a White House working group report
that criticized as "fatally flawed," a whole line of cases concerned
with the right to privacy. But yesterday you said you never read
the controversial and highly publicized report, and that you believe
the Constitution protects the very right the report criticizes.

  In all of your 150-plus speeches and dozens of articles, your only
reference to a right to privacy was to criticize a constitutional ar-
gument in support of that right. Yesterday you said there is a right
to privacy.

  Now, Judge Thomas, I am frank to say to you, I want to be fair
in arriving at a conclusion, and I feel that I speak for every
member of this committee who wants to be fair. Our only way to
judge you is by looking at your past statements and your record.
And I will be frank; your complete repudiation of your past record
makes our job very difficult. We don't know if the Judge Thomas
who has been speaking and writing throughout his adult life is the
same man up for confirmation before us today. And I must tell you
it gives me a great deal of concern.

  For example, yesterday, in response to a question from Senator
Biden, you said that you support a right to privacy. Frankly, I was
surprised to hear you say that. I have not been able to find any-
thing in your many speeches or articles to suggest that you support
a right to privacy.

  Unfortunately, the committee has learned the hard way that a
Supreme Court nominee's support for the right to privacy doesn't
automatically mean that he or she supports that fundamental right
when it involves a woman's right to abortion. At his confirmation
hearing, Judge Kennedy told us he supported the right to privacy.
Since he joined the Court, Justice Kennedy has twice voted with
Chief Justice Rehnquist in cases that have restricted the right to
abortion.

  Likewise, Justice Souter told us that he supported the right to
privacy, and then when he joined the Court, Justice Souter voted
with the majority in Rust v. Sullivan.

  My concern is this--and I know I have been rather lengthy in
this first question. Your statement yesterday in support of the
right to privacy does not tell us anything about whether you be-
lieve that the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose to
terminate her pregnancy. I fear that you, like other nominees
before the committee, could assure us that you support a funda-
mental right to privacy, but could also decline to find that a
woman's right to choose is protected by the Constitution. If that
happens soon, there could be nowhere for many women to go for a
safe and legal abortion.

  I must ask you to tell us here and now whether you believe that
the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose to terminate
her pregnancy, and I am not asking you as to how you would vote
in connection with any case before the Court.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I would like to respond to your opening
question first and, if you think it appropriate, to consider each of
your questions seriatim.

  Yesterday as I spoke about the Framers and our Constitution
and the higher law background--and it is background--is that our
Framers had a view of the world. They subscribed to the notion of
natural law, certainly the Framers of the 13th and 14th amend-
ments.

  My point has been that the Framers then reduced to positive law
in the Constitution aspects of life principles that they believed in;
for example, liberty. But when it is in the Constitution, it is not a
natural right; it is a constitutional right. And that is the important
point.

  But to understand what the Framers meant and what they were
trying to do, it is important to go back and attempt to understand
what they believed, just as we do when we attempt to interpret a
statute that is drafted by this body, to get your understanding. But
in constitutional analysis and methodology, as I indicated in my
confirmation to the court of appeals, there isn't any direct refer-
ence to natural law. The reference is to the Constitution and to
using the methods of constitutional adjudication that have been
traditionally used. You don't refer to natural law or any other law
beyond that document.

  What I have attempted to do with respect to my answers yester-
day is to be as fair and as open and as candid as I possibly can. I
have not spoken on issues such as natural law since my tenure as
Chairman of EEOC. At that time it was important to me--it was
very important--to find some way to have a common ground un-
derlying our regime and our country on the issue of civil rights. I
thought it was a legitimate ground. I wondered. I looked back at
Lincoln, saw him here in Washington, DC, surrounded by a pro-
slave State yet pro-Union, and a Confederate State. And I asked
myself what was it that sustained him in his view that slavery was
wrong. And it was through that progress that I came upon the cen-
tral notion of our regime, All men are created equal, as a basis or
as one aspect of trying to fight a battle to bring something positive
                                          180

and aggressive to civil rights enforcement. And I thought it was a
legitimate endeavor.

  At no time did I feel nor do I feel now that natural law is any-
thing more than the background to our Constitution. It is not a
method of interpreting or a method of adjudicating in the constitu-
tional law area.

  With respect to your last question--and I assume for the moment
that perhaps you don't want me to address each of the underlying
questions or specific questions seriatim. I would say this about
them, though: I have written and I have been interviewed quite a
bit. I have been candid over my career. My wife said to me that to
the extent that Justice Souter was a "stealth nominee," I am "Big-
foot." And I have tried to think through difficult issues without
dodging them.

  As a judge, though, on the issue of natural law, I have not
spoken nor applied that. What I have tried to do is to look at cases,
to understand the argument, and to apply the traditional methods
of constitutional adjudication as well as statutory construction.

  I am afraid, though, on your final question, Senator, that it is im-
portant for any of us who are judges, in areas that are very deeply
contested, in areas where I think we all understand and are sensi-
tive to both sides of a very difficult debate, that for a judge--and as
I said yesterday, for us who are judges, we have to look ourselves
in the mirror and say: Are we impartial or will we be perceived to
be impartial? I think that to take a position would undermine my
ability to be impartial, and I have attempted to avoid that in all
areas of my life after I became a judge. And I think it is important.

  I can assure you--and I know, I understand your concern that
people come here and they might tell you A and then do B. But I
have no agenda. I have tried to wrestle with every difficult case
that has come before me. I don't have an ideology to take to the
Court to do all sorts of things. I am there to take the cases that
come before me and to do the fairest, most openminded, decent job
that I can as a judge. And I am afraid that to begin to answer ques-
tions about what my specific position is in these contested areas
would greatly--or leave the impression that I prejudged this issue.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Having said that, Judge, I will just repeat
the question. Do you believe--I am not asking you to prejudge the
case. I am just asking you whether you believe that the Constitu-
tion protects a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnan-
cy.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I noted yesterday, and I think we all
feel strongly in this country about our privacy--I do--I believe the
Constitution protects the right to privacy. And I have no reason or
agenda to prejudge the issue or to predispose to rule one way or
the other on the issue of abortion, which is a difficult issue.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I am not asking you to prejudge it. Just as
you can respond--and I will get into some of the questions to which
you responded yesterday, both from Senators Thurmond, Hatch,
and Biden about matters that might come before the Court. You
certainly can express an opinion as to whether or not you believe
that a woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy
without indicating how you expect to vote in any particular case.
And I am asking you to do that.
                                         181

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think to do that would seriously com-
promise my ability to sit on a case of that importance and involv-
ing that important issue.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Let us proceed. Judge Thomas, in 1990, I
chaired a committee hearing on the Freedom of Choice Act, where
we heard from women who were maimed by back-alley abortion-
ists. Prior to the Roe decision, only wealthy women could be sure of
having access to safe abortions. Poor, middle-class women were
forced to unsafe back alleys, if they needed an abortion. It was a
very heart-rending hearing.

  Frankly, I am terrified that if we turn the clock back on legal
abortion services, women will once again be forced to resort to
brutal and illegal abortions, the kinds of abortions where coat-
hangers are substitutes for surgical instruments.

  The consequence of Roe's demise are so horrifying to me and to
millions of American women and men, that I want to ask you once
again, of appealing to your sense of compassion, whether or not
you believe the Constitution protects a woman's right to an abor-
tion.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the prospect--and I guess as a kid we
heard the hushed whispers about illegal abortions and individuals
performing them in less than safe environments, but they were
whispers. It would, of course, if a woman is subjected to the agony
of an environment like that, on a personal level, certainly, I am
very, very pained by that. I think any of us would be. I would not
want to see people subjected to torture of that nature.

  I think it is important to me, though, on the issue, the question
that you asked me, as difficult as it is for me to anticipate or to
want to see that kind of illegal activity, I think it would undermine
my ability to sit in an impartial way on an important case like
that.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I have some difficulty with that, Judge
Thomas, and I am frank to tell you, because yesterday you respond-
ed, when Senator Biden asked you if you supported the right to pri-
vacy, validated in Moore v. City of East Cleveland, by agreeing that
the Court's rulings supported the notion of family as one of the
most private relationships we have in our country. That was one
matter that might come before the Court.

  You also responded, when Senator Thurmond asked you wheth-
er, following the Court's ruling in Payne v. Tennessee, families vic-
timized by violence should be allowed to participate in criminal
cases. You went on to respond by indicating that the Court had re-
cently considered that matter, and you expressed concern that such
participation could undermine the validity of the process.

  You also responded to Senator Thurmond's questions about the
validity of placing limits on appeals in death penalty cases, the
fairness of the sentencing guidelines, which was another one of his
questions, and the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule,
which was another one of his questions.

  Finally, you responded, when Senator Hatch asked you whether
you might rely on substantive due process arguments to strike
down social programs such as OSHA, food safety laws, child care
legislation, and the like, by telling him that "the Court determined
                                      182
correctly that it was the role of the Congress to make complex deci-
sions about health and safety and work standards."

  Now, all of those issues could come before the Court again, just
as the Roe v. Wade matter might come before the Court again. So,
my question about whether the Constitution protects the woman's
right to choose is, frankly, not one bit different from the types of
questions that you willingly answered yesterday from other mem-
bers of this committee.

  So, I have to ask you, how do you distinguish your refusal to
answer about a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnan-
cy with the various other matters that may come before the Su-
preme Court, to which you have already responded to this commit-
tee?

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, since my distinguished col-
league has mentioned my name several times, I would like to make
a brief comment here and take it out of my time when I am called
on again. I think it is pertinent to just take a little time, if you
have no objection.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I did not see fit to interrupt my colleague
during his line of questioning. After the Judge

  Senator THURMOND. It is right on this point, you have just men-
tioned my name

  Senator METZENBAUM. But after the Judge responds, then I
would

  Senator THURMOND [continuing]. And if I can take it out of my
time, I would like to do that.

  The CHAIRMAN. I would be delighted to let the Chair do that, but
the witness is about to answer the question. Immediately after
Judge Thomas has answered the question, then I will yield to the
Senator from South Carolina to make his point, whatever the point
is.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I responded to and discussed, I believe,
with Senator Thurmond, questions and concerns that he raised
about these particular cases that you mentioned. I do not believe--
and I have not had an opportunity to review the transcript--I do
not believe that I either indicated that I agreed with the outcome
in those cases that I raised with him or not. I simply raised the
concerns, the discussions, and the Court holdings, and I believe
some of the problems that might occur in some considerations in
the future. I tried to discuss it openly with him, without reaching a
judgment with respect to the outcome.

  With respect to the Lochner era cases, I thought that my view
was that these are cases that were decided in the 1930's or the
post-Lochner era cases, and that I do not think the Court is going
to revisit that area in the very near future. It is certainly not one
that, to my knowledge, is

  Senator METZENBAUM. I am sure you are not suggesting that all
of those matters about which Senator Thurmond inquired of you
were all decided in the 1930's. Many of them are very pertinent
and very much within the last few years.

  Judge THOMAS. I may not have made myself very clear, Senator.
The questions that Senator Thurmond and concerns that he raised
about cases, those were recent cases. I do not believe--again, I have
not had an opportunity to review the transcript--that I commented
                                         183

on or that I agreed with or supported or sustained the judgment or
the outcome in those cases.

  Senator METZENBAUM. That is all I am asking you on this, to do
the same kind of response that you gave Senator Thurmond. I am
not asking you to speak about how you would vote on the Court.
And just as you commented on those cases, what you thought about
presentencing guidelines, habeas corpus matters, and various other
questions that the Senator asked you, all I am asking you to do is
give me the same kind of response with respect to the woman's
constitutional right to choose in the same area.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator Thurmond, I do not believe asked me
whether I agreed or disagreed with the particular outcome. Again,
I have not reviewed the transcript. The point that I am making
with respect to the Lochner cases, the post-Lochnerera cases, is
that they were decided in the 1930's and that I do not think that
they will be revisited.

  I am not, nor would I have it suggested--and I think this is an
important point, Senator--I think that if there were, if I could
retain my impartiality and study those cases and think about
them, I think that there would be room for comment. I do not be-
lieve that a sitting judge, on very difficult and very important
issues that could be coming before the Court, can comment on the
outcomes, whether he or she agrees with those outcomes as a sit-
ting judge.

  I think those of us who have become judges understand that we
have to begin to shed the personal opinions that we have. We tend
not to express strong opinions, so that we are able to, without the
burden or without being burdened by those opinions, rule impar-
tially on cases.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I understand that, Judge, but I want to
point out the similarity of this matter as compared to the question
I am asking you about a woman's right to choose. Senator Thur-
mond said to you, "In fact, the Court recently used in the case of
Payne v. Tennesseethat the use of victim impact statements in
death penalty cases does not violate the Constitution." He goes on
to say, "In your opinion, should victims play a greater role in the
criminal justice system, and, if so, to what extent should a victim
be allowed to participate, especially after a finding of guilt against
the accused?"

  You responded, "Of course, Senator, that is a matter the Court,
as you have noted, recently considered." You go on to say, "My
concern would be, in a case like that, we don't in a way jeopardize
the rights of the victim. Of course, we would like to make sure that
the victim is involved in the process, but we should be very careful,
in my view, that we don't somehow undermine the validity of the
process."

  Now, I am not questioning your position. Whatever your position
is, that is perfectly fine. What I am saying is that if you were able
to respond as you did yesterday to questions from Senators Thur-
mond, Hatch, and Biden with reference to matters in the Supreme
Court or may return to the Supreme Court, and why, Judge
Thomas, can't you tell us about a woman's right to choose, which is
understandably one of the most controversial issues in the country?
                                184

I am not asking you as to how you will vote in connection with
that issue.
Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, it is on that very point that I
would like to make a statement.
The CHAIRMAN. The Senator is recognized, and the time will not
come out of the Senator from Ohio's half hour.
Senator THURMOND. I want to say that no question I asked Judge
Thomas to answer in any way required him to comment about how
he would rule on a case that could come before the Supreme Court.
My distinguished colleague, Senator Metzenbaum, as a lawyer,
must know that the questions I asked the nominee were areas
where the law is well settled. I strongly believe it is inappropriate
to ask the nominee how he would rule in a particular case. Judges
must be impartial. For a judge to have preconceived notions about
how he would rule in a case would clearly undermine the inde-
pendence of the judiciary.

Additionally, I specifically told Judge Thomas, and these are
words that you can quote, "If I propound any question you consider
inappropriate, just speak out, because I strongly believe a nominee
should not be compelled to answer how he would rule on any spe-
cific case that may come before the Court."
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
I point out that the ruling on victim impact statements was, I
think, a 6-to-3 decision, and it is far from well-settled. It is still in
controversy, both here and in the Court. Now, I will yield back to
the Senator from Ohio.
Senator METZENBAUM. And it overruled previous Court decisions,
so it still is in controversy.
Let me go on. Yesterday, you were asked about a 1986 report pro-
duced by the White House Working Group on the Family. You tes-
tified you had not read a section of the report which criticized as
fatally flawed a lien of cases upholding the right to privacy in a
woman's right to abortion. Two of the cases criticized by the report
were Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, both of
which protect a woman's right to an abortion.

The report also declared that State-imposed restrictions on a
woman's right to an abortion should not be challenged by the Su-
preme Court. Judge Thomas, it appears to me that you were the
highest ranking administration official on the White House Task
Force, and this report was recommending policy changes that
would have a profound and sweeping impact on the lives of mil-
lions of American women.
In the months leading up to your confirmation, this report has
been the subject of considerable discussion. As a matter of fact, the
Chairman of the Commission is also, as I understand it, chairman
of the committee to help promote your candidacy.
  How    is  itthpeosrseibploertthaantd; --unwtiellly, ensotetrdgauye,ssyotuhahtadI  never  read  this
section  of                                                                          would  ask   that
question.
Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is important to understand
how the domestic policy shop in the White House worked. What it
would do is that it would assemble a group of people who had ex-
pressed an interest in an area across the administration, and it
would, in essence, use that group as a resource.
                                        185

  My interest during the meetings--and I believe there were three,
perhaps four meetings, I cannot remember--was in low-income
families, families that I believed were at risk in our society. I sub-
mitted to that working group, I believe to the head of the working
group, who was not myself, a document, a memorandum on low-
income families. The group itself did not meet, nor were we called
upon to draft the document.

  The document itself was, I believe, circulated and final, although
I cannot remember exactly the procedure, but it is not uncharac-
teristic that, after you have participated in a working group or
after one participated in a working group with the White House or
with the domestic policy branch, that the report itself would not be
made available for comment, and that others would simply finalize
the report. Again, I cannot remember how that precisely worked.

  My interest was limited to low-income families and I was thank-
ful that certain portions of that was included. I did not have an in-
terest in, nor expressed comment on the other portions of the
report.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Yesterday, the chairman stated that one
of the privacy decisions criticized as fatally flawed in the report
was Moore v. City of Blast Cleveland. The chairman also noted that
the report calls for the appointment of new Justices on the Court,
to change the result in the Moore case in another decision.

  In response to the chairman, you stated that, "If I had known
that section was in the report before it became final, of course, I
would have expressed my concerns." Judge Thomas, if you had
known that the report characterizes two abortion cases as fatally
flawed and suggests that these decisions can be corrected, directly
or indirectly, through the appointment of new judges, would you
have objected to that, as well?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, let me respond to that in this way: I
thought that the report--and, based on the submissions, I think
this underlines that--that the report should have been focused on
how do we help existing families, not debating some of the more
controversial and difficult issues in our society. I thought that it
would be an opportunity and would be an occasion to find ways to
take families that are at risk and families that are having difficul-
ties and to help those families in whatever form we find them.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I guess my question is--I will repeat the
question: Would you have objected, if you had known that language
was within the report, as you indicated you would have objected
with respect to the langauge in connection with the East Cleveland
case?

  Judge THOMAS. I think I would have, Senator, raised concerns of
the nature and with the underpinning that I just gave you, and
that is that I thought it would have been appropriate for the report
to have focused expressly on families that were at risk and how we
could help families in their current conditions nor out of their cur-
rent conditions.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, you told Senator Biden you would
have objected to the language with reference to the East Cleveland
case, and so I am only asking you whether you would have objected
to the langauge with respect to the abortion cases.
                                         186

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I believe--again, I have not reviewed
the transcript--I believe I indicated that I would have raised con-
cerns, and I believe that those concerns would have been of the
same character and the same nature as the concerns that I would
raise in this case. I thought that we had a grand opportunity there
to focus governmental policy on existing low-income and at-risk
families.

  I felt that was very important, and it was very important in this
context, it was important to me: It was important, because you had
I think about one-third or more of the minority kids in our society
being under the poverty limit, and I felt that the administration
could have addressed that in a policy that was important to the
entire administration.

  Senator METZENBAUM. My time is up, but, Judge Thomas, I am
really asking you specifically yes or no. You indicated you would
have objected to the East Cleveland decision, had you known that
language with reference to the East Cleveland decision, had you
known it was in there. So, I am asking you if you had known about
the abortion case references, would you have objected, and the
answer is just yes or no.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I would have raised concerns for the
reasons I have expressed to you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Metzenbaum.
  Dr. Hatch
  Senator SIMPSON. Dr. Hatch?
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me. I am so accustomed to attempting to
avoid the Simpson-Metzenbaum skirmish that I guess it was a
reflex action. I do apologize. I was so impressed with Senator
Hatch's rehabilitation yesterday that I just wanted to hear more.
[Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. With Senator Simpson's permission, I would be
really happy to pick up with this.
  The CHAIRMAN. I apologize, Senator Simpson. I am sorry. Sena-
tor Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, you have often left the Senator
from Ohio and I to our own skirmishes, which we certainly enjoy.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU will understand if both Senator Thurmond
and I just reflexively push our chairs back. If you will notice Sena-
tor Thurmond has already started back. I am heading back, too, so
you can see one another. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. I want to get a little eye contact with Howard.
Get out of the way, Ted.
  Well, let me say that you see one of the great pleasures of being
on this committee. It is a splendid committee, and we have a splen-
did chairman. And the members I think have a comity and a
nature of dealing with each other which is something I think that
no nonlawyer could understand. It is a little tough for my friend
from Iowa; sometimes he will say, "What are you guys up to?" But
it is part of the practice of law. You whack around on somebody all
day long, and then you go off and have dinner together or visit
with each other, and that is the best way to legislate.
  I have the highest regard for every single member of this com-
mittee, and my spirited friend from Ohio and I had one one time
where we were both just standing going toe to toe. I think it was
                                         187

during the Rehnquist hearings. And let me tell you, our neck mus-
cles were bulging in the hall. And Howard said, "Well, smart alec,
here they come, here come the media. They have seen what we are
up to." And we both said, "Yes, but by the time they get here, we
will be smiling and clapping each other on the back." And by the
time they made it there, we were chuckling and doing our chicken
dance, whatever it is we do. Anyway, it is interesting work.

  I want to welcome the family here: The son and the mother and
the daughter, Jamal and Ginnie, who I think I knew before she
knew you, with the Department of Labor when I was working on
immigration issues. Very splendid lady.

  I go back to the words of probably our most respected colleague,
Jack Danforth. He mentioned that you had a great propensity for
laughter and good humor. You display that. I have a propensity to
sometimes cross the line between good humor and smart alec. And
when I do, I certainly pay for it dearly, and should.

  My dear mother taught me that humor was the irreplaceable sol-
vent against the abrasive elements of life, and that remarkable
lady, in her ninth decade, will be critiquing whatever I say. And I
must be very diligent and clear in saying it.

  I think you can already see the hazards of speaking out. Your
collected speeches--I heard Dr. Hatch yesterday. The reason the
chairman refers to him as "Dr. Hatch," he is the great rehabilita-
tor. He can take broken bodies and stretch them back into proper
shape after Kennedy or Howard or whoever have raveled them un-
yielding. And so that was just a slip there.

  But what has happened is you took the collected ramblings of all
of us, and we were sitting there, and they said Senator Biden or
Senator Metzenbaum or Senator Kennedy or Senator Simpson, do
you remember a speech you gave to some institute in Detroit on
the night of October 1, 1981? You probably scribbled it on the back
of a matchbook. Then you did it, and you either got carried away
with the crowd or you didn't, or you took them or you didn't. And
to think that you can go back in life and try to put those things
together as something that has to do with now is a very difficult
thing for me to believe in life. But I am one who believes that if
they were putting together the life of Al Simpson at the age of 60,
at which I arrived September 2, and the Al Simpson of 17 or 35 or
40 or 45, no one can pass that test. There may be a lot of people
here that say they can pass that test, but nobody--nobody--can
pass that test.

  So you see the hazards of this, and I think it is very important
that we heed the warning--I read it as a warning--of Jack Dan-
forth not to pay one bit of attention to snippets and pieces and bits
and shards and jagged edges, or whatever you have said in the
past, unless you have a little stack of it right there. And every time
somebody pulls one out, you just say, "I ask that the entirety of
that speech go into the record." We will make that an automatic. I
think that is a very important thing because there isn't anything
that I have read--and I have read a great deal--and knowing
others on this panel, Senator Leahy or Senator Specter, and I know
how they burrow in stuff and read extensively everything you prob-
ably have done. I think it is critically important that it all be pre-
sented. Because, indeed, in looking at the questions that have been

       56-270 O--93 7
                                         188

presented and then looking at the speeches, it just doesn't fit,
unless, of course, you are just taking the one phrase.

  Well, I must comment on the so-called confirmation conversion.
That seems to be a bit of a topic of the day. I mentioned in my
opening statement that certain special interest groups would go
after you in a rich and vigorous way. That is not exactly what I
said, but it could be rancorous and it could be contentious. And I
said that, and that now is, you know, coming to pass.

  And after you explained to us yesterday, I thought rather clear-
ly, on this issue of natural law that you had used it as a basis for
political theory but not as a basis for constitutional adjudication.
That was your statement. And this issue of natural law, it would
be really interesting to know what that is. But since you don't
know what it is, it is kind of tough to talk about it I would think.

  These are the reasons why I struggled in law school. Little ses-
sions like that used to just leave me huddled in the corner as to
what it was that was trying to be developed, losing track of how do
you assist a person in extremity, what is a lawyer supposed to do,
what is your duty to society, and real life things that have to do
with a lawyer-client relationship.

  But, anyway, one of the leading spokesmen, or at least one of the
continually most vocal spokesmen for some civil rights groups have
accused you of a confirmation conversion. Let me read the quota-
tion in one of today's journals. It says, "The Executive Director of
the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said that Judge Thomas
was running from his record"--"He seemed to be sprinting from
his record," not running from his record. "He seemed to be sprint-
ing from his record." That was the earlier confirmation conversion
we have witnessed.

  I think that is a bit of an overreaction, but I think that is but a
portrayal of a sound bite syndrome that suddenly overcomes some
people in that line of work. And I think it is an inaccurate accusa-
tion, and I think it is untrue. And I use that word without being
light about it. Untrue. An act of desperation, if you will, and that
is used often by that group.

  Here is their publication of July 17, 1991, of this Leadership Con-
ference on Civil Rights. By the way, the record should disclose that
more than several of their membership organizations dropped out
of the fight here with you and decided not to join them in denounc-
ing you. That is clearly of record.

  Then in July, they didn't know what to do with you. You got
them. They are very frustrated about you. And they said that if
they decided to oppose you--and, believe me, from my experience
with them, I know that they were ready to oppose you on July 17,
1991--but if they decide to oppose you, it will come only after the
most serious consideration.

  In that same document, they go on to say about what is at stake
for them. So far they say, "The right wing of the Court, led by
Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia, have
had to compromise on many occasions in order to get their 5-4 and
6-3 majorities. If Justices Rehnquist"--and I emphasize this--"and
Scalia get one more like-minded Justice, they will have without
question the votes to overturn directly Supreme Court decisions.

Overnight, constitutional and statutory rights Americans have had
for decades could vanish."

  Now, that is half hysterical stuff there. You only get one vote, as
far as I am aware. But here is the part that deserves, I think, the
attention of fair-thinking people. Here is what you said to this
chairman on February 6, 1990. Everybody had a good look at this.
They scoured your record with a brush, a wire brush.

  So you said to this chairman and this committee on February 6,
when you were nominated to the circuit court, with regard to the
issue of natural law--and everybody knows this. Let us try to stay
at least basic, in fairness. You said:

  But recognizing that natural rights is a philosophical, historical context of the
Constitution is not to say that I have abandoned the methodology of constitutional
interpretation used by the Supreme Court. In applying the Constitution, I think I
would have to resort to the approaches that the Supreme Court has used. I would
have to look at the texture of the Constitution, the structure. I would have to look
at the prior Supreme Court precedents.

  Now, that is what you said. You made that quite plain 17 months
ago, the exact distinction that you were making yesterday. I might
ask you, then, to set the record straight: Is it accurate to say that
on the day of September 10, 1991, was that the day on which Clar-
ence Thomas changed his views or had a conversion or sprinted
from his previous record on natural law? Or were those the views
you explained so well and ones that you have held for some period
of time?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have been consistent on this issue of
natural law. As I indicated, my interest in the area resulted from
an interest in finding a common theme and finding a theme that
could rekindle and strengthen enforcement of civil rights, and ask
the basic or answer a basic question of how do you get rid of slav-
ery, how do you end it.

  Our Founders, the drafters of the 13th, 14th amendments, aboli-
tionists, believed in natural law, but they reduced it to positive
law. The positive law is our Constitution. And when we look at con-
stitutional adjudication, we look to that document. We may want to
know, and I think it is important at times to understand what the
drafters believed they were doing as a part of our history and tradi-
tion in some of the provisions such as the liberty component of the
due process clause of the 14th amendment. But we don't make an
independent search or an independent reference to some notion or
a notion of natural law.

  That is the point that I tried to make, and there was no followup
question, as I remember it, at my confirmation to the court of ap-
peals. But that has been a consistent point. We look at natural law
beliefs of the Founders as a background to our Constitution.

  Senator SIMPSON. Have you seen anything come up at this hear-
ing thus far that is really anything different, much different than
what happened when we confirmed you for the circuit court, other
than the fact that you have remained absolutely silent as those out
there decided to distort these issues?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I think the one difference, Senator, of
course is that I am a sitting Federal judge now. When I came
before this committee the last time, I was a policymaker. I was
                                         190

someone who had taken policy positions, and those questions and
concerns were raised of me as Chairman of EEOC.

  Today I am a sitting Federal judge, and I find myself in a much
different posture. It is a different role. Ihave no occasion to make
policy speeches, have no occasion to speculate about policy in our
Government, or to be a part of that policy debate. And I believe at
my last confirmation, much of that debate or those debates were
explored in the hearings.

  Today I have refrained from it, from those debates, primarily be-
cause, as I have said before, engaging in such policy debate, par-
ticularly in public, I think undermines the impartiality of a Feder-
al judge. Taking strong positions on issues that are of some contro-
versy in our society when there are viewpoints on both sides under-
mines your ability.

  My Dallas Cowboys, for example, played the Redskins on
Monday night, and I am totally convinced that every referee in
those games is a Redskins fan. But none would admit to it.

  I think that in something as simple as that, even though we have
strong views about who should win, something as simple as that,
we would want to feel that the referees--and judges are, to a large
extent, referees--are fair and impartial, even when we don't agree
with the calls.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, are you for the Dallas Cowboys or the
Redskins?

  Judge THOMAS. I am a lifetime--I have been a Dallas Cowboys
fan for 25 years.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. That didn't come off of my time, did it?
  The CHAIRMAN. NO. It doesn't come off your time. I am just curi-
ous.
  Judge THOMAS. I am certain that that will probably have some-
one else express his concern about me.
  Senator SIMPSON. I think that will create more concern than any-
thing thus far. To have you in this nest of Redskin fans, to be a
Dallas Cowboy fan certainly discloses a degree of independence
which will serve you very well on the Court. [Laughter.]
  Let me ask a couple more. My time is running down. Some have
raised a litany of questions about this issue of natural law. I think
some of your critics--and I do not say this about the chairman be-
cause I know the way he does his research, in a powerful, skilled
way, using resources that are available to him. But it seems to me
that as I read stuff about, it has been selected as an issue to try to
confound people because natural law is an inherently vague con-
cept. And then your detractors can conjecture all kinds of things
about you and your philosophies without being taken to task for
the obvious inaccuracies and vagueness.
  Now, for example--and I love this definition--the commentator
in the Legal Times--I didn't get the name, but I love the quote. He
recently wrote, he or she--

  Of all the perplexing questions surrounding the Supreme Court nominee, few are
more nettlesome than natural law. It is sure to come up at confirmation hearings,
but don't expect any clear answers, and don't blame Thomas for being unclear. Nat-
ural law philosophy and its adherents live in a world apart, a world that is dense
                                         191

and combative and, above all, unclear. A journey to the world of natural law is not
for the faint of heart.

  That is a quote from the Legal Times. In the article, it says:

  Tap into the natural law crowd, and you quickly learn that there are factions of
adherents who hate each other. There are the East Coast Straussians and the West
Coast Straussians, both followers of philosopher Leo Strauss but sharply in disagree-
ment with each other. You are instructed if you talk to Walter Byrnes, a leader of
the East Coast faction, you don't mention the name of Harry Jaffa, the West Coast
leader, until your conversation is nearly over. And it is true. When asked about
Jaffa, Byrnes said, "At one time we were close friends, but ten years ago we parted
company."

  Yesterday I saw a report in a national publication that had four
paragraphs of Jaffa. I don't even know what he has to do with this.
As far as I know, he is not going to testify. But if he does, I certain-
ly want to be here. He has got some unique ideas and concepts I
would like to ask about.

  So it goes on to say, "It goes on like that"--I am quoting from
the article--"propelling one on a fairly fruitless search through
writings by the likes of St. Thomas Aquinas and Abraham Lincoln
in hopes of discovering how Clarence Thomas would carry out nat-
ural law precepts. The simple answer, the one that frightens liber-
als, is that nobody knows."

  And then, of course, it was interesting to me--and it was men-
tioned yesterday--that Laurence Tribe, who I greatly respect and
who I know and feel quite certain that when the Democrats
wrench the Presidency back to their bosom, he will be exhibit A
right here. And I want to talk with him and visit with him and
hear his views, but we won't have to look far because he has a ton
of opinions that he has written. And I admire his guts. Because
there aren't going to be people who are bright and energetic who
are ever going to write much more again as long as this committee
continues to do what we do. And there is a purpose for what we do,
and I am not challenging that. And it is done with fairness.

  But, in any event, you were asking about natural law solely on
the basis of something that was deep in your craw, and that was
slavery. Isn't that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, that is correct. The issue of civil rights
has been something that, of course, has affected my entire life, and
which I indicated in my opening statement, but for those changes I
would not be here.

  My concern was how do you, from a standpoint of our political
philosophy, how do you end slavery and how do you reinvigorate
civil rights enforcement. How do you convince people who may be
skeptical of aggressive enforcement that it is actually central to
our country?

  I think that those who heard me during that time understood
how deeply I felt about that and continue to feel about that. And I
think that anyone who grew up where I grew up, in the world that
I grew up in, would be deeply impassioned about civil rights en-
forcement. But I was trying to engage not only the passion but the
intellect, and it was an effort to help and to add to and to support
and sustain that I was looking at the whole area of natural law;
not as an effort to undermine or destroy individual freedoms in our
society, but to actually support it and to defend it and enhance it.
                                         192

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think that that is a very good answer.
Obviously I concur with it. But it seems to me that this natural
law business, if I can understand it, does have a very clear founda-
tion. And it has been used by anyone of both parties, and I have
quotes of members of this committee who have used it to talk
about racism in South Africa or what we have done with the disad-
vantaged in society. Professor Tribe has used it, the other side of it
with Judge Bork. Good heavens.

  But I think if you asked us what is a natural law, it has to do
with things like the right of privacy--and that is a critical right, in
my mind, in life, a principle shared by all of us about inalienable
rights, the Declaration of Independence itself. That, I gather, is
what you were referring to, that we hold these truths to be self-
evident, or, rather, natural--if I may interpret it--that all men are
created equal, which must have puzzled you greatly from your
resume of life that you have presented to us; that all men are en-
dowed by the Creator with certain inalienable rights, which must
have stunned you,too.

  So I can hear it from that standpoint, and although I hesitate to
use today's trendy jargon, I believe one would have to be terribly
insensitive not to hear what you are saying and the way you are
saying it and understand your explanation of your exploration of
this thing called natural law in an effort to find meaning in a Con-
stitution that apparently permitted slavery in the United States.
That must have been a most torturous path to travel, one that I
nor any one of us could even conjecture.

  So I fear that we lawyers have become fascinated with this new
vague theory of law which most of us never heard one whit about
in law school. This is like the doctrine of Renvoi. I never tried a
case with the doctrine of Renvoi, but it sounded good, and one guy
talked about it all day. And he got an A, and I got a D. So I knew
he was on the right track.

  So I believe this fascination has caused us to elevate this rather
peripheral matter to a central issue in the confirmation, kind of a
penumbra of stuff floating around, to quote another Justice.

  You have told us so clearly that you feel that natural law is not
applicable to constitutional adjudication, is the word you used, or
interpretation. You testified that you had not considered it in your
adjudications on the circuit court and that you hadn't spoken pub-
licly or written on it since you left the EEOC. Now, that seems to
me pretty well to cover it, but I don't think it will.

  So my final question for you, do you believe that that passage
that I just moments ago quoted from the Declaration of Independ-
ence has meaning, perhaps the meaning I attached to it? Is the
belief that all men are endowed with certain inalienable rights one
that you would consider well accepted within the judicial main-
stream and consistent with most Americans' values and principles?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that most Americans, when they
refer to the Declaration of Independence and its restatement of our
inherent equality, believe that. And I believe that our revulsion
when we think of policies such as apartheid flow from the accept-
ance of our inherent equality.

  Now, we haven't always lived up to that. And, indeed, principles
or concepts such as liberty were added by individuals who believed
                                         193

that we were all created equal, abolitionists some of them, to the
Constitution itself. But once it is in the Constitution, then our
rights are set out. It is no longer an ideal. It is a constitutional
right--liberty. And once it is in the Constitution, we adjudicate it,
we interpret it, understanding what our Founders believed. But ad-
judicate it, looking at our history and our tradition, not just what
their beliefs were when they drafted the document.

  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I am going to conclude. I know
I have a couple of minutes left, but I would be starting on another
approach on issues that I think I would not be able to properly ad-
dress. I thank you for your courtesy.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  I am going to suggest that we take a 5-minute break, to accom-
modate the Judge. If I may, Judge, I want to put one notion to rest
here.
  Number 1, do not count me as one of your detractors, because I
ask you tough questions. No. 2, the issue of natural law may con-
found the people, to use Senator Simpson's phrase, but not a single
legal scholar in America. I hope you meet that criteria, or you
should not be on the Supreme Court. You must have a knowledge
and insight to the Constitution that is better than the average
lawyer, and I am sure you do. That is why I am sure you under-
stand what I am about to say.
  Not a single legal scholar in America fails to understand the sig-
nificance of whether or how one applies natural law. Judge Bork
devoted a chapter in his book about how those people who want to
apply natural law are bad, not bad in a moral sense, but wrong.
  There is an entire school of thought with which you are fully fa-
miliar. I did not fail to accept your answers yesterday. I just want
to make sure we all know what we are talking about here. You and
I know, at least, what we are talking about.
  There is not a single legal scholar who does not understand that
there is a fervent, bright, and aggressive school of thought that
wishes to see natural law further inform the Constitution than it
does now. The positivists, led by Judge Bork, argue against this
school.
  Again, that may be lost on all the people, but you know and I
know what we are talking about. Now, all I am out to do in my
second round is to find out whether you, in fact, do apply natural
law, and, if you do, how. You answered that partially yesterday,
and yet I am still somewhat confused, so I plan to come back to it.
But for the record and for all the press to know, whether someone
applies natural law is of phenomenal significance, and there is not
a single legal scholar in America who will disagree with this state-
ment.
  Now, someone may apply it in a way, like Moore, who leads him
in a direction that is liberal. You may apply it in a way that leads
you in a direction that is conservative, or you may, like many
argue, not apply it at all. Nevertheless, it is a fundamental ques-
tion that is going to be almost impossible for nonlawyers to grasp
and exchange, but you know and I know that it is a big, big deal.
  In conclusion, the only reason most of us asked you about natu-
ral law, is that is how you gained your reputation. Rightly or
wrongly, when you are spoken about by other lawyers or when you
                                         194

were spoken about in the press, you are spoken about in terms of
your speeches on natural law.

  Now, I accept for the moment that everybody misunderstood you;
let me be precise, that your speeches were just philosophic mus-
ings. I accept that for the moment. But, I do not want any Senator
to think that your detractors are out there searching for a theory
that doesn't have significance.

  I, like Senator Simpson, did not do well in law school, probably
worse than Senator Simpson.

  Senator SIMPSON. I did pretty well. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I did very poorly in law school, but I have spent
an awful lot of time since law school dealing with this subject. I
know and you know that what a judge's view on this issue is of
phenomenal consequence to the future of this country.
  Again, I need to explore your view further, but if it is, as you
have stated, "Senator, whenever I speak of natural law, they are
philosophic musings, they in no way impact upon my view on the
Court," fine, that answers the question. But please, let no one mis-
understand, this question informs every other application of the
law and the Constitution. It is that basic, it is that simple. I accept
your assertion that it doesn't for you, I accept that. I want to go
back and discuss it more. This discussion is less for you than it is
for Senator Simpson and others.
  Lastly, let me point out that you say a right must be in the Con-
stitution, for example, liberty. Well, you know, liberty means dif-
ferent things to different people. It is in the 14th amendment.
  Now, as you well know, some people interpret liberty in terms of
natural law. Some people interpret it only in terms of tradition and
history, and some people, when they look at history and tradition,
interpret it a different way. Scalia says when you look at tradition,
you've got to look at it very narrowly. Others say you look at it
broadly.
  So, it makes a big difference. It is going to be impossible to com-
municate these ideas to the people, however, at this point, my job
is not to communicate to the people. My job is to make sure that
we know what your basic philosophic point of view is relative to
the Constitution. I am not a detractor asking you these questions.
It is not meant in any way, I hope you understand, to be a detrac-
tion or distraction. It is tantamount to understanding how you ap-
proach constitutional interpretation.
  We will recess for 10 minutes.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, may I
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, the Senator wants to make a com-
ment.
  Senator SIMPSON. I have 30 seconds at least left.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU can have any time you want.
  Senator SIMPSON. NO, I don't. I would just say I think it is very
important to make a distinction here between natural law as an
academic exercise or discussion or a flight for law review editors
and a political confirmation process. Those are two entirely differ-
ent matters, and I was referring to the latter, and I would just say
that to me, in my studies, your life in public is not based on a repu-
tation bogged down in the definition of natural law. I don't know
where that came from.
                                         195

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I will point out later where it came from.
  I thank you very much. We are going to recess for 10 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will resume now.
  Judge, I did not give you a chance to say anything. Did you want
to say anything after my little discussion with the Senator? I am
not asking you to, but did you?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the one point, and perhaps it is one that
you probably already knew, I did not consider you a detractor of
me. I think that the dialog on natural law is an important one and
it is one that, of course, you indicated we would have, and I wel-
come the opportunity to explain to you
  The CHAIRMAN. I want to make clear, also, I did not think that
you thought I was a detractor, and I am sure that Senator Simpson
is not. But all kidding aside, that was really a discussion between
Senator Simpson and me on whether or not this issue is of conse-
quence.
  Thank you, and let me now yield to the Senator from Arizona,
Senator DeConcini.

     OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DENNIS DE CONCINI, A U.S.
                 SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA

  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
  Members of the committee and Judge Thomas, I regret that I
was unable to be here yesterday for the opening testimony. I did
read your statement and have heard a lot about it. Indeed, it was a
moving statement and I compliment you for your candidness and
openness.

  As Cochairman of the Helsinki Commission, I had to attend or
felt I had to attend the opening of the International Human Rights
Conference in Moscow prior to being here today. Our delegation,
traveled to the Baltic states and several other republics and had an
interesting opening session in Moscow.

  As I was traveling through these republics and listening to Gor-
bachev and others make speeches about human rights in Moscow, I
couldn't help but think about the process that we are going
through here today. The fundamental rights, the freedoms which
Americans have enjoyed for 200 years are just now coming to pass,
perhaps, in the Soviet Union. My thoughts kept returning to these
hearings and the Founding Fathers, of how they struggled with
this and did not do a perfect job. It took a long time before we fi-
nally did some of the things we should have done earlier on.

   It is our Constitution which these small democrats were looking
to for the equality of human beings, and we see how they struggled
with it, and your opening statement certainly expresses how you
have struggled with that, like no one on this committee could
really appreciate.

   It is particularly fitting that my first duty upon returning to the
country is to consider the confirmation of the successor to a man
who has been the champion and in the forefront of the rights of
the individuals during his long and distinguished service on the Su-
preme Court, of course, that is Thurgood Marshall. His legacy will
                                      196
surely serve as a model for the jurists in these emerging democra-
cies and the justice system, as they seek to protect their hard-
fought struggle for individual rights and their freedoms.

   It is against this backdrop that I will listen to the responses to
some of the questions that I will submit to you and those that have
already been asked to you. I hope that I will be able to conclude,
Judge Thomas, that your judicial philosophy will first and foremost
be dedicated to the protection of the rights of individuals.

  Mr. Chairman, I request that the full statement that I would
have given yesterday be inserted in the record in the proper place,
if I may.

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be placed in the record in its entirety.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  [The statement of Senator DeConcini follows:]
                                        197

                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR DENNIS DeCONCINI
                        NOMINATION HEARING OF CLARENCE THOMAS
                        AS AN ASSOCIATE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE

                                          SEPTEMBER 10, 1991

         I AM PLEASED TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES ON THE COMMITTEE IN
WELCOMING JUDGE THOMAS TO HIS CONFIRMATION HEARINGS. AT A TIME
WHEN OUR CONSTITUTION IS SERVING AS THE BLUEPRINT FOR DEMOCRATIC
REFORM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE BEGIN, TODAY, THE PROCESS OF ONE
OF THE MORE INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF THAT GREAT CHARTER -- THE
SENATE'S DUTY OF "ADVICE AND CONSENT" TO THE PRESIDENT ON
JUDICIAL NOMINEES.

         THE ADVICE AND CONSENT DUTY OF THE SENATE IS ONE OF THIS
BODY'S MOST IMPORTANT CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS. BUT THIS PROVISION
PROVIDES NO IMMUTABLE STANDARD FOR SENATORS TO LOOK TO WHEN FACED
WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF VOTING ON A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. I
HAVE OFTEN STATED AND BELIEVE THAT THE SENATE SHOULD GIVE THE
PRESIDENT'S NOMINEE THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. BUT THIS IN NO WAY
MEANS THAT WE SHOULD CONFIRM A NOMINEE WITHOUT THOROUGHLY
EXAMINING HIS OR HER QUALIFICATIONS. AS THE SENATE DOES NOT
EXPECT THE PRESIDENT TO RUBBER STAMP ITS LEGISLATION, THE
PRESIDENT SHOULD NOT EXPECT CONGRESS TO RUBBER STAMP HIS
NOMINEES.

        A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE IS NOT A CABINET MEMBER WHOSE JOB IS
TO SERVE THE PRESIDENT. IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT THAT THE PRESIDENT
AGREES WITH THE VIEWS OF THE NOMINEE. THE SENATE HAS A RIGHT,
INDEED A CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION, TO EXAMINE A NOMINEE'S
                                     198

COMPETENCE, INTEGRITY, EXPERIENCE, AND YES -- HIS OR HER JUDICIAL
PHILOSOPHY. FOR THE SUPREME COURT IS UNDENIABLY A POLICYMAKER.
OUR FRAMERS DRAFTED THE CONSTITUTION IN BROADLY-WORDED PRINCIPLES
THAT WERE INTENDED TO PROTECT AN EVOLVING SOCIETY.
CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION REQUIRES AN EXERCISE OF
DISCRETIONARY JUDGMENT. THUS, WE MUST CAREFULLY CHOOSE THE
CONSTITUTION'S MOST IMPORTANT INTERPRETERS.

         WE HAVE HEARD FROM VARIOUS GROUPS WHO EITHER OPPOSE THE
NOMINATION OF JUDGE THOMAS OR HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS IN PLACING HIM
ON THE COUNTRY'S HIGHEST COURT, INCLUDING NATIONAL GROUPS
REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF WOMEN, HISPANICS, AFRICAN-
AMERICANS, AND THE ELDERLY. NO ONE DOUBTS THAT JUDGE THOMAS HAS
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER TAKEN ACTIONS OR ANNOUNCED POSITIONS THAT
HAVE INVOKED CRITICISM. BUT I BELIEVE THAT JUDGE THOMAS'
OPPONENTS HAVE THE BURDEN IN PERSUADING THIS SENATOR THAT JUDGE
THOMAS SHOULD NOT BE CONFIRMED. GROUP POSITIONS MUST BE
SUPPORTED BY MORE THAN A BOARD VOTE. THE OPPOSITION TO THIS OR
ANY NOMINEE MUST SUBSTANTIATE THEIR CASE THAT THE NOMINEE IS
COMMITTED TO IMPOSING HIS OR HER OWN EXTREMIST AGENDA UPON THE
COURT.

         THE COURT IS GOING THROUGH A TRANSITION PERIOD. IN MANY
AREAS OF THE LAW I AGREE WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THE CURRENT
COURT HAS MOVED. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS IN WHICH I
BELIEVE THE COURT HAS BEEN DEAD WRONG. THAT IS WHY I VOTED IN
FAVOR OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS BILL LAST CONGRESS. THE EXCESSES OF
THE WARREN COURT IN ONE DIRECTION SHOULD NOT BE REPLACED BY
EXCESSES IN ANOTHER DIRECTION. THE COURT LOSES ITS LEGITIMACY AS
                                     199

AN INSTITUTION IF ITS EDICTS ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON ITS
PERSONNEL.

         IN JUDGE THOMAS, I HOPE TO FIND A CANDIDATE WHO RESPECTS
THE COURT AS AN INSTITUTION. AS AN INDIVIDUAL, HE DESERVES
PRAISE FOR HIS NUMEROUS ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN A SHORT PROFESSIONAL
CAREER. I AM VERY IMPRESSED BY HIS INTELLECT AND LEGAL ACUMEN.
HIS PERSONAL STORY IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE TOLD OVER AND OVER
AGAIN. HE LEFT ME WITH A POSITIVE IMPRESSION AFTER HIS OFFICE
VISIT EARLIER THIS SUMMER. I FOUND HIM TO BE VERY ENGAGING AND
PERSONABLE. AND IMPORTANT IN THIS SENATOR'S MIND IS THE STRONG
SUPPORT HE HAS FROM MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE SENATOR DANFORTH,
WHO HAS ATTESTED TO JUDGE THOMAS' SKILL AND INTEGRITY.

         OVER THE YEARS JUDGE THOMAS HAS WRITTEN ARTICLES, DELIVERED
NUMEROUS SPEECHES, DIRECTED A FEDERAL AGENCY, TESTIFIED BEFORE
CONGRESS, AND AUTHORED FEDERAL JUDICIAL OPINIONS. HE HAS A
RECORD THAT WE CAN ALL EXAMINE. WE HAVE AN AMPLE BODY OF
EVIDENCE ON JUDGE THOMAS'S VIEWS ON VARIOUS IMPORTANT AREAS OF
THE LAWS AND HIS CRITIQUE ON SOME MOMENTOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CASES.
BUT AS HE STATED AT HIS COURT OF APPEALS NOMINATION HEARING, HE
HAS YET TO FORMULATE HIS OWN CONSTITUTIONAL PHILOSOPHY.

         AFTER THESE HEARINGS CONCLUDE, THE SENATE AND THE AMERICAN
PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE A VISION OF CLARENCE THOMAS' CONSTITUTIONAL
PHILOSOPHY. I HOPE TO FIND A JURIST WHO IS RESPECTFUL OF
PRECEDENT RATHER THAN A JURIST WHO IS ON A MISSION TO IMPOSE HIS
PERSONAL BELIEFS OR HIDDEN AGENDA ON THE COUNTRY THROUGH BROAD
SWEEPING OPINIONS. IN RESPONSE TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S
QUESTIONNAIRE, A RECENT SUPREME COURT NOMINEE CHARACTERIZED
                                     200

JUDICIAL RESTRAINT AS A JUDGE HONORING "THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN
PERSONAL AND JUDICIALLY COGNIZABLE VALUES." I NEED TO BE
CONFIDENT THAT JUDGE THOMAS CAN FULFILL THIS DEFINITION OF
JUDICIAL RESTRAINT.

         NO ONE IN THIS BODY WILL EVER BE SATISFIED WITH EVERY
RESPONSE OF A NOMINEE; THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. I KNOW AND EXPECT
THAT JUDGE THOMAS AND I WILL DISAGREE ON PARTICULAR ISSUES. WHAT
IS IMPORTANT IS THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHEN ALL IS SAID AND
DONE, EACH SENATOR MUST ANSWER ONE QUESTION BEFORE VOTING -- DO
YOU FEEL SECURE ENTRUSTING THIS NOMINEE WITH THE TREMENDOUS
RESPONSIBILITY OF PROTECTING THE RIGHTS -- WHETHER ENUMERATED OR
UNENUMERATED -- IN OUR CONSTITUTION?

         ONE FINAL NOTE -- AS OCCURRED WITH KIS NOMINATION TO BE A
JUDGE ON THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,
QUESTIONS HAVE ARISEN, ONCE AGAIN, CONCERNING JUDGE THOMAS'
COMMITMENT TO THE LAW. THE CONCERN STEMS FROM JUDGE THOMAS'
CONTROVERSIAL TENURE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT
OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AS WELL AS RECENT REVELATIONS REGARDING
HIS ACTIONS AT THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
EDUCATION.

         I HOPE TO EXPLORE THROUGH THESE HEARINGS WHETHER JUDGE
THOMAS WAS ACTING WITHIN HIS ADMINISTRATIVE CAPACITY IN CARRYING
OUT THE POLICY OF THE ADMINISTRATION OR WHETHER HE WAS UNWILLING
TO ENFORCE LAWS THAT CONFLICTED WITH HIS PERSONAL VIEWS.

         IN CLOSING, I JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN EXTENDING A WARM WELCOME
TO YOU, JUDGE THOMAS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE QUESTIONING AND
WITNESSES. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT YOUR
                                     201

JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY AND YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL
ISSUES OF OUR DAY.
                                          202

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge Thomas, I would like to pursue the
equal protection clause, the 14th amendment and how it relates to
discrimination. As you so well know, but for purposes of clarity,
the 14h amendment prohibits a State from depriving a person of
life, liberty, or property, without due process of law or equal pro-
tection of those laws.

  The equal protection clause provides the primary constitutional
protection against laws that discriminate on the basis of gender.
And as we also know from previous hearings, there are three tests.
There is the rational relationship test, which is the most lenient of
those tests, there is the intermediate scrutiny test or a heightened
test, which has been used in gender cases, and then there is the
scrutiny test, which has been used in race and national origin.

  Judge Thomas, there has been much discussion already regard-
ing reliance on natural law. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately,
depending on how you define it, natural law has been invoked his-
torically, and goes back a long time.

  For example, in 1873, in the Bradwell v. Illinois case, the Su-
preme Court denied a woman a license to practice law, arguing the
following:

  Civil law, as well as nature herself, has always recognized a wide difference in the
respective spheres and destinies of man and woman. The natural and proper delica-
cy which belong to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of
civil life. The paramount destiny and mission of women is to fulfill the noble and
benign office of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator.

  Now, I know you went on with Senator Kennedy at some length
about your position on natural law, which I did review this morn-
ing, and I welcome some clarification that you can give. But with
the Bradwell case, we see that those Justices applied natural law.

  I know that you stated that your duty would be to uphold the
Constitution and not a natural law philosophy, but I would like to
just clarify for the record, do you disagree with the Justices' deci-
sions that were held back in 1873 in the Bradwell case?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I do.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. That is really all I want to
know. I want to be very clear, based on your statements to Senator
Kennedy, that you do not have any lingering thoughts that stare
decisis, when dating back to a clear case where natural law was
used, poses any problems to you.
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  Judge Thomas, when you were nominated to the court of ap-
peals, because of time constraints and other things that prohibited
me from coming to those hearings at any length and waiting my
turn to ask you questions, I submitted written questions requesting
your comments on the court's approach to the equal protection
clause. We also discussed this before these hearings when you were
in to see me, where I told you I would address some questions to
you and offer some thoughts on it.
  In response to my written questions, your partial response was,
"Though I do not have a fully developed constitutional philosophy,
I have no personal reservations about applying the three standards
as an appellate court judge in cases which might come before me."
                                         203

  Now that you have been on the court for 18 months and may
soon be making decisions on important equal protection cases on
the highest court of the land, let me ask you if you have developed
a constitutional philosophy regarding the Court's three-tier ap-
proach to the equal protection cases.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have no reason and had no reason to
question or to disagree with the three-tier approach. Of course, the
rational basis test being the least structured or least strict of the
tests, the heightened scrutiny test, which has been used in the area
of gender and alienage and legitimacy, and the strict scrutiny test,
which has been used in the area of fundamental rights and race,
Senator, I think that those tests attempt in our society to demon-
strate the concern that we have for classifications that could in-
fringe on fundamental rights, and I believe that underlying, when
we move away just from the legalese--and I do accept this struc-
ture of the three-tier test--when we move away from it, at bottom
what we are talking about is are we going to allow people to be
treated in arbitrary ways, either because of their gender or because
of their race, are we going to defer to classifications based on
gender or race, and what the Court is attempting to do in an im-
portant way is to say no, we are going to look at those classifica-
tions.

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge Thomas. That is helpful,
and I guess it goes without saying, but I am going to say it anyway,
you have no agenda or hidden belief or anything else regarding the
present position that the Supreme Court has taken with these
three tiers on equal protection as they relate to gender or any
other minority or class that it may be applied to.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is important for judges not to
have agendas or to have strong ideology or ideological views. That
is baggage, I think, that you take to the Court or you take as a
judge.

   It is important for us, and I believe one of the Justices, whose
name I cannot recall right now, spoke about having to strip down,
like a runner, to eliminate agendas, to eliminate ideologies, and
when one becomes a judge, it is an amazing process, because that is
precisely what you start doing. You start putting the speeches
away, you start putting the policy statements away. You begin to
decline forming opinions in important areas that could come before
your court, because you want to be stripped down like a runner. So,
I have no agenda, Senator.

   Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge Thomas.
   Is it fair to say that your philosophical approach, not going to
any specific case, is that you would agree with this statement: If
the Court were to abandon the heightened scrutiny test as it is ap-
plied to sex discrimination, gender cases, et cetera, that it would be
turning the clock back on equal protection rights of women?
   Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that would be an appropriate
statement, if you said either abandon or ratchet down.
   Senator DECONCINI. Thank you very much. Because it concerns
me a great deal, if the Court moves in that direction, without
touching the issue of abortion or what have you. Having studied it
and having posed these questions to a number of nominees here, I
really feel the Court has, to the best it can, with the variance of
                                         204

people that are on there, come to some relatively good conclusions.
And though the intermediate scrutiny or heightened scrutiny may
not be enough to satisfy the inequities in women's position in jobs
and pay and what have you today, at least I am satisfied that it
gives a court an opportunity, as the cases come before it, to contin-
ue to improve the inequities that I believe women still suffer in our
society, and I am pleased with your responses.

  They are similar to those responses that Judge Souter gave, and
maybe you listened to his testimony, but I am very thankful for
your candid approach, and also your comments about an agenda,
because I agree with you, Judge Thomas, there is no place on the
Court for someone who has an agenda. We all have ideas and we
have to express them. We are all raised in a certain way and we all
have certain convictions that we have to express and follow
through, once we are in a position of making a decision. But
indeed, I take that as a very serious statement on your part.

  Justice Marshall had his own distinct approach to equal protec-
tion claims, as you may recall. Marshall believed that the Court
does not apply a three-tier approach to equal protection claims,
but, rather, a "spectrum of standing" review. Thus, the more im-
portant the constitutional and societal right given to an interest,
the greater the scrutiny should be applied.

  Do you have any feelings about this distinction that Justice Mar-
shall makes regarding the three-tier system that you clearly said
that you support and the spectrum of standing in total society?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have not examined Justice Marshall's
approach in any detail and not had occasion to employ it in any of
my analysis. But I think that what he is attempting to do is pre-
cisely what you are attempting to do with the three-tier analysis,
and that is to adjust the scrutiny and to make it more exacting, the
more significant and more important the right we are protecting.
Maybe it would accomplish the same ends or be pretty close to the
three-tier analysis, but it seems as though the objective is the
same. But I have not had occasion to use

  Senator DECONCINI. IS it fair to say from your comments, then,
that if you came across a case regarding sex discrimination--it
could fall into the strict scrutiny, if it was such a blatant case that
was not unisex toilets or something that is always used in the area
of the intermediate scrutiny to show the difference in applying a
strict scrutiny, in an effort to all sex cases? Is that a fair statement
or can you comment on it?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that discrimination is, as I have
said, a cancer on our society. There could be instances where one
would want to apply a more exacting standard even than the cur-
rent heightened scrutiny test. I would be concerned if we were to
see a movement down toward the rational basis test. But I think
that discrimination and classifications based on race or sex are so
damaging to our society, and to individuals in particular, that one
could consider and be open to ratcheting up or applying a more ex-
acting standard.

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge Thomas.
  I know yesterday with Senator Kennedy you discussed the 1987
Atlantic Monthly article by Juan Williams--"A Question of Fair-
ness" I believe it is called--which was based on the extensive inter-
                                        205

view with you. In that article, Williams writes that you stated,
among other things, "Blacks and women are generally unprepared
to do certain kinds of work by their own choice. It could be that
blacks chose not to study chemical engineering and that women
chose to have babies instead of going to medical school."

  You also discussed with Senator Kennedy your support of the
writings of Thomas Sowell. In an article you wrote for the Lincoln
Review in 1988 titled "Thomas Soweil and the Heritage of Lin-
coln," you praised Sowell's analysis of working women. And Sowell
contended in a 1984 book that inequities in pay and career ad-
vancement stem from women's own behavior and preferences,
claiming that women choose jobs and careers with lower pay and
greater flexibility to accommodate their roles as wives and moth-
ers. And I agree with you that Mr. Sowell certainly has a right to
express his views.

  But my question to you is: Do you agree with his conclusions on
this particular statement and issues?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think as I alluded to yesterday, to say
that women brought discrimination on themselves or lower pay on
themselves is going too far. The point that I attempted to make
yesterday with Senator Kennedy was that you have to begin to dis-
aggregate the numbers. You have to look more at the particular
categories. You can't just have the average and say this is the prob-
lem. If you are going to address the problems, you have to engage
in a process of disaggregation.

  There were questions on--I think the comment yesterday by Sen-
ator Kennedy, I believe, was something to the effect that women
who were married weren't as good employees. And as an employer
and someone who employed a significant number of women, I did
not find that to be true and made that very clear.

  Senator DECONCINI. Sowell also explained pay inequities between
the genders by claiming that "Women are typically not educated as
often in such highly paid fields of mathematics, science, and engi-
neering, nor attracted to physically taxing and well-paid fields such
as construction work, lumberjacking, coal mining and the like."

  What are your thoughts about that conclusion?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I can't say whether or not women are at-
tracted or not attracted to those areas. I think that is a normative
comment there. But I do think his point that there are not women
in some of the higher paying professions begs the question.
  Senator DECONCINI. I do, too.
  Judge THOMAS. There are reasons why, and some of those rea-
sons could involve discrimination.
  Again, my point in saying that his arguments could be an anec-
dote to the debate is because he attempts to disaggregate and to
not simply say all of the reasons are simply discrimination. There
could be other reasons. It is not to say that I adopted, as I said yes-
terday, I believe, to Senator Kennedy, all of his conclusions and his
assertions. I simply don't and did not at that time.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge Thomas.
  Judge Thomas, I want to go into some areas that deal with His-
panic concerns. As a former Chairman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, you weren't responsible for, but I am
sure or I hope you are familiar with the 1983 charge study--enti-
                                               206

tied "Analysis of the EEOC Service by Hispanics in the United
States," which was conducted by the EEOC-appointed task force.
That task force concluded that the needs of Hispanics were not
being adequately addressed by the EEOC.

  At the time, the task force indicated a need to improve EEOC's
record of investigations of Hispanic charges and to increase out-
reach and education efforts within the Hispanic community.

  Now, as the Commissioner, what programs did you initiate to im-
prove the accessibility of the EEOC within the Hispanic communi-
ty?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, when I arrived at EEOC, one of the first
concerns among many--believe me, there were many--with which
I was met was that EEOC was underserving the Hispanic commu-
nity; for example, in Los Angeles and certainly in your home State.

  There were a number of hearings, some of which I participated
in, across the country in various major cities discussing the prob-
lem and what the probable or possible responses could be. A
number of the, I think, concerns were that the national origin
charges were low. The problem there, of course, is that not all of
the charges which we received from Hispanic employees or Hispan-
ic-Americans are national origin charges. They go across the line.
They can involve age; they can involve gender discrimination also.

  A number of the things that we did included opening offices in
predominantly Hispanic communities, satellite offices. That was a
part of our expanded presence program. I made sure that we devel-
oped public service announcements that were bilingual. I installed
a 1-800 number at EEOC so that the agency could be accessible.
We developed posters that were bilingual. We took all of our docu-
ments, our brochures, and translated them into Spanish.

  The effort was to make sure that we reached out, that we includ-
ed, and also in areas where we had--there was a significant His-
panic population, we made every effort to see to it that the top
managers and the investigators spoke Spanish. Again, the effort,
the overall effort was to reach out, and that was consistent with
the recommendations.

  I might also add that during the major part of my tenure, two of
our five commissioners were also Hispanic. So there was consider-
able interest on my part, on their part, and, indeed, the Commis-
sion's part, in being of greater service to Hispanic-Americans.

  Senator DECONCINI. HOW many offices did you open in the His-
panic community.

  Judge THOMAS. We opened--that is a good point. I can't remem-
ber the satellite offices, the exact number. I know we opened one in
east L.A., and we upgraded the office in San Antonio, TX, from a
smaller area office to a full-scale district office to better serve that
area.

  Senator DECONCINI. Did any of these programs include plans to
recruit more Hispanics for the agency itself?

  Judge THOMAS. We attempted to do that in coordination with
various individuals, but that is a more difficult proposition, and
also to promote internally and to make sure that we had Hispanics
promoted to jobs.

  But that can be frustrating. My efforts sometimes were met with
individuals after you position them for the senior position, they
                                         207

find other alternatives and leave the agency, or other difficult per-
sonnel actions.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, an interim result of a study conduct-
ed by the National Council of La Raza indicates that since the 1983
task force study, the situation at EEOC with regard to Hispanics
has not improved. While the Hispanic population in the United
States has grown in the last decade from 6 percent of the total U.S.
population in 1980 to over 9 percent of the total population today,
the percentage of the EEOC total charge caseloads filed by Hispan-
ics was only 4.15 percent.

  Given your efforts to improve the EEOC record with regard to
Hispanics since 1983, how do you account for the disproportionate
small number of charges filed by Hispanics?

  Judge THOMAS. Again, Senator, I have and had the very same
concern that we were underserving--or that EEOC during my
tenure and when I arrived there was underserving the Hispanic
community. I don't know how the numbers were arrived at. To my
knowledge, the agency does not keep data in areas that do not in-
volve national origin charges by national origin. So I don't know,
for example, whether we are looking at numbers reflecting only
the national origin charges as opposed to other areas.

  I can say this: That we made every effort during my tenure to
change the Commission's accessibility to Hispanic-Americans, to in-
dividuals across this country. That was the purpose for our expand-
ed presence program, for our satellite offices, for our educational
programs, all of which were started during my tenure. Our out-
reach efforts were all designed so that we are not sitting in our of-
fices waiting for people to come in, but we actually go to them.

  Sometimes it is frustrating because they don't all work, but it
certainly was not because of a lack of trying.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, I'm certain it must be frustrating.
Judge, another area of concern is the disposition of charges filed by
Hispanics. According to the National Council of La Raza report,
the percentage of cases which were administratively closed without
remedy to the charging party has increased from 45 percent in
1985 to 72 percent in 1990. I realize a little bit of that time you
weren't there. But does this figure reflect a weakness in the EEOC
effort to pursue complaints filed by Hispanics, or does it suggest
that the incidence of discrimination against Hispanics is lower
than other protected groups?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, I don't have that data, and this is
the first I have heard of those numbers. I would not think, particu-
larly with the office heads and the employees who would certainly
be interested in the communities in which they investigate those
charges, that it is a weakening in EEOC's efforts.

  Again, I don't have the data. It certainly does not reflect--not to
my way of thinking--a reduction or decline in discrimination.

  Senator DECONCINI. IS it your position that you were taking and
following the recommendations of the 1983 task force?

  Judge THOMAS. We did everything in our power during my
tenure to reach out.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, did you, really, Judge? Did you go and
meet with the Council of La Raza, the GI Forum, or any of the
other national or local Hispanic groups, to see what they would
                                                208

suggest you do, or to ask for their counsel and suggestions and
advice?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I can't name, again, sitting here, all of
the groups that I have met with, but one of our Commissioners in
particular was very, very active, and he and I spent a great deal of
time together, because he would go, and he would report back on
what the perceptions of the problems were and approaches that we
could take. Again, he and I were there the entirety of my tenure,
with the exception of a few months. And a second Commissioner
who was also Hispanic, he and I worked very closely together to
begin to address some of these problems. And I am sure both of
them were very active and very involved, and I think they would
both tell you that I always

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, I appreciate that, but it doesn't
answer my question. What did you do? Did you go out and seek to
sit down with some of these national Hispanic groups regarding the
problem, or was it kind of your attitude that, look, I've got two His-
panics here; I'll let them take care of that; I am going to take care
of other areas that I think are of primary concern to me?

  I get a feeling that you did not pay attention yourself to Hispan-
ics--and that doesn't mean I am going to vote against you or for
you because of that single issue, because I don't make any decisions
that way, but I get a feeling that while you were there that that
was not high on your priority list, that you left it to the two His-
panic Commissioners, and you did something else, but yet you were
the Chairman.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I can assure you that I traveled over
this country to meet with various groups. I can't tell you precisely
right now which groups I met with. I know I met with any number
of Hispanic groups in my efforts to change the way that the agency
was responding.

  I believe that discrimination in this country--whether it is race,
gender, national origin, religion, age--that all of it is wrong,
and

  Senator DECONCINI. I don't question that, Judge, I don't question
that.

  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. And what I attempted to do was to
equalize treatment at the agency of all the areas. I was outside of
the agency to visit with these organizations. I can't tell you which
ones. I certainly tried to work with a number of the organizations.
Some, I had better relationships with during my tenure than
others.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, maybe you could help us--and I don't
know if you have time, or somebody could help you to go back over
your calendar. I'd like to know whom you did meet with in the His-
panic area. The feeling I have is that you really were not paying
attention to Hispanics--maybe not because you didn't like them--
I'm sure that isn't the case--maybe it is because you were so busy
dealing with women's issues and black discrimination, I don't
know. But I get that feeling, and from the opposition that has come
forward from the Hispanic community, you certainly didn't leave
them with any great impression that you were interested in their
problems, Judge.
                                         209

  Judge THOMAS. Well, Senator, I was, and I tried to resolve the
problems. As all of us know, when you run an agency as spread out
as EEOC, and with the difficult mission that we had, you have
your frustrations, and I certainly had my share, but I can assure
you that I tried to reach out to all the groups.

  Senator DECONCINI. My time is up, Judge. I will come back to
this and a couple of other areas later. Thank you, Judge Thomas.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make sure that
a letter sent to you and Senator Thurmond from former Attorney
General Benjamin Civiletti is introduced in the record, and I would
like to note as a statement in that record besides the fact that Mr.
Civiletti served the Carter administration, he has testified in sup-
port or has asked to testify in support of Judge Thomas, and these
are some words he used, "finding his tenacity and strength of char-
acter to be positive attributes for the work of the Court." So, I
would like to submit that for the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, and I can assure the Senator
that Greneral Civiletti has been invited to testify and we look for-
ward to hearing his testimony.

                 Re: Clarence Thomas Nomination

Dear Mr. Chairman:

       I write in support of thenomination of Clarence Thomas to
the Supreme Court and to respectfully request that if time and
the calendar permit that I be invited to be a a witness before
the Judiciary Committee on this matter.

       I support this nomination formany reasons but first
because Judge Thomas is qualified by education, training and
capacity to be a Supreme Court Justice. Further, I believe
that diversity of experience, age, geography, andbackground is
desirable on the Supreme Court, andJudge Thomas' age,
background, andupbringing differ from other members of the
Court. I also admire greatly Judge Thomas' tenacity and
strength of character in the successful pursuit of his legal
and public service career, positive attributes for the work of
the Court.

       On a personal note, oneof my partners, forwhom I have the
greatest respect, was a classmate of Judge Thomas in law school
and has kept in touch with himsince then, and this partner
endorses Judge Thomas without reservation as an outstanding
choice for the Supreme Court.

and particularly welcome you and your family, and I admired how
patient they have been sitting through all of this. They are to be
complimented, and particularly complimented for their support of
you during this time of trial, although you tend to be handling the
trial very well.

  I do not know what your son's career is going to be, but I am
sure it is not going to be in law, after he observes what you go
through. [Laughter.]

  Much of the discussion has focused on natural law, and while I
have listened intently to this and have some questions in that area,
I would like to pursue what I believe is a related subject, judicial
restraint. An understanding of your view on the role of the courts
in our democracy will, I really think, give us a better understand-
ing of where natural law fits into your judicial philosophy.

  The Founding Fathers, as Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Fed-
eralist Paper 78, intended the judiciary to be, in their words, the
least dangerous branch of government. Now, in your writings and
speeches, you have cited Hamilton's framework for Federal power,
power based on the sword, the purse, and the power of reason.
Hamilton said the President would hold the power of the sword,
the Congress the power of the purse.

  The judiciary, having neither power of the purse nor sword,
would derive its power and influence from its ability to provide rea-
soned and persuasive decisions, establishing sound legitimate rea-
sons for every dispute that it decided.

  I understand this to mean that judges would have to be fair, un-
biased, openminded, devoted to addressing the facts and the law
before them, without freedom to apply their own values in reach-
ing a decision. I would like to refer to what Judge Harlan Fiske
Stone expressed well, when he wrote--and then this will bring me
to a question for you--and this is Justice Stone, "While the uncon-
stitutional exercise of power by the Executive and Legislative
Branches of government is subject to judicial restraint, the only
check upon our exercise of power is our own sense of self-re-
straint."

  Yesterday, you told Senator Hatch that there was no room to
apply personal philosophies in one's effort to adjudicate cases. In
my first question, I hope that you will reaffirm what you said along
this line in your confirmation hearings for the Court of Appeals of
the D.C. Circuit. You said, "The ultimate goal should always be to
apply the will of Congress, the will of the legislature, I don't think
it is ever appropriate for a judge to replace the intent of the legis-
lature with his or her own intent." Is that something you can reaf-
firm today, after being on the circuit court of appeals?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, when I spoke those words in my confir-
mation hearing for the court of appeals, of course, I had not been a
judge. But now I can reaffirm those words with the experience of
having had to be a judge and having had to judge in some difficult
cases.

  I do not believe that there is room in opinions in our work of
judging for the personal predilections, the personal opinions and
views of judges. I think in statutory construction, the ultimate goal
for us is to determine the will of the legislature, the intent of the
                                         212

legislature, not what we would have replaced the legislative enact-
ment with, if we were in the legislature, and we have no role in
legislating.

  Senator GRASSLEY. TO continue along the same line, it seems to
me your notion of the role of courts is very similar to that of Jus-
tice Anthony Kennedy. He cautioned that judges are not to make
laws, they are to enforce the laws. He said the courts could not be
"the aristocracy of the robe," that is to say black robes of a judge
give the individual no special mandate to declare the law. How
close would you be to the statement made by Judge Kennedy?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, that we all who have been
judges are pretty close to the same statement. We recognize that
when we sit to judge cases, one, that we have to be open and we
have to think and we recognize our fallibility, as I said yesterday,
but we also have to recognize--and this is something that I do
before I sit down in each case, and in each of the cases that I sat on
on the court of appeals, I ask myself a very simple question, what
is the role of a judge in this case. I think that is an important ques-
tion. It is not so much to determine that we are going to in any
way constrain the development of individual rights. Indeed, I am
for the robust development of those rights. But, rather, it is a ques-
tion to restrain judges and to restrain me, so that I have a confined
and defined role.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I like those responses, but let me now refer to
a speech you gave that maybe on my reading of it bothers me, and
maybe on your explanation of it, you can clear it up. But I would
like to contrast what you said and also what you said in the earlier
confirmation hearing for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with a
speech at Wake Forest University in 1988, and I do have a copy of
the speech, if you want me to give it to you.

  There you said, "Once a law passes, the action shifts to the prob-
lem of administration, it is up to the courts and the bureaucracy to
fill in generalities and sometimes resolve the contradictions of the
law."

  Now, the reason this concerns me is because it is vaguely like
something Justice Souter said in response to some of my questions
last year, that the courts--and these are his words--"fill vacuums
left by Congress." That statement, of course, troubled me a year
ago. He later somewhat qualified it in responses to additional ques-
tions the following day.

  I guess my question is very basic. How much filling in are you
going to do, as a Supreme Court Justice? I hope you can clarify
something here. Do you think there is a role for the courts to be
activist this way in the terms of filling vacuums or, as you said,
filling in the generalities and resolving contradictions of the law?

  Maybe, you know, in a wider area, I would want you to explain
when is judicial activism legitimate.

  Judge THOMAS. I do not think that it is legitimate, Senator, and
perhaps let me respond to your specific question.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Surely.
  Judge THOMAS. The point that I was making there, and it is one
that was an important point, is that when an agency, an adminis-
trative agency receives a statute, it is called upon to implement
that statute, to develop regulations, perhaps internal rulings or
                                         213

procedures, but it is always called upon to do that consistent with
the intent of this body. The statute on its face may be general, it
may be ambiguous. The agency has to go through a process, howev-
er, of determining in a reasonable way what your intent was.

  I think a court does the same thing, that when there is ambigui-
ty in the statute, the court simply goes back to your legislative his-
tory and attempts to discern what was Congress' intent. To the
extent that we are talking about filling in in that instance, I think
it is simply a process of statutory interpretation and development
of rulemaking within the agency or the administrative bodies in
the executive branch.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Scalia testified here, and has practiced
it as a Justice, that in looking at history, he is not going to look to
the committee reports, he is not going to look to congressional
debate, he is going to look at the statute and just determine con-
gressional intent from the language of the statute. Is that where
you are going to get congressional intent?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't know how you can resolve ambi-
guities in statutes, and when we do have ambiguities in statutes,
then we look to legislative history, we look to the debates on the
floor, of course, we look to committee reports, conference reports,
we look to indications, the best indications of what your intent was.

  Of course, some legislative history is perhaps more accurate or
better than others, but the point is our effort is always to look for
your intent, to discern your intent. I don't know how one can go
about that process, the process of interpreting ambiguous statutes,
without looking to legislative history.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me go to maybe, along the same line, but
to some specific cases you have been involved in, because the
docket of the court you now sit on is filled with regulatory cases,
and in this position I think a judge could be tempted, with such a
big caseload, to direct and manage bureaucracy and, of course,
thereby substituting his or her own judgment for that of a more
politically accountable administrative agency.

  In fact, one of your colleague, Judge Mikva, has written that the
court should be on the lookout for--and this is as he termed it--a
sudden and profound change in agency policies, as such changes
constitute, in his words, danger signals and give license for court
intervention in agency action, in his view.

  Considering this, I was struck by your opinion in Citizens v.
Busey, and that is the Toledo Airport expansion case. Your opinion
expresses some important elements of judicial restraint. You found
that the FAA, in reviewing the expansion plans, carried out its
lawful authority. The plaintiffs wanted more review of the environ-
mental issues. What did you base your decision on--your opinion, I
should say?

  Judge THOMAS. First of all, let me say, Senator, that Chief Judge
Mikva and I and our other colleagues worked together very well
and have very vigorous debate internally on these important
issues, and I enjoy sitting with him as a colleague.

  In this case, the initial question was this: In determining wheth-
er or not or where Burlington-Northern was to place its hub, who
makes that initial decision or who determines the objective or the
goal of the project. And if the objective or the goal of the project is
                                         214

determined in a broad way, that is, Burlington-Northern is enti-
tled, the goal is a hub, then the alternative to be explored can be
very significant, they can be countless, a hub where in the United
States, or is a determination of the goal or objective to be made by
the city of Toledo and Burlington, that is, Burlington wants a hub
in Toledo, then the question becomes that the alternative is be-
tween that specific hub and no project at all.

  What we, in essence, found was that the decision should have
rested, the goal, the objective of the project rested with the individ-
uals who were applying for the FAA permission to build the hub,
rather than this broad expanse of possibilities.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me quote briefly from that opinion of
yours, and I guess not that you need to react, but I want to know if
this is good basis for me to judge your opinion of judicial restraint:

  Federal judges enforce the statute--

  In this case, it was the National Environmental Policy Act--

by insuring that agencies comply with NEPA's procedures, and not by trying to
coax agency decision-makers to reach certain results. We are forbidden from taking
sides in the debate over the merits of developing the Toledo Express Airport. We are
required, instead, only to confirm that the FAA has fulfilled its statutory obligation.
Congress wanted the agencies, not the courts, to evaluate plans to reduce environ-
mental damage, but the Federal courts are neither empowered nor competent to
micro-manage strategies for saving the Nation's parklands.

  That is you.
  Judge THOMAS. I think that, Senator, was my view, my opinion
as to what the intent of this body was, and my effort was to faith-
fully apply that in adjudicating in that particular case.
  Senator GRASSLEY. There are a lot of other cases like that I
would like to go over, but let me just do one more. It is your con-
currence in the Cross Sound Ferry v. Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion. The case involved the issue of standing. You agreed with
Judge Mikva's result, but just not the reasoning; is that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right. I concurred in the result in that
case, Senator.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I would like to have you elaborate on those
differences of views between Judge Mikva on the one hand and
your reasoning on the other.
  Judge THOMAS. My concurrence, the purpose was really a simple
question, one of the challenger. The case involved two ferry compa-
nies. One was an established ferry company, and there was a new-
comer who wanted to travel back and forth across Long Island
Sound. ICC determined that the newcomer was exempted from reg-
ulation. As we received the cases, one of the challenges was by the
existing ferry company that the ICC should have required of the
newcomer a filing or compliance with two environmental regula-
tions, NEPA and the Coastal Zone Management Act.
  The question was for me initially the question that I ask in all
cases and in all areas: Do we have jurisdiction to consider this?
And there is an argument sometimes that when the merits of the
case are easy and the jurisdictional component of the case is hard,
that it is easy enough to skip over determining jurisdiction and de-
termine the easy-merits portion of the case.
  My point in the concurrence was that it was inappropriate to
skip over the jurisdiction determination to get to the merits, that
                                         215

Federal judges had an obligation to determine at each turn wheth-
er or not we as judges had any role in that particular case. And my
view was that there was no standing to raise the issue on the part
of the existing ferry company.

  Senator GRASSLEY. One sentence that you said in that decision,
"Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. When Federal ju-
risdiction does not exist, Federal judges have no authority to exer-
cise it, even if everyone--judges, parties, members of the public--
wants the dispute resolved." It seemed to me like you set a very
narrow role for the courts. And my question then in regard to
going to the Supreme Court, you assume that is going to be the
same philosophy you start with, on standing and other things?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't think that we as judges should be
stingy or crabbed in our review of individuals' access to our judicial
system. I think it is important, as I said yesterday, that the courts
and our judicial system be available to all, that they have a place
where their case can be adjudicated in a fair way.

  My concern, however, is that we are judges who are required to
determine what our jurisdiction is before we can decide a case, and
I see that more as a restraint on us than it is on the individual
having access to the court system, although the two, of course,
could ultimately be the same thing in some cases. But the jurisdic-
tional determination to me is an important determination.

  Senator GRASSLEY. The doctrine of standing is a limitation on the
exercise of judicial power. Your opinions to me are good examples
of how a judge must restrain himself or herself in exercising power
he or she possesses. Has that general approach--maybe you have
had it throughout your lifetime as a lawyer, but has this been
strengthened in the year or 2 years you have been on the circuit
court?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, a couple of points. I think when one be-
comes a judge, as I have noted earlier, one begins to realize the dif-
ficulty of the cases that come before us. You don't have the comfort
of your position as an advocate. You don't reinforce your own argu-
ments. You have got to listen to all the arguments. And the argu-
ments can be equally forceful on either side.

  So I think that when we recognize our own fallibility and our
own humility, we become concerned about what our role is in each
of these cases, which is the second point. And we ask ourselves, Do
we belong in this case? What is our role? Do we have the author-
ity? And one learns a sense of humility.

  So I would say that my view--and one also recognizes, Senator, I
might add, that we are the least democratic branch of the Govern-
ment, and we have to restrain ourselves as judges. And I think that
is important. Indeed, I think it is critical so that we do not begin to
see ourselves as superlegislators.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Right there let me say that what you have
just said it seemed to me like is what Judge Scalia described him-
self and his colleagues on the High Court as: The unelected and
life-tenured judges who have been awarded extraordinary undemo-
cratic characteristics. And that was from a concurrence that Scalia
wrote in the Webstercase. And that is your approach. Your ap-
proach would be similar to Scalia's, then? I mean, I think you have
said the same thing.
                                         216

  Judge THOMAS. I think if his point is, Senator, that we are not
elected to make policy, we are not in the position to make the
kinds of difficult decisions that the elected, the political branches
make, then I think he is right. We are judges, and I don't think
that we should stray beyond our role in the undemocratic, the most
undemocratic branch of the Government into the political, the au-
thority and the role of the political branches.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, the political branches, too, have great
responsibility to protect our liberties, and since judges are not ac-
countable to the body politic and should not have the responsibility
of deciding sensitive and controversial issues of the day, and that is
judicial activism, that is legislating, judges trying to do our job
from the bench. I guess I need to have you tell Americans what
you see as the dangers of judges substituting their ideas for those
of the political branches of government.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that, briefly, the danger is inher-
ent in the fact that there are no checks and balances as you have
in the political branches for judges. We don't stand for elections. If
we do the wrong things, we are not challenged by an opponent, and
we don't lose our incumbencies as an elected official. We don't have
to go back to our districts and be told that we have done the wrong
thing. We are lifetime appointments. And I think that there is a
danger with the lack of that check, the lack of that exposure to
elections, and the lack of the tensions between the political
branches that we could do things as judges that we think are noth-
ing more than a matter of our personal opinions. And I think it
would be inappropriate. I think it is a very significant danger.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I would ask if you, in just what you have said,
if you would be standing behind a 1987 speech that you gave before
the Cato Institute. The quote: "When political decisions have been
made by judges, they have lacked the moral authority of the major-
ity. When courts have made important political and social decisions
in the absence of majority support, they have only exacerbated the
controversies." My question, in a sense, is then you are saying leav-
ing the difficult, sometimes contentious decisions to the elected rep-
resentatives, then there should be no concern or fear among the
American people.

  Judge THOMAS. I think that, of course, Senator, we always have
concerns and fears and different points of views, and there is
always debate and give and take. But I think that those political
decisions, those policies should be developed and debated and estab-
lished in and by the legislature; that the judge's role is not to legis-
late and it is not to set policy, and it is certainly not to engage in
political decisionmaking.

  Senator GRASSLEY. There may be a trend away from judicial ac-
tivism, but I don't think we have seen the last of it. I would like to
draw your attention to some recent cases in which district judges
engaged in judicial activism. The first is a case that arose in a New
Jersey Federal court. It was in Morristown. The public library
board of trustees issued regulations designed to ensure that the li-
brary did not become home to vagrants. The regulations required
that patrons use the library as it was intended to be used; that is,
"for reading, studying, or using library material." So the court
                                         217

struck down the library's regulation saying that everyone has a
right to receive ideas, and the library cannot restrict access.

  There was a New York Federal judge who just this past June
found that panhandling might be protected speech under the first
amendment, and this was despite the fact of a second circuit ruling
to the contrary from last year.

  Now, I realize that you are going to be reluctant to comment on
the merits of these cases since such issues could come before the
Supreme Court. But I hope--and I suppose this is more of a state-
ment than a question--no, I guess I would really want it to be a
question. Can you see these as examples of a court's usurping the
function of legislative bodies and making rather than applying or
interpreting the law?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, unfortunately, I don't know the full
facts in those cases, and I think it would be inappropriate for me to
try to comment on those particular cases. But let me just simply
say this: That I think that we all as judges should be concerned
and should be aware, or at least be cautious not to move into areas
that are best left to, as I said, the political branches and to the leg-
islature. But those specific cases, I simply don't know the details of
them, and I think even if I did, it would be inappropriate to com-
ment on them.

  Senator GRASSLEY. OK. Maybe it is, but let me make this point to
you to think about, and whether or not those cases might not be
inconsistent with the point you made in that 1987 Cato Institute
talk, where you stated, "Maximization of rights is perfectly com-
patible with total government regulation. Unbound by notions of
obligation and justice, the desire to protect rights simply plays into
the hands of those who advocate a total state. The rhetoric of free-
dom [license, really] encourages the expansion of bureaucratic gov-
ernment."

  My time is up. I just want to leave the subject with a quote from
Felix Frankfurter on the role of judges. He found the duty not to
enlarge his authority to be one of the greatest challenges of being a
judge. He continued, and let me quote probably about 40 words--

  That the court is not the maker of policy but is concerned solely with the question
of ultimate power, is a tenet by which all justices have subscribed. But the extent to
which they have translated faith into works probably marks the deepest cleavage
among the men who have sat on the Supreme Court. The conception of significant
achievement on the Supreme Court has been too much identified with largeness of
utterness and too little governed by inquiry into the extent to which the judges have
fulfilled their professed role in the American constitutional system.

  I hope I see your confirmation bringing to the Supreme Court
one more person like Felix Frankfurter, who is going to be looking
at and inquiring into the extent to which judges have fulfilled their
role in the American constitutional system.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator, and thank you, Judge. We
will recess until 2 p.m.
  [Whereupon, at 12:40 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 2 p.m., the same day.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  The Chair recognizes Senator Leahy.
                                         218

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, welcome back this afternoon. Judge, I would like
to just go over a couple of points prompted by some of your earlier
testimony.
  A couple of thoughts occur to me. I was looking over the notes of
your responses to Senator Kennedy's questions yesterday. You
recall that when he talked about the Lewis Lehrman article, "the
Declaration of Independence and the Right to Life," he referred to
your statement, in which you called the Lehrman article a "splen-
did example of applying natural law."
  I understand your answer was that you were speaking in the
Lewis Lehrman Auditorium, with Lewis Lehrman sitting there, re-
ferring to Lewis Lehrman's article, and that you intended to make
your conservative audience more receptive to natural law princi-
ples as it applied to civil rights. Is that a fair restatement of your
answer?
  Judge THOMAS. I think with the possible exception of "Lew Lehr-
man sitting there."
  Senator LEAHY. Oh, that is my misconception. He was not there,
then?
  Judge THOMAS. Not to my knowledge.
  Senator LEAHY. OK. Was the rest a fair restatement?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you. So, granting that it was a strategic
remark for the reasons that you stated, did you believe the article
was "a splendid example of applying natural law"?
  Judge THOMAS. AS I indicated yesterday, Senator, that I did not
and do not think that natural law can be applied to resolve this
particular issue, I think it is a constitutional matter and it has to
be resolved under constitutional law, as a matter of constitutional
law.
  Senator LEAHY. But that is not precisely my question. My ques-
tion was, did you believe the article was a splendid example of ap-
plying natural law? Just on that narrow line: Do you believe the
article itself was "a splendid example of applying natural law"?
  Judge THOMAS. Let me explain what I was trying to say. What I
was trying to say
  Senator LEAHY. YOU cannot answer that specific question?
  Judge THOMAS. What I am trying to say, so I am not misunder-
stood, Senator
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, he has a right to explain his
position.
  Judge THOMAS. What I was trying to say is here is a good exam-
ple
  Senator LEAHY. If Senator Thurmond wishes to join him at the
witness stand--but go ahead, Judge.
  Senator THURMOND. I would be glad to do it, but he has a right
to explain his answers.
  Senator LEAHY. GO ahead, Judge.
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator.
  My point was that here is an example of one of yours using natu-
ral law. I was not commenting on the substance of its use, so it^was
an example, it was a splendid example in the sense that it was a
compliment to him and it is a compliment to someone they be-
                                         219

lieved in, and I would reaffirm what I said yesterday and I have
said consistently, and that is that at no time did I adopt or endorse
the substance of the article itself.

  My interest in that one sentence, I believe, was to get a conserva-
tive audience that was skeptical of a concept to be more receptive
to that concept in the area that I wanted to use, in the area of civil
rights. That speech is on the treatment of blacks by conservatives,
treatment of minority issues in the Reagan administration, and a
sort of request and a push or a tug to them to be more receptive in
this area and to be aggressive in this area. It was not an endorse-
ment of that article.

  Senator LEAHY. DO you feel that your answer today is in any way
inconsistent with what you said then?

  Judge THOMAS. What I said?
  Senator LEAHY. At that time?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you. And you understand my confusion in
the two answers, but you explain that confusion in that the state-
ment then and your answer today are consistent?
  Judge THOMAS. I said that they were consistent.
  Senator LEAHY. OK. Then you feel your answer today is consist-
ent with what you said back at the time you spoke in the Lewis
Lehrman Auditorium?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my statement today is consistent with
what I intended to do and what I did in the Lew Lehrman Audito-
rium. My interest, as I indicated to you, and I think I repeated a
number of times here, it was in civil rights and finding unifying
principles in the area of civil rights.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, let me make sure that I understand. Is it
your testimony here today and yesterday that you do not endorse
the Lewis Lehrman article to the extent that it argues under the
natural law principles of the Declaration of Independence that a
fetus has an inalienable right to life at the moment of conception?
Is that your testimony?
  Judge THOMAS. I do not--my testimony is that, with respect to
those issues, the issues involved or implicated in the issue of abor-
tion, I do not believe that Mr. Lehrman's application of natural law
is appropriate.
  Senator LEAHY. Had you read that article before you praised it?
  Judge THOMAS. I think I skimmed it, Senator. My interest, again,
was in the fact that he used the notion or the concept of natural
law, and my idea was to import that notion to something that I
was very interested in.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, you certainly
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, would the Senator yield? I did not
understand one answer.
  Did you say that you do not believe that Mr. Lehrman's applica-
tion of natural law in that article was appropriate?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU do not believe it is appropriate?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Judge THOMAS. I said that my testimony has been that that diffi-
cult issue is to be resolved as a matter of constitutional law.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, the chairman has anticipated my next
question. When you gave the speech, which was in 1987, as I recall
the testimony, did you understand that the consequences of Mr.
Lehrman's position were not just that Roe v. Wade should be over-
turned, but that abortion, even in cases of rape and incest, should
be banned in every State of the Union? Did you understand that to
be the position that he was taking in that article?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, until recently, in reflecting on it, I did
not know, I could not recall the entire content of that article until
I read recent articles about it. Again, my interest was very, very
limited
  Senator LEAHY. I understand-
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. And the----·
  Senator LEAHY. YOU have read the article now, though, now that
it has been brought up
  Judge THOMAS. I have not re-read it. I have not re-read it.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU have it?
  Judge THOMAS. I have not re-read the article.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you have the article?
  Judge THOMAS. I do not have it with me.
  Senator LEAHY. Does somebody want to just--I want to make
sure somebody gives it to you, Judge. Let me say that the article,
as written, takes a position not just that Roe v. Wade should be
overturned, but that abortion, even in cases of rape and incest,
should be banned in every State of the Union. Assuming that is the
thrust or one of the main points of the article, do you agree with
that?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, Senator, it would be, I think, for me to re-
spond to what my views are on those particular issues would really
undermine my ability to be impartial in those cases. I have at-
tempted to respond as candidly and openly as I possibly can, with-
out in any way undermining or compromising my ability to rule on
these cases.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, let's just go, then, to Mr. Lehrman's posi-
tions. Under his theory of natural law, every abortion in this coun-
try would be criminalized. Do you understand that to be his posi-
tion? I am not asking whether it is yours, but do you understand
that to be his position in that article?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, I would have to re-read the article, Sena-
tor. I understand the criticisms that you have of the article, but my
point to you here today, as well as in other questioning concerning
this article, is that I did not adopt or import anything more from
this article than the use of this one notion of natural law.
  Senator LEAHY. Might I ask you to do this, then, Judge, because
we will have another go-round on this. It would only take about 4
or 5 minutes to read that article sometime between now and the
next go-round. Could you please find the time to read it? And if
you get crammed with too many things between now and then
when I get my next turn around, I will just stop and give you time
to read it right then.
  Judge THOMAS. OK. Thank you.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, Mr. Lehrman drew a parallel between the
struggle for liberty by slaves with a struggle "for the inalienable
                                         221

right to life of the child-in-the-womb--and thus, the right to life of
all future generations." Do you understand the parallel of the
struggle for liberty by slaves with the struggle for the inalienable
right to life of the child in the womb, and thus, the right to life of
all future generations? Do you agree with that comparison?

  Judge THOMAS. Again, Senator, I have not re-read this article. I
would take you up on your offer to go back and re-read it. My in-
terest was on the issue of slavery, Senator, it was an important
issue to me. The concept of liberty and life, et cetera, are very gen-
eral concepts. I would like to just take the time to go back and re-
read it

  Senator LEAHY. Fair enough.
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. And be fair in my response to you.
  Senator LEAHY. I absolutely agree.
  Judge THOMAS. But let me, if I could say this--my interest in
this article was as I have testified before this committee, and I
think indicated in some of our prior meetings, it was very impor-
tant to me to convince conservatives that they should openly sup-
port and be aggressive in their support of civil rights.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, does a fetus have the constitutional status
of a person?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I cannot think of any cases that have
held that. I would have to go back and rethink that. I cannot think
of any cases that have held that.
  Senator LEAHY. If somebody were to raise that issue in a court,
how would a judge go about making a determination of that? I am
not asking you to make a determination, but how would a judge do
that? Does he or she go to a medical text, a philosophical text,
theological treatises? How does one make such a determination?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I could only offer this, and I have not
made that determination and I have not gone through that kind of
analysis, but, of course, one would rely in any case in which one is
making a difficult determination, one would rely on the adversarial
process to sharpen the issues. One would rely on precedent. One
would certainly rely on related areas, such as the area of medicine.
In the area of Roe v. Wade, I think there was considerable reliance
on medical evidence. Again, I am doing that in a vacuum, and I
was--
  Senator LEAHY. I understand that. Of course, even in the adver-
sarial process, a judge can oftentimes shape and direct in a most
appropriate way. Any judge I have ever appeared before--if he or
she felt that the adversaries did not present enough evidence to
help the judge decide--would certainly have the right to ask the
adversaries for more information.
  In an area like this, do you rely on theology? Do you rely on ju-
risprudence? Do you rely on medical information? Or do you rely
on experience?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, I would like to just simply say
that, of course, one could see where medical, certainly experience
and one could see where precedent would be relevant. I do not see
at this point where theology would be relevant.
  Again, I would like to refrain from further speculation in this
very difficult area. The point that I am making to you, and I think
it is an important point, is that when a judge is engaged in any
                                         222

kind of an effort to make difficult decisions-in any area, a judge
tries to examine the relevant evidence and tries to reach a rea-
soned conclusion and tries to reach a conclusion, without implicat-
ing or without involving his or her personal opinions.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge, you were in law school at the time Roe v.
Wade was decided. That was 17 or 18 years ago. You would accept,
would you not, that in the last generation, Roe v. Wadeis certainly
one of the more important cases to be decided by the U.S. Supreme
Court?

  Judge THOMAS. I would accept that it has certainly been one of
the more important, as well as one that has been one of the more
highly publicized and debated cases.

  Senator LEAHY. SO, it would be safe to assume that when that
decision came down--you were in law school, where recent case
law is oft discussed--that Roe v. Wade would have been discussed
in the law school while you were there?

  Judge THOMAS. The case that I remember being discussed most
during my early part of law school was I believe in my small group
with Thomas Emerson may have been Griswold, since he argued
that, and we may have touched on Roe v. Wade at some point and
debated that, but let me add one point to that.

  Because I was a married student and I worked, I did not spend a
lot of time around the law school doing what the other students en-
joyed so much, and that is debating all the current cases and all of
the slip opinions. My schedule was such that I went to classes and
generally went to work and went home.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge Thomas, I was a married law student who
also worked, but I also found, at least between classes, that we did
discuss some of the law, and I am sure you are not suggesting that
there wasn't any discussion at any time of Roe v. Wade?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I cannot remember personally engaging
in those discussions.

  Senator LEAHY. OK.
  Judge THOMAS. The groups that I met with at that time during
my years in law school were small study groups.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you ever had discussion of Roe v. Wade,
other than in this room, in the 17 or 18 years it has been there?
  Judge THOMAS. Only, I guess, Senator, in the fact in the most
general sense that other individuals express concerns one way or
the other, and you listen and you try to be thoughtful. If you are
asking me whether or not I have ever debated the contents of it,
that answer to that is no, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you ever, in private gatherings or other-
wise, stated whether you felt that it was properly decided or not?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, in trying to recall and reflect on that, I
don't recollect commenting one way or the other. There were,
again, debates about it in various places, but I generally did not
participate. I don't remember or recall participating, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. SO you don't ever recall stating whether you
thought it was properly decided or not?
  Judge THOMAS. I can't recall saying one way or the other, Sena-
tor.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, was it properly decided or not?
                                        223

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that that is where I just have to
say what I have said before; that to comment on the holding in
that case would compromise my ability to

  Senator LEAHY. Let me ask you this: Have you made any deci-
sion in your own mind whether you feel Roe y. Wade was properly
decided or not, without stating what that decision is?

  Judge THOMAS. I have not made, Senator, a decision one way or
the other with respect to that important decision.

  Senator LEAHY. When you came up for confirmation last time for
the circuit court of appeals, did you consider your feelings on Roe
v. Wade, in case you would be asked?

  Judge THOMAS. I had not--would I have considered, Senator, or
did I consider?

  Senator LEAHY. Did you consider.
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. SO you cannot recollect ever taking a position on
whether it was properly decided or not properly decided, and you
do not have one here that you would share with us today?
  Judge THOMAS. I do not have a position to share with you here
today on whether or not that case was properly decided. And, Sena-
tor, I think that it is appropriate to just simply state that it is--for
a judge, that it is late in the day as a judge to begin to decide
whether cases are rightly or wrongly decided when one is on the
bench. I truly believe that doing that undermines your ability to
rule on those cases.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, with all due respect, Judge, I have some
difficulty with your answer that somehow this case has been so far
removed from your discussions or feelings during the years since it
was decided while you were in law school. You have participated in
a working group that criticized Roe. You cited Roe in a footnote to
your article on the privileges or immunity clause. You have re-
ferred to Lewis Lehrman's article on the meaning of the right to
life. You specifically referred to abortion in a column in the Chica-
go Defender. I cannot believe that all of this was done in a vacuum
absent some very clear considerations of Roe v. Wade, and, in fact,
twice specifically citing Roe v. Wade.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, your question to me was did I debate the
contents of Roe v. Wade, the outcome in Roe v. Wade, do I have
this day an opinion, a personal opinion on the outcome in Roe v.
Wade; and my answer to you is that I do not.
  Senator LEAHY. Notwithstanding the citing of it in the article on
privileges or immunities, notwithstanding the working group that
criticized Roe?
  Judge THOMAS. I would like to have the cite to it. Again, notwith-
standing the citation, if there is one, I did not and do not have a
position on the outcome.
  With respect to the working group, Senator, as I have indicated,
the working group did not include the drafting by that working
group of the final report. My involvement in that working group
was to submit a memorandum, a memorandum that I felt was an
important one, on the issue of low-income families. And I thought
that that was an important contribution and one that should have
been a central part in the report. But with respect to the other
comments, I did not participate in those comments.
                                         224

  Senator LEAHY. I will make sure that you have an opportunity to
read both the footnote citation and the Lewis Lehrman article
before we get another go-round. But am I also correct in character-
izing your testimony here today as feeling that as a sitting judge it
would be improper even to express an opinion on Roe v. Wade, if
you do have one?

  Judge THOMAS. That is right, Senator. I think the important
thing for me as a judge, Senator, has been to maintain my impar-
tiality. When one is in the executive branch--and I have been in
the executive branch, and I have tried to engage in debate and
tried to advance the ball in discussions, tried to be a good advocate
for my points of views and listening to other points of views. But
when you move to the judiciary, I don't think that you can afford
to continue to accumulate opinions in areas that are strongly con-
troverted because those issues will eventually be before the Court
in some form or another.

  Senator LEAHY. Of course, as Senator Metzenbaum pointed out
earlier today, you have spoken about a number of cases, and I un-
derstand your differentiation in your answers to his question on
that. But I wonder if those cases somehow fit a different category.
The expression once was that the Supreme Court reads the newspa-
pers, and I suppose we can update that today to say that Supreme
Court nominees read the newspapers and know that this issue is
going to be brought up.

  But, Judge, other sitting Justices have expressed views on key
issues such as--well, take Roe v. Wade. You know, Justice Scalia
has expressed opposition to Roe. Does that disqualify him if it
comes up? Justice Blackmun not only wrote the decision but has
spoken in various forums about why it was a good decision. Is
either one of them disqualified from hearing abortion cases as a
result?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that each one of them has to de-
termine in his mind at what point do they compromise their impar-
tiality or it is perceived that they have compromised their objectivi-
ty or their ability to sit fairly on those cases. And I think for me,
shortly after I went on the court of appeals, I remember chatting
with a friend just about current events and issues. And I can re-
member her saying to me, asking me three or four times what my
opinion was on a number of issues, and my declining to answer
questions that when I was in the executive branch I would have
freely answered. And her point was that I was worthless as a con-
versationalist now because I had no views on these issues. And I
told her that I had changed roles and the role that I had was one
that did not permit me or did not comport with accumulating
points of views.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, I might just state parenthetically, I have
been both a prosecutor and a defense attorney, and I have been
before judges who have expressed very strong views on the idea
that when they go on the bench, they do not go into a monastery--
they still are part of the populace, able to express views. And I
have been there when they have expressed views both for and
against a position of a client I might be representing, whether it is
the State on the one hand or the defendant on another. But I have
also felt secure in knowing that they were fairminded people and
                                        225

would set their own personal opinions aside, as judges are supposed
to and as you have testified one should do in such a case.

  Let me ask you this: Would you keep an open mind on cases
which concern the question of whether the ninth amendment pro-
tected a given right? I would assume you would answer yes.

  Judge THOMAS. The ninth amendment, I think the only concern I
have expressed with respect to the ninth amendment, Senator, has
been a generic one and one that I think that we all would have
with the more openended provisions in the Constitution, and that
is that a judge who is adjudicating under those openended provi-
sions tether his or her ruling to something other than his or her
personal point of view.

  Now, the ninth amendment has, to my knowledge, not been used
to decide a particular case by a majority of the Supreme Court, and
there hasn't been as much written on that as some of the other
amendments. That does not mean, however, that there

  Senator LEAHY. That is not what I am
  Judge THOMAS. That does not mean, however, that there couldn't
be a case that argues or uses the ninth amendment as a basis for
an asserted right that could come before the Court that does not--
that the Court or myself, if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed,
would not be open to hearing and open to deciding.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU are saying that you would have an open
mind on ninth amendment cases?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator LEAHY. I ask that because you have expressed some very
strong views, as you know better than all of us, on the ninth
amendment. You had an article that was reprinted in a Cato Insti-
tute book on the Reagan years. You refer to Justice Goldberg's "in-
vention," of the ninth amendment in his concurring opinion in
Griswold. And you said--and let me quote from you. You said,
"Far from being a protection, the ninth amendment will likely
become an additional weapon for the enemies of freedom." A pretty
strong statement. But you would say, would you not, Judge, not-
withstanding that strong statement, that if a ninth amendment
case came before you, you would have an open mind?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, Senator, as I noted, my concern was that I
didn't believe that--in such an openended provision as the ninth
amendment, it was my view that a judge would have to tether his
or her view or his or her interpretation to something other than
just their feeling that this right is OK or that right is OK. I believe
the approach that Justice Harlan took in Poe v. Ullman and again
reaffirmed in Griswold in determining the--or assessing the right
of privacy was an appropriate way to go.
  Senator LEAHY. That is not really my point. The point I am
making is that you expressed very strong views--and you have
here, too--about the ninth amendment. My question is: Notwith-
standing those very strong views you have expressed about the
ninth amendment--pretty adverse views about it--would you have
an open mind in a case before you where somebody is relying on
the ninth amendment?
  Judge THOMAS. The answer to that is, Senator, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. But if you were to express similar views regard-
ing the principles and reasoning of Roe v. Wade, you feel that
                                         226

somehow it would preclude you from having that same kind of ob-
jectivity as the views you have expressed about the ninth amend-
ment?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't believe, Senator, that I have expressed
any view on the ninth amendment, beyond what I have said in this
hearing, after becoming a member of the judiciary. As I pointed
out, I think it is important that when one becomes a member of
the judiciary that one ceases to accumulate strong viewpoints, and
rather begin to, as I noted earlier, to strip down as a runner and to
maintain and secure that level of impartiality and objectivity nec-
essary for judging cases.

  Senator LEAHY. Does that mean if you were just a nominee, a
private citizen as a nominee to the Supreme Court, you could
answer the question, but as a judge you cannot?

  Judge THOMAS. I think a judge is even more constrained than a
nominee, but I also believe that in this process, that if one does not
have a formulated view, I don't see that it improves or enhances
impartiality to formulate a view, particularly in some of these diffi-
cult areas.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is up, but I
am sure the judge realizes that we will probably havj to revisit
this subject a tad more. Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  The Chair recognizes Senator Kennedy for a moment regarding a
clarification of a quote that was used this morning.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think there was
just one area of clarification.
  Yesterday I questioned Judge Thomas, and I used these words:

  Mr. Sowell goes on to suggest that employers are justified in believing that mar-
ried women are less valuable as employees than married men. He says that if a
woman is not willing to work overtime as often as some other workers, needs more
time off for personal emergencies, that may make her less valuable as an employee
or less promotable to jobs with heavier responsibilities.

  And then the judge went on and gave his response to that ques-
tion.

  In a response to a question earlier this morning from Senator
DeConcini, Judge Thomas said, "There were questions on--I think
the comment yesterday by Senator Kennedy, I believe, was some-
thing to the effect that women who were married weren't as good
employees. And as an employer and someone who has employed a
significant number of women, I did not find that to be true and
made that very clear."

  I would just like to ask consent that the record--I understood
what Judge Thomas was trying to say this morning, and

  Judge THOMAS. I did not intend to attribute Professor Sowell's
quotes to you. [Laughter.]

  Senator KENNEDY. SO I would just ask consent that the record re-
flect that modification at the appropriate point.

  Senator LEAHY. I thought that was a little out of character there,
Ted.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the record will be corrected.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Spec-
ter.
                                         227

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, incidentally, last July on a monthly call-in show,
there was a lot of interest by people in my State, and some people
didn't really understand the process as to what we were doing. And
it might be well just to say that when questions are asked, that
does not suggest in any way a disagreement with your position, but
an effort to draw out how you would function if confirmed as a Su-
preme Court Justice. In moving beyond your legal qualifications,
we are following a practice of going into constitutional law very
much as I had said in my opening when Chief Justice Rehnquist,
as a lawyer back in 1958, stated the importance of having the Judi-
ciary Committee get into questions of equal protection of the law
and due process of law; and that in the thoroughness of our efforts
to find out how you would function as a Supreme Court Justice, we
do so because of the tremendous importance of the role of a Jus-
tice, illustrated by 18 decisions last year by a 5-4 vote. And if you
serve as long or to an age of Justice Thurgood Marshall, who is 83,
it would put you on the Court for 40 years, or until the year 2031.
  So I make those introductory comments, repetitious to some
extent of what I said in my opening, to give some parameter as to
how I see the confirmation hearings, and the importance of the
separation of powers, and the Senate's role in advice and consent.
Because under our system of government, the President nominates,
the Senate consents or not, and then the Justices on the Supreme
Court have the final word in so many issues of such tremendous
importance.
  Judge Thomas, in my opening yesterday, I outlined the key focus
on my concern, and that is on the very fundamental issue as to the
Supreme Court's interpreting law and not making law. And there
has already been considerable discussion about that subject, and
you have articulated your view that the Court should defer to con-
stitutional intent and should interpret law and not make law.
  You have dealt, as Chairman of EEOC, with many very impor-
tant Supreme Court decisions, and there are quite a number that I
would like to discuss with you. But I want to start with one for il-
lustrative purposes--and I could pick many--and that involves the
case decided by the Supreme Court back in 1987 where a woman
had applied for a job as a road dispatcher. There were 238 posi-
tions, all held by men. She was competing with a man named Paul
Johnson in the transportation system of Santa Clara County, which
is the name of the case. Mr. Johnson had a better test score, but as
part of an affirmative action program, no quotas but affirmative
action, the employer gave the job to the woman.
  You had commented about this case in a speech which you made
in 1987, and I would like to make available to you two speeches
and one article so that you can have them available during the
course of my questioning. I agree with Senator Simpson; they all
ought to be a part of the record, and I would ask unanimous con-
sent, Mr. Chairman, that they be placed in the record so that the
totality of what Judge Thomas had to say in those speeches is ap-
parent.
  In the course of the speech in 1987, you said this: "Let me com-
mend to you Justice Scalia's dissent, which I hope will provide
guidance for lower courts and a possible majority in future deci-
                                         228

sions." The comment about guidance for lower courts we will come
back to. Perhaps it will be for Senator Simon. He raised that pre-
liminarily yesterday. But the point that I will focus on at the
moment is Justice Scalia's dissent as possible guidance for future
decisions.

  You then said--in the article on "Assessing the Reagan Years"
in the compilation by Mr. Boaz, while you did not say that they
were enough, you refer to "quick-fix solutions such as the appoint-
ment of another Justice with the right views."

  You further note in the Boaz article that, "In each case"--and
now you refer to a series of them, including the Johnson decision--
"In each case, Congress could have reinterpreted its legislative
intent to rebut the interpretation of Justice Brennan in Weber, but,
of course, it"--referring to Congress--"demurred."

  You have commented very extensively about your view of the
Congress. I don't quarrel with your view of the Congress except as
it relates--and I don't even quarrel with it then. I just want to find
out your views concerning the Supreme Court as to carrying out
constitutional intent. And in a speech on April 8, 1988, a copy pro-
vided to you, you said, "Congress is no longer primarily a delibera-
tive or even a lawmaking body. There is little deliberation and
even less wisdom in the manner in which the legislative branch
conducts business." Members act for "their own interests." "Inter-
ests of few take precedence over interests of the many."

  Now, my question to you is: In a context where you think the
Johnson case should be overruled, and in the context where you
have articulated your regard, such as it is, for Congress, and you
have--I really don't quarrel with your view of the Congress. A lot
of people have that view of the Congress. I really don't. And I
think it is important to back up for just a minute on some funda-
mentals for a lot of people who were listening, and that is that
Congress makes the law, we make public policy, and the Court is
supposed to interpret the law. And we all agree on those rules. And
there are a lot of illustrations where Congress has overruled what
the Supreme Court has done on legislative intent where Congress
doesn't like what the Court has done.

  And I would ask unanimous consent at this point, Mr. Chairman,
that a list of some 23 decisions which Congress overruled between
1982 and 1986 be inserted in the record. And we could talk about
those at great length, but the point is that Congress does know how
to overrule the Court on matters of constitutional intent.

  The CHAIRMAN. They will be included in the record.

     There is already some evidence that Congress has been less

restrained in overruling the pronouncements of the Court. Between 1982

and 1986, Congress overruled atleast twenty-threeSupreme Court deci-
sions--half within two years ofthe date ofthe decision.103 These enact-

ments cover a wide range of decisions. For example, in three separate

instances, Congress directly overruled Court decisions concerning state
and local liability under federal acts.104 In addition, Congress has either

passed or is presently considering five bills overruling Court decisions
that ease limitations on prosecutions and sentencing.103 In all, Congress

1991]  WHEN CONGRESS OVERRULES THE COURT  749

overruled more than twice as many decisions in the first four years after
President Reagan's first appointment to the Supreme Court than in the
entire decade preceding his election.106 Although there has been no sug-
gestion that the Court's rulings in all these cases were politically moti-
vated, the accelerated pace of overrulings may reflect a dangerous view
on the part of Congress that even proper pronouncements of the Court
are entitled to less respect.

                                              CONCLUSION

      The risks of constitutional quibbling have been recognized for more
than a century. In 1883, Justice Harlan complained about the Supreme
Court proceeding "upon grounds entirely too narrow and artificial [, sac-
rificing] the substance and spirit of the . . . amendments of the
Constitution . . . by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism."107 Around
the turn of the century, Dean Roscoe Pound asserted that the laissez-
faire judiciary was at grave risk of being cut off from the populace. He
stated that the Court, which once stood as a protection to the individual
from the Crown and the State, now "really stands between the public and
what the public needs and desires, and protects individuals who need no
protection against society which does need it."108 Today, many of these
same objections are being directed at the Court: critics complain that the
Court's decisions are "needlessly cramped" in order to accomplish other

  Senator SPECTER. But here you have been explicit in the quick fix
of judges who have the right view. You have identified the Johnson
case as one where you hope that the dissent will provide the basis
for a majority when judges are added. You have stated what you
think of the Congress. And the question is: What assurances can
you give to the Senate that you will follow constitutional intent as
opposed to your own public policy views on those cases?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, when one is involved in the midst of a
debate in the executive branch and advocating a point of view, as I
alluded to earlier, one continues to advocate that point of view as
an executive.

  When I moved to the judiciary, as I noted earlier, I ceased advo-
cating those points of views. I think that you can have the comfort
of your position, and I felt that in those cases that the constitution-
al intent was one of nondiscrimination that was explicit in the lan-
guage of the statute and clear in the language of the legislative his-
tory. That was my reading of constitutional intent.

  Of course, the Court took a different point of view, and those of
us who may not have agreed with that point of view simply had to
swallow hard and go along.

  I might add here that I think--and I feel very strongly--that this
matter of disagreeing over what the appropriate remedies are--and
this, just parenthetically, does not in any way indicate the depth of
my commitment to fighting discrimination. I think it was an im-
portant disagreement as to how far you can go with your efforts to
move people into the work force that you believe should be in the
work force who had been left out, and the effort of trying to also
preserve that notion of fairness and nondiscrimination that I
thought was central in the statute.

  With respect to my disagreements with Congress, I think that
those of us who were in the executive branch--and I am certain
that those who are in Congress have their disagreements with the
members of the executive branch, that there is tension between the
two political branches. And certainly I have had a sufficient
number of oversight hearings and a sufficient number of battles to
know that that tension was alive and well. But when one goes to
the judiciary, I think it is important to remain neutral in those
policy battles, and that is something that I have certainly attempt-
ed to do.

  With respect to whether or not a policy point of view or a view
that I advocated as a member of the executive branch will under-
mine my ability to rule on cases as a judge, my answer to you, Sen-
ator, is that it will not. I advocated as an advocate, and now I rule
as a judge. And I think that that is important. I think it is an im-
portant distinction. I think it is a requirement that I be impartial,
and I have attempted to do that.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Thomas, I am going to come to the
issue of remedies, and I can understand your disagreement on over-
sight. Both of those are different issues. And I understand your as-
sertion of impartiality, and I do not question it. But where you
have repeatedly over such a long period of time expressed a very
strong view as to congressional ineptitude--and you did that in the
Fullilove case: "What can one expect of a Congress that would pass
the ethnic set-aside law?" And you have, again in the speech on
                                          232

April 8, 1988, referred to the extensive policymaking role of the
Court: "When they have made important --referring to the
courts--"made important political and social decisions in the ab-
sence of majority support, they have only exacerbated the contro-
versies they have pronounced.

  If the Court rules in the presence of majority support, does that
give the Court any license to act? It suggests that it does.

  The problem I have, Judge Thomas, is that if you take a large
body of your writings, where you disagree with these cases and you
disagree to the core with the congressional function, what assur-
ances will we have that you will respect congressional intent?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I throughout my writings--and I can't
find all the quotes now--made it clear that those difficult policy de-
cisions debating the large issues are precisely the role of Congress.
There may be disagreements when one is in the executive branch,
but those disagreements cease and policymaking debates cease
when one goes to the judiciary.

  The difficulties that I have expressed differences, particularly as
one who has been involved in the oversight process, but I think I
have made it clear that the legislative function of Congress, that
the oversight function of Congress are very appropriate. And,
again, I can't go back through all the speeches, but my view would
be that the Court--it is the Court that cannot legislate, not Con-
gress, and that the Court would be misplaced in attempting to es-
tablish policy, not Congress.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, I am not talking to you about
oversight now. That is the second time in response to a question
about carrying out congressional intent you have referred to the
congressional oversight function. I know you had very severe dis-
agreements, and I hope to have a chance to ask you about that
later. But congressional oversight is very different from a clear-cut
expression of congressional intent.

  We had Justice Scalia before us, and it has already been referred
to, the difference and what happens on the bench as opposed to in
the nomination process, and that is understandable. Justice Scalia
doubts that there is any such thing as congressional intent. And
when he writes about the absence of congressional response--and
this is enormously important because we have the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. And it was interpreted in 1971 by a unanimous Su-
preme Court in an opinion written by Chief Justice Burger. And
Congress was satisfied with that interpretation, left it alone. Then
18 years later, the Supreme Court comes up 5-4 and changes that
law and does so with four Supreme Court Justices who put their
hands on the Bible in this room, or similar rooms, swore to inter-
pret the law and not to make new law.

  Justice Scalia writes in his dissent in the Johnson case that
when Congress doesn't act, it could be a result of many things, in-
cluding political cowardice. I think Justice Scalia might have a
point, but the major area of congressional or Senate political cow-
ardice perhaps came when we didn't ask him very many questions
in his confirmation hearing.

  I would be interested in your observation. I won't ask you what
you think of Justice Scalia's comment, but I will re-ask the ques-
tion that Senator Grassley put to you. When Congress doesn't act,
                                        233

would you agree that that is a sign that Congress doesn't think
anything should be done?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that if there is a long-standing
interpretation of a congressional legislation

  Senator SPECTER. Is 18 years long enough, like in Ward's Cove
and Griggs?

  Judge THOMAS. If there is a longstanding interpretation and Con-
gress does not act, that certainly would seem to be considerable evi-
dence of Congress' intent. And it certainly would be, at least from
my way of looking at a statute, evidence that cannot be ignored in
revisiting that particular statute.

  Senator SPECTER. TWO subquestions. No. 1, is 18 years long
enough?

  Judge THOMAS. Eighteen years is quite a long time. I don't know
whether we could put a mathematical or a numerical standard on
that, to have that kind of quantification as to whether or not that
would be enough not to revisit a statute. But I think that when you
have a statute that has been interpreted for that long a period,
that is so well known, that Congress is very aware of, that it would
be an important consideration in finding that to be the appropriate
interpretation, the fact that Congress didn't act for such a long
time.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Thomas, I have a problem, and I
am not saying any of this is determinative. We are just talking
about your approach as a prospective Justice if confirmed. But I
have a problem with long enough not being enough in the context
of Griggs and Ward's Cove, and I have a problem with "cannot be
ignored," which are your words, as opposed to being determinative.
It seems to me, that when a unanimous Supreme Court decision
stands for 18 years, that is long enough. Or if it is not, I would like
to know what is long enough. And when you talk about "cannot be
ignored," I would look for something more there as to a sign of
what does establish what the Congress expects the Court to do.

  Judge THOMAS. The point I was attempting to make, Senator,
was this: That when Congress doesn't act, I think it is more diffi-
cult to determine precisely why Congress doesn't act. For example,
if Congress takes an explicit action and fails to change a particular
statute, then that might be more evidence than simply not doing
anything.

  But the additional point that I was attempting to make was this,
that the fact that Congress did not act for 18 years is an important
consideration in determining whether or not the prior ruling or the
prior interpretation was the correct interpretation. It would be a
part of the calculus of legislative history.

  I think it would be going too far to say definitively that definite-
ly 18 years or 15 years or 10 years is the cutoff period, but I under-
stand the point that you are making and I do not think that a
judge or a court can simply ignore the fact that Congress has not
acted in an important area.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, in my questioning you on how
you handle the cases of Johnson and also the predecessors of Weber
and Fullilove, we do not have time to go into all the facts now, I do
so for a number of reasons. One is the one we have already exam-
ined, and the other is that you had shifted a position on it, that in
                                         234

1983 you appeared to be in agreement with Fullilove and with
Weber, and then your reconfirmation hearings came and you
agreed to abide by them, and they relate to your approach to af-
firmative action and to your development of your legal thinking as
you have taken the problem of discrimination and racism and how
you have analyzed affirmative action, and in your career in the
early 1980's stated that you favored it, and then appeared to accept
the Supreme Court decisions, and then later disagreed with those
decisions, although you agreed to abide by them, and still later just
absolutely plundered those decisions with the very strong hostile
comments about Congress.

  In your writing, Judge Thomas, you have made a very strong
comment that I agree with. You said that the Dred Scott decision
upholding slavery and Chief Justice Taney's opinion in that deci-
sion provide a basis for the way we think today. You wrote that in
1987, "Racism and discrimination are deeply rooted in the history
of the United States." I agree with you about 1987 and 1991.

  And then there was the article by Mr. Juan Williams in Atlantic
Monthly, which sought to provide an understanding of your philos-
ophy and your approach to programs against discrimination, and
quoted you as saying this, and these are the words which he says
are yours, "There is nothing you can do to get past black skin. I
don't care how educated you are, how good you are at what you do,
you'll never know the same contacts or opportunities, you will
never be seen as being equal to the whites."

  Now, given that very strong statement, black skin, given your
very strong statement about things being in 1987 like they were in
the 1950's in Dred Scott, and given the fact that it is just not possi-
ble for the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission to take
care of all the cases, one by one, why is it that you come down so
strongly against any group action to try to put minorities or Afri-
can-Americans in the position that they would have been as a
group, but for the discrimination?

  This is a broad subject, but let's get it started with just a few
minutes to go of my time.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that over my years in public life,
as well as my adult life, I have made it clear what I think of
racism and discrimination. I made it clear during my tenure as the
Chairman of EEOC that it had to be eliminated, and I did every-
thing within my power.

  I have also, even in the heat of debate, attempted to talk reason,
even though I, like perhaps everyone else, was susceptible to the
rhetoric in that debate. I think that we all have to do as much as
possible to include members of my race, minorities, women, anyone
who is excluded into our society. I believe that. I have always be-
lieved that, and I have worked to achieve that.

  Senator SPECTER. What is the best way to do it?
  Judge THOMAS. And that is the question, how best to do it. I
think that you have a tension, you want to do that and, at the
same time, you don't want to discriminate against others. You
want to be fair, at the same time you want to affirmatively include,
and there is a real tension there.
  I wrestled with that tension and I think others wrestled with
that tension. The line that I drew was a line that said that we
                                        235

shouldn't have preferences or goals or timetables or quotas. I drew
that line personally, as a policy matter, argued that, advocated
that for reasons that I thought were important.

  One, I thought it was true to the underlying value in the statute
that would be fair to everyone, and I also drew it because I felt and
I have argued over the past 20 years and I felt it important that,
whatever we do, we do not undermine the dignity, self-esteem, and
self-respect of anybody or any group that we are helping. That has
been important to me and it has been central to me.

  I think that all of us who are well-intentioned, on either side of
the debate, at any given time, wanted to achieve the exact same
goal. I would have hoped, if I could revisit the 1980's, that we could
have sat down and constructively tried to hammer out a consensus
way to solve what I consider a horrible problem.

  Senator SPECTER. But the problem I have with that response, if
you take a case like Local 28 of the Sheetmetal Workers, where the
New York City Human Relations Commission cited them for dis-
criminatory practices in 1964, and EEOC finally brought a lawsuit
in 1971, and there was a finding of discrimination in 1975, and
there was a court order to correct that discrimination, which there
was contempt in 1977 and again in 1982 and contempt again in
1983, and you have written that you are astounded that there is
more of a penalty for breaking into a mailbox than for discriminat-
ing against a minority or African-Americans, and you have advo-
cated jail sentences and heavy fines for those who are in contempt
of court, and you have this kind of outrageous conduct that spans a
20-year period, and then EEOC comes in at the latter stages of this
litigation in the 1980's and takes a different position and argues
against the court orders to stop the flagrant discriminatory prac-
tices and the practices which have been labeled by the courts re-
peatedly in violation, contempt of court, and you criticize the Su-
preme Court's decision in trying to do something to deal with
proved discrimination, not taking a class which wasn't discriminat-
ed against and giving them a boost forward, but in dealing with la-
borers who were discriminated against, judicial determinations,
contempt citations, ignoring by the people who were the discrimi-
nators, and you, as Chairman of EEOC come in and oppose it, and
then you sharply criticize the decision of the Supreme Court of the
United States in upholding that kind of a remedy.

  That seems to me to come right within the purview of what you
say ought to be done to remedy active discrimination, and yet you
take the other side.

  Judge THOMAS. With respect to the weight of that case proceeded
through the court, Senator, the Commission itself, to my knowl-
edge, did not approve and it was not required to approve that liti-
gation, because the general counsel had already been authorized at
the lower courts to pursue that, but the point is well taken.

  My view with respect to cases like that has been that, as a policy
matter and one that I have stated clearly on the record, is this: I
think that, rather than a court attempting to punish these individ-
uals with a quota or preferential treatment, I thought that in this
case and in the egregious cases there could be criminal contempt
citations, I felt that there should be appropriate roles for heavy
fines, I think or I felt that individuals who discriminated against
                                         236

other individuals should be subject to the same kinds of fines and
penalties that are available in some of the antitrust litigation.

  I felt that there was an undervaluation of the effects and the
damage done by discrimination, and I felt that this kind of a case
was very susceptible and appropriately susceptible to criminal con-
tempt citations.

  Senator SPECTER. I have been handed a note that my time is up,
and we will return to it with my first question being why did
EEOC, in your tenure, join with petitioners in trying to upset the
contempt citation and taking the position that the discriminators
ought not to be held for contempt and ought not to be punished.

  Thank you, Judge Thomas.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Judge Heflin. Senator Heflin. Just so everybody does not think it
was a slip, you were a judge. Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Thomas, I try to approach these hearings
on the basis of fairness, fairness to you, fairness to the President,
fairness to your opponents, and try to consider all of the evidence
before I make up my mind. I tried to follow that procedure in the
other confirmation processes, not only of the Supreme Court Jus-
tices, but of all appointments to the judiciary.
  So, I do not at this time have any firm opinion one way or the
other. I have done a good deal of reading and tried to listen to tes-
timony. Of course, it has entered into my mind from your testimo-
ny, as opposed to some of the spoken and written words that you
have given in the past, an appearance of confirmation conversion.
  Now, this term is a term that came from the mouth of my col-
league Senator Leahy here in the Bork hearings, which would indi-
cate that the confirmation processes cause one to change his mind
or to give answers that will hurt him in regards to seeking the con-
firmation. But it also can raise issues that can affect the evaluation
that members of the committee may give as to integrity and tem-
perament.
  Now, in reading some of the articles and reading speeches that
you had given beforehand, most of them in about the last 5 years,
or at least since you have been on the EEOC, not back when you
were 20 years of age or 25 or 30, but fairly recently, there appears
to be a conflict on natural law between what you have stated in
the past and what you state here at these hearings.
  You are stating in these hearings basically that you do not think
that natural law ought to be used in constitutional adjudication.
Some interpretation--and it depends on how you interpret your
written and spoken words beforehand--would lead one to believe
that you had previously advocated the use of natural law in consti-
tutional adjudication.
  Now, natural law, of course, is a term that is broad and there
seem to be at least two schools of thought, and there may be many
others, one a liberal school of thought, another a conservative
school of thought on the use of natural law. Those who are of the
conservative viewpoint indicate that it would be using the ninth
amendment, where there is no deprivation of unenumerated rights
that a judge could pick an unenumerated right, something that he
said was and then defend it under the concept of natural law.
                                        237

  On the other hand, from a political theory viewpoint on possible
constitutional adjudication, there are those that advocate that nat-
ural law be used as a defense for judicial restraint, as being a de-
fense for limited government and being a defense for economic
freedom and certain other freedoms.

  As has been pointed out, those that would advocate the use of
natural law, and there have been those in the past in the Supreme
Court decisions, particularly in the Lochner era, who say that the
economic right of the freedom to contract should be allowed, with-
out any government restrictions, and, therefore, that minimum
wage laws, health laws, job safety-type laws are restrictions against
the right to contract and economic freedom, and, therefore, they
follow the concept of judicial restraint or follow the concept of lim-
ited government.

  Now, you have been asked some questions about this issue and
you, of course, have very clearly stated that you do not believe that
natural law ought to be used toward constitutional adjudication,
and you have mentioned that you so testified in your court of ap-
peals hearing, and that was quoted to you from the court of ap-
peals hearing, statements that you made, and this appears--and I
want you to have an opportunity later to read it, and you can give
a fuller answer after you are thoroughly advised, because it is not
my purpose to ambush you or to make any statement, without you
having a thorough right to review what you said before.

  But here you say:

  But recognizing the natural rights is a philosophical, historical context of the Con-
stitution, is not to say that I have abandoned the methodology of constitutional in-
terpretation as used by the Supreme Court. In applying the Constitution, I think I
would have to resort to the approaches that the Supreme Court has used. I would
have to look at the texture of the Constitution, the structure, I would have to look
at the prior Supreme Court precedents on these matters.

  That is what was quoted to you.
  The next sentence says--and this was your answer then--"and
as a lower court judge, I would be bound by the Supreme Court de-
cisions." Now, reading that answer, it is subject to two or more in-
terpretations. One is that you were speaking of natural law as it
would apply to your functions as a court of appeals judge, and the
other would be whether you would apply it as to the broad general
theory of constitutional adjudication.
  Now, if you want to read this and read the whole thing, I will do
it, or if you want to answer as to where it may have an appearance
of either an ambiguity or of being contradictory. Whatever you
want to do, if you want to study it and read it and give me an
answer later, or if you want to give me an answer now.
  Judge THOMAS. Let me comment on what you have said, Senator.
My view is that I have been consistent. On natural law, my inter-
est, as Chairman of EEOC, was as I have stated. It was as a part-
time political theorist, someone who was looking for a positive way
to advance the ball with respect to individual rights in our political
debates, as well as on the issue of civil rights.
  I have not advocated or suggested that it should be used in consi-
tutional adjudication. Our Founders and our drafters did believe in
natural law, in addition to whatever else, philosophies they had,
and I think they acted to some extent on those beliefs in drafting
                                        238

portions of our Constitution, for example, the concept of liberty in
the 14th amendment.

  I think that knowing what their views are is a context for under-
standing our Constitution, knowing what they believed in is a con-
text for understanding the separation of powers or perhaps even
understanding the notion of limited government and the rights of
individuals.

  But when the rights are in the Constitution, then one resorts to
constitutional adjudication. Now, the beliefs of the Founders could
be a part of the history or tradition to which we look, but you do
not make an independent search of natural law, and I have not
suggested that. I think my writings have made clear that natural
law is the background of our Constitution, that it does not move to
the front and that it is not positive law. They are two separate
things.

  Senator HEPLIN. YOU have indicated that your writings and
speeches were directed toward natural law more as a political
theory and you have used the illustration dealing with slavery.
How is slavery related to a political theory?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, the issue there was for Abraham Lincoln,
how do you, when the stated ideals of our country are that all men
are created equal, how do you end slavery, and what is the under-
pinning, what does that promote in our country, the notion that all
men are created equal.

  Once you have the adoption of the 13th and 14th amendments,
you have a positive law, but I think it was important to understand
what that meant. It is just a notion, for example, of why do we feel
strongly that apartheid is wrong, why do we feel strongly that dis-
crimination is wrong, outside of the law.

  But my point is very simply that Abraham Lincoln was sitting
here, I think at the time I had read "The Battle Cry of Freedom," I
wondered how or what gave him the strength to survive the on-
slaught that he was faced with, and it was then that I began to
refer back to his beliefs and the beliefs of the abolitionists as a
backdrop to the Constitution, as a background to the Constitution.

  Senator HEPLIN. I am going to ask that someone on the staff here
hand you two documents. One is a speech to the Federalist Society,
an address, University of Virginia, March 5, 1988, and the other
being an article that appears in the 1988 Harvard Journal of Law
and Public Policy, entitled "Higher Law Background of the Immu-
nity Clause of the Fourth Amendment," if they will hand you that.

  Again, if any question that I ask, if you want to have time to
read or review those, I would certainly want to do it, because I will
have another opportunity to ask you questions, where you can fully
understand it.

  These two appear to have much relationship. This speech ap-
pears to be a speech, and then it appears that it was put in more of
a law review form and was published. Is that a correct

  Judge THOMAS. What you do normally with these is that you give
a speech and the review edits it and converts it to a law review
piece. That is essentially what happens.

  Senator HEFLIN. I see. Now, on the speech, on the first page, if
you will look, tell us, bearing in mind as to whether or not you at
that time were expressing a view that higher law or natural law--
                                         239

as I understand it, they are used interchangeably--could be used as
a part of constitutional adjudication.

  Now, on the speech, starting it, you say:

  I appreciate this opportunity for a practitioner, the head of a law enforcement
agency, to give his opinion on our subject. I do not pretend to be a legal scholar, but
I have a strong practical interest in the crucial part of our conference topic, namely,
the grounding of our Constitution in higher or natural law. The expression "unenu-
merated rights" makes conservatives nervous, as it gladdens liberals, for the rea-
sons our previous discussions here have indicated.

  I want to take a different approach to this theme, which provides necessary back-
ground for the very abstract issue of the privileges or immunity clause today. Brief-
ly put, I argue that the best defense of limited government and the separation of
powers and judicial restraints that flow from that commitment to limited govern-
ment is the higher law political philosophy of the Founding Fathers.

  Far from being a license for unlimited government and a roving judiciary, natural
rights and higher law arguments are the best defense of liberty and of limited gov-
ernment. Moreover, without recourse to higher law, we abandon our best defense of
a court that is active in defending the Constitution, but judicious in its restraint and
moderation. Higher law is the only alternative to the willfulness of both run-amuck
majorities and run-amuck judges.

  Now, in regards to the question of higher law, how do you inter-
pret that? It seems to me that you are advocating or at least it has
the appearance--maybe I withdraw saying it appears to me, be-
cause I have not made up my mind, but it at least appears that
that is an advocation of the use of natural law toward constitution-
al adjudication.

  Judge THOMAS. It is not, Senator. The point there is that, in our
regime, if you notice, I speak to the higher law political philosophy
of the Founders. Their philosophy was that we were all created
equal and that we could be governed only by our consent, and that
we ceded to the Government only certain rights, and that, to that
extent, the Government had to be and was a limited government.

  But beyond that--and the judiciary, of course, was a part of that
limited government--but in no sense, and I do not mention here or
say higher law should be pointed to in adjudicating cases. It is
nothing more than the background, the--I think I say here pro-
vides the necessary background, it provides us an understanding of
our form and our structure in our Government. It is not a method-
ology in constitutional analysis. I think it would have been easy
enough to have said that directly.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, you use the words "higher law is the only
alternative to the willfulness of both run-amuck majorities and
run-amuck judges." Now, how can higher law through a political
theory serve as a protection against willfulness of run-amuck ma-
jorities or run-amuck judges?

  Judge THOMAS. The theory would be, Senator, essentially this:
That the individual is to be protected, that the individual can only
be governed by consent, so that the majority cannot take rights
away from the individual that have not been conceded or that have
not been consented to be given to the Government by that individ-
ual. It is not a notion that in your adjudication you look to this
higher law. It is simply an explication or an indication that this is
the theme of our underlying background political philosophy and
that the Constitution protects these rights.
                                         240

  Senator HEFLIN. All right. If you turn to page 7 and 8 of that
speech, you make this statement starting at the beginning of the
last sentence on page 7:

   Similarly, an administration inspired by higher law thinking would not have
argued on behalf of Bob Jones University. The higher law background of the Ameri-
can Constitution, whether explicitly appealed to or not, provides the only firm basis
for a just, wise, and constitutional decision.

  I am taking that out of context. If you want to read
  Judge THOMAS. The point there was that I felt that as a policy
matter, as a political branch of our Government, that the adminis-
tration of which I was a part made an inappropriate decision about
being involved in the Bob Jones University case; a decision that
had it been informed with the notion that we were all created
equal or the notion of how important it was not to have discrimina-
tion in our society, that it--not the courts but our administration--
would not have made as a policy matter. I thought it was a wrong
decision.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right, sir. Now turn to your law review arti-
cle. Again, you--by the way, that thing that Senator Leahy was
talking about, that footnote, I believe, appears here if you wanted
to later, when Senator Leahy returns--it is footnote 2 on the first
page.
  I think basically the first part of that you use the term "run-
amuck majorities" and "run-amuck judges" in that regard. But in
the context of economic freedom or the freedom to contract on the
concept of higher law, if you were to read it in that context, "More-
over, without recourse to higher law, we abandon our best defense
of judicial review, a judiciary active in defending the Constitution
but judicious in its restraint and moderation. Rather than being a
justification for the worst type of judicial activism, higher law is
the only alternative to the willfulness of both run-amuck majorities
and run-amuck judges."
  Now, in the context of economic freedom, right to contract, and
the fact that any governmental restrictions placed upon those free-
doms would be, in effect, restrictions and could be looked upon as
being run-amuck majorities, do you still maintain that that does
not--well, I am just saying it is subject to an interpretation that
you are referring to constitutional adjudication there.
  Judge THOMAS. I am not in this sentence. Let me make a point
about my interest in the economic aspect of this. I was asked on--I
did not just simply sit around and spend time just trying to spin
theories. I had certain experiences that prompted me to think
about some of these issues. And with respect to the issue of having
a right to run my grandfather's business, for example, I simply
looked at what in theory was his right. After slavery, what was his
right or the rights of people who were near me, who lived around
me, to just simply use their land and grow their food and be able to
eat it or to sell it?
  Those were the kinds of examples that I would use. I, for exam-
ple, remember vividly my grandfather, whom I thought was a
strong man--and when you are small, it is a giant of a man, and
certainly a man with great pride. He would literally have to get a
drink before he went to the licensing bureau in Savannah to get
                                        241

the license that he needed to drive his oil truck. Those were the
kinds of questions I was looking at.

  Now, I did not intend, first, to say that this was a basis for con-
stitutional adjudication. I think I could have said that if I had in-
tended that. The second point is that I have said and I believe that
the Lochner era cases were properly overruled and that the health
and safety--the Court does not serve as a superlegislature over this
body or the political branches.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, you said you could have stated that. On
the other hand, in all of these writings on natural law, you could
have made the distinction, could you not, that you were speaking
of a theory and not a constitutional adjudicatory process?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, if I were a judge, if I gave some
of these speeches after I went to the bench, I would have made that
distinction. But at the time, I was not a judge and certainly did not
think at that time that it was necessary to draw that distinction
when it really at that point wasn't relevant.

  I felt, as I stated in my hearings for the court of appeals, that
this is political theory. This is not constitutional adjudication or
methodology. And I stand by that. I think the distinction is an im-
portant one, and it is one that certainly I didn't draw a clear and
exacting line sometimes, simply because I wasn't in the judiciary. I
didn't say I am not saying this or I am not saying that, but it was
not my intent at any point to provide a basis for adjudicating con-
stitutional law cases.

  Senator HEFLIN. In this article in the Harvard Journal of Law
and Public Policy on page 66, this statement appears:

  To believe that natural rights thinking allows for arbitrary decisionmaking would
be to misunderstand constitutional jurisprudence based on higher law.

  That appears--it has the appearance of advocating natural law
in the field of jurisprudence and decisionmaking on constitutional
adjudication.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, no, I still--my point is that--and juris-
prudence that I would use there would be in the broadest sense. I
still take the position and took the position then that this would
serve as a background to understanding what our Constitution was
for. I was not speaking as a judge. I was not setting out rules of
analysis or adjudication. I was trying to establish a sense among
conservatives or among the audience that here is the background
to our Constitution.

  Now, our Founding Fathers took bits and pieces of what they be-
lieved may have been natural law, and they placed that in the Con-
stitution. But once it is in the Constitution, it is no longer required
that anyone refer to natural law. It is a part of our positive law.
And I think that that is the appropriate distinction. It is the one
that I certainly attempted to make there. At no point did I intend
to say, look, this is an approach or methodology for constitutional
adjudication. And that was the point I attempted to make again in
my court of appeals confirmation. It has no role.

  I think that if as a judge I had stated here is a new approach for
constitutional adjudication, then I think you would be right, that
there would be concern. But I was speaking solely as a chairman of
                                         242

a commission who was interested in this debate and advancing this
idea, but not in adjudicating cases.

  Senator HEFLIN. The concept that natural law is a political
theory, most political theories that are developed involve protec-
tions, adjudicatory concepts, or processes. You eliminate as a part
of the comprehensiveness of the natural law theory or natural law
philosophy the protection of rights or adjudicatory rights.

  Now, in most political theories, you would have something, if it
is adopted, that would provide for protection, which is judicial deci-
sionmaking. Are you separating from the natural law theory adju-
dicatory processes?

  Judge THOMAS. What I am saying, Senator, is this: That the indi-
viduals who drafted our Constitution, let's say our 14th amend-
ment, the abolitionists, for example, believed in natural law. And
to the extent that they reduced it to a positive document, it ap-
pears in the Constitution. But one need not appeal to whatever
they believed beyond the understanding of what they intended to
do, that the law--that our rights don't flow from what their beliefs
were, but rather from the appearance of those rights in the Consti-
tution.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, if it became positivism or the positive law
of the Constitution, then why is natural law being advocated? The
concept that if it is constitutional law, if natural law has pro-
gressed to the extent that it is positivism, it is a part of the Consti-
tution, then why all the great discussion today on natural law?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, for me it was just a matter of discussing
and understanding the issue of slavery and the issue of the under-
lying values and the underlying ideals of our country. I thought it
was important. I thought it was a way of discussing an issue that
was important to me, rather than simply constantly arguing about
goals and timetables and quotas. It was a way of attempting to find
a way to--a theme to unify us on this debate and a way to con-
vince individuals whom I felt should be supportive of civil rights.
And I am not saying that it worked. I certainly never thought that
I would be having this discussion about it. And I did not intend it
certainly as a method of adjudication.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, let me ask you this last question. I under-
stand my time is about up. How does natural law as a political
theory provide protection for limited government or for judicial re-
straint if that political theory excludes constitutional adjudication?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, it offers an understanding of
why it was necessary or why our Founding Fathers felt that we
should have a government that did not infringe on the rights of in-
dividuals or a government by consent rather than our rights ema-
nating from that government.

  It gives us an understanding of why government ought to be lim-
ited, why it ought not to intrude on the individual, why there is a
line between the individual and the government. It gives us a sense
of why the government shouldn't require that black people live
over here or white people live over there. But it doesn't adjudicate
it. It gives us an understanding of why slavery was wrong, but it
doesn't provide for the manumission of slaves. That had to be done
by the Constitution.
                                        243

  Again, it is theory. It was an endeavor that I thought was an ap-
propriate endeavor at that point in my career. I did not intend for
it to involve constitutional adjudication.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Before we take a break, just out of curiosity, you keep talking
about the need to get conservatives to be more supportive of civil
rights. Does that mean they are not supportive of civil rights?
  I am not being facetious, because it goes to the question of your
intentions here. Are conservatives supportive of civil rights?
  Judge THOMAS. I was giving them reason to be strongly support-
ive and more aggressively supportive of civil rights. I don't think
they were necessarily against civil rights, but I thought that there
was a comfort level in being opposed to quotas and affirmative
action. And I thought that we should advance the ball, that the
issue of race has to be solved in this country and that we have to
stop yelling at each other and we have to stop criticizing each
other and calling each other names. And I was involved in that
debate, and I was a pretty tough debater, too. But at some point we
have got to solve these problems out here.
  The CHAIRMAN. I think the State Department is the place for
you, Judge. [Laughter.]
  We will recess, to give you a chance to have a break, for 10 min-
utes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Senator Brown?
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, I have heard a number of criticisms of the chair-
man's style of conducting this hearing. The substance of those criti-
cisms have revolved around the fact that he clearly is too soft on
you, has not brought the tough questions out. And I just wanted to
serve notice on the chairman that this love-in that he seems to be
presiding over will come to an end.
  Reflecting on my own children--I have two daughters and a
son--it is clear to me that if I want to get the inside information
on my son, I ask one of his sisters, and we intend to call your sister
as a witness later on, whenever the chairman will allow that meas-
ure. I don't know if that is
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU just scared the living devil out of him. He is
not sure whether you are serious. [Laughter.]
  See the look on his face. He is only kidding, Judge.
  Judge THOMAS. I would be more concerned if he called my broth-
er.
  Senator BROWN. I think we can make arrangements for that, too.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, let me correct the record. That
is Clarence's sister there and not his daughter. We want to get all
this sibling stuff straightened out.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS far as his sister is concerned, she would
rather it not be corrected, she would rather be a daughter.
  Senator BROWN. Judge, earlier in this hearing you were asked
about the right to privacy, and as I recall your answer, you indicat-
ed that you recognized a right of privacy within the Constitution.
Since that is one of the cornerstones that leads to decisions in-
                                         244

volved in Roe v. Wade, I think that was of some real significance
and interest to this committee.

  You have been asked specifically about Roe v. Wade, and you
have declined to answer on the grounds that you may well be
called upon to rule on those specific issues as a judge of the Court.

  I would like to ask a related question that is slightly different. I
can understand the reluctance to indicate how you would rule, but
I would be interested to know if in your own mind you have come
to a decision on the right to terminate a pregnancy. I am not
asking what that decision is, but I would like to know within your
own mind if you are at a point where you have decided that.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think, as I have noted earlier, that for
me to begin to state positions, either personal or otherwise, on such
an important and controversial area, where there are very, very
strong views on both sides, would undermine my impartiality and
really compromise my objectivity.

  I think that it is most important for me to remain open. I have
no agenda. I am open about that important case. I work to be open
and impartial on all the cases on which I sit.

  I can say on that issue and on those cases I have no agenda. I
have an open mind, and I can function strongly as a judge.

  Senator BROWN. Well, I thank you. I think that willingness to
look at the facts and review them objectively is an important factor
for us to look at.

  Mr. Chairman, I think it is appropriate here to at least put into
the record something that was said by Justice Marshall upon his
confirmation. He was asked by a variety of Senators to indicate
how he would have ruled on a number of cases. The Miranda case
was brought up as well as several others.

  In the Miranda case, or at least in response to the Miranda case,
Justice Marshall said this, and I quote: "I am not saying whether I
disagree with Miranda or not because I am going to be called to
pass upon it. There is no question about it, Senator. These cases
are coming to the Supreme Court."

  Justice Marshall remarked at a different stage of the hearings,
"My position is--which in every hearing I have gone over is the
same--that a person who is up for confirmation for Justice of the
Supreme Court deems it inappropriate to comment on matters
which will come before him as a Justice." I thought it appropriate
to have that in the record. The position you have taken with
regard to announcing an opinion in advance of hearing the case is
certainly in line with other people who have been advanced to the
Supreme Court, and in this case specifically Justice Marshall.

  But I must say I do appreciate your answer to my question. I
think a critical issue for us here is to know that you are willing to
listen to the facts in those cases.

  The CHAIRMAN. If the Senator would yield, did you have more
than you read that you want to place in the record?

  Senator BROWN. I think I would leave it at that, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Second, did the witness answer your question? I
didn't think he answered your question. That is, did he make up
his mind? Not what is it, but just has he made up his mind?
  Judge THOMAS. I indicated that it would be inappropriate to ex-
plain to him or to say whether I did or not.
                                        245

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator BROWN. At least my interpretation--and I appreciate
the chairman mentioning this. At least my understanding was that
the judge indicated that his mind was--he was willing to listen to
the facts on this, and his mind was open in terms of this particular
case.
  Have I
  Judge THOMAS. That is correct.
  Senator BROWN. I am assuming that you have not made a final
decision in your own mind on the Roe v. Wade case?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator BROWN. Earlier the chairman had brought up I thought
some very important questions involving economic rights in the
Constitution. I know you commented further on that and answered
Senator Hatch's question specifically with regard to several lines of
cases that I know our chairman was concerned about. In addition,
you had commented with regard to whether or not you would be a
disciple of several philosophers that were mentioned, indicating
that you would not.
  I would like your views, though, on a different aspect of this eco-
nomic question. As I just glance through the Constitution, we have
a variety of provisions in the Constitution that deal specifically
with property rights: Articles I, IV, VI; amendments II, III, IV, V,
VII, XIII, I suspect many others. These are property rights, eco-
nomic rights if you will, that are specifically addressed in the Con-
stitution and protection provided.
  It has been suggested, I think by the chairman, or at least an ob-
servation, perhaps I should say, by the chairman, that in the past
some Supreme Court cases have accorded property rights or eco-
nomic rights a lesser degree of protection than other rights in the
Constitution.
  My own view of it is that it is very difficult to separate rights. It
strikes me that if someone cuts off your salary because you have
said something, you may have denied freedom of speech but you
have done it through a deprival of economic rights, property rights.
At least it occurs to me that if the 13th amendment means any-
thing, it means that you have justifiable property rights in the
fruits of your labor. And if you are not going to protect the proper-
ty rights of your labor, then the 13th amendment doesn't mean
much.
  Now, I broach this subject because I think it is important. In my
mind it is difficult to separate property rights and personal rights.
It does appear to me that both are protected in the Constitution,
and I guess I would like an indication from you as to whether or
not you think property rights deserve a lesser protection in the
Constitution, greater protection under the Constitution than other
rights, or whether it is a balancing between rights when these
questions arise. Would you share with us your view on that?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my point has been that property rights,
of course, deserve some protection, and I think they are, as are our
other rights, important rights. The Court in looking at the econom-
ic regulations of our economy and our society has attempted to
move away from certainly the Lochner era cases and not as a su-
perlegislature. And I indicated that that is appropriate, particular-
                                        246

ly in the area as I have noted--the health and welfare, wage and
hour cases.

  I think that some of those cases, the area, I think there is some
developing in the taking area, and perhaps if I am fortunate
enough to be confirmed to the Court, perhaps I would be called
upon to rule on those issues. But I would be concerned about the
diminishment or the diminishing, diminution of any rights in our
society. But that is not to say in any way that I disagree with the
standards that the Court applies to protecting those rights today.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you. I wanted to address the subject of
stare decisis. It has been raised by other members of this commit-
tee. I think the distinguished Senator from Ohio has discussed the
concern about the overturning of previous decisions and prece-
dents.

  As I see the figures, from 1810 through 1953 we had a total of 88
cases that were overruled, where a previous decision of the Court
was simply and flatly overruled by the Court. That is 88 cases in
143 years.

  Interestingly, I think, in the next 36 years, 37 years, we had 112
cases overruled. Really starting with the Warren Court on, you had
a much greater movement on the part of the Court to overrule pre-
vious decisions.

  I mention that because apparently the modern courts, at least
since the Warren Court, have been much more inclined to move in
that direction, not less so, in terms of observing stare decisis. But
at least I observe those cases as ones that were important land-
marks: Brown v. the Board of Education addressing segregation;
Mapp v. Ohio, an illegal search; the Gideon case, involving the
right to counsel. These are areas where we have overturned prece-
dent, but I think with a very significant and real reason behind
those changes.

  I mention all of this because I wish you would share your view
with us as to the kind of standards you are going to use in sitting
on the Court as to whether or not you will choose to overrule a pre-
vious decision of the Court. What kind of standards are you going
to be looking to apply?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that the principle of stare deci-
sis, the concept of stare decisis is an important link in our system
of deciding cases in our system of judicial jurisprudence. The
reason I think it is important is this: We have got to have continui-
ty if there is going to be any reliance, if there is going to be any
chain in our case law. I think that the first point in any revisiting
of the case is that the case be wrongly decided, that one thing it is
incorrect. But more than that is necessary before one can rethink
it or attempt to reconsider it. And I think that the burden is on the
individual or on the judge or the Justice who thinks that a prece-
dent should be overruled to demonstrate more than its mere incor-
rectness. And at least one factor that would weigh against overrul-
ing a precedent would be the development of institutions as a
result of a prior precedent having been in place.

  But, again, I think the first step is that the precedent be incor-
rect, and the second step in the analysis has to be more than the
mere incorrectness of that precedent.

  Senator BROWN. I am wondering if the standards that you will be
applying will vary depending on the constitutional issues involved.
Is this the standard you would apply in every area?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, that the standards that I gave
you should be as uniform as possible. I don't think, for example, as
I have read someplace, that the standard should be less for individ-
ual rights than for commercial cases. I did not understand that
comment, but it would seem to me that individual rights deserve--
or the cases in the individual rights area deserve the greatest pro-
tection and should be considered with the application of the high-
est standards of stare decisis.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  I want to change subjects on you for a moment and take you
back to the EEOC, during that 8-year period that you directed that
agency, Commission. My recollection is that in 1983 you changed
policy for the Commission, that the Commission adopted a resolu-
tion to shift its presumption in favor of rapid charge processing to
one of case-by-case investigation.
  I wonder if you would be willing to outline for us this policy initi-
ative, and if you would relate what kind of results it achieved or
didn't achieve. What kind of changes occurred?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, when I arrived at EEOC in 1982, among
the many problems that I incurred--and, indeed, there were
many--was that the existence of a rapid charge system, that
system was designed to reduce the backlog that had plagued EEOC
for so many difficult years. I felt that the system, which in essence
brought the charging party who filed the claim of discrimination
and the employer together and required them to reach a settle-
ment, without investigating and determining whether or not there
was actual discrimination, I felt that that system shortchanged
both parties.
  The Commission voted in the policy that as an ideal, felt that--
or indicated that cases should be investigated as fully as possible
before there is any determination. That took quite some time to im-
plement. But the sense of it was this: That if someone--and there
were approximately 60,000 charges filed a year. If someone filed a
charge, that that person had the right to have it investigated and
to have a determination made as to whether or not there was dis-
crimination.
  One of the results of this approach is the increased number of
cases that were litigated. I think also an important result was that
we were more consistent, and I think more faithful to the statute
that required us to investigate these charges.
  Again, this effort was not without its glitches, but I think it was
a very important move in the right direction and brought about
the appropriate results for an agency that enforces nondiscrimina-
tion laws.
  Senator BROWN. One of the changes that at least I have under-
stood that you focused on during that period was an effort to auto-
mate the office, adopt computers and computer systems. I wonder
if you could summarize what you did and whether or not you
thought it was a wise investment.
  Judge THOMAS. Again, Senator, we automated in a number of
ways. The first area that I was told when I was confirmed that I
                                         248

had to clean up was the financial management area. The then-
chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee told me
that he would call me on the carpet if that was not done.

  We were able to automate that area and as a result achieved sav-
ings that we could then use to automate other areas. And then that
necessity for automating is quite simply that when you receive
60,000 charges a year in 50 offices across the country, in order to
manage and in order to understand your agency and in order to be
able to understand the type of discrimination that is taking place
in this society, you have to have a database. You have to have a
database in each of the offices, and you have to have a national da-
tabase to manage that national workload from the central office
here in Washington, DC.

  One of the problems that you have when you don't have that da-
tabase is simply you don't know what is going on in the agency.
You don't know what changes there are, and quite frankly you
have no idea what is in your workload except the most general of
ideas. Without additional resources and over a period of time, we
were able to build a database, to put the automated management
systems in the offices across the country, and as well as develop a
national database that is so important in managing our workload
and actually enforcing the equal employment opportunity laws.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  Judge, I must say I was shocked at hearing comments that you
had made about Congress. Those harsh views are ones, of course,
we have never heard before. As one who came to Congress some 11
years ago with the thought that we would balance the budget
within a couple of years, the concept that perhaps a $250 billion to
$300 billion deficit a year leaves something to be desired I suspect
is not new to the American people. But sometimes saying the em-
peror has no clothes is not always the greatest help for you in the
confirmation process.
  Be that as it may, I think the underlying question is an appropri-
ate one, and that is: What will your attitude be as a Justice of the
Supreme Court in reviewing the constitutionality of legislation in
which you find yourself in disagreement with the policy judgments
of Congress? Are you going to be able to separate out your objec-
tions to congressional policy in making the determination of wheth-
er or not that law is judged constitutional?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is one thing to be in the execu-
tive branch and to come back and forth to oversight hearings and
budget hearings and to disagree on policy decisions and to argue
and debate and advocate for a particular point of view. There is a
tension there, and sometimes those of us who have been nominated
and needed to be confirmed have deep regret about negative com-
ments about this body or any body, but the appropriate role for a
judge totally precludes being a part of that tension and that debate
and that advocacy.
  A judge must determine what the will of this body is. A judge
does not have to agree, a judge does not have to think it is the
most wonderful legislation in the world. Indeed, that is irrelevant.
The judge's role is, as impartially as possible, to determine what
the will of this body is, and that is precisely what I have attempted
to do in my current position as a judge on the U.S. Court of Ap-
                                         249

peals for the D.C. Circuit, and never to supplant my personal
views.

  As I indicated earlier, when I pick up a case for consideration,
the first question I ask myself is what is my role as a judge in this
case, and that role never includes bringing personal views or predi-
lections to that case.

  Senator BROWN. I appreciate that. I expect that is not the easiest
portion of your duties or task. It would not be for me.

  You have mentioned several times in the course of these hear-
ings your experiences in dealing with congressional inquiries in-
volved in the various agencies you have either directed or been in-
volved in. It is my understanding that you have appeared and re-
sponded some 57 times, in addition to the I guess 5 times you have
been up for confirmation. I wonder if you would give us an idea, in
those 57 inquiries, how much time was involved, what it involved
on your part, your agency's part in terms of staff time, commit-
ment of resources.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, Senator, I would have to put that inquiry
into two separate categories. The least amount of involvement are
the instances in which there is significant cooperation between the
staff of a particular committee and the agency. The difficulty arises
when there is, in the second category, significant disagreements or
where there is significant information or document requests in-
volved.

  But as a rule of thumb, when I prepared for a hearing, any of
the hearings other than my own confirmation hearings, I would
allow, at a minimum, 4 to 8 hours of personal preparation, in addi-
tion to whatever staff time it took to gather documents and to ad-
dress the issues that concern the committee involved.

  Senator BROWN. What about the agency itself?
  Judge THOMAS. The involvement of the agency, again, depends
on the range of the inquiry. There have been instances when the
involvement has been quite overwhelming, as a result of the
amount of data involved.
  Generally, however, the agency's involvement has been some-
times exacting, it has been within manageable ranges.
  Senator BROWN. Judge, in the past you have expressed some con-
cerns about racial quotas. If I understand your position as it has
been articulated at this hearing, it has been an interest or an advo-
cacy of affirmative action, but an opposition to racial quotas as a
method of achieving those advances. I wonder if you could articu-
late the differences you see and the reasons for them.
  Judge THOMAS. AS I indicated earlier, Senator, throughout my
adult life, I have advocated the inclusion of those who have been
excluded. I have been a strong advocate of that. I advocated that in
college and I advocated that in my adult life, and I certainly prac-
ticed that during my tenure at EEOC.
  I felt, for example, that there were many opportunities to include
minorities and women and individuals with disabilities in our work
force, and I took every occasion to do that in the Senior Executive
Service Program, the top level of Government managers, our
record is superb on the efforts that I was able to achieve in agree-
ments, scholarships for minorities and women across the country,
                                        250

colleges and universities programs, internship programs, mentor
programs, stay-in-school programs, et cetera.

  I think that many of us of good will and many of us who, though
we do not necessarily share the same approach, agree with that
goal that we have to include individuals who have been left out for
so long.

  The difficulty comes with how far do you go without being unfair
to others who have not discriminated or unfair to the person who
is excluded, and at that range I thought--and, again, this was the
policy position that I advocated--that it was appropriate to draw
the line at preferences and goals and timetables and quotas.

  I also felt that those approaches, the objectionable approaches
had their own consequences, and that is I felt that they had the
tendency of undermining the self-esteem and dignity of the recipi-
ents. That is again something that others can debate, but I thought
it was a valid point of view, and that those approaches, if we went
too far, actually could be harmful to the very individuals whom we
all care so much about.

  But I am very firmly for programs to include those who have
been excluded. That has been a passion of mine throughout my
adult life.

  Senator BROWN. In describing your views on racial quotas, unless
I have missed it, you have not anchored them based on constitu-
tional arguments, but anchored them in your own feelings about
what makes sense, what makes the reason.

  Yet, I notice the Plessy v. Ferguson dissent that you have re-
ferred to, or at least it has been attributed to you, that you found
some interest in Justice Harlan's dissent there in that case in-
cludes this quote:

  But in view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law there is in this country no
superior dominant ruling class of citizens, there is no cast here, our Constitution is
color blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of
civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law.

  Now, my recollection is I did finish saying I understand your re-
luctance to rule on cases in advance, but do you attribute your con-
cern over racial quotas to reading the Constitution, as well?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, in the appropriate circum-
stances, we all are concerned with the underlying value of fairness
that is expressed in our Constitution, as well as in our statutes. But
I would like to make one comment with respect to that quote, and I
think it is an important comment, that we have to remember that,
even though the Constitution is color blind, our society is not, and
that we will continue to have that tension.

  Senator BROWN. Judge Thomas, I bring this subject up not to
cause you personal concern, but because it has become part of the
debate over your nomination. I preface it that way, because it is
not normally the type of thing that I guess I would bring up at a
hearing of this kind.

  But one of the charges that has been brought against you in this
nominating process is that you benefited by quotas or affirmative
action, but do not support them. I guess the question is directly in
entry to Yale, were you part of an affirmative action quota, were
you part of a racial quota in terms of entering that law school?
                                        251

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have not during my adult life or
during my academic career been a part of any quota. The effort on
the part of Yale during my years there was to reach out and open
its doors to minorities whom it felt were qualified, and I took them
at their word on that, and I have advocated that very kind of af-
firmative action and I have done the exact same thing during my
tenure at EEOC, and I would continue to advocate that throughout
my life.

  Senator BROWN. Mr. Chairman, my time is up. I would merely
note for the record that the judge was an honors graduate of Holy
Cross undergraduate school.

  The CHAIRMAN. We will suspend just for a moment.
  [Pause.]
  I was just conferring with staff about the timing. Just so you
have a sense of how much longer you are going to sit there, I think
we should go with one more Senator. Today we will hear from the
Senator from Illinois, and then we will take up tomorrow morning
at 10 o'clock with the Senator from Wisconsin, followed by a second
round beginning with me.
  The Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, I will try to avoid doing what Senator Danforth
said we should not do and just read little snippets from what you
have written and said. I have read now over 800 pages of Clarence
Thomas' speeches and opinions. I have read more of Clarence
Thomas than any author I have read this year. I regret to say I do
not think you have a best seller in the works. [Laughter.]
  But it is important, because when you say you have no agenda or
when you say you are not a policymaker, the reality is you become
a policymaker on the U.S. Supreme Court. If I may quote from Jus-
tice Frankfurter, "It is the Justices who make the meaning," talk-
ing about the law and the Constitution. "They read into the neu-
tral language of the Constitution their own economic and social
views. Let us face the fact that five Justices of the Supreme Court
are molders of policy, rather than the impersonal vehicles of re-
vealed truth."
  If, for example, in this committee, my colleagues, Senator Heflin
and Senator Hatch, have a disagreement and work out a compro-
mise and the law is not completely clear, then ultimately you may
have to decide and make policy. That may be a 5-to-4 decision of
the Court.
  I mention this, because, generally, while it is not always true,
you can usually tell where a Justice of the Court is going to go by
looking at his record. For example, Justice Marshall has been
talked about here. Generally, we can say there were no great sur-
prises in Thurgood Marshall's record on the Court, because we
knew where he had been.
  When I look at your writings, I find a somewhat different tone,
frankly, than the response to questions here, or a somewhat differ-
ent tone in the quotes Senator Danforth read--with great respect
to my colleagues, Senator Danforth, who gave as strong and elo-
quent an endorsement as I have ever heard of any candidate. But
what I read is somewhat different from the tone of the remarks,
the quotes that he made there. And when I read attacks on mini-

         56-270 O--93 9
                                        252

mum wage, for example, I would defer to your sister and mother
on whether or not we ought to have a minimum wage law rather
than to Judge Thomas. Or when I read and when I hear you men-
tion public housing that your mother was able to move to, and then
I read your statement--and I have almost--well, I have 16 similar
in tone here, but let me read the one that I read in the opening
statement:

  "I for one don't see how the government can be compassionate.
Only people can be compassionate, and then only with their own
property, and their own effort, not that of others."

  Now, in the case of public housing, my feeling is we are talking
about government being compassionate, taking a little of your
money, taking a little of Jack Danforth's money, taking a little of
my money, but doing something that is very constructive and very
needed.

  I find an inconsistency there, and I--well, let me just ask you to
comment on what I see as inconsistency and maybe you do not see
as an inconsistency.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, with respect to--let me just address the
minimum wage. The concerns that I raised in a policy debate were
something that I felt should have been taken into account. I think
we are all for a decent wage. The one factor that I thought should
be taken into account is the impact it would have particularly on
minority teenage employment, and if that was considered in the
calculus, then that was fine. But that was an important consider-
ation. That is a policy decision. It is not one that judges make.

  With respect to public housing or comments about compassion, I
don't think in all of those that you found one word saying that we
shouldn't spend money to help people who are poor or downtrod-
den.

  Senator SIMON. But isn't that what you are----
  Judge THOMAS. I think that we have an obligation, an obligation
to help those who are down and out. That is what I tried to point
to in my opening statement; that as a part of our community, I
think it is important for us to be willing to pay taxes so that people
have a place to live.
  Senator SIMON. And so when you attack, for example, redistribu-
tion of wealth--and one statement I read could have been made by
an early king of France, very negative on the redistribution of
wealth. But, in fact, when we have public housing
  Judge THOMAS. I think that is very important.
  Senator SIMON. And that does not offend you?
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator SIMON. All right.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, let me make one point. I think that it is
important that we recognize, whether we have public housing or
any other policies, that we make sure that we are doing good for
the people who are the beneficiaries or recipients of this. Years ago
I think we remember that there were public housing in certain
cities that ultimately had to be torn down because they turned out
to be more harmful to the inhabitants than they were helpful.
  Senator SIMON. One of them in St. Louis that all three of us
know about here.
                             253

Judge THOMAS. The debates that I requested and would have
hoped to have been a part of is, Look, let's reexamine the pros and
cons. Let's have a constructive debate about it. The problem is still
going to be there.
I called a debate over affirmative action a pointless debate be-
cause at the end of the day there are people who are still not a
part of our economy. We can agree or disagree all day. It is as
though we are fiddling while their chances burn.
So I do think that those efforts are important, Senator.
Senator SIMON. In that connection, affirmation action, Senator
Brown just asked you about college programs. One of your succes-
sors in the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education
has criticized setting aside scholarships for minorities. Washington
University, headed by a distinguished chancellor, William Dan-
forth, has graduate fellowships for minorities in the field of science
and math. Does that offend you in any way?

Judge THOMAS. It is my understanding, Senator, that there may
be litigation about that particular policy, but let me answer that in
this way:
When I had the opportunity to establish a program at EEOC that
provided scholarships for minorities and women, I did. And it is a
program that I think now has about $10 million in endowments.
When I had an opportunity to establish a program or to participate
in the establishment of a program here in Washington for minority
interns, I did. I think that it is important for them to be here, to
participate in this process, to learn from this process, to grow. I
wish that when I was a kid I had had this opportunity also.

So I think that there are steps that need to be taken, but I
can't--on that specific policy, I think it would be best that I not
comment explicitly on that.
Senator SIMON. That is a perfectly legitimate response.
Again, so that I can get a feel of where you are coming from to
judge where you are going to be going, Newsday magazine de-
scribes James J. Parker as a mentor and the person who intro-
duced you to the Reagan White House. Is that an accurate descrip-
tion?
Judge THOMAS. Jay Parker has been a friend since I worked here
on Capitol Hill. He was not the person who introduced me to the
White House.
Senator SIMON. He has been, for many years, a lobbyist for the
Government of South Africa. Were you aware of that?
Judge THOMAS. I became aware of that, interestingly, even
though he  iinsdaivifdriueanld, ,aIndcaIndtiedlnl'v  'ou that I  do not question--he is
an honest                                            question    him about his personal
activities and his businesses. I bee ame aware that he--through the
news media, as you did, about this particular activity.
Senator SIMON. NOW, he is quoted at one point as saying he in-
formed you in 1981 about that. You don't recall that.
Judge THOMAS. I don't recall it. I knew he represented some of
the homelands in South Africa at some point. I think the Mandela
family or some individuals in South Africa. I was not aware, again,
of the representation of South Africa itself.
Senator SIMON. He and a fellow named William Keyes, who are
both editors of Lincoln Review, which is frequently given a far-
                                         254

right label--whether it is justified or not, it is frequently given
that label. But the two of them over the course of the years re-
ceived well over $1 million from the Government of South Africa.
They also, in editing this publication, have had a number of arti-
cles critical of sanctions, antichoice articles, other things. For 10
years you were an editorial adviser to that publication. Did you at
any point question whether these articles that, while critical of
apartheid, were in agreement with the policies of the Government
of South Africa or also the antichoice articles? Did you at any point
suggest that those were not proper?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the role of a member of the advisory
board was purely honorary. There were no meetings. There was no
review of literature. There were no communications. There was no
selection of the material that was included in the journal. Indeed, I
don't think that I have read a copy of the Lincoln Review in 2 or 3
years. I haven't received one in the mail in the last 2 or 3 years.

  On the issue of South Africa, however, let me make this point:
That even as I was aware of Mr. Keyes' involvement with South
Africa, I was not aware of Mr. Parker's. But even as they took that
position, I took a strong position on the board of trustees of Holy
Cross that we divest of stocks in South Africa. That was important
to me then, and, of course, that is contrary to a position that they
might take. But it is one that I felt strongly about.

  Senator SIMON. I was not aware of that, and I think that is sig-
nificant.

  You joined Clarence Pendleton and Steven Rhodes in criticizing
those who were protesting at the South Africa Embassy on South
African policy. At least the Washington Post reports this. Did you
do this on your own? Were you requested by someone to do this?
Do you recall this?

  Judge THOMAS. I have no recollection of that at all, Senator.
  Senator SIMON. Somebody give that to Judge Thomas.
  If you can just look at the article and see if you do recall this.
  [Pause.]
  Judge THOMAS. I think the quote that if these were protests
about the quality of education black kids in the United States re-
ceive, about the high crime rate in black neighborhoods, I would be
right out front in that kind of a march. It is probably the kind of
statement I would have made.
  Senator SIMON. But the three of you did this in a coordinated
way. Obviously, you know, it didn't just happen that all three of
you said that the same day.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, the only way that I think that something
like that could happen would be that we were called the same day
by the reporter. I had no involvement on that issue within the ad-
ministration. I would assume that the reporter simply picked up
the phone and looked for individuals to get a comment.
  Senator SIMON. If on further reflection you or anyone else has
any further background on that, when we get around to the second
round
  Judge THOMAS. I simply don't remember a coordination. If any-
thing comes to mind or if I can reflect on that, I will certainly ap-
prise you of it.
                                      255

  Senator SIMON. On the question of privacy, you have been criti-
cal of the use of the ninth amendment. And when you were asked
by Senator Metzenbaum, I believe, about the question of privacy,
you referred to the 14th amendment.

  There are at least three members of the Supreme Court who
have referred to the right of privacy as a fundamental right. The
ninth amendment, as I am sure you are aware, grew out of corre-
spondence between Madison and Hamilton, where Hamilton said,
"If you have a Bill of Rights, some people will say these are the
only rights people have." And so the ninth amendment was added
which says, "The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights
shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the
people."

  That amendment is not just in isolation. In the Constitution you
also have a provision which states that the Government can't
search your home without a search warrant. That is in a sense a
right of privacy. The Constitution says you can't have militia quar-
tered in your home. That is in a sense a right of privacy.

  When you put that all together, together with the ninth amend-
ment, it seems to me that there is fairly clearly a right of privacy
implied.

  Now, that becomes significant because if you use the 14th
amendment as a basis for the right of privacy, that comes later in
our history. It has not been a part of our whole tradition of our
country to have a right of privacy.

  Do you have any reactions to that, and do you consider the right
of privacy a fundamental right?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, to my knowledge, the Supreme Court,
no majority has used the ninth amendment to establish as the
basis for a right. Of course, it was used by Justice Goldberg and by
Justice Douglas in Griswold.

  With respect to the approach that I indicated that I thought was
the better approach, it was Justice Harlan's approach. But with
that said, my bottom line was that I felt that there was a right to
privacy in the Constitution, and that the marital right to privacy,
of course, is at the core of that, and that the marital right to priva-
cy in my view and certainly the view of the Court is that it is a
fundamental right.

  Senator SIMON. Let me shift to another area, and that is the
church-state area where you have not written very much. In fact,
the only thing I have is in response to a question about religion in
the schools in Policy Review magazine. You say:

   My mother says that when they took God out of the schools, the schools went to
hell. She may be right. Religion is certainly a source of positive values, and we need
all the positive values in the schools that we can get.

  It is the only thing I have found in this whole church-state area.
  This is an area where, again and again, during your years on the
Court you will be asked to make decisions. Since 1971, the Court
has followed a three-part Lemon criteria that you may be familiar
with. It is Jefferson's wall of separation. It is not quite that clear.
When the Methodist church is on fire, you call the fire department.
You don't say separation of church and state. We can't put out the
fire because of a number of factors.
                                          256

  But the Lemon criteria are: No. 1, does it have a secular pur-
pose? No. 2, is its effect to advance or inhibit religion? And, No. 3,
does it excessively entangle government and religion?

  That is what the Supreme Court has been using since 1971.
  I guess I have a twofold question: No. 1, are you familiar with
the Lemon criteria? And, No. 2, if you are, do you think they are
reasonable criteria that should be used in the future?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, Senator, I am aware of the tests enunciated
in Lemon v. Kurtzman. The Court has applied the tests with some
degree, I think, of difficulty over the years. I have no personal dis-
agreement with the tests, but I say that recognizing how difficult it
has been for the Court to address just the kind of problem that you
have pointed out when the church is on fire or when there is this
closeness between the activity of the Government and the activity
of the church.
  I think the wall of separation is an appropriate metaphor. I
think we all believe that we would like to keep the Government
out of our beliefs, and we would want to keep a separation between
our religious lives and the Government.
  But the Court has had a great deal of difficulty, and there is
some debate on the Court as to how far you should go; whether or
not there should be this complete separation; whether or not there
should be some accommodation and certain circumstances; or
whether or not even there should be a movement as far as just
simply to the position where the Government isn't establishing a
religion or coercing individuals to be involved in a certain kind of
activity.
  But I think it is a vibrant debate. I have an open mind with re-
spect to the debate over the application of the Lemon v. Kurtzman
test, and I recognize that the Court has applied it with some degree
of difficulty. But at the same time, I am sensitive to our desire in
this country to keep government and religion separated, flawed as
it may be by that Jeffersonian wall of separation.
  Senator SIMON. Let me give you a very specific instance that you
are not going to be confronted with, though the issue may be one
that you will be confronted with. We have a House colleague by
the name of Dan Glickman, a Congressman from Kansas. He told
me the story, and I repeat it with his permission.
  When he was in--I think it was the fourth grade, they had
prayer in the schools in Wichita. He happens to be Jewish. A large
majority of this population in Wichita is not. Every morning when
he was in the fourth grade, he was excused while they had school
prayer, and then he was brought back in. Every morning little
Danny Glickman was being told, you are different, and all the
other fourth graders were being told he was different.
  Does this strike you as something that is offensive in terms of
where we have been, and where we ought to go?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that when we engage in conduct
such as that, when someone feels that he or she is excluded be-
cause of certain practices, such as those religious practices, I think
we need to question whether or not government is involved. I think
it is wrong.
  You know, as you were talking, something came to mind. I re-
member being excluded from conversations about the war of North-
                                         257

ern aggression, which for those who don't know about the war of
Northern aggression, it is the Civil War. And it is refought, for
those who think it ended at some point. But it is a sense of exclu-
sion. And for those of us who have felt that sense of exclusion, I
think that we have a strong sense that any policy that endorses
that exclusion--and I think Justice O'Connor points that out--
should be considered inappropriate.

  My concern would be with someone like Danny Glickman that
when we consider cases in a constitutional context that we under-
stand the effects of government's perceived endorsement of one re-
ligion over another, and that we take that into consideration when
we analyze those cases.

  Senator SIMON. I don't think since you have been on the appel-
late court you have had any chance to rule on any of these church-
state issues. Have you?

  Judge THOMAS. In my way of recollection or in my knowledge, I
have not, Senator.

  Senator SIMON. If you or anyone--Ken or Fred or anyone, if you
have written anything in this field, I would be interested in seeing
it.

  Judge THOMAS. I think my writings in this area are mercifully
minor, if any.

  Senator SIMON. My time is just about up, and rather than start
the next subject--when you are the last in line, you have to skip
from subject to subject, whatever hasn't been covered. I will hold
off until the second round.

  Thank you very much, Judge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you so much. Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, all the writings are in the area of natu-
ral law. There aren't any on religion.
  Senator I understand that you don't mind if we start tomorrow,
do you?
  Senator KOHL. NO.
  The CHAIRMAN. Tomorrow we will start at 10 o'clock, Judge. I
am going to give you a copy, which you already have, of some of
your speeches that occurred post-1984. I believe, almost all of these
speeches have been discussed, but I want to make sure you have
copies of them, because tomorrow I am going to ask you to help me
understand some of them.
  If there is no further business, I have been asked to accommo-
date the President's request to continue to allow district court and
circuit court judges to be reported out during this process. In order
to honor that request we will have a very brief--which will make
no sense to anyone except White House staff that is here and the
committee--exec tomorrow to vote on reporting out 13 Federal
judges and 4 U.S. attorneys. So as a practical matter, I say to the
press that we will begin questioning closer to 10:30 than 10. But
the purpose of that is to report out these Federal judges. We might
as well just do it right here so we don't have to move around.
  But we are going to try to start as close to 10 as we can with you,
judge. This exec won't take very long.
  With that, if there is no further business coming before the com-
mittee this evening, we will adjourn until 10 tomorrow.

NOMINATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                     THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 1991

                                                                       U.S. SENATE,
                                                  COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                               Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice at 10:22 a.m., in room
325, Senate caucus room, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon.
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chairman of the committee) presiding.
  Present: Senators Biden, Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini,
Leahy, Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley,
Specter, and Brown.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let's officially begin the hearing with Judge
Thomas.
  Judge, welcome. We are delighted to have you and Mrs. Thomas
back. We will follow, business as usual, and begin with the Senator
from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl who will have one-half hour of dia-
logue with the witness.
  Senator Kohl.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Good morning, Judge Thomas.
  Judge THOMAS. Good morning, Senator.
  Senator KOHL. Glad to see you this morning.
  Judge Thomas, Monday's New York Times said that you were
"involved in mock committee sessions in which your answers were
tried out in front of lawyers pretending to be committee members."
  My question is three-fold: First, who played me? [Laughter.]
  Was it Kevin Costner or Mel Gibson? Second, I would like to
know who played Senator Metzenbaum? [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. Nobody would have that
  Senator KOHL. Third, Judge Thomas, I would like to know who
could possibly have played Senator Simpson?
  Judge THOMAS. That is a good question, Senator. I don't remem-
ber precisely, but I think that it may have been Senator Danforth
who played all three. But I can't remember precisely.
  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Thomas, I would like to ask you
why you want this job.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, being nominated to the Supreme Court
of the United States is one of the highest callings in our country. It
is an opportunity. It is an entrustment, an entrusting of responsi-
bility by the people of this country, by this body, to make some of
the most difficult and important decisions in our country.

                                                           (259)
                                        260

  It is an opportunity to serve, to give back. That has been some-
thing that has been important to me. And I believe Senator, that I
can make a contribution, that I can bring something different to
the Court, that I can walk in the shoes of the people who are af-
fected by what the Court does.

  You know, on my current court, I have occasion to look out the
window that faces C Street, and there are converted buses that
bring in the criminal defendants to our criminal justice system,
busload after busload. And you look out, and you say to yourself,
and I say to myself almost every day, But for the grace of God
there go I.

  So you feel that you have the same fate, or could have, as those
individuals. So I can walk in their shoes, and I can bring something
different to the Court. And I think it is a tremendous responsibil-
ity, and it is a humbling responsibility; and it is one that, if con-
firmed, I will carry out to the best of my ability.

  Senator KOHL. All right. That is good.
  Judge Thomas, if I understand you correctly, you are going to
leave behind almost all of your views about what type of society we
ought to be and what type of policies we ought to apply. Two ques-
tions. First, why after 20 years in the forefront of these battles do
you want to leave all of this behind? And the second question is: If
you do leave so much of this behind, what is left?
  Judge THOMAS. Though it may sound rather strange to some in-
dividuals, the kind of fighting and the in-fighting and certainly the
difficulties of battles, those kinds of battles in the political process I
think are wearing. So it is not the confrontation that I ever rel-
ished or enjoyed. In fact, that is the opposite of my personality. I
like to try to find consensus. So I don't miss and have not missed
on this court having those kinds of battles. We have reasoned, con-
structive debate on the court.
  But with respect to the underlying concerns and feelings about
people being left out, about our society not addressing all the prob-
lems of people, I have those concerns. I will take those to the grave
with me. I am concerned about the kids on those buses I told you. I
am concerned about the kids who didn't have the strong grandfa-
ther and strong grandparents to help them out of what I would
consider a terrible, terrible fate. But you carry that feeling with
you. You carry that strength with you. You carry those experiences
with you. I don't think you have to carry the battles with you. It is
a difficult weight.
  Senator KOHL. Judge, I would like to come back to a question
about preparation. When I was running for the Senate, I worked
with people who helped prepare me for debates, so in my mind
there is nothing wrong with getting some advice and help in pre-
paring for this hearing. But I would like to ask you some questions
about the process.
  When you were holding practice sessions, did your advisers ever
critique you about responses to questions in a substantive way? Did
they say, for example, "You should soften that answer," or 'Don't
answer that question, just say that you can't prejudge an issue that
may come before the Court"?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the answer to that is unequivocally
"no." I set down ground rules at the very beginning that they were
                                         261

there simply to ask me and to hear me respond to questions that
have been traditionally asked before this committee in other hear-
ings and to determine whether or not my response was clear, just
to critique me as to how it sounded to them, not to myself, but not
to tell me whether it was right or wrong or too little or too much.

  Senator KOHL. Good. Judge Thomas, most Americans believe
that the Supreme Court should have a fierce independence. Do you
see any problem in terms of the system of checks and balances, and
separation of powers in having members of the executive branch
detailed to assist in the confirmation of a member to the Supreme
Court? Do you think that such assistance creates an appearance of
impropriety, because it blurs the lines between the branches of
Government?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the process of confirmation, as you can
imagine, is a difficult one. The last 10 weeks have involved my an-
swering countless questions, responding to significant document re-
quests that I personally could not respond to, and information that
was contained in the executive branch.

  Traditionally, individuals in the executive branch have assisted,
but, again, there I made it clear what my rules were. They were to
do nothing more than provide me with information such as case
law, documents that I needed to prepare myself at my request.
They in no way did anything more than provide that information.

  For example, they would be more in the order of what I would
have my law clerk do, provide me with the material that I need.

  Senator KOHL. But it is said in the New York Times--perhaps
they were misquoting--that there were mock sessions between you
and people from that branch during which questions were asked
and answers were given. That is entirely different from what you
just said.

  Judge THOMAS. TO my knowledge, there was one individual from
the--there were a number of individuals from the executive
branch, that is right. I thought you were talking about the individ-
uals who assisted me with the documents, not the individuals in
mock sessions.

  Senator KOHL. NO, no. We are talking about the whole process,
the preparation, the involvement, the fact that the executive
branch and you have been working together on this nomination in
all the various ways, including preparation for this hearing. And I
am asking you not whether or not you have the right to do it. You
do. I am asking whether or not that blurs the separations that are
supposed to exist as between the branches of Government.

  Judge THOMAS. I am sorry I was not responsive. I think that
there would be certainly be no more conflict than one would have
when a clerk from your staff argues before you in the subsequent
years. I do not think there would be, Senator. I can see the con-
cern, but I do not think that there would be at all.

  Senator KOHL. All right.
  Judge THOMAS. And the preparation is dearly needed, the help,
the assistance is dearly needed.
  Senator KOHL. Good. Judge Thomas, I would like to talk to you
about the right to privacy for just a minute. Yesterday, you told
Senators Leahy and Metzenbaum that you had no opinion, either
personally or professionally, about the legal issues raised in Roe,
                                        262

and that you have never had an opinion and never discussed it.
That is a very strong statement to make to this committee and to
the American people.

  I would like to ask you a related, but nonlegal question. As Clar-
ence Thomas the man, a human being, do you have a personal view
on whether society ought to provide women with the option of
having an abortion?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I would essentially reply as I have yes-
terday, and that is this or in this way: I think that in this area
that the need for a judge such as myself to maintain impartiality is
critical. I think that whether or not I have a view on this impor-
tant issue is irrelevant to being an impartial judge and having one
could undermine or create a perception that could undermine my
impartiality. That is very important to me, and I think it is criti-
cal, if not important to any other judge.

  Senator KOHL. That is fine, but the question I asked is whether
you have, as a human being, a personal view on this subject.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I understand the concerns on both sides
of the issues. I am certainly a citizen who attempts to keep abreast
of the news and to be aware of the issues in this country. But as I
indicated before, whether or not I have one I think is irrelevant to
my being impartial or considering this issue as a judge.

  Senator KOHL. Judge Thomas, yesterday you reminded us that
the panel that is judging you is all white and all male. Do you
think that your responses on this question would have satisfied a
panel composed of 14 women, instead of 14 men?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't know, Senator. I would hope that the
manner in which I am judged, in a fair and impartial manner, does
not depend on the gender or the race of those judging me.

  Senator KOHL. In 1987, Judge Thomas, you said that you be-
lieved, and I quote, "Our civil rights policy should be based on fun-
damental principles and the assumption that Americans are basi-
cally decent, and that they prize fairness." Yet you told Juan Wil-
liams, for an article in the Atlantic Monthly, that you believe that
the white world is wrought with racism. "There is nothing you can
do to get past black skin. I don't care how educated you are, how
good you are at what you do, you will never be seen as equal to
whites."

  Judge Thomas, those are contradictory statements and I would
like to ask you: First, how you can oppose most forms of affirma-
tive action, if America is basically racist; and second, how can you
support any type of affirmative action, if Americans are as basical-
ly decent and fair as you have suggested?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, it is clear from the testimony that I
have given you here about where I grew up, that I understand the
realities of our country. It should be clear from my biography that
I understand that racism exists. Throughout my speeches, I have
made it clear that there is unfairness, in speeches at commence-
ments of Savannah State College, Compton, wherever, places that I
have had occasion to speak to minority students and to others, I
have pointed out this unfairness, but I appealed.

  There is an individual I heard recently who said that we can
seek revenge or prosperity. I have tried to appeal to that which is
good. I have been there where I have been angry and upset, and I
                                         263

understand what it means to be angry and upset. But what I have
tried to do during my tenure at EEOC, during my public life, recog-
nizing that there are these contradictions in our society, I have
tried to appeal to what is good, what can move us forward, not
backwards.

  With respect to affirmative action programs, I tried to explain
yesterday the tensions between the notion of fairness to everyone
and this desire to help people who are left out. There is a tension,
and how far do you go in trying to include people who are left out,
and not be unfair to other individuals, and it is one that I had
hoped that we could wrestle with in a constructive way. But as the
debate went on, unfortunately, we were not able to, and the rheto-
ric was heated.

  But I have initiated affirmative programs, I have supported af-
firmative action programs. Whether or not I agree with all of them
I think is a matter of record. But the fact that I don't agree with
all of them does not mean that I am not a supporter of the under-
lying effort. I am and have been my entire adult life.

  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Thomas, I would like to talk
about a subject which is somewhat sensitive, but it seems to me we
ought to address it openly. In the article by Juan Williams, you
said you were troubled with the possibility of being selected for a
position because of your race. In that instance, you were speaking
about your appointments to the head of the Office of Civil Rights
at Education, and also to head the EEOC. Did you have similar
thoughts when you were nominated for the Supreme Court, Judge
Thomas?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my concerns were in being selected for
the two positions that you stated, was that I sensed that it was
automatically assumed that, since I was black, these are the posi-
tions for me, it is expected that I would go to that sort of a posi-
tion, as opposed to the Energy Department, for example.

  The President indicated that he nominated me as a result of his
search, as limited or as broad as it may have been among those in-
dividuals, he felt that I was the best qualified. I take him at his
word, but I also believe that there is a need in all of our institu-
tions, on the Supreme Court and elsewhere, in diversity. I think it
is important to our society.

  Senator KOHL. Well, are you troubled by what mainstream peri-
odicals have been saying now for several weeks. I quote just one,
U.S. News & World Report. They said you were "picked from a
pool of one to fill a quota of one." That has been said in some way
by half a dozen or a dozen mainstream periodicals around the
country. Does that bother you?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there is much that has been said over
the past 10 weeks that has troubled me. To say that is the most
troubling thing that has been said, I think would not be accurate,
but that would trouble anyone, and also I think it is inaccurate.

  Senator KOHL. Judge Thomas, you have had some harsh things
to say about Congress--so have I and so have most of the American
people. But unlike most of the American people, you have worked
in the Congress. In fact, you have worked in the executive, legisla-
tive and the judicial branches. I would like to ask you a few ques-
tions about your experience in these areas.
                                         264

  In a 1988 speech at Wake Forest, you said that legislators "brow-
beat, threaten and harass agency heads." In the Wake Forest
speech and in another 1988 speech, you said that Congress was,
and I quote, "a coalition of elites which failed to be a deliberative
body, which legislates for the common or the public interest," and
that Congress was "no longer primarily a deliberative or even a
law-making body."

  So, Judge Thomas, why would a man like you, with strongly held
ideas about public policy, ever want to work in this branch of gov-
ernment, the courts, where you have an obligation to uphold the
bad laws that you say Congress makes?

  Judge THOMAS. First, let me go back to the position that I was in
as a member of the executive branch. As I indicated yesterday,
there is tension between the two branches, and particularly in the
oversight process. I felt, as the head of an agency who had been
called to the Hill on a number of occasions in some very difficult
circumstances, that particularly some of the staffers went too far
in micromanaging the agency and made it very, very difficult.

  I think that the legislative role of Congress, as well as the over-
sight roles of Congress, are very, very important. It is a little easier
to see, when you are not the object of an oversight hearing.

  In my current job, our role is to determine the intent of Con-
gress. I believe that I have done that fairly and impartially. I have
stated very clearly that my job is not to engage in a policy debate
with Congress. I am out of that role. I am not in the political
branch. I am in the neutral branch, and my job is to remain neu-
tral.

  When I was in the political branch, I think I fought the policy-
making battles, and I am sure that individuals on this side has
some

  Senator KOHL. That is all right. I just want to go back and quote
to you what you said, and ask you, do you remember saying it? Is it
true? And do you believe it? You said that "Congress was a coali-
tion of elites which failed to be a deliberative body that legislates
for the common good or the public interest," and you said that
"Congress was no longer primarily a deliberative or even a law-
making body." Is that how you feel?

  Judge THOMAS. Today?
  Senator KOHL. Today. [Laughter.]
  Here, sitting before 14 of us who are going to vote.
  Judge THOMAS. I can't, Senator, remember the total context of
that, but I think I said that and I think I said it in the context of
saying that Congress was at its best when it was legislating on
great moral issues. Now, I could be wrong. I think I have turned
over 138 speeches, and I can't remember the details of all of them,
but I did say and I do remember saying that Congress was at its
best when it was deliberating the great moral issues of our time,
such as, for example, our involvement in the Persian Gulf conflict.
  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge, I would like to briefly follow up
on Senator Simon's church-state questions. During your appellate
court confirmation hearing, we discussed your views on school
prayer and I asked you about your 1985 statement where you said,
"As for prayer, my mother says when they took God out of the
schools, the schools went to hell. She may be right. Religion cer-
                                     265

tainly is a source of positive values, and we need to get as many
positive values in schools as possible." You said that was your per-
sonal view, but of no consequence; that as an appellate judge, you
would be bound to follow Supreme Court precedent.

  Now, however, you are being considered for the Supreme Court
and you will be in a position to set precedent. Your personal views
are of great consequence, so I would like to ask you this: The Su-
preme Court has repeatedly ruled that prayer in the schools vio-
lates the first amendment. Given your statement in 1985, could you
explain your views on prayer in school today?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I indicated yesterday, my comments
there were not taken to in any way reflect on the legal rulings on
the establishment clause or the free exercise clause. As I indicated
yesterday, that from my standpoint, as a citizen of this country and
as a judge, that the metaphor of the Jeffersonian wall of separation
is an important metaphor. The Court has established the Lemon
test to analyze the establishment clause cases, and I have no quar-
rel with that test.

  The Court, of course, has had difficulty in applying the Lemon
test and is grappling with that as we sit here, I would assume, and
over the past few years, but the concept itself, the Jeffersonian
wall of separation, the Lemon test, neither of those do I quarrel
with.

  Senator KOHL. All right. In your view, Judge, what is the current
state of the law with regards to the establishment clause of the
first amendment?

  Judge THOMAS. The Court now, in the application of the Lemon
test, that is that there be a secular purpose to the legislation or the
action, that there be no primary sectarian effect and there be no
unnecessary entanglement of government in the affairs of religion.
It has been difficult for the Court, as I noted, to apply. The Court
has been split between I think those who feel that there should be
some accommodation and those who think there should be an abso-
lute separation.

  Justice O'Connor, of course, has offered some movement in the
area, as well as Justice Kennedy I think has applied a coercion
test. I think the judges are grappling at, when church and the gov-
ernment are inexorably in contact with each other, how much sep-
aration can there be and how do you draw the line.

  I think it is difficult. It has been difficult for the Court. We see it
in the cases with the Christmas displays and the Court has not re-
solved it, but I think the analysis, the Lemon test, as well as the
understanding that the separation must be there is important, but,
in practice, it is difficult.

  Senator KOHL. HOW do you reconcile your willingness to discuss
this area of the Constitution, which is still unsettled law, with your
unwillingness to discuss another area of the Constitution, which is
the woman's right to choice?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think what I have attempted to do is,
to the best of my ability, without judging or prejudging the case, to
simply set out in an area that you have requested the analysis of
what the Court has done and where it has gone.

  I have indicated and I think it is important to indicate that the
area of Roe v. Wade is a difficult, it is a controversial area. Cases
                                         266

are coming before the Court in many different postures. And I
think it would--and I think it is a judgment that each member of
the judiciary has to make. I think it would undermine my ability to
impartially address that very difficult issue, if I am confirmed, to
go further than I have gone.

  Senator KOHL. All right. Finally, Judge, with respect to all the
things that you have said and written in the past and the things
that you have asked us to discount today--I am thinking also about
the meeting we had in my office when you said that we should for
the most part forget about what we have read and written about
you--you said that the real Judge Thomas would come out at the
hearings. My question is, Why is it inappropriate for us to make an
evaluation of your candidacy based upon all the things that you
have written and said--particularly in view of the fact that you
have been on the court for only 16 months? If we are going to
make an informed judgment on behalf of the American people,
why are your policy positions not important? How are we supposed
to make a judgment on you? Is it fair for you to say to us, for the
most part: members of the panel, just view me on what I am saying
here this week; don't view me on what has been written about
me--about my speeches, the things that I have said? Does that give
us the most complete opportunity to make the evaluation that we
need to make on behalf of the American people?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that I have turned over in re-
sponding to requests, as a result, I think 32,000 pages of documents.
I have spent the last decade in the Government. I think that the
material is there. I think that a fair reading of my record is a read-
ing which indicates that I am one person who has attempted to be
involved and attempted to do some good, who did not hide, who did
not sneak away from the problems, who tried to grapple with
them, who tried to take them head on, and who tried to make a
difference. I think the record is relevant, but I think it has to be
understood that when I was in the executive branch, I was in the
executive branch. I am a member of the judiciary, and I think it is
a fair question from me to you is to see whether or not my policy
positions have tainted my role as a judge.

  Senator KOHL. Well, you have only been on the court for 16
months, and so we are not in a position to see how your policy posi-
tions are, either consistent or not consistent with the things that
you have done on the court. But in many areas, you are asking us
to recognize that, some of the policy positions that you have taken
in the past, were just that--policy positions--and they don't have
any relevance to your court experience or the kind of experience or
expertise that you will bring to the Supreme Court.

  For example, you say you turned over 32,000 pages to us, and yet
when we come back to you and say, well, what about this or what
about that, you are saying that doesn't count or that doesn't count.
In your opening statement, for example, for the most part you said
that you are an example of a person who has pulled himself up by
the bootstraps, who is a good, honest, decent, hard-working, effec-
tive, intelligent man--which you are. And I think to an extent this
approach troubles me. Your hearing has been a continuation of
that kind of experience and you have encouraged us to judge you
on that. But I think that we and the American people, Judge
                                        267

Thomas, should be given the full opportunity to judge you on the
whole range of your life experiences, which does include the things
that you have said and written and done, just like it does for the
rest of us.

  When I ran for office, I wasn't able to say don't consider this or
don't consider that. The voters wouldn't allow that. And they con-
sider everything I have done, everything I have said. And I think
that that is the way the process should work in a democracy. And
to the extent that you think I am exaggerating, I would be interest-
ed in your response, and then I am finished.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that if this were an oversight
hearing and I could go back and discuss all the policies and tell you
that, yes, it is relevant to me going back and running my agency,
running the agency that I have been asked to run or permitted to
run.

  When one becomes a judge, the role changes, the roles change.
That is why it is different. You are no longer involved in those bat-
tles. You are no longer running an agency. You are no longer
making policy. You are a judge. It is hard to explain, perhaps, but
you strive--rather than looking for policy positions, you strive for
impartiality. You begin to strip down from those policy positions.
You begin to walk away from that constant development of new
policies. You have to rule on cases as an impartial judge. And I
think that is the important message that I am trying to send to
you; that, yes, my whole record is relevant, but remember that that
was as a policy maker not as a judge.

  Senator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Judge, before I begin my questioning, I would like to point out
for the record there are 32,000 pages of documents, but I would
guess 31,000 pages of those have nothing to do with what you have
written, nothing to do with what you said. They are agency docu-
ments. So the implication should not be left here that anybody has
questioned you on even a remotely large part of those 32,000 pages.
  All you have been questioned on so far and all I think the Sena-
tor was making the point about is that we are trying to figure out,
as you said, how you would rule--we don't want to know how you
would rule on cases. We want to know how you think about ruling
on it. And all the questions asked of you, none of them thus far
have had anything to do with 32,000 pages of documents. They
have to do with probably--if you added up all the speeches you
gave that would give us insight into how you think, maybe there is
1,000. Maybe there is 500; maybe there is 1,200 pages. But that is
what we are talking about. I know you know that. I just want to
make sure that the public doesn't think you have to go back and
look over 32,000 pages of documents and analyze it. That is sort of
the Wall Street Journal argument. You know, this has nothing to
do with 32,000 pages of documents.
  Now, Judge, I want to see if I can come away from this round of
questions with a better understanding of the method--not the
result, the method--that you would apply to interpreting the very
difficult phrases in the Constitution, which have been phrases that
have been matters of contention for 200 years or more and, when
interpreted, have sent the country off in one direction or another.
                                         268

  Now, you will be pleased to know I don't want to know anything
about abortion. I don't want to know how you think about abortion.
I don't want to know whether you have ever thought about abor-
tion. I don't want to know whether you ever even discussed it. I
don't want to know whether you have talked about it in your sleep.
I don't want to know anything about abortion. I mean that sincere-
ly, because I don't want that red herring, in my case at least, to
detract from what I am just trying to find out here, which is how
do you think about these things.

  When you and I talked on Tuesday in this hearing, you said, and
I quote, "I don't see a role for the use of natural law in constitu-
tional adjudication. My interest in exploring natural law and natu-
ral rights was purely in the context of political theory."

  Now, that struck me as something different than you said in
many speeches, and I gave you some of those speeches yesterday so
that you would know what I wanted to talk about today. And you
know I want to talk about this subject with you so I can under-
stand it better.

  So let's start with not what you said in the speeches but what
you told the committee so far about whether natural law does or
does not impact on the Constitution.

  Yesterday you told us that the Framers of the Constitution "sub-
scribed to the notion of natural law." But you emphasized that any
such belief, any belief held by the Framers based on natural law
had to be reduced to positive law; that is, put in the Constitution
for it to have any effect or impact on adjudication.

  The Framers, you said, sometimes "reduced to positive law in the
Constitution aspects of life principles they believed in; for example,
liberty. But when it is in the Constitution, it is no longer natural
rights. It is a constitutional right, and that is an important point."

  So as I heard that statement, I began to think I am beginning to
understand your thinking on this, but I want to be sure. Do you
recall saying that yesterday?

  Judge THOMAS. I generally recollect.
  The CHAIRMAN. And is that a fair rendition?
  Judge THOMAS. I think it is.
  The CHAIRMAN. Then you went on to say, and I quote, "Positive
law is our Constitution, and when we look at constitutional adjudi-
cation, we look at that document." So it is purely positive law. It is
purely that Constitution, this document. When you as a judge are
interpreting it, the fact that the Framers may or may not have
based the Constitution on natural law--and you and I think they
did--that does not impact on adjudication unless it was reduced to
writing in the Constitution. Then it is positive law. That is what
you mean by positive law, right?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, SO it is purely positive law that you as a
judge look to in order to decide a case; is that right?
  Judge THOMAS. I think I indicated in later testimony--and this is
an important point, and it is one--as I read your op-ed piece, it is
one that I think you ask in a different way. You say, Is it rigid or
is this concept of natural law rigid? For me, that question would
be, Is the concept of liberty rigid?

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.
                                         269

  Judge THOMAS. And in our constitutional tradition, the concept
of liberty, liberty is a concept that has been flexible. It is one that
has been adjudicated over time, looking at history, tradition, of
course starting with what the Founding Fathers thought of the
concept of liberty, but not ending there.

  The CHAIRMAN. OK. I am beginning to understand. So natural
law informed the notion of liberty. You and I have both read--be-
cause of our backgrounds, I suspect we have both read--I won't get
into Aquinas and Augustine and all of that, but Locke looked back
to the concept of natural law as an evolving notion. Montesquieu
talked about it. Jefferson understood it. He was in Paris. He was
probably the only one that fully understood it. But others who
were there writing the Constitution, they talked about it. They had
what they wrote about the Declaration, as you say in other places,
and in the Constitution they reduced these broad notions of natu-
ral law, the natural rights of man, to this document.

  Now, you say that they put some of these natural law principles
in the document in words like liberty, you just mentioned. You in-
dicate that once liberty was in the Constitution, it becomes positive
law. But now comes the hard question, as you and I both know. A
judge has to define what liberty means. Now, how does a judge
know what the ambiguous term liberty means in the Constitution?
And I want to start with a key term in the Constitution, one that
protects the right of privacy and many other rights. And that is
the word you mentioned yesterday and you mention again here
today--liberty.

  Yesterday you told the committee our founders and our drafters
did believe in natural law, in addition to whatever else philoso-
phers they had, and I think they acted to some extent on those be-
liefs in drafting portions of the Constitution; for example, the con-
cept of liberty in the 14th amendment. So the concept of natural
law, liberty, is embodied--you say, and I agree with you--in the
14th amendment.

  You also then said, "To understand what the Framers meant and
what they were trying to do, it is important to go back and attempt
to understand what they believed, just as we do when we attempt
to interpret a statute that is drafted by this body to get your under-
standing."

  Now, as I understand this, Judge, while you reject any direct ap-
plication of natural law--that is, you sitting there and saying "I
think natural law means * * * therefore, I rule." Even though you
reject the direct application of natural in constitutional adjudica-
tion, you would use natural law to understand what the Framers
had in mind when they interpreted these broad notions. Isn't that
correct?

  Judge THOMAS. Not quite, Senator. Let me make two points
there.

  The Framers' view of the principle of liberty is the important
point.

  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Judge THOMAS. Whatever natural law is, is separate and apart.
The important point is what did the Framers think they were
doing. What were their views.

   The CHAIRMAN. Got you.
                                         270

  Judge THOMAS. The second point is this: That is only a part of
what we conceive of this notion in our society. The world didn't
stop with the Framers. The concept of liberty wasn't self-defining
at that point.

  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Judge THOMAS. And that is why I think it is important, as I have
indicated, that you then look at the rest of the history and tradi-
tion of our country.
  The CHAIRMAN. I agree with you completely--which may worry
you, but I agree with you completely.
  Now, as a matter of fact, you used that argument to take on the
original intent people in some of your speeches. You basically say,
hey> you folks who just go original intent and are pure positivists,
you have got to look at intent, real intent. And the real intent of
these guys is not just static. It goes on. It is informed by changes in
time, and also you have got to understand, as I understand you,
that they used the word liberty because they believed it to be a
natural right of man. I mean, to be specific, you say--and this is
what you said here: "Our founders believed in natural law, but
they reduced the natural law to positive law." And one of those
concepts in natural law they reduced was liberty to positive law be-
cause the word liberty appears in the Constitution, in the 14th
amendment in particular.
  Now, in a speech before the Pacific Research Institute, which I
gave you yesterday, you praised the opinion of Justice Scalia in
Morrison v. Olson. That is the case where the Supreme Court
upheld, as you know, 7-1, the right of the Congress to say there
can be a special prosecutor, like Walsh, like the Iran-Contra. It
wasn't about Iran-Contra but the special prosecutor.
  But Scalia filed a lone dissent, and you praised his dissent, and
you said the following: "Justice Scalia's remarkable dissent in Mor-
rison points the way toward the correct principles and ideas. He in-
dicates how again we might relate natural rights to democratic
self-government and thus protect the regime of individual rights."
  You go on to say that, "The principles and ideas indicated by the
opinion and the Massachusetts Bill of Rights"--which you quote--
"refers to"--and you are referring now, you say "summarizes well
the tie between natural rights and limited government. Beyond his-
torical circumstances, sociological conditions and class bias, natural
rights constitutes an objective basis for good government. So the
American founders saw it and so should we. But we don't. Try talk-
ing to a Justice Department attorney about natural rights, and
when you mention the venerable term, they assume that you want
an activist Court along the lines of Mr. Justice Brennan. That such
an assumption must be fought reveals the extent to which the term
natural rights has been corrupted and misunderstood, and not only
among the class of conservative sophisticates in Washington."
  Now, I don't know any other way to read this passage than to
conclude that you believe that natural law and natural rights
should help judges decide constitutional decisions.
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator. I have said that over--I have re-
peated that continually here.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know, but that does not jibe.
                                         271

  Judge THOMAS. But, Senator, I was speaking as the Chairman of
EEOC, and let me explain to you what my interests were. I have
under oath, in my confirmation for the court of appeals and for
this Court, tried to explain as clearly as I possibly could what I was
attempting to do. In speech after speech, I talked about the ideals
and the first principles of this country, the notion that we have
three branches, so that they can be intentioned and not impede on
the individual. That is what this case is about. At bottom, the case
is about an individual who could be in some way, whose rights
could be impeded by an individual who is not accountable to one of
the political branches. That was the sole point.

  The CHAIRMAN. I understand the point.
  Judge THOMAS. I have not in any speech said that we should ad-
judicate cases by directly appealing to natural law.
  The CHAIRMAN. What was Scalia doing?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, he was
  The CHAIRMAN. He was adjudicating a case, wasn't he?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, he was pointing out the relationship, the
purpose of the relationship among the branches.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right, but, Judge, wasn't the reason he was
pointing it out--if need be, we will spend all day Friday on this--
wasn't the reason he was pointing this out because he wanted the
case adjudicated, decided in a way differently than the seven Jus-
tices who decided in favor of the existence of, the constitutionality
of? He was adjudicating. Now, what is this, it seems like we are
engaged in a little bit of sophistry here. Wasn't he adjudicating a
case?
  Judge THOMAS. He was adjudicating a case. I am only pointing
to, as I say here, the concern that I had between the relationships
in the branches. If, Senator, I as a sitting Federal judge had writ-
ten this speech, considering the fact that I adjudicate cases as a sit-
ting Federal judge, and did not draw a clean distinction between a
speech that is talking generally about the protection of individuals,
then I think you have a very valid point.
  The CHAIRMAN. What did Scalia do, Judge? Didn't Scalia do just
what you said? Scalia applied natural rights in making a decision,
a decision before the Supreme Court of the United States of Amer-
ica. You say that is what he did and you recommend to everyone
else, look at what he did, it is a good thing.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I beg to differ.

   The CHAIRMAN. OK.

  Judge THOMAS. I have attempted, in good faith and under oath
twice, to make clear that I don't think that an appeal, a direct
appeal to natural law is a part of adjudicating cases.

  Now, the point that I was attempting to make here, as I indicat-
ed to you, is simply he indicates how, again, we might relate natu-
ral rights to democratic self-government.

  The CHAIRMAN. Right, that is what he was doing.
  Judge THOMAS. Relate. I didn't say adjudicate cases.
   The CHAIRMAN. All right.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I am interested, I was interested in the
notion that you have the three branches of Government and
   The CHAIRMAN. Right.
                                         272

  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. And you have an individual. Now,
let me give you an example of my point, talking about the ideal. I
think that we agree that the ideal that all men are created equal is
an ideal.

  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Judge THOMAS. It is certainly one that was in our Declara-
tion
  The CHAIRMAN. IS it based on natural rights?
  Judge THOMAS. It was based on our Founders' belief in natural
right.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Judge THOMAS. But slavery existed, even as that ideal existed.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Judge THOMAS. That did not mean that slavery was right or com-
ported with that idea. It did not mean that you could end slavery,
without a constitutional amendment.
  The CHAIRMAN. Agreed. That is the point, Judge. The point is
you say our Founders looked to natural law to inform what they
put in the Constitution, but it doesn't matter. The fact they said all
men are created equal didn't mean anything until the 13th and
14th amendments to stop slavery. But once they put it in, this nat-
ural law principle in 1866, it became part of the law and now we
have to treat it as law. But because it is uncertain what that
means--for example, does "all men" mean all women? That is
what the 14th amendment was about and we have concluded it
does.
  Because we don't know what it means, because it is broad and
ennobling, we have to go back, you said, and look at the Framers
and what they meant.
  Judge THOMAS. AS a starting point.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS a starting point. So, at least, Judge, will you
not acknowledge you conclude that natural law indirectly impacts
upon what you think a phrase in the Constitution means?
  Judge THOMAS. TO the extent that it impacts, to the extent that
the Framers' beliefs comport with that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right, what the Framers thought natural law
meant.
  Judge THOMAS. But the important point is what the Framers be-
lieve. I, for example, I think I said in--I am trying to find the pre-
cise statement here
  The CHAIRMAN. Take your time. We have a lot of time. Take
your time.
  Judge THOMAS. I think in referring in the speech to what a plain
reading of the Constitution
  The CHAIRMAN. I read it.
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. It is to indicate that Harlan's dissent
relies on his understanding of the Founders' arguments
  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. Not some direct appeal to any broad
law out there that we don't know.
  The CHAIRMAN. But how did he figure out what the Founders
meant by natural law?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, I think, Senator, you look at the debates,
you look at whatever it was that Harlan had available to him.
                                         273

There is not an explicit direct reliance on anything other than
what he could find the Founders meant.

  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
  Judge THOMAS. HOW do we look at history and tradition, how do
we determine how our country has advanced and grown, it is a
very difficult enterprise. It is an amorphous process at times, but it
is an important process.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that is the one we are trying to find out
you used, Judge. For example, before I leave the Pacific Research
speech, let me digress for just a moment. In that speech you said,
and I quote, "Conservative heroes such as the Chief Justice failed
not only conservatives, but all Americans in the most important
case"--that is Morrison--"themost important case since Brown v.
Board of Education. I refer, of course, to the independent counsel
case of Morrison."And you said the Morrisoncase upheld the con-
stitutionality of independent counsel, which did uphold it, and you
thought Scalia was right that it shouldn't have upheld it.
  Now, Judge, why is a case upholding the legality of an independ-
ent counsel the most important case since Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator
  The CHAIRMAN. Why do important cases, Baker, New York
Times, and the PentagonPapers,why does that one, just out of cu-
riosity?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, the reason that I use that approach was for
most people it had to do with an obscure point, the separation of
powers, so that doesn't exactly excite people in an audience. The
point, though, that was I was trying to indicate to them is that
when we address cases involving the structure of our Government,
there is a subsequent impact or could have a direct impact on indi-
viduals, and I think that is the point that I made in the speech,
and that was the central part of the speech. It was not an exegesis
of the Supreme Court opinion itself, but how it affected the rela-
tionship of the Government to individuals.
  Again, it is a point that I would have to make again, Senator,
that underscores much of the discussion of natural law. It has to be
understood that I took on this endeavor, as the Chairman of EEOC,
because of my general view that the last great person who was able
to inspire our country toward an ideal was Martin Luther King
and the notions of the poor treatment of people in our society.
  The CHAIRMAN. I agree with you, Judge.
  Judge THOMAS. It was not an effort, as I indicated in my confir-
mation hearings for the Court of Appeals, to establish a constitu-
tional philosophy to adjudicate cases.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, I don't know how you can possibly
say that, since you say the Framers--let's just stick to liberty--the
Framers put liberty in the Constitution, because they thought it
was a natural law principle, they put it in the Constitution, it
became positive law, nobody knows what liberty means, for certain,
so judges today have to go back and look at what the Framers
meant by it. How you cannot examine what their view of natural
law was, in order to know what they meant is beyond me, but
  Judge THOMAS. Well, that's the point, we agree there.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. We agree, all right. Now
                                        274

  Judge THOMAS. That's for starters, though.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, you are going to apply, at least in part, the
Framers' notion of original intent of natural law, right?
  Judge THOMAS. AS a part of the inquiry.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS a part. OK. So, how do we know what the
Framers of the 14th amendment had in mind, when they said "lib-
erty"? How do we know they had the same version of natural law
in mind, say, the Framers in 1789, when they talked about "all
men are created equal" in the Declaration, and then enshrine that
principle in the Constitution later? How do we know?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, I have not used or interpreted
that provision in the context of adjudication, but the important
starting point has to be with the debates that they were involved in
and their statements surrounding that debate.
  The CHAIRMAN. In the debates, don't they use phrases like "God-
given rights" and "they came from God."
  Judge THOMAS. Let me move forward.
  The CHAIRMAN. Don't they use those phrases? I read them.
  Judge THOMAS. But let me move forward. I also indicated that
the concept doesn't stop there, it is not frozen in time. Our notions
of what liberty means evolves with the country, it moves with our
history and our tradition.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Well, Judge, what happens if the tradi-
tion and history conflict with what you and I would believe to be
the natural law meaning that the Founders had at the time, even
though it has been reduced to positive law? The word "liberty" was
reduced to positive law in 1866. Tradition and history demonstrat-
ed when that happened; for example, women didn't have the right
to vote, women were not allowed to be everything from lawyers to
whatever. So, you look at tradition in history and you conclude, ob-
viously, they didn't have women in mind. Yet, when you look at
the natural law principle they had in mind, they must have had
women in mind when they talk about all men and the rights of in-
dividuals.
  Now, when they conflict, natural law, underpinning of the
Founders or the Framers of that amendment's notion and history,
which do you choose?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, let me make that point or let me ad-
dress that by saying this: The concept is a broad concept.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right, and that's the problem.
  Judge THOMAS. That's it, but maybe that is one of the reasons
the Founders used that concept. It is one that evolves over time. I
don't think that they could have determined in 1866 what the term
in its totality would mean for the future.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Judge THOMAS. But in constitutional adjudication, what the
courts have attempted to do is to look at the ideals, to look at the
values that we share as a culture, and those values and ideals

  The CHAIRMAN. Change.
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. Have evolved, in that specific provi-
sion have evolved over time.
  The CHAIRMAN. There are a lot of other provisions that have
evolved, too, Judge.
  Judge THOMAS. But in that provision
                                         275

  The CHAIRMAN. Sure, in liberty. Let's just stick to the liberty
clause, they have evolved. Now, some argue, a number of very dis-
tinguished jurists before us argued that that evolution of those
views should be bound by the history and their tradition, and Jus-
tice Scalia, whom you quote often, fundamentally disagrees with
your view about going back and looking at the natural law tradi-
tion.

  You said yesterday, for example, that there is a right to privacy
in the 14th amendment, and it was made clear that this was a mar-
ital right to privacy. Now, Judge, I assume you find that right in
the liberty clause, this right to privacy.

  Judge THOMAS. The liberty component of the due process clause.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right. Now, let me ask you this, if I can move
along, in light of my time here: The discussion of this question yes-
terday about the right to privacy, yesterday it was Senator Leahy.
You told the committee, "I believe the approach that Justice
Harlan took in Poe v. Ullman and reaffirmed again in Griswoldin
determining the right to privacy was the appropriate way to go." Is
that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. That is what I said, I believe, yesterday.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I find this still hard to understand, in light
of the fact that Justice Harlan in Poe relied specifically on natural
law. Let me read the quote to you. He says, "It is not the particu-
lar enumeration of rights in the first eight amendments that spells
out the reach of the 14th amendment due process, but, rather, it
was suggested in another context long before the adoption of that
amendment"--meaning the 14th amendment--"it is those concepts
which are considered to embrace rights 'which are fundamental'
and which belong to all citizens of a free government." And he is
quoting the Corfieldcase there.
  Now, Justice Harlan reaches his judgment based on natural law,
and he quotes the Corfield case, which I might add, Judge, this is
not something new. As late as 1985, in the Rehnquist court, they
quote the Corfieldcase, as well.
  This is what confuses me. You say natural law is no part of adju-
dication of a case, that you rely on
  Judge THOMAS. That it has to be
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me just finish, and you can tell me I am
wrong. You rely on Justice Harlan in Poe as the rationale as to
how you find a right to privacy in the 14th amendment, Justice
Harlan adjudicates that there is a right, because it is a natural
right, and you say natural rights have no part of the adjudicating
process of whether or not the word "liberty" means A, B, or C, or
any other provision of the Constitution that we have difficulty un-
derstanding means anything. Explain that to me.
  Judge THOMAS. YOU missed an important point, and maybe I am
not making myself as clear as I could be. What I said was this, that
there is no independent appeal to natural law.
  The CHAIRMAN. What do you call Poe?
  Judge THOMAS. What one does is one appeals to the drafters'
view of what they were doing and they believe in natural law,
what were their beliefs, and one moves forward in time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me stop you there for a second, so I under-
stand now. I am not trying to confuse you. I am trying to under-
                                         276

stand. The drafters had different views of natural law. You and I
both know that. Some agreed with the Thomistic view--not you,
Thomas Aquinas--some agree with the Thomistic view that the
natural law is not revealed all at once, but natural law is a process
that reasonable men, reasoning together over time, will determine
what it is.

  Others believed, more in the Augustine tradition, he didn't call it
natural law, that it is revealed, God just sent these down on high,
and some people believe that it is even defete doctrine, you know,
boom, this is the law. They had different views.

  Now, you're saying you have got to go back and look at what
their view of natural law is. How do you determine which view it
was?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I think it is difficult in any enterprise,
when you attempt to determine what other people were trying to
do. But I think the important point that has to be made

  The CHAIRMAN. It is subjective, isn't it, ultimately?
  Judge THOMAS. It is an important point and it is a difficult point
and it is a difficult determination, just as it is difficult to determine
after that how our tradition and our history and our culture
evolves, and what are the underlying values. I think that is the
point that Justice Harlan and others have attempted to make, that
it is not to constrain the development or rights, that you would
want this adjudication being tethered to our history and tradition,
but, rather, to restrain judges.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, Justice Harlan had no problem. He didn't
have your problem, this tortuous logic which I think borders on--
anyway, this tortuous logic. He had no problem. He went straight
to the heart of it in his dissent. He said you don't look to any one
of the amendments to inform or all of the amendments to inform
the 14th. I, Harlan, I don't have that problem, he said to the world,
I go straight to natural law, and, by the way, I'm not the first one
to do that, in Corfield they did that.
  And you say you base your conception of privacy in the liberty
clause based on Harlan inPoe.
  Judge THOMAS. Exactly.
  The CHAIRMAN. And now you're telling me that you don't think
natural law plays--he didn't fool around, he went right to the
heart of the matter.
  Judge THOMAS. What I said was, again, Senator, is that one goes
to what the Founders and the drafters believe
  The CHAIRMAN. And he believed
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. As you indicated, that there were
competing notions of natural law. I think it is an important,
though difficult inquiry and that it is one that the Court under-
takes, as well as the subsequent development and expansion and
growth of the liberty component of the due process clause through
referring to history and tradition.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, I don't know why you are so afraid
to deal with this natural law thing. I don't see how any reasonable
person can conclude that natural law does not impact upon adjudi-
cation of a case, if you are a judge, if you acknowledge that you
have to go back and look at what the Founders meant by natural
                                         277

law, and then at least in part have that play a part in the adjudica-
tion of

  Judge THOMAS. I am admitting that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Pardon me?
  Judge THOMAS. I am admitting that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Oh, you are admitting that?
  Judge THOMAS. I have. I said that to the extent that the Fram-
  The CHAIRMAN. Good. So, natural law does impact on the adjudi-
cation of cases.
  Judge THOMAS. TO the extent that the Framers believed.
  The CHAIRMAN. Good. We both admit, you looking at the Fram-
ers and me looking at the Framers, we may come to two different
conclusions of what they meant by natural law.
  Judge THOMAS. But we also agree that the provisions that they
chose were broad provisions, that adjudicating through our history
and tradition, using our history and tradition evolve.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Let me move on. I am trying to get
through this as quickly as I can here.
  Judge, if you are confirmed, you would go about interpreting the
Constitution, prior to Tuesday I thought and now I understand,
with natural law at least playing some part, as you described it.
  Now, that still leaves me in the dark about how you would inter-
pret the broad principles of the Constitution in terms of what kind
of natural law informed our founders, and as to whether the right
of privacy protects certain family and personal decision or it
doesn't. As you point out, after all, the 14th amendment is broadly
phrased. It speaks of liberty and of due process.
  Now, the Court has used this broad language in the past, the
courts--the Supreme Court not the founders--to recognize that cer-
tain types of personal decisions about marriage, child rearing and
family are "fundamental to liberty." That is the phrase they use.
That means that government must have an extraordinary, as you
know, or compelling reason for interfering with the decisions. I am
not talking about abortion. I don't want to talk about abortion. I
will answer no questions on abortion. All right? [Laughter.]
  Now, do you agree that the right to marital and family privacy is
a fundamental liberty?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask you a second question. You have
written a great deal about the rights of individuals as opposed to
groups, that human rights, natural rights, positive law rights apply
to individuals not to groups. And in fairness to you, you have done
it almost always in the context of talking about civil rights as op-
posed to civil liberties. That doesn't mean exclusive of civil liber-
ties, but you have made your point about affirmative action, I
mean quotas and other things, through that mechanism.
  Now, am I correct in presuming that you believe that the right of
privacy and the right to make decisions about procreation extend
to single individuals as well as married couples, the right of priva-
cy?
  Judge THOMAS. The privacy, the kind of intimate privacy that we
are talking about, I think
  The CHAIRMAN. The right about specifically procreation.
                                         278

  Judge THOMAS. Yes, procreation that we are talking about, I
think the Court extended in Eisenstadt v. Baird to nonmarried in-
dividuals.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that is a very skillful answer, Judge. Judge
Souter--and I was not fully prepared when he gave me the answer.
I am now. Judge Souter waltzed away from that by pointing out it
was an equal protection case. So that I want to know from you, do
single individuals, not married couples alone, have a right of priva-
cy residing in the 14th amendment liberty clause?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the courts have never decided that, and
I don't know of a case that has decided that explicit point. Eisen-
stadt was, of course, decided as an equal protection case and

  The CHAIRMAN. Not alone, but go on.
  Judge THOMAS. My answer to you is I cannot sit here and decide
that. I don't know
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, why can't you? That case is an old case. I
know of no challenge before the Court on the use of contraceptives
by an individual. I can see no reasonable prospect there is going to
be any challenge. And, Judge, are you telling me that may come
before you? Is that the argument you are going to give me?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I am saying that I think that for a judge to
sit here without the benefit of arguments and briefs, et cetera, and
without the benefit of precedent, I don't think anyone could decide
that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, I think that is the most unartful
dodge that I have heard, but let me go on.
  Judge, I think the decision in Eisenstadt and so do, I think, most
scholars think it stands for a much broader principle beyond equal
protection. Let me read to you from Eisenstadt the majority opin-
ion. "The marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind
and a heart of its own, but an association of two individuals, each
with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of
privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married
or single"--I will stop here. The same point you make about civil
rights, individuals.
  Back to the quote. "If the right of privacy means anything, it is
the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from un-
warranted government intrusions into matters so fundamentally
affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget child.'
Many Supreme Court cases since then have been decided using the
ruling in 1972 that I have referred to, using this basic principle.
  So for the time being, let's put aside equal protection again,
Judge, and focus on the more sweeping question of the right of pri-
vacy. And I ask you again: Do you think that single people have a
right to privacy anchored in the liberty clause of the 14th amend-
ment?
  Judge THOMAS. I think my answer to that, Senator, is similar to
my previous answer, and it is this: that the Court has found such a
right of privacy to exist in Eisenstadt v. Baird, and I do not have a
quarrel with that decision.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO you don't quarrel with the quote I just read to
you?
  Judge THOMAS. I don't quarrel with the decision in Eisenstadt v.
Baird.
                                        279

  The CHAIRMAN. That is not the question I am asking you, Judge.
Do you quarrel with the quote that I read you from the majority
opinion?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't quarrel with the quote, but
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you agree with the quote? Let me ask you
that way.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, let me
  The CHAIRMAN. This is getting more like a debate than it is get-
ting information.
  Judge THOMAS. The important point that I am trying to make,
Senator, is that the case was decided on an equal protection basis.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that.
  Judge THOMAS. I do not quarrel with the value that you are dis-
cussing. I do not quarrel with the result in the case.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I am not looking for your values because I
know you are not going to impose them on us. I am not looking for
your judgment on the case as to whether it was equal protection. I
am asking you whether the principle that I read to you, which had,
in fact, been pointed to and relied upon in other cases, is a consti-
tutional principle with which you agree; which is that single people
have the same right of privacy--not equal protection, privacy--as
married people on the issue of procreation.
  Senator THURMOND. The gentleman can finish his answer.
  Judge THOMAS. I think that the Court has so found, and I agree
with that.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Now, let me ask you this: Are
there
  Senator THURMOND. HOW is the time, Senator?
  The CHAIRMAN. My time is going real well, Senator. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. HOW much time have you got?
  The CHAIRMAN. I don't have any idea. Just like you, I am looking
at that little clock.
  Senator THURMOND. Who sets this clock? Who keeps this clock?
  The CHAIRMAN. Some impartial person that works for me, Sena-
tor. [Laughter.]
  Senator THURMOND. I was afraid of that.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is what I thought.
  Now, you said that the privacy of right of married couples is fun-
damental, and as I understand it now, you told me, correct me if I
am wrong, that the privacy right of an individual on procreation is
fundamental. Is that right?
  Judge THOMAS. I think that is consistent with what I said and I
think consistent with what the Court held in Eisenstadt v. Baird.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Just so we don't have any problem
here, I think your friends think you are getting in trouble and they
would like for me to stop. So what I will do is I will stop now.
  Senator DANFORTH. NO. GO ahead. That is not fair.
  The CHAIRMAN. Chairman Danforth suggests we can go forward.
[Laughter.]
  But if we have gone over the time of a half an hour, we should
stop. If not, I would be delighted to keep going because I would like
to now talk about another phrase in the
                                         280

  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I wouldn't like to do it like
that, because when I started this hearing, I emphasized the issue of
fairness. And that is what this is. Every one of

  The CHAIRMAN. If I have gone over a half an hour, I will stop.
  Senator SIMPSON. I can assure you you have. You have gone
about 35 or 40 minutes.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. If I have gone 5 minutes over, then I
stop. Thank you very, very much, and I want to assure you there is
no plot back there, Judge, notwithstanding what my friends may
think. But thank you very much. I think I have learned a lot more
about what you think, and I want to come back--just so you know,
so there is no surprise, I am going to come back and talk about
other provisions of the Constitution which we don't understand the
exact meaning--I don't mean just "we." We, the universe of law-
yers.
  Thank you very much. I yield now to the distinguished Senator
from South Carolina. And if I have gone over any time at all, add
that time to the Senator from South Carolina's time.
  Oh, I am sorry. It has been suggested that it would be an appro-
priate time for there to be a 10-minute break. We will recess for 10
minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, welcome back.
  I want to make clear for the record I was not referring to--when
I said your supporters, I was not referring to the distinguished Sen-
ator from Missouri or anyone from the White House or your family
or you or your friends. I was referring to the intramural scuffle
that occasionally we get into here. And I want to make it further
clear there was no need for--we had agreed before we began that
we would break after two people. I wasn't suggesting, quote, you
needed a break because of the relentless questioning. That was no
part of it. It was the intramural scuffle that was going on here,
which is all intramural scuffles are ended here because there is no
problem. And as is always the case, if I went over--and apparently
I did go over--the Senator from South Carolina and/or anyone of
my colleagues on either side--I don't ever recall cutting anyone off
when they have gone 35 minutes if they were in a line of question-
ing, and I won't do it now. They can have as much time as they
want. We will break after two more for lunch, and we will move on
from there.
  I now yield to my
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I think, too, I want to clarify
that I understand that the time and the lapse or the failure to ter-
minate was totally inadvertent, and I want to state that. I under-
stand that was an error. It did occur, but it certainly wasn't any-
thing

  The CHAIRMAN. I think what happened was, remember when you
were going through your book? I turned and said, "Hold the clock."
And what happened was, this clock is not what you would call--the
Navy Department would not use it for its instrumentation pur-
poses. That is what happened. We did go over 5 minutes. We are
all squared away.
                                         281

  Senator THURMOND. 18 minutes.
  The CHAIRMAN. 18 minutes?
  Senator THURMOND. That is what I understood; 48 minutes is
what I heard; 48 minutes, that is what they said.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Senator, you can have 53 minutes if you
would like.
  Senator THURMOND. I don't care for any more. We will just cut
yours the next time. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Here we go. The Senator from South
Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, in a 1988 article in the Harvard Journal of Law
and Public Policy, you stated, and I quote, "To believe that natural
rights thinking allows for arbitrary decisionmaking would be to
misunderstand constitutional jurisprudence based on higher law."
  Now, the question is: Is it your belief that cases that come before
the Court must be interpreted according to precedent, the law, and
the Constitution?
  Judge THOMAS. That is the case, Senator. I think it is important
for any judge to recognize that when he or she is engaged in adju-
dication that you must start with the text and structure of the doc-
ument. And, of course, it is important in some of the open-ended
provisions and constitutional adjudication to look to our history
and our tradition.
  I think that the importance of doing that is not so much to re-
strain or constrain, as I said before, the development of important
rights and freedoms in our society, but rather to restrain judges so
that they do not impose their own will or their own views or their
own predispositions in the adjudication process.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, you said in your opening
statement that you benefited greatly from the efforts of certain
civil rights leaders. You further said that but for them, there
would be no road to travel. Could you generally describe how you
benefited by the efforts of certain civil rights leaders?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I speak with caution. I guess I have
spent so much time on my own biography that it may be a matter
of concern. But let me just make this point.
  There were any number of friends of mine whom I considered
when I grew up to be much, much more talented. There were indi-
viduals who had enormous ability to remember, individuals who
had tremendous capacity with numbers, and you wonder whether
or not they would have gone on and become physicists or writers or
business persons, what have you.
  But somehow, with the impediments--impediments that said you
couldn't go to a library, that you could not go to certain schools,
that you could not walk across certain parks, go into certain neigh-
borhoods, impediments that said that you could be picked up and
put on the chain gang for just standing on the corner--somehow
with all those impediments, any number of them were prevented
from moving on. Relatives, friends--my grandfather is a perfect ex-
ample. Enormously talented man.
  Unless someone removed those impediments, unless there was a
civil rights movement, not all the talent in the world would get me
here or get me actually even out of my neighborhood in Savannah.
                                         282

That is the point; that the civil rights leaders opened the doors,
that the civil rights movement opened the doors that permitted in-
dividuals like myself to then move on.

  My further point was this, and that is that when others, either
directly or indirectly, in a broad or a specific way, make the effort
to create these opportunities, then I believe that I have an obliga-
tion and I believe that others have an obligation to repay them by
taking full and complete advantage of those opportunities. As
Martin Luther King said, we have to burn the midnight oil. And I
think it is important to repay individuals, individuals with those
kinds of efforts. And I have tried to do that, and I would encourage
others to try to do that and remember those leaders and remember
what they gave for us to have these opportunities.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, I often ask potential judges
for their comments on the topic of judicial temperament. How im-
portant do you believe this quality is in a judge? And what are
your views on this topic?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is important, actually critical
for a judge to be able to listen, to be open to the arguments, to be
open to the different points of views, to look for all arguments on
all sides, to explore them in depth, not to reject any.

  I think the essence of temperament is that receptivity and that
openness, because, as I said, before the process is over, a judge has
to feel that he or she got the decision right, and there is no better
way to get it right than to allow the adversarial process to work to
its fullest, and you can do that by having the temperament and the
receptivity and the openness throughout the process, so I would say
it is critical.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, I noticed in your background
that you worked with poor and indigent clients as a student attor-
ney in the New Haven Legal Assistance Bureau, covering a broad
range of legal issues. Some bar associations have debated the ques-
tion of making pro bono representation mandatory. Aside from this
issue, what are your views as to the importance of pro bono work?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I would look at pro bono work on two
levels, first the need of the individuals. I think there are individ-
uals in our society who, for whatever reasons and a variety of rea-
sons, primarily socioeconomic reasons, cannot afford the kind of
representation that they deserve or that they need.

  I think it is important for all of us in the society to feel and to
know that our judicial system is open to everyone, and the repre-
sentation of poor or indigent individuals, I think, is critical to that,
and it says a lot about our system.

  The second point is this: I think it is important, as I indicated
earlier, for those of us who have gained so much from this society
to give back. What I was attempting to do while I was in law
school, as well as any number of friends of mine, is to take the op-
portunities, the abilities, the analytical skills, the energy that we
had as law students and to translate that into concrete help for
people who needed things, such as how to get their welfare check,
how to get a pair of shoes, how to keep from being evicted, how to
get their driver's license.

  Those are very basic things, and they may not be the sorts of
things that will change the judicial landscape, but for those indi-
                                     283

viduals it was critical and I felt a sense of satisfaction, a sense that
I was giving back when I was able to work at New Haven Legal
Assistance.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, early in your life, you per-
sonally struggled to overcome difficult circumstances. You have
prevailed over many obstacles to attain great success. As a result
of this, are there any special qualities that you believe you would
bring to the Supreme Court, if you are confirmed?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, first, with respect to the opportunities
that I have had and the help that I have gotten from other people,
and as I noted in my opening statement, there have been just
countless numbers of individuals who have helped me when I
needed help.

  I can remember, for example, wanting to take a reading course
and not having the money, and I remember someone, still to this
day, someone I don't know left $300 for me to take that reading
course in 1970 or 1971. So, the people who have helped me have
been countless. But if there is one thing that I have learned, it is
that you have to commit yourself to working hard, and you have to
understand that that alone will not do it.

   But going to the Court, the experience that I would bring is
something that I said earlier today, and that is that I feel that,
since coming from Savannah, from Pin Point, and being in various
places in the country, that my journey has not only been a journey
geographically, it has also been one demographically.

   It has been one that required me to at some point touch on virtu-
ally every aspect, every level of our country, from people who
couldn't read and write to people who were extremely literate,
from people who had no money to people who were very wealthy.
So, what I bring to this Court, I believe, is an understanding and
the ability to stand in the shoes of other people across a broad spec-
trum of this country.

   Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, the power of the judiciary is
limited by article III of the Constitution to cases and controversies.
Its jurisdiction is not unlimited, as the Court must decide disputes
between parties. Could you please describe the limitations on Fed-
eral jurisdiction and what role that would play in hearing cases
before the Court?

   Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is important for any judge to
ask that critical question, what authority do I have or what juris-
diction do I have to review this case or to adjudicate this case. I
think that is important, and that is critical in the judge being able
to restrain himself and rightfully restrain himself. I do that myself,
and in my own cases, either explicitly or implicitly, go through
that sort of analysis and self-questioning.

   Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, how would you resolve a con-
flict between your own conscience or your own sense of justice and
the clear meaning of a statutory or constitutional provision?

   Judge THOMAS. Senator, if I was unable to adjudicate a case im-
partially, I don't think that--in fact, I would consider recusing
myself from that case, and probably would or more likely would. I
think it is essential that a judge be impartial.

   With respect to my own personal views, my views have no place,
my personal views have no place in adjudication. The object of ad-

          56-270 O--93 10
                                         284

judicating a statute, or interpreting a statute, or applying a statute
is to determine the intent of this body, the intent of the legislature,
whether or not one would agree, if one were in a policy position,
with that intent or with that policy. It is the will of the legislature.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, in an effort to provide the
public with a more accurate and fair understanding of what actual-
ly occurs in the court room, the Judicial Conference has recently
authorized a 3-year program to allow photographing, recording,
and broadcasting of civil proceedings in certain Federal courts.

  As you are aware, many State courts have also permitted the use
of cameras in the court room. Of course, this situation must be
carefully balanced, to insure that the integrity of the court room is
not compromised, in an effort to provide the public with better in-
formation. Judge Thomas, could you provide us with any comments
you may have on the use of cameras in the court room?

  Judge THOMAS. Of course, Senator, at our court, we are an appel-
late court, and there isn't much activity, other than fairly intricate
and detailed oral arguments. But I would have no personal objec-
tion--of course, I can't speak for the other judges or for the
courts--to cameras being in courts, as long as they were unobtru-
sive and did not disrupt the proceedings.

  For the life of me, though, I can't imagine how someone would
spend any significant amount of time watching a program that in-
volves oral arguments in appellate cases. After they have had their
fill of three or four FERC cases, I think that they would probably
tune out.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, the concept of judicial immu-
nity is deeply imbedded in our common law heritage. Judicial im-
munity insures that judicial officers will be free to make appropri-
ate decisions, without the fear of reprisal from the parties involved
in the lawsuits. If judges are subjected to legal actions based on
their decisions, what impact would this have on the independence
of the judiciary?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that when judges engage in con-
duct that is inappropriate, the grievance process seems to work
well. Of course, we have our own Code of Judicial Conduct. I would
be concerned, if a judge is put in the position where he or she feels
that the judge could not make a decision, without fear of a lawsuit.
It is important that a judge be able to impartially and objectively
rule on cases, without the external pressures that are not relevant
to that particular case.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, some have recommended im-
posing a requirement that the losing parties in a lawsuit be respon-
sible for the legal fees of the opposing party, in an effort to reduce
frivolous lawsuits. Do you think that such a proposal would chill
the filing of meritorious lawsuits, because of the fear of such finan-
cial sanctions if a party should lose?

  Judge THOMAS. I think that one should be concerned that if a
change in the manner in which legal fees are paid would chill the
filing or the litigation in appropriate cases. I have not studied that
particular issue, but my concern would be that our system has
seemed to work well, and there may be instances in which individ-
uals may think that there have been abuses. But I would be careful
in changing the system wholesale, without understanding what the
                                        285

unintended consequences could be, and indeed having a chilling
effect on litigation in appropriate cases might well be such one un-
intended consequence.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, if you are confirmed, what
do you believe will be the most rewarding aspect of serving on our
Nation's highest court?

  Judge THOMAS. I think the reward, Senator, for being entrusted
with that great a responsibility is actually discharging that respon-
sibility in a dignified, professional and judicial or judicious way,
and to realize that you are doing all you can to preserve and pro-
tect the Constitution and the freedoms of the people in our coun-
try. I think the reward itself is in the doing of the job and doing it
right.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, international drug cartel
members have sometimes avoided prosecution as a result of the dif-
ficulty of finding the appropriate forum of prosecution. Internation-
al drug courts have been discussed as an option. Would you discuss
whether you believe our Nation's concept of due process can be rec-
onciled with other countries' principles of what constitutes due
process, if such a court was implemented?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that our notions of due process
in criminal cases is so imbedded and so important in our way of
life and important to our way of life and to us, that I would be con-
cerned if there was any diminution of our respect for those rights
and our regard for those rights in the creation of other tribunals.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, you mentioned yesterday in
your opening statement that you wished your grandparents, who
were a major influence in your life, could be here today. What do
you think your grandfather would say, and what advice would he
give you?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I used to go back home and visit him after I
was a member of the Reagan administration, and the one thing he
would always say is, "Tell that Mr. Reagan don't cut off my social
security." [Laughter.]

  Senator KENNEDY. What did you say? [Laughter.]
  Judge THOMAS. I told him I would look out for him and make
sure that didn't happen. He was a wonderful man. I can only
repeat, the last time I saw my grandfather was in the hospital, we
were visiting my grandmother, who was ill, and they both died.
They died about a month apart.
  I can remember having had a long conversation with him in the
lobby of the hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital in Savannah, and the
elevator door, he marched me to the elevator and I was waiting on
the elevator and we were talking away, and his final words to me,
because I was complaining about the difficulty of doing my job and
the criticisms and thinking about giving up, and his last words to
me, as I can remember, in 1983, February of 1983, was "Stand up
for what you believe in," and I think he would give me the same
advice.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, in a speech before the Palm
Beach Chamber of Commerce in 1988, you spoke about the imple-
mentation of civil rights legislation and its complex relationship
between Congress and the executive branch. Would you care to
                                         286

expand on this for us and include the courts in describing the roles
of the three branches of Government in the area of civil rights?

  Judge THOMAS. I think that we have an obligation in this coun-
try, and I have tried to do that in writings and speeches and efforts
to open this country up to everyone, and we have an obligation to
aggressively enforce laws that require people to not discriminate,
to enforce laws that say you can't treat a person arbitrarily, to
push for programs that say let's open up our society.

  Now, there is disagreement on how far you should go and what is
the precise approach, but there is no disagreement that we have
got to eradicate discrimination, and I think all three branches have
a role in that. I also believe that we have got to open up doors, and
there may be disagreements over that, but it has just got to
happen.

  I don't think that we can be content in this society, when the gap
between have's and have not's continues to expand, and I don't pro-
pose to have all the answers and I am sure that there will be de-
bates about how best to do that and whether or not there would be
drawbacks to a certain approach, but at bottom I do know it has
got to be done.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, would you please give us
your view of the role of antitrust today, including those antitrust
issues which you believe more seriously affect competition and the
consumer.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is important that we recognize
that, in a country such as ours, where we have an economy and a
free enterprise system that has the capacity to absorb a variety of
individuals and to allow people to participate, a small business
person like my grandfather, that it is important to keep that econo-
my open to access and open to competition, and I think that the
antitrust laws are important. I think they are important for those
individuals who do want access, and I think that they are impor-
tant for individuals who use the products of that process, from a
price standpoint, quality standpoint, and efficiency standpoint.

  Senator THURMOND. I don't have any more questions at this
time. I would like to take this opportunity to commend you for
your calmness, steadfastness, and courtesy in answering questions
of the members of this committee.

  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Judge Thomas, one of the Supreme Court's
most important roles under the Constitution is to resolve the dis-
putes between the President and the Congress about the limits of
executive power. The role of the Court has grown more independ-
ent, important in the past quarter century because we have had a
divided government for most of the last 25 years.
  The Framers of the Constitution believed that unchecked execu-
tive power is one of the greatest threats to freedom and individual
liberty. You yourself have made many strong statements in your
speeches about the need for limited government. Yet you harshly
criticized a Supreme Court in 1988, Morrison y. Olson, which
upheld the constitutionality of a statute authorizing the appoint-
ment of independent special prosecutors to investigate criminal
conduct by high officials in the executive branch.
                                         287

  The Supreme Court upheld that law by 7-1, the opinion written
by Chief Justice Rehnquist. Justice Scalia was the only dissenter,
and in a speech that same year, you condemned Chief Justice
Rehnquist's decision. You praised Justice Scalia's dissent. You said,
and I quote, "Unfortunately conservative heroes such as the Chief
Justice failed not only conservatives but all Americans in the most
important case since Brown v. Board of Education. I refer, of
course"--and this is your quote. "I refer, of course, to the inde-
pendent counsel case, Morrisonv. Olson.As we have seen in recent
months, we can no longer rely on conservative figures to advance
our cause. Our hearts and minds must support conservative princi-
ples and ideas. Justice Scalia's remarkable dissent in the Supreme
Court points the way toward those principles and ideas."

  Now, that is a very strong statement opposing the validity of in-
dependent special prosecutors. But no branch of the Government
should be trusted to investigate itself. Independent prosecutors are
sometimes needed to ensure that high executive branch officials do
not violate the law. We all remember Watergate. The Justice De-
partment voluntarily appointed Archibald Cox as a special prosecu-
tor. Mr. Cox began to do his job too well, fired by President Nixon
in the Saturday Night Massacre.

  So Congress enacted legislation authorizing the courts to appoint
independent special prosecutors to prevent that from ever happen-
ing again.

  Now, the Iran-Contra scandal could never have been fully inves-
tigated and the wrongdoers brought to justice without the appoint-
ment of the special prosecutor. And if the circumstances warrant
it, a special prosecutor should be available to investigate the sav-
ings and loan scandal. Yet you say that special prosecutors are un-
constitutional. Why?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't think that my point of departure was that
it was unconstitutional, although I disagreed and argued that the
Scalia opinion was the better approach.

  Let me make a couple of points. I discussed that with Senator
Biden earlier. My concern was this: I

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I am not interested in so much Scalia's
rationale in terms of the natural law. I was here during your re-
sponse. I am taking a different approach, and that is with regards
to the decision, only one dissent on the issue of the constitutional-
ity of the special prosecutor. And in that one dissent, in which Jus-
tice Scalia developed his opposition to the strong majority opinion,
he expressed his view that it was not constitutional.

   Now, why shouldn't we have the capability when there is the
wrongdoing in the executive branch? Why isn't it important that
we maintain the majority's opinion in that special prosecutor case?

  Judge THOMAS. I think that is a fair question. The point that I
was trying to make there was not that there shouldn't be a way to
aggressively investigate and determine wrongdoing. I agree with
that. I think that is very important. That is the way you keep gov-
ernment honest. And I think you find ways to sustain people's
belief in Government by making sure that it is honest.

   The point that I was trying to make there was that when you
have an individual that--the way that our Government has pro-
tected the individual is the tension between the branches, that you
                                          288

have three branches, none really dominating the other; and that
when you have one member or one individual that is not directly
accountable to either, then the consequence could be--and I
thought in this case, again speaking broadly--the consequence was
that individual rights were at stake, the individual rights of an in-
dividual who is investigated, not responding to Congress or re-
sponding to the Executive, but to a person who was not responding
to either.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, all of the rights and protections of the
Constitution are still there even under the special prosecutor. All
of the other kinds of protections of the Constitution are there. This
is basically a question about whether, as the Founding Fathers
pointed out, spelled out very clearly, article II, section 2, permits
Congress to vest appointments of such inferior officers, as they
think proper, in the courts of law. We have seen both in Water-
gate, potentially in the whole savings and loan scandal--no one is
prejudging that at this time, but there may very well be those
within the executive department that ought to be subject to that
particular kind of process and procedure. And all of the constitu-
tional rights and liberties are still retained by those that are going
to be found by the special prosecutor to be subject to prosecution.
So why aren't those rights and protections sufficient?

  Judge THOMAS. I agree with you that where there is wrongdoing,
it should be ferreted out aggressively.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, how are you going to do that in the ex-
ecutive branch if they have the responsibility of investigations?

  Judge THOMAS. The point that I was making was very simply
this: that it wasn't that it should not be determined or that wrong-
doing should not be ferreted out, nor did I indicate that perhaps
there could not be--that the executive could necessarily totally
oversee itself. I don't think that was my point.

  My point was that the individual, when an independent body was
involved in the investigation and conducted the investigation, that
there wasn't that responsiveness directly to either one of the three
branches, and that that concern led to a view that an individual--
that that lack of accountability could actually undermine the indi-
vidual freedom of the person who is being investigated. That was
the totality of that point. And that is, I think, an important point,
and it was one that I made in the context of a speech about individ-
ual freedoms.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, the Attorney General can remove a
court-appointed special prosecutor for cause. Isn't that enough pro-
tection?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, again, that may be--the Court found it to
be enough, and I would assume that case stands decided, that that
is enough in order to--from a standpoint of constitutional law that
is enough protection in a legal sense. But my point was just
simply--and I think the Court also found that none had been re-
moved or that that had not been used. But my point was not so
much the legal analysis per se, but rather what the effect of a
ruling that allowed a person to investigate someone who is not re-
sponsive to either of the branches of the Government.
                                         289

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, do you feel now that as a matter of law
that there is the special prosecutor process and procedure decided
by the Supreme Court overwhelmingly is the law of the land?

  Judge THOMAS. That is right. I agree with that, Senator. I think
it is. It is a decided case. I was simply expressing, from a point of
view as a member of the executive, my disagreements with it.

  Senator KENNEDY. Let me, if I could, go back to a case that was
discussed earlier, the Johnson v. Santa Clara Transportation. Just
quickly to go over the facts, this is a leading case in the rights of
women to be free from job discrimination in the 1986 the Supreme
Court decision in Johnson v. Santa Clara agency. In that case, a
male worker challenged the promotion of a woman to the job of
road dispatcher. She was the first woman ever to hold that kind of
job in the county. In fact, she was the only woman to hold any of
the 238 skilled positions in the agency.

  The county was making a voluntary effort to bring qualified
women into these positions, and the woman had experience compa-
rable to the men who had applied for the job, and she had been
rated qualified by the county. She had scored 73 out of 100 in her
subjective oral interview. The man had scored 75 on the oral inter-
view. But the employer said that the different scores were not sig-
nificant. There were actually seven, as I understand it, employees
that met the qualification standard which had been established.

  The man took the agency to court saying he had been the victim
of sex discrimination. The woman had had more than ample expe-
rience on the job. She was found qualified for the job. She ranked
only two points below the man on a subjective interview, according
to the agency. She had demonstrated that she was qualified. In
fact, she was a pioneer, willing to be the first and only woman on
road maintenance crews in the county.

   How could you conclude that she was not qualified to receive the
job?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the point that I was trying to make was
this--and I think I alluded to it earlier--that when you have a
statute that seems to be clear that there should be no discrimina-
tion and it doesn't prefer or it doesn't deter any particular group or
individual, and you do something that seems not to comport with
that language, there is a problem. I for one agree that, and I cer-
tainly did it in my job at EEOC, that there are ways and it is im-
portant to include minorities, women, and individuals with disabil-
ities in the work force and to aggressively do so. And I am proud of
that record.

   But there is this value in the statute that does not--that makes
discrimination wrong on any basis, whether you want to do good or
you want to do bad. And I think it is important to recognize that.
Now, that can be changed; that can be altered; that can be adjusted
perhaps. But that value is in the statute, and it was that move-
ment away from that that I was criticizing.

   Senator KENNEDY. The movement away is effectively two points,
and this was on the basis of a subjective interview. That was only
part of what the agency looked at. The record shows that one of
the officials who interviewed her had previously refused to issue
coveralls when she worked on the road crew until she had ruined
her clothes and filed a grievance, although he did issue coveralls to
                                             290

male workers. The second member of the three-person interview
panel had described her as a rabble-rousing, skirt-wearing person.
So two of the three officials who participated in the interview had
clearly displayed a bias against her. She endured that discrimina-
tion as a road maintenance worker, and her employer found that
she was among the best qualified to be the road dispatcher. And
yet you would hold that the law bars that employer's decision.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, it is clear that if the hiring process is
discriminatory that she has a direct claim; that is, she can argue
that the individuals who interviewed her engaged in discriminatory
conduct. And I would clearly be in favor of actions such as that.
That is my point.

  The question in this case wasn't that there was discrimination in
the application process or in the employment process with respect
to the woman in the case. The question was whether or not the
man who was rated higher in that process, again without challenge
to the selection process, the question was whether or not he was
discriminated against because of his gender, because at the end of
the process he was rated most qualified.

  Now, let's turn it around. If at the end of the process the woman
had been rated most qualified and the man was not re; A as quali-
fied, and the man was hired and the woman brought a sex discrim-
ination charge, what the agency would have to do is process a
charge indicating that there was gender discrimination against the
woman.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, the fact remains that seven individuals
were qualified, according to the scores. So the employer made the
selection that they had 238 individuals that are serving in these po-
sitions and not a single woman. There are seven in the pool that
the employer says are qualified, voluntarily selects this individual
who only scored two points lower than the one who brought the
case on a subjective test where two of the individuals clearly ex-
pressed some bias against that individual. And you are suggesting,
well, they are going to have to--the employer is going to have to
state that they have some kind of a plan of discrimination in the
past. If any employer were to make that kind of finding or judg-
ment based upon the past, they would be subject to a good deal of
liability, wouldn't they?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, they should be if they were discriminating.
  Senator KENNEDY. All right. Well, how are you going to encour-
age people, how are you going to encourage any of those employ-
ers? How are you going to encourage employers such as the Santa
Clara County who said that we have got 238 executive positions, all
men. We have this one woman who has been a real pioneer in
terms of striking down the stereotyped jobs and is able to perform
that. The employer says qualified to perform it. And a clear kind of
bias in terms of the subjective test, expressions, refusing to provide
the coveralls and the other statements about it. And you are pre-
pared to say to us now that you would continue to deny that
woman who has been found qualified by the employer of that par-
ticular job.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, let me answer it this way, Senator. The
problem that has to be confronted is that the statute does not make
that distinction.
                                             291

  Now, with respect to the underlying concern that you have in
the treatment of individuals in our society based on gender or race,
I think that many of these exclusions, many of the problems that
we have are abhorrent. And I have said so on the record, and I
have conducted myself consistent with that. I believe that one way
to address some of these concerns where there does not seem to be
an effort to include minorities and women is something that you
and I have discussed in the past, and I still think--I thought as
Chairman of EEOC--I won't comment on legislation as a judge.
But one of the major weaknesses in that statute is that there are
no real deterrents. There is no real damage. All you have to do if
you discriminate against someone is to give that person the job he
or she would have had or the back pay involved.

  I was convinced as Chairman of EEOC that if there was real
teeth in that statute, that would more than encourage employers to
do the right thing.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, of course, the Court decided 6-3 that it
was consistent with the statute.

  Now, you have expressed your opinion about the hiring of a
woman. Wasn't the county just opening its doors to a woman whom
it felt to be qualified in attempting to provide some degree of diver-
sity in its institution, like Yale was in its institution? Why isn't it
the same?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have looked at that hiring process in
this case. There is an explicit statute on its face that says here is
how it is supposed to occur. I agree with the notion of diversity. I
am a strong supporter of including people who have been excluded.
Yale went about it in a way where it looked all over the country. It
looked for people to include in its class, individuals it felt were
qualified from among a number of qualified individuals. It made
the decision that certain minorities were qualified, as it did with
respect to certain whites. And it found that individuals, including
myself, were qualified. We were not talking about two people com-
peting for one job. We were talking about an educational institu-
tion that was very subjective in its selection process.

   Senator KENNEDY. Well, of course, educational institutions have
to conform as well under title VI.

   Judge THOMAS. They have to conform, Senator, but we are not,
again, talking--there is nondiscrimination. It gives you what the
selection process is.

   Senator KENNEDY. YOU don't see any similarity with what Santa
Clara is trying to do in terms of providing some degree of diversity
and what Yale was attempting to do

   Judge THOMAS. I do, Senator. That is the point I am trying to
make; that the problem that I have wasn't in what Santa Clara
was trying to do. The problem is that you have got a statute that
provides for a fairly neutral principle, and that is that you cannot
discriminate based on race or sex or national origin.

   Senator KENNEDY. Before winding up on that, that decision was 6
to 3; was it not?

   Judge THOMAS. I believe it was, Senator.
   Senator KENNEDY. YOU were an official of EEOC at that time,
you were part of the administration, and yet you recommended to
courts, though your speeches recommended that lower courts
                                        292

follow the Scalia decision, did you not? You said, "Let me commend
to you Justice Scalia's dissent, which I hope will provide guidance
to lower courts." Weren't you inviting lower courts to find ways to
disregard the majority ruling in that case in a way that would
make it even harder than it already is for women to prevail
against sex discrimination on the job and achieve equal opportuni-
ty?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that, in using the word "guid-
ance," I suggested what we do in our job now, and I think most any
judges do, is we look at the opposite side of the argument. But let
me make a point with respect

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, the majority is 6 to 3, that is the law of
the land, and if the Cato Institute--you used those words, "Let me
commend to you Justice Scalia's dissent, which I hope will provide
guidance for lower courts." Now, you are an executive official. Why
are you recommending that they follow the dissent in that case,
when the 6-to-3 majority says that is the law of the land?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that if I wanted to say follow
that, I would have said it, and I don't think that any of us is suffi-
ciently off our rockers to say that dissenting opinions are control-
ling. In fact, in my confirmation before my second term at EEOC, I
indicated just that point to you.

  But the point that I am making is that, even as I had my own
concerns, we used that precise case, Johnson v. Santa Clara, in our
development of rules for affirmative action in the Federal Govern-
ment and we refer to Johnson explicitly for affirmative action in
the Federal Government.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, hopefully, since it is the law of the
land

  Judge THOMAS. It is the law of the land and that is the point I
am making.

  Senator KENNEDY. But your language will, I believe, state, at
least, your position to the Cato Institute.

  Let me go into a different area. I noted with interest that you
were asked by Senator Simon yesterday about the constitutional
issues involved in a case on freedom of religion and the so-called
Lemon test used by the Supreme Court to decide cases involving
the separation of church and state, and you answered, "I have no
personal disagreement with the test," and you repeated that view
this morning in response to a question from Senator Kohl. You
said, as I recall, that you have no quarrel with the Lemon test.

  Now, as a matter of fact, the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear
a particular case this fall on that issue, the Lee v. Weisman case.
The Supreme Court has been called upon to consider its earlier de-
cisions, and the Justice Department has already filed a brief in
that case calling for the Supreme Court to abandon the constitu-
tional test it has been using, the Lemon test. I have the brief here:
"The case offers the Court the opportunity to replace the Lemon
test with the more general principle implicit in the traditions
relied upon in Marsh and explicit in the history of the establish-
ment clause."

  So, if you are confirmed as Justice, you will be sitting on that
case this fall as a member of the Court. Yet, you did not hesitate
yesterday and today to tell us that you have no personal disagree-
                                         293

ment with the Lemon test now being used by the Supreme Court.
My question is, do you have any personal disagreement with the
test used by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wadeto decide the cases
on abortion? That test requires the State to have a compelling
State interest, if it is to justify an infringement on a woman's right
to choose an abortion.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, without commenting on Roe v. Wade, I
think I have indicated here today and yesterday that there is a pri-
vacy interest in the Constitution, in the liberty component of the
due process clause, and that marital privacy is a fundamental
right, and marital privacy then can only be impinged on or only be
regulated if there is a compelling State interest. That is the analy-
sis that was used in Roe v. Wade, you are correct.

  I would not apply the analysis to that case or can't do it in this
setting, and I have declined from doing that in this setting, the
analysis separate from that case, if that is the test, the compelling
interest test. I don't have a problem with that particular separate
analysis separate and apart from that case, but I think it is inap-
propriate for me to sit here as a judge and to say that I think that
should be used in a case that could come before the Court, for the
reasons that I have stated previously.

  Senator KENNEDY. Judge, you have indicated a willingness to
comment on the constitutional cases affecting the establishment
clause, the test which you would be willing and do support under
the Lemon case. I am not asking you how you would rule in Roe v.
Wade.All I am asking you is, since you have been willing to state
your agreement with the current test in the Lemon case and you
will be sitting on the Court in October on that case, if confirmed,
and you have been willing to express your opinion here on the test
that is used in terms of the establishment clause.

  My question is, without getting into the outcome of Roe, whether
you have any problem in the test, the compelling State interest
test.

  Judge THOMAS. What I have said, Senator, is that the Lemon test
I had no quarrel with, but the Court has had difficulty in its appli-
cation. I think that was my complete statement.

  With respect to the compelling interest test in the application of
that to fundamental rights, fundamental privacy rights, I have said
that I have no problem with that, so I have said that the compel-
ling interest test I have no problems with. I said that yesterday, I
believe, with Senator DeConcini, when we were talking about the
equal protection analysis. What I have said that I cannot do is now
import that and superimpose it and apply it to a specific case.

  Senator KENNEDY. I am not asking you to do that. As I under-
stand, you do not have a disagreement with the compelling interest
test, when it was applicable in the abortion standard.

  Judge THOMAS. Could you repeat the question, Senator?
  Senator KENNEDY. YOU don't have, as I understand you, you
don't have a quarrel with the compelling interest test used in Roe.
  Judge THOMAS. AS I have indicated, Senator, with respect to the
application of the compelling interest test to that
  Senator KENNEDY. I am just talking about the test. That is all I
am talking about, is the test.
                                        294

  Judge THOMAS. YOU are doing two things, and I am trying to sep-
arate them.

  Senator KENNEDY. I think I understand what you are trying to
do. [Laughter.]

  Judge THOMAS. What I am saying is that the compelling interest
test I do not quarrel with, and I do not quarrel with the application
of the compelling interest test where the right of privacy is found
to be fundamental. My point is that I cannot apply that test in the
specific instance involving the issue of abortion involved in Roe v.
Wade. That is what I am declining to do.

  Senator KENNEDY. What test are you going to apply?
  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, that is what I am trying to
remain impartial to
  Senator KENNEDY. We are just talking about the test, not what
the outcome is going to be, what the standard is that you are going
to use. We found out that the Supreme Court has applied this test.
I am not trying to make the judgment of what the outcome would
be. You have been willing to express your view about tests with
regard to another extremely important provision of the Constitu-
tion. My question again is whether you are prepared to make that
same kind of comment with regards to the application of that test
in abortion cases.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, what I think I have done is I have said
that the Lemon test, I had no quarrel with the application of the
Lemon test generally to establishment clause cases. I have said
that I had no quarrel with the application of the compelling inter-
est test to the area of privacy cases, when privacy is a fundamental
right.
  Senator KENNEDY. Including abortion?
  Judge THOMAS. And what I have done is left open, and I think
appropriately so, for the reasons that I expressed yesterday and
again this morning, is not apply that to the difficult issue of abor-
tion and the case of Roe v. Wade.I think that is important for me
to do, in order to not compromise my impartiality.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, do I understand that you may overrule
it or you may sustain it?
  Judge THOMAS. I have no agenda, Senator. I have tried to here,
as well as in my other endeavors as a judge, remain impartial, to
remain open-minded, and I am open-minded on this particular im-
portant issue.
  Senator KENNEDY. My time is up, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  We have been breaking for an hour and a half, giving us time to
go back and return calls and the rest. We have been running a
little late this morning, so we will break until 2:15.
  [Whereupon, at 12:53 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 2:15 p.m., the same day.]

                                           AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  The Chair recognizes Senator Hatch for as much time beyond 30
minutes as he thinks he needs. [Laughter.]

  Senator HATCH. I certainly appreciate that special deference and
I will probably take it.

  Judge Thomas, I think it is appropriate at this point for us on
the committee to remember a very important point, and that is
that you are a sitting Circuit Court of Appeals judge in what many
feel is the most important Circuit Court of Appeals in this country,
the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It is con-
sidered to be so important because of the wide ranging matters it
handles.

  So, you are a sitting judge on one of the Nation's highest courts,
and whatever the outcome of these hearings may be, you are still
going to be a judge for the rest of your life, for the rest of your
professional life, if you so choose to be.

  You simply do not have the freedom to answer every question as
a sitting judge, every question that every Senator might have on
this panel or might wish to be answered, and that goes for ques-
tions from both sides of the aisle, not just the other side of the
aisle.

  Now, I kind of resent the implication made several times that
you are selectively answering only those questions that suit your
political agenda. Believe me, I have many questions I would like to
ask you about your own political beliefs and your particular politi-
cal philosophy, and I would enjoy having answers to them. But I
respect your duties as a sitting judge and your responsibilities as a
nominee to our Nation's highest Court, when you say that you
don't want to impinge upon your right to sit on some of these very
important issues as they come up in the future, nor do you want
your right to sit on those issues and to hear those issues ques-
tioned. And they could be questioned, if you got into your particu-
lar points of view at this time, assuming you have them.

  So, I suggest to you, just keep answering the questions in the
very responsible manner that you have been answering them. That
is the way any good judge would answer these questions, in my
opinion.

  Now, Judge, the court on which you sit, the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, handles quite a few cases of statu-
tory construction; is that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. That is correct, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, you have sat on approximately, as I under-
stand it, 170 judging panels; am I right?
  Judge THOMAS. I think 150 or so cases I have sat on.
  Senator HATCH. More than 150 cases, and let me just ask you
this question. In your decisions, have you resorted to legislative his-
tory in construing these statutes?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I have indicated, when the statute is
ambiguous, and in an effort to discern the intent of Congress, there
have been instances in any number of cases when either myself or
another judge with whom I sat, an opinion which I signed onto re-
ferred to and included legislative history. Where relevant, it is an
important part of our interpretation of statutes from this body and
in other areas.
  Senator HATCH. Well, in your decisions, have you relied upon
natural law?
                                         296

  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator. As I indicated earlier in my prior
discussions with the Chairman, I indicated that, in adjudicating
cases, the limited role of natural law with respect to our Framers,
but beyond that the reference is to the history and tradition of our
country.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I think that is an important distinction.
  Now, when a Senator asks you, as the nominee, do you believe
the Constitution protects the woman's right to choose to terminate
her pregnancy, I believe the nominee is being asked to decide the
principal underlying issue in abortion cases, and certainly in a
number of cases that are expected to come before the Court in the
immediate future.
  Now, it is irrelevant, in my opinion, if the Senator adds, "Oh, but
don't tell me how you're going to decide a particular case." Once
you give the answer to the first question, does the Constitution pro-
tect a woman's right to choose to terminate her pregnancy, if you
give the answer to that question, you are well on your way to de-
ciding particular cases involving abortion which are certain to
come before the Supreme Court.
  Now, let's not kid ourselves, we all know that. It is, in my view,
inappropriate to keep this up. Thus far, you have been asked about
70 questions on abortion. Now, I don't know why you are being sin-
gled out, because Justice Souter was only asked 36 questions on
abortion, and that was way too many, since he hadn't decided how
he was going to vote, either.
  Now, as I heard your testimony the day before, you said that you
are basically undecided on that issue, and that you are reserving
your judgment until the time when you can listen to all the facts
and all of the issues and all of the case law and all of the other
materials pertaining to that particular issue. Am I wrong in stat-
ing it that way?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I indicated that I think it is important
that I retain an open mind and that I don't have an opinion on
that important case.
  Senator HATCH. Well, if you answered that question that I cited
at the beginning, which is probably the pivotal question, I think
questions would be raised as to whether or not you would be impar-
tial in cases that may be in front of you in the next year or so.
  I would just add that I do not recall you replying to questions
Tuesday or yesterday with the specificity that you have been
pressed with these abortion cases. One year ago this week, Justice
Souter declined to say anything about abortion. He was approved
13 to 1 in this committee, 13 to 1, and he refused to say anything
about it. I think the burden is on those who would condition your
confirmation on answering questions about abortion to tell the
American people why you are being treated any differently from
Justice Souter--70-plus questions thus far, versus 36.
  I think when you say you are going to keep an open mind, you
are undecided, you are going to look at everything and you are
going to do it in the best way you can and make a decision in the
best way you can, I think we ought to take your word for that, es-
pecially since you have a reputation for integrity and honesty. I
don't think anybody questions that.
                                             297

  So, I ask the question, why are you being treated differently from
all of these confirmable people in the past? Now, I know it cannot
be that throwaway line in a 9-page single-space speech to the Her-
itage Foundation. I don't think you should be judged by that. I
think you should be judged by your testimony here. I think that
reed is so thin, that it is invisible. But so much for that.

  I just have to say that you have been asked double the questions
of Justice Souter. What are we going to have, 64,000 questions on
abortion before we are done with this approach? You would think,
from listening what is going on here, that it was the only issue the
Supreme Court has to decide.

  I have to say I think it is a tremendous mistake to condition the
confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee on any single issue. I
have to admit, I feel very deeply about abortion, too, and I
wouldn't mind knowing, if you knew, how you would rule in ad-
vance myself. But, I am not going to ask you, because it is a contro-
versial issue, it is a difficult issue. It is one you are going to have to
hear, it is one where, if you gave your opinions now, I think you
would seriously erode any confidence anyone would have when you
are on the bench trying to make the final decision on any number
of cases that might come before you that you will fairly weigh the
arguments in that case.

  So, I think there is a time when enough is enough. Frankly, I
think you have more than adequately said you will do the very best
you can honestly to decide those issues, based upon the materials
that are brought before you when you are sitting on that Court,
and that as of the present moment you haven't an agenda and you
have not made up your mind how you will vote on those issues.
Indeed, how could you, because nobody knows what those facts are
going to be, nobody knows what the particular case is going to be,
except some of those that may be pending at the present time.
Well, enough on that.

  The subject of affirmative action came up on yesterday and
today, I have to say, and I have some questions on that, but let me
just make a few comments first.

  Affirmative action can mean different things. It can mean re-
viewing one's employment practices to eliminate discriminatory
practices. It can mean increasing an employer's outreach and re-
cruitment activities aimed at increasing the numbers of minorities
and women in the applicant pool from which all applicants will
then be considered fairly, without regard to race or gender.

   There are similar activities aimed at widening the pool of appli-
cants, and I am going to ask about those. This form of affirmative
action has widespread support in this country for it. You have
spoken and you have written about it and you have written for it,
and I am not aware of any single Member of the U.S. Senate who
opposes that position.

   Now, I believe that discrimination against anyone should be
ended and it should be remedied, and there is still much discrimi-
nation against minorities and women, and I think we should do ev-
erything we can to root that out in this society, and I favor the
kind of affirmative action that I have just described, which you
have supported in the past.
                                            298

  But there is another form of affirmative action which is highly
controversial, deeply divisive, and I have to say, wrong. By what-
ever euphemism or label used to describe or mask it, this form of
affirmative action calls for preferences on the basis of race, ethnic-
ity, and gender. Lesser qualified persons are preferred over better
qualified persons in jobs, educational admissions, and contract
awards, on the basis of race, ethnicity, and gender.

  Some argue that there is a distinction between a quota and so-
called goal and timetable, but that, in my view, is misleading and
it is of no practical meaning. It isn't the label that is objectionable,
but the practice, and the practice is unfair preference given to one
American citizen over another. It doesn't matter what one labels a
numerical requirement that causes or induces preferences. If you
are discriminated against because of it, the harm is all the same,
regardless of the "feel good" label someone else might happen to
put upon it, and the harm to the victim is the same, if the employ-
er is private or public.

  Yesterday and today, reference was made to the Johnson case.
This is a 1987 Supreme Court decision. All 238 positions in 1 job
category were held by males at this particular employer's busi-
ness--and this is an important point, this next point: There was no
finding in this case of discrimination against women by the em-
ployer. Notwithstanding the out-of-context quotes from the lower
court record that we heard today, there was no finding of discrimi-
nation.

  Under a nondiscrimination standard, Mr. Johnson would have
been selected. Among the seven qualified persons, he was recom-
mended for the job and did have a slightly higher rating than the
woman who was ultimately selected. What happened next is that
the county affirmative action office got involved and the county af-
firmative action coordinator recommended to the hiring official
that the woman be hired.

  Now, he did hire her, taking into account qualifications and af-
firmative action matters. Now, promoters of preferences, they like
to say, well, the person preferred was qualified. But, if a better
qualified person, even if ever so slightly, loses a job to someone less
qualified because race or gender counts against him or her, that is
unlawful discrimination.

  Now, I have to say it is unfair, and I think that is what basically
you have said. This preference was taken under a plan that I be-
lieve one of my colleagues yesterday described as not a "quota,"
but just an "affirmative action plan." But I stress the label, wheth-
er it is called a quota or affirmative action plan or anything, is not
the key. It is the practice of preference based on race, gender, and
other irrelevant characteristics that is the key here.

  The reason to oppose a quota is because it causes preferences, not
because the word "quota" sounds bad. So, it is not enough to say
we oppose quotas. We must oppose preferences and we have to
oppose the various means by which preferences are required,
caused, or induced.

  Now, title VII as enacted bans preference. Title VII is not a
heavy-handed interference with the private sector, as its opponents
claimed back in 1964. It is the embodiment of the principle of equal
opportunity and nondiscrimination.
                                             299

  In a 1979 decision that George Orwell could appreciate, the
Weber case, the Court construed title VII to permit preferences in
training. Now, there a white male was discriminated against. In
the Johnson case, the Court extended its creative interpretation of
title VII to hiring. Five members of the Johnson court said Weber
was wrongly decided, that it turned title VII on its head, but two of
those five adhered to stare decisis and not only let Weber stand,
they extended it.

  It is desirable to increase minorities and women in various jobs,
and that is a desirable thing and I am for that and you are for
that, but not at the price of discriminating against other hard-
working innocent persons who are not privileged people in this
country. I have to add that there have been many instances where
preferences for members of one minority group have disadvantaged
members of other minority groups and women. Preferences for
women have disadvantaged minority males as well as white males.
In an increasingly multicultural society, the preference problem is
less a black-white issue.

  The victims of preference do not have 150 groups out there lobby-
ing for them, but they do have a moral right to be free of discrimi-
nation. That moral right was codified in the statute, at long last, in
1964 for all Americans. I think it is that statute to which all judges
ought to be faithful. The victims of preference know that, however
labeled or candy-coated, preferences are unfair, they are immoral,
and they don't even have to be lawyers to understand it turns the
statute on its head.

  I don't think it is divisive to defend the principle of equal oppor-
tunity for every individual. I think it is divisive to compromise that
principle. If one wishes to require equal opportunity for all individ-
uals, regardless of race, ethnicity, and gender, our laws and Consti-
tution as written already require that. There is no need to estab-
lish a numbers requirement.

  A racial, ethnic, or gender numerical requirement, however la-
beled, is intended to be met. It is not intended merely to increase
recruitment of minorities and women into the applicant pool,
which can be required in its own right. It is intended to induce
preferences of lesser qualified over better qualified persons, in
order to reach the so-called "right numbers" in hiring and promo-
tion, educational admissions, and contract awards, and that is as
true in the private sector as in the public sector.

  Now, Judge Thomas, you criticized this kind of preferential af-
firmative action while in policy positions, so I want to explore just
for a minute forms of affirmative action and ask your position on
them while at the EEOC. These are things I agree with and I
would like your opinion, to see just where you come down.

  Judge, let me ask you this: While you were at the EEOC, how did
you feel about companies seeking referrals of applicants from orga-
nizations such as the Urban League, LULAC, the GI Forum, col-
leges and high schools with high minority enrollments, national or-
ganizations for women, black fraternities and sororities, and simi-
lar groups? How did you feel about that?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that particularly in those in-
stances in which the question is how does a company reach minori-
ty applicants, I have felt that those avenues, among others, were
                                             300

very, very helpful. You can use similar approaches in education in
which you have contact with organizations that are supportive of
minority students and who can provide access with that student to
the institution.

  I think that all of those accesses are important. Again, those are
efforts to get minorities at the door of employment and to make
that opportunity available to them.

  Senator HATCH. Good. How did you feel about employers provid-
ing briefings to the groups I mentioned on the employers' premises,
as well as plant tours, explanation of job openings and so on? Do
you have any problem with that?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think those are important. Again, the
idea is to get information, and I think some employers go so far as
to actually have programs in high school in which they mentor the
students or programs in which they actually provide summer train-
ing.

  We had one at EEOC in which we had interns who were hired
into the agency, as well as stay-in-school programs and co-op pro-
grams where we had an opportunity to take a look at the students
and to really provide them with opportunities down the road.

  Senator HATCH. I agree with that. What was your view about em-
ployers asking their minority and female employees to refer job ap-
plicants to the employer?

  Judge THOMAS. Again, it is a way to provide access to individ-
uals. It works both ways. It is a two-way street. Individuals who
might not have come to that employer or, on the other hand, the
employer may not have known of are provided access, and I think
that is, again, as important as the other avenues that we have
mentioned.

  Senator HATCH. I agree with that, too. What was your view about
employers actively recruiting at predominantly minority and
female schools, colleges, and universities?

  Judge THOMAS. Similarly, Senator, it is an opportunity for an
employer to find individuals at institutions that have trained them
and prepared them for the workforce. As you know, I have been
very supportive of efforts of that nature. There are programs that
we had--again, the co-op programs that I mentioned--at predomi-
nantly minority institutions, and the idea was to actually not only
help in preparing a student to become a part of the work force, but
also for us to conduct an interview over time. And we have been
able to get, or were able to get some very, very good employees out
of that program.

  Senator HATCH. That was one of the methods that helped you,
wasn't it?

  Judge THOMAS. It was.
  Senator HATCH. I certainly agree with it. What was your view
about an employer recruiting in schools where there were fewer
minorities or women, seeking out those fewer minorities or women
to encourage them to apply?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, I think that that is an important effort.
Again, Senator, it provides access and it provides contact.
   Senator HATCH. What was your view about employers advertis-
ing for applicants in media with a predominantly minority or
female audience?
                                         301

  Judge THOMAS. Again, Senator, when you are attempting to re-
cruit and you are looking for employees, individuals who are mi-
norities, you have to, again, look at the readership or the distribu-
tion of the media that you choose. And I think it is important. It
may not be as aggressive sometimes as I think it should be, but I
think it is very, very important.

  Senator HATCH. What is your view about employers establishing
motivation, training, and employment programs for hard-core un-
employed of all races and both genders?

  Judge THOMAS. I think it is consistent with what I have said ear-
lier, Senator. I think we have an obligation to include those indi-
viduals who have been left out of our society in our society, in the
economy, in our schools, our educational programs, et cetera. I
think that that is an important obligation and one that is certainly
discharged in part in that way.

  Senator HATCH. Did you object to employers establishing equal
opportunity offices?

  Judge THOMAS. I support that, in fact encourage it. I had felt
that those offices should actually be enhanced. They shouldn't be
afterthoughts in organizations, that they would have to be a part of
the employment decision or the promotion decisions. They would
have to be in the chain of command as opposed to a satellite office.

  Senator HATCH. SO these and other affirmative action steps can
be taken to enhance the opportunity to compete for jobs. But when
the time comes for hiring and promotion, has it been your view
that these decisions should be made without regard to race or
gender?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, that has been my view, and at EEOC we
were able to accomplish both ends. We were able to improve the
number of minorities and women in the upper ranks of the agency,
and at the same time make the decision based on the best quali-
fied. It is a record that I was particularly proud of and one that I
think exemplifies the approaches that you are talking about.

  Senator HATCH. Judge, could you explain your views about the
adequacy of the current title VII penalties for intentional discrimi-
nation?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, let me just simply restate what I have
said in the past. I think that title VII--for the kind of injury that
we are talking that title VII needs to be stronger. I have said that
in the past, and that is an important point.

  A lot is being demanded or was demanded of title VII, and as
Chairman of EEOC I felt that it was undervalued, that the damage
to individuals was being undervalued, that there should be more
damages and that there perhaps should be stronger penalties.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I agree with your comments, and I agree
with your statement. And there are many ways that we can accom-
plish the integration of minorities, women, and others into the
work force without using preferences. And your effort have been a
prime example of how to get that done, and your tenure at the
EEOC shows that. And I want to compliment you for it.

  Now, some have charged you and your statements in these hear-
ings that natural law is not an independent rule of decision in ad-
judication, that your testimony on that is inconsistent with your
                                         302

earlier writings and speeches, and that this represents a confirma-
tion conversion. Now, that is pure nonsense as I view it.

  First, if you did think that independent recurrence to natural
law in adjudication was proper, one would expect to see some evi-
dence of that in your decisions on the court upon which you now
sit, the Court of Appeals. But what your opinions show is a careful
consideration of the written law, and that is why I started off with
questions about construing statutory law. Moreover, a careful
review of your writings and your speeches reveals a recurring
theme that natural law demands limited government and limited
government demands that judges not overstep their constitutional
authority. Is that a fair comment?

  Judge THOMAS. It is a fair comment.
  Senator HATCH. In the September 9, 1991, New Republic maga-
zine, no shill for the Bush administration, reporter Jeff Rosen re-
viewed the judge's writings, and he concluded that they "show that
his views have been not only caricatured but turned on their head.
Far from being a judicial activist, Thomas has repeatedly criticized
the idea that judges should strike down laws based on their person-
al understanding of natural rights. Far from being bizarre or un-
predictable, Thomas' view of natural rights is deeply rooted in con-
stitutional history. Like many liberals, Thomas believes in natural
rights as a philosophical matter, but unlike many liberals, he does
not see natural law as an independent source of rights for judges to
discover and enforce."
  Now, I am personally delighted that this particular reporter un-
derstood your use of natural law before these hearings began. And
I think he pretty well summed it up.
  Now, you have indicated to us that natural law is enforceable as
a matter of adjudication only to the extent that natural law has
been incorporated into the constitutional or statutory provision
before you. Is that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. That is accurate, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. OK. Now, many constitutional and statutory pro-
visions do reflect or incorporate natural law and appropriately re-
strict private moral choices. For example, the 13th amendment for-
bids anyone from choosing to enslave another human being. There
is nothing novel about this.
  Similarly, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids hotels and restau-
rants from making the private moral choice to exclude black
people from being their patrons and employers from making the
private moral choice to exclude black people from jobs.
  Likewise, the Fair Housing Act restricts the rights of landlords
and realtors to make private moral choices to discriminate on the
basis of race.
  Now, Judge Thomas, I understand that it is your position that
your personal views of natural law are not independently enforcea-
ble under the liberty component of the due process clause. Is that
correct?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. What you are telling us, as I understand it, is
that your approach to the due process clause would be similar to
that taken by Justice Harlan; namely, that history and tradition
provide the substantive context to that clause.
                                         303

  Judge THOMAS. That is right, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, isn't this approach to interpretation of the
due process clause that you and Senator Biden agreed upon a tradi-
tional approach to the interpretation of the amendment? Isn't it a
traditional approach?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I believe that the approach that I have
suggested is, indeed, a traditional approach.
  Senator HATCH. I need approximately a minute, Senator Biden, if
I may.
  The CHAIRMAN. Sure. Go ahead.
  Senator HATCH. Indeed, isn't it a basic principle of constitutional
interpretation that we look to the natural law or other consider-
ation when, but only when, it aids us in understanding the written
law of the basic document?
  Judge THOMAS. I think we look to the Framers' intent. We look
to what they were attempting to do in an aid to interpret those
provisions. I think that is correct.
  Senator HATCH. SO as I understand it--and I think as anybody
who has been watching these proceedings who has listened careful-
ly would understand it--is it your position that natural law is not
an independent basis for decision, but rather it can inform our un-
derstanding of the substantive context of the document, including
history and tradition?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right, Senator. To the extent that the
Framers reduced their beliefs or their principles to the document,
it could aid in determining what the Framers thought.
  Senator HATCH. Well, so in this regard, it seems to me it is ap-
parent that you follow in the footsteps of Abraham Lincoln and
Martin Luther King, Jr., who argued that natural law informs the
Constitution. Do you agree with that?
  Judge THOMAS. I think it informs and inspires it the way that we
conduct ourselves in this country, Senator, in our political process-
es.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I agree with that, too.
  Let me just say in closing of my questioning that I don't think
that we should have a single litmus test to exclude somebody from
serving on the Court. And I frankly don't think that it is fair to
keep bombarding you with questions about abortion when you have
said you are undecided on that issue. Now, any Senator can ask
any question he or she desires to ask. But I think there is a point
where it is overdone, and in your particular case, I think you have
been singled out. And I have even heard some Senators say that
unless you answer the question the way they want you to answer
it, that they may not vote for you. Well, that is a decision that an
individual Senator has to make, but I think it is an abominable ap-
proach. Because I don't think anybody should be rejected or should
be voted against for the Supreme Court of the United States on a
single issue or a single litmus test. I just don't. And if we get to
that point where this becomes a politicization of the courts, we are
all going to lose.
  I have been very proud sitting here and listening to you, and I
just personally want to congratulate you on the good way that you
have answered everybody's questions and your demeanor and the
                                                304

approach that you have taken. I think you are doing a great job.
Just keep it up.

  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator Hatch.
  Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I would just like to make a comment before getting into another
line of inquiry. My colleague from Utah wants to know why you
are being treated differently than Judge Souter with respect to the
question of a woman's right to choose. I think it is pretty obvious
that
  Senator HATCH. Not just Justice Souter; all of the prior justices.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, all of them. You have written very
extensively and have spoken out quite extensively in this area, and
I think it warrants that inquiry. Beyond that, I think there is a
greater sense of alarm as to the direction in which the Court seems
to be moving, and I think to fail to inquire of you in that area
would be irresponsible on our part.
  But, Judge Thomas, to another area. In the past, you and I have
had disagreements over policies which you pursued at the EEOC.
But there is one area of your record at the Commission which is
particularly troubling to me, and that is your record with respect
to age discrimination, discrimination against senior citizens. Dis-
crimination against the elderly does not always receive the same
amount of attention or provoke the same degree of outrage as
racial discrimination or sexual discrimination. But employers who
dismiss or refuse to hire individuals because of age, as you know,
violate the law every bit as much as employers who discriminate
on account of race or sex.
  That is why, Judge Thomas, in reviewing your record, I was
shocked to come across a 1985 statement you made in an interview
with the ABA Banking Journal, a banking industry trade publica-
tion. In that article, you suggested that discrimination against the
elderly could be justifiable. You are quoted as saying that, "The
age discrimination issue is as complicated an economic issue as any
we confront in the equal opportunity area." You continued on, ' I
am of the opinion that there are many technical violations of the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act that, for practical or eco-
nomic reasons, make sense. Older workers cost employers more
than younger workers. Employee benefits are linked to longevity
and salary. In an economic downturn or when technology calls for
staffing changes, employers tend to eliminate the most experienced
and costly part of their work force."
  Judge Thomas, at that time, you were the chief Federal official
in charge of enforcing the law against age discrimination. Yet here
you were characterizing age discrimination as an economic issue,
and then stating that many violations of the age discrimination
law make sense.
  My question to you is: How could you, as a law enforcement offi-
cial, make a public statement which could easily be interpreted by
employers as condoning violations of that law?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, if I could have the whole quote, it would
be helpful to me so I could look at the context. But let me say this:
I have never condoned violations of the Age Discrimination in Em-
                                         305

ployment Act. In fact, just the opposite. The act itself has made
some very difficult decisions.

  For example, in the mid-1980's, the act itself covered the ages
from 40 to 65 and then from 40 to 70--actually earlier than that.
From 40 to 70, then uncapped during the 1980's. The age act also
makes clear that there can be factors other than age that could
result in those sorts of distinctions. That is in the statute. Those
aren't my decisions.

  I have not, do not, and never did condone discrimination, unlaw-
ful discrimination under the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, Judge Thomas, what concerns me is
that when the chief Federal official in charge of enforcing the age
discrimination law says that many technical violations of that law
make sense, it sends a signal. It suggests both to employers and
even to EEOC personnel that age discrimination issues are not a
high priority within the Commission.

  Weren't you concerned about sending that kind of signal? Now,
it is my understanding that you do now have a copy of the article.

  Judge THOMAS. I have a copy of the article. The point that I am
making is this: To individuals--and I don't think that I suggested
that it made sense to or condoned the violation of the act. But it
would make sense to an employer to think that, well, this approach
is OK. That is a violation of the Age Act to say that we are going
to pinpoint or focus on older workers. The important issue is not so
much for me whether or not to the individual the employer says--
the employer says we want to make the decision of downsizing our
work force. The employer says, well, that makes sense. Perhaps
what we could do is look for the highest paying jobs.

  Well, that might make sense to the employer. The problem for us
when an employer makes a decision of that nature is: Does that
violate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act? And as you re-
member, during the 1980's, during those significant downturns,
during those mergers and acquisitions, employers were making
those decisions and we were bringing a significant number, a
larger number of lawsuits to counter that. So it might have made
sense to them. The problem is that it violates the Age Act.

  Senator METZENBAUM. My point is, Judge, that you sort of indi-
cate you weren't sending a signal, but you made that statement to
the ABA Banking Journal, which, as you know, is a trade journal
for the banking industry.

  Now, would you have made that same statement if you had an
interview with the AARP's publication? Do you think you would
have said that many technical violations of the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act make sense?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, if you would look at the whole
article, the point that I was trying to make in the article--and I
haven't had a chance to review the entire article--is that we were
actually upgrading enforcement; that, indeed, this is one area that
was technically very complex; that, indeed, employers were at a
greater risk.

  Later in the article, for example--and I just had a chance to
skim it here--I say, "Under Thomas, the EEOC has changed to a
system that investigates all cases that fail conciliation." Well, that
                                         306

is actually a misstatement, but it says, " 'About 85 to 90 percent of
cases probably will go on to court,' Thomas said." That is an in-
crease in enforcement, and that is something that we did over
time.

  The article also refers to, I believe here, the automation pro-
grams that I was beginning at that time so that we could better
enforce the law.

  I have not in any place condoned a violation of the Age Discrimi-
nation in Employment Act. These efforts on the part of employers
may make sense to them. But if they are wrong, they are wrong. If
they violate the act, they violate the act.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, I guess words speak for themselves
when you say that technical violations make sense. I think that it
certainly sends a signal.

  In that same interview, after you assert that there are many
technical violations of the Federal age discrimination law which
make sense, you go on to say:

  Older workers cost employers more than younger workers. Employee benefits are
linked to longevity and salary. In an economic downturn or when technology causes
staffing changes, employers tend to eliminate the most experienced and costly part
of their workforce.

  Now, Judge, many older workers, as you well know, are really
the people who built the company. They were there for 20, 30, 40
years. They are loyal, long-term employees. Courts have consistent-
ly held that employers may not target older workers for layoffs.

  In a 1988 opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, after
examining cases that were decided well before you made your
statement, that case summarized the law in this area by stating:

  Courts have emphatically rejected business practices in which the plain intent
and effect was to eliminate older workers who had built up, through years of satis-
factory service, higher salaries than their younger counterparts.

  In view of that court decision and the law, the specifics of the
law, why would you publicly suggest that it was sensible for em-
ployers to lay off older workers because of higher salaries when the
courts had made it clear that the age discrimination law forbids
such a practice?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, let me repeat what I have said. It may
make sense to the employer, but if it is a violation of the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act, it is a violation. We at EEOC I
think pursued those cases aggressively. Just because it is logical to
them that this is an area that perhaps they could make changes, if
it is a violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,
then it should be addressed. Those cases were investigated to the
best of our ability. They were litigated, and they were pursued.

  As you remember, during that time those were difficult issues in
the downturn in the economy. And I think that we wrestled with
them in a professional and an appropriate manner. There were dif-
ferences of opinion as to how that should be best done.

  I don't think that I am saying here that it is OK, that it is ac-
ceptable, that it is fine to violate the law. The line that I am trying
to, I think, and I haven't had a chance to read the entire article, to
point out here is this: That it does perhaps make sense to the em-
ployer. But that is a violation of the Age Act.
                                         307

  Senator METZENBAUM. Did you say that at the time?
  Judge THOMAS. I did not--again, I didn't write the article, Sena-
tor. If I had the whole interview
  Senator METZENBAUM. I understand that, but the point is the ar-
ticle is quoting you, and there you are saying to the banking indus-
try that many technical violations of the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act make sense for practical or economic reasons.
You don't put any qualifier on it. You don't put any condition on
it. You don't say it is still a--that you are going to prosecute those
cases. You are sending a message that you understand that there
are some violations of the age discrimination law that make sense.
And that is of concern to senior citizens. It is a concern to many
people in this country.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, Senator, you state that I put no qualifiers
on it. The point that I am making is that, one, I did not write the
article. Perhaps I gave an interview. But at no time did I endorse
or permit or allow violations of the Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment Act. If someone were to ask me the questions, do you find
that there are violations out there? Why is it that employers are
running into violations in the new era of mergers and acquisitions?
Why are they having more violations of the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act?, then I would say, well perhaps they think it
makes sense or it makes sense to do this.
  But that is not an endorsement of a violation of the Age Discrim-
ination in Employment Act.
  Senator METZENBAUM. But, Judge, I find again you want to n^ve
away from your own statement. You didn't say what some others
might think. You are saying, "I am of the opinion." That is a
quote. "I am of the opinion that there are many technical viola-
tions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that, for prac-
tical or economic reasons, make sense." It is you who is speaking,
not somebody who is interpreting your words.
  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act requires older work-
ers to file their age bias claims with the EEOC. The Commission is
authorized to investigate the claim and, if it has merit, attempt to
work out a settlement or file a lawsuit on behalf of the older
worker. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act has a 2-year
statute of limitations, meaning that either the EEOC or the older
worker who brings the age discrimination charge to the EEOC's at-
tention must file a lawsuit within 2 years of the alleged act of
discrmination. If not, the older worker loses his or her right to seek
redress under the law.
   As you well know, unfortunately during your tenure as head of
EEOC, thousands of age bias claims sat languishing in the EEOC
for over 2 years. As a result, thousands of older workers lost their
right to bring lawsuits under the ADEA. Congress did not become
aware that there was a systemwide problem within the Commis-
sion until late January 1988. Then, as you know, Congress moved
quickly to pass special legislation in April 1988 which restored the
rights of those older workers who believed they had been discrimi-
nated against.
   As I mentioned in my opening statement, the problem of lapsed
age cases happened not once, but twice, Judge Thomas. For now,
let's focus on the first batch of lapsed cases.
                                        308

  Your agency's own internal documents show that as far back as
January 1986, Commission members, including yourself, were
aware that EEOC field offices were having trouble meeting the
statute of limitations on age discrimination cases. A January 1986
litigation memo presented to all five commissioners, including you,
stated that even though there was substantial merit to one age
case, the general counsel's office had to recommend against litiga-
tion "primarily due to statute of limitation problems."

  An April 1986 litigation memo presented to all five commission-
ers, including you, in another meritorious age case stated that,
"The statute of limitations is already operating to bar individual
claims on almost a daily basis."

  I have two questions for you, Judge Thomas. First, how could
these lapses have happened? Second, given that there were early
warning signs going back to January 1986, why did it take almost 2
years before the Commission discovered that it had a system-wide
problem which was causing thousands of older workers to lose the
chance to vindicate their rights?

  Judge THOMAS. First, Senator, with your permission, I would like
to just simply comment on to the extent that there is any question
about my view of enforcing ADEA claims from the last quote, my
point is and remains firmly that I would not tolerate nor permit
any violations of the Age Act.

  With respect to this particular problem, as you know, this was a
very difficult problem and a very difficult period for me during my
tenure. I am a lawyer, or I was a lawyer before I went on the
bench. And one of the things that I can remember early in my own
tenure as a lawyer is making that panicked midnight run to the
law office or to the attorney general's office because I thought
there was a deadline approaching. I thought that when others
heard the word statute of limitation, their reaction or that panic
set in in the exact same way.

  If I could have investigated every single one of those age charges,
I would have. That was the low point of my tenure. I said it then,
and I say it now.

  I don't have the presentation memos that you are talking about,
but let's put that in context a second. If you want to get to them in
detail, I will just do that. But let me talk generically about the
problem that we were facing in the mid-1980's.

  First of all, the initial inkling of a problem that we saw was that
when cases were presented after they had been investigated in the
field, and those cases were then sent to our headquarters, they
were sent to our general counsel's office. When those cases came
in, in any number of areas we found that there was this problem.
The problem was whether it was title VII or the Age Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act. The cases would sit in that office for
months and sometimes years.

  We immediately changed that policy. I think I changed it some-
time in the early 1980's, perhaps 1984 or 1985, so that when these
investigated cases recommending litigation came from the field of-
fices,they immediately came to the full Commission.

  As a part of that, what we noticed was that cases could, while
sitting in the general counsel's office or in the regional attorney's
office in the district offices, they could miss the statute of limita-
                                         309

tion. That was a separate problem from the one that you and I
have talked about.

  One of the things that we did was this, with respect to those
cases: The problem with respect to the lapse is separate from that.
That is an administrative problem in the field offices. It is not a
problem that comes from the period that the cases are sent to the
headquarters office, and then those cases sitting there waiting to
be attended to by an attorney. The administrative problem results
from this, or resulted from this: When I went to EEOC

  Senator METZENBAUM. Could you wind up shortly, please?
  Judge THOMAS. When I went to EEOC, there was a process--
EEOC did not investigate routinely age discrimination charges.
Myself and the other commissioners felt that they should be inves-
tigated, and we introduced a policy to do that. That took more
time.
  The second component of that is this: that the Age Act has a 2-
year statute of limitations, unlike title VII. Our first initiative
when we changed the policy, recognizing that it would take longer
to investigate the cases, was to require the district directors to
monitor their workload more closely. Some district directors, unfor-
tunately, did not do this, and unfortunately some cases missed the
statute of limitations.
  I found out about this in December 1987. I notified Congress as
soon as it returned from the Christmas break, and my staff or
EEOC's staff worked closely with your staff to develop legislation,
which was introduced and passed and enacted I believe in April.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Thomas, I just have to take issue
with you that Congress acted at your behest.
  Judge THOMAS. NO. We cooperated with you.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, you didn't oppose it. A 1988 report
by the staff of the Senate Aging Committee concluded that, "The
EEOC misled the Congress and the public on the extent to which
age discrimination charges had been permitted to exceed the stat-
ute of limitations." That is a quote.
  The report states that when it initially requested data on this
issue in September 1987, the EEOC responded that only 70 cases
had lapsed. But at that time, an internal EEOC survey revealed
that over 900 Federal age discrimination charges had lapsed the
statute of limitations. In December 1987, EEOC told the Aging
Committee that only 78 cases had lapsed, but a trade publication
reported that nearly 988 charges had exceeded the statute of limi-
tations. One month later, in January 1988, you formally advised
the Aging Committee that 900 cases had lapsed.
  Senator David Pryor, the current chairman of the Aging Com-
mittee, has stated that, "After months of fruitless attempts to
obtain additional and accurate information on this matter, the
Aging Committee issued a February 1988 subpoena to Chairman
Thomas to provide data on the lapsed charges."
  The EEOC now acknowledges that the age bias claims of over
4,000 workers lapsed due to your agency's failure to process those
claims in a timely manner. Both the Senate and the House Aging
Committees have estimated that as many as 13,000 older workers
may have lost their rights due to your agency's inaction. Congress
                                        310

was trying to find out the extent of the lapsed cases problem at
your agency.

  The Senate committee which deals with senior citizen issues was
attempting to determine whether older workers were losing their
rights. The current chairman of the committee has stated that the
committee's efforts to inform itself on this issue were being frus-
trated, and so a subpoena was issued. Ten Democrats and three Re-
publicans on the committee supported the issuance of the subpoe-
na. No member of the Aging Committee objected, and yet here is
how you characterized that subpoena in a speech prepared for de-
livery on April 7, 1988, the exact same day that the President
signed the law passed by Congress restoring the rights of older
workers. You said, "My agency will be virtually shut down by a
willful committee staffer who has succeeded in getting a Senate
committee to subpoena volumes of EEOC records. It will take
weeks of time and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not mil-
lions. Under the guise of exercising oversight functions, the staffer
seeks to implement the program of the American Association of
Retired Persons. Thus, a single unelected individual," said you,
"can disrupt civil rights enforcement all in the name of protecting
rights."

  Now, Judge Thomas, those comments were absolutely astound-
ing. Congress was trying to find out the scope of a problem that
affected thousands of senior citizens. Congress had to enact two
pieces of legislation restoring the rights of lapsed cases because the
statute of limitation that applied. We were trying to find out how
to keep it from happening again. You declare that the Aging Com-
mittee acted improperly in issuing a subpoena to determine wheth-
er or not your agency had neglected the legal rights of thousands
of older workers. You also maligned the integrity of the committee
which issued the subpoena. It was not my committee. It was Sena-
tor Pryor's committee. You suggested the committee was doing the
bidding of the American Association of Retired Persons.

  My question, Judge Thomas, is: How could you, on the very day
on which the law bailing out your agency went into effect, con-
demn so vehemently Congress' efforts to find out whether older
workers were still losing their rights as a result of your agency's
inaction?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there is quite a bit there. We received,
on a Thursday afternoon, a very detailed request from the Senate
Select Committee on Aging, then under Senator Melcher, concern-
ing very detailed information over Labor Day weekend at EEOC.
The request, which was not handled directly by myself, but by our
legislative office and our administrative people and our general
counsel, the request was for a variety of data, including charges,
those are the administrative charges that come in to EEOC, and
cases that had passed the statute of limitations.

  Our personnel separated those tasks, the requests for charges
and the requests for cases, and took those requests, assigned those
to the relevant offices. The requests for cases were assigned to the
general counsel's office. The requests for charges were assigned to
the administrative people. The document request that we respond-
ed to about the numbers that had lapsed, that had missed the stat-
                                        311

ute of limitations, was the request response from the general coun-
sel's office concerning cases, not charges.

  There was no effort ever to mislead the committee. In fact, we
attempted to have the committee clarify for us precisely what it
wanted us to respond to in such a short period, so that we could do
that quickly.

  Normally, when a request comes to EEOC, the request or the re-
questing body sits down with our staff people and we go through
the documents, we go through the requests and we determine how
to respond. In this instance, that did not occur.

  Now, with respect to learning about the mischarges, as opposed
to the cases, what we attempted to do was, as soon as I found out,
was to not only inform Congress, but to make it public. I found out
in December 1987 and reported to Congress the day Congress re-
turned for the next term in January.

  Senator METZENBAUM. My time is about to expire, but I want to
make it clear before it does, that when the lapsed age case issue
came to light, you stated that it wouldn't happen again. But as we
all know now, after Congress' corrective legislation in 1988, the
problem didn't go away, you didn't take care of it. Thousands of
age cases continued to lapse, due to your agency's failure to insure
that the claims were processed in a timely manner. We had to pass
a separate bill in October of 1990, due to the inaction of your com-
mission and, as a consequence, costing thousands of aged workers
the loss of their rights.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, we did everything, and I certainly did
my tenure, with the resources that I had, we have a very spread-
out agency, to respond to that problem. As you remember, it was a
difficult problem. If I could have investigated every one of those
cases, I would have. There were approximately 2,000 cases within
EEOC or charges within EEOC which had missed the statute
during over a 4-year period out of the approximately 50,000 or
60,000 that we receive a year, and I believe approximately 100
cases did involve actual--there was as finding of discrimination.
But even one, as I have indicated, is too many.

  We took steps to solve the problem. We automated or completed
automating the automation of the agency, so that the cases could
be more accurately tracked, that is both at headquarters and in the
field offices. We sent notices to the individuals, so that they would
know when the statute was approaching. We held managers more
accountable. We had done that before, but we redoubled our ef-
forts.

  The point was that we are trying to make an entire agency re-
spond to something that I felt strongly about and I know that you
felt strongly about. It was enormously frustrating. I did as much as
I could possibly do. I did not want a repeat of that. In fact, I never
wanted it to happen. But getting an agency to respond, a bureauc-
racy to respond is sometimes far more difficult than wanting it
done.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, sir.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                        312

  Well, there are lots of things to talk about. I do agree and I want
to say that I agree with Senator Hatch about the issue of abortion.
I don't know how many times you can ask that question and how-
ever many times it will be asked, it will be answered in the same
manner. But it is interesting to me to hear the continual response
and the continual asking of it, because I couldn't help but think,
after being on this committee for 13 years, back in 1980, Senator
Metzenbaum, who was in the majority and chairing hearings with
Judge Ruth Ginsburg, was very clear on this issue that seems to
have taken over a good deal of discussion, and that is what ques-
tions we should ask you.

  Senator Metzenbaum was saying, in connection with the Ruth
Ginsburg nomination, and he chaired that as ably as he does his
work, and talked about her statement and said:

  You don't mean that every nominee up for confirmation ought to have his or her
views explored as to what his or her positions are on all of the controversial issues
that may come before those jurisdictions, you don't actually mean that, do you?

  That was a quote of Senator Metzenbaum.
  Then he went on to say:

  Do you think the Judiciary Committee members in days of yore should have re-
fused to confirm Justice Black, who had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan and
went on to become one of the more liberal members of the bench, do you think that
they would have been doing their job right, or would the Nation have suffered or
gained, if he had not been confirmed?

  And then it was said:

  Should we then vote against her, or should we look at her and say is this a person
who has the kind of integrity, temperament, and ability that can make a good or a
great jurist? And if he or she has, then regardless of our agreement or disagreement
with his or her particular views, shouldn't we then under those circumstances send
that nomination to the floor with our recommendation?

  And I concur totally with those views of my senior colleague
from Ohio, and that is the way it works in this place.

  Senator Kennedy, I served with him and enjoy the service with
him on this committee. He said, in a hearing with regard to Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor, he said:

  It is offensive to suggest that a potential Justice of the Supreme Court must pass
some presumed test of judicial philosophy. It is even more offensive to suggest that
a potential Justice must pass the litmus test of any single issue interest group. The
disturbing tactics of division and distortion and discrimination practiced by the ex-
tremists of the new right have no place in these hearings and no place in the Na-
tion's democracy.

  Now, I just happened to think, as I looked at that, that what is
true for the new right is also true for the old left. So, that is an
interesting thing, but what it shows is that there isn't a thing we
couldn't find here in what we do of those of us on this committee,
where we haven't said one thing one time 4 years ago or 5 or 10,
and another thing last month. I have done it, and I can tell you, if
you have been in politics long enough, the wheel will come around
and kick you right in the rear-end, and that is the way it works.

  So, to put this test on you--and I think you have explained it
pretty well, but I think you maybe ought to just say, you know, I've
done some things when I was a politician that I sure wouldn't do as
a judge, and then we would understand it better. It would fit, it
would be something we could grasp, and then you wouldn't have to
                                        313

say that you were a quasi-public person or that you were in the ex-
ecutive branch. Just say you were a pretty hard-hitting politician
at one time. You worked for a President, helped get him elected. I
didn't know, did you ever do any precinct work or pack around in
that stuff?

  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. Oh, you missed something, I will tell you.
[Laughter.]
  We have all done a little of that, I think. But if you were just to
reflect, you know, that, obviously, the things you said as you dealt
with emerging thoughts and as a political person serving a Presi-
dent of your party and then part of the executive branch, I think
those things need to be very carefully segregated as to the impor-
tance.
  Unfortunately, I think it is kind of sad to see it turned into
something as if it were a confirmation conversion, when there isn't
one of us here that could pass that test. You won't pass it, either,
but it doesn't have a thing to do with our integrity or with our
honesty, and you made certain promises to this panel when you
started as to what you would do. You said you would serve with
honesty and integrity. It was a very beautiful statement and it is
already in the record.
  But we as politicians, we have learned that, when those things
happen to us, we call it a maturity in thinking that has overcome
us or evolution of mental weighing of the issues. We don't lay bad
things on it, because this is the ways it is. Facts change, things
change, people change.
  So, I think that it is very important. I would be quite hurt, if I
heard people impugning your integrity or your honesty or your
character. You handle that one a hell of a lot better than I would.
  Now, if I might get to the Select Committee on Aging. I must be
one of the last of the line. I serve on that, and let me tell you what
happened when I got on there, because I wanted to get on to see
what was going on on the Select Committee on Aging, and what
was going on with you was a vendetta by a Senator who is no
longer in the U.S. Senate and a staff that had just gone on an abso-
lute hunt. I know, because I used to show up occasionally and pop
my head in and I would say what's going on, and the staff mem-
bers just kind of stood around and kind of salivated. They said,
well, what's going on, boy, we're going to get into the EEOC.
  It was very curious to me that everything that has been present-
ed here by the senior Senator from Ohio has all been presented
before. There is not one thing here that hasn't come up before, and
that was before you went on the bench before, because this was the
only stuff to use on you, and I won't want anybody to believe that
this is new stuff or that somehow this terrible thing that has hap-
pened is all brand new.
  You could go back and look at the record, go back and look at
the Select Committee on Aging record, and it was not at the direc-
tion of Senator Pryor that this occurred, it was at the direction of
his predecessor, and it got so bad that the members didn't even
show up any more. Now, let the record show that. Let the record
also show that, after all those months of wasting your time and
ours, nothing came of it, because you had a committee staff that
                                        314

never even understood the difference between a charge and a case
and couldn't even compute it correctly, and it was appalling to
watch.

  Along came Senator Pryor, our wonderful colleague who is back
with us now, and, I can tell you, he made some sweeping changes
in the staff of the Select Committee on Aging. There ain't anybody
left that was involved in that kind of absolute extreme activity.

  So, the exaggerations as to the charges and criticisms of your
handling of age discrimination cases before the EEOC is really,
really old laundry, and some of those exaggerations came from the
very tenacious group in the community known as the AARP. I
have dealt with them before. I had a full head of hair before I got
into it with them. [Laughter.]

  But I can tell you, they are tough. You know, whenever we do
something that affects them, they say, "Huh, don't forget, there
are 32 million of us out here." Of course, that includes the maga-
zines on dentists' stands anywhere in the country, too, of Modern
Maturity, which is a better magazine than the Smithsonian. That
is what they said. Actually, I think the distinction is that it is of
the same paper quality and print quality, but the interesting thing
is that in it the advertising is some of the sleekest gray-haired
catch you ever saw, but all the editorial comment is about how ev-
erybody over 65 is somehow underprivileged, and they lose some
credibility in that, and that is how I lost all this hair.

  So, the AARP led that charge with a Senator who was willing to
lead it, a Senator who is no longer in the Senate, and it was a bust.
It didn't go anywhere. It was an embarrassment to some. And an-
other of our colleagues who is no longer with us was the ranking
member on that committee, and if he were here, he would put all
of this stuff to bed, and that was our friend, John Heinz.

  So, I hope we won't spend too much time on that. It was brought
squarely before the Senate, and who brought it to the Senate was
you, because your predecessor surely didn't. So, every single bit of
this was presented to the U.S. Senate by you, and the Senate con-
sidered every one of these criticisms in total and rejected every
single one of them when we confirmed you previously, so I hope we
can keep that old tired issue in its proper perspective.

  I think that Senator Metzenbaum quoted a news article, if I
heard correctly, to the effect that you said that some violation of
age discrimination laws made economic sense to some employers.

  Senator METZENBAUM. It was the ABA banking magazine.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you.
  I guess the implication was that not only you understood that,
but that you also approved of that. Did that get clarified?
  Judge THOMAS. I think my final comment on that was that I in
no way endorsed any violation of the Age Discrimination in Em-
ployment Act, so I think I did say what my view of it was, and I
certainly would not have intended to do that.
  Senator SIMPSON. I don't think you ever misled this Senate Spe-
cial Committee on Aging, not from the times that I knew or my
staff was there. I was not there throughout, because I finally just
got tired of it, it was too much to--it was so feckless, so silly.
  But I don't believe that, in any sense, ever have you misled, and
I often thought that you were being blamed for the inability of the
                                         315

Aging Committee staff at that time, their failure to understand
what it was that you did or what the agency did, especially with
regard to the interchangeable use of case and charge. I think that
13,000 figure has been terribly overblown and that, of course, has
been covered rather thoroughly.

  So, I just want to make those comments with regard to the Select
Committee on Aging and its hearings on you. Do you have any-
thing to add to how you felt that came about and what the results
were as you perceived it, after you sat there patiently for many
hours, with your staff? What is your assessment of that?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I noted to Senator Metzenbaum, that
was an enormously difficult period. There were misunderstandings
about information early on. It required a redirection of an enor-
mous amount of resources in the agency, and it was a problem that
was difficult to solve and we recognized that. It was a problem that
we had to solve with limited resources, and we recognized that.

  But the point is that we took every step possible and ultimately,
with a refocusing or redoubling of our efforts in paying attention or
having the agency staff pay more attention to the statutes of limi-
tations, as well as finalizing a computer data base, not a perfect
data base, but a working computer data base. We were able not
only to track the time-sensitive age discrimination charges, but we
were also able to monitor and to send out notices to the charging
parties involved.

  Prior to that, and I will end on this note, we were unable to even
discern what we had in the agency. We could in no way tell you
what kind of problem we had or what was even there. We did not
have the data base capability. I think the recognition for us was,
and it is an important recognition, is that those time-sensitive
charges, perhaps we should have thought about tolling the statute
in some way legislatively or perhaps some other action.

  But when you attempt to fully investigate time-sensitive charges,
it requires that you do more and do it more quickly. Remember
that EEOC receives about 60,000 charges a year, and that is some-
thing that requires us to manage our work more closely, and we
attempted to do that.

  Senator SIMPSON. I have noted in recent weeks that your prede-
cessor has been very critical of you, and she speaks critically of you
in various forums, which puzzles me because, you know, all of this
happened before you got there. And I would like to enter into the
record the digest of the General Accounting Office report of April
1981 saying that the rapid charge process has overemphasized ob-
taining settlement agreements with the result that EEOC has ob-
tained negotiated settlements for some charges on which GAO be-
lieves there was no reasonable cause to believe that the charges
were true. Settlement agreements for these charges have little sub-
stance, and they distort the results of the rapid charge process by
inflating the number of settlements. I think the entire digest ought
to go in the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the entire document will be
placed in the record.

Report To The Congress

Further Improvements Needed
In EEOC Enforcement Activities

In 1976 GAC reported that the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission's manage-
ment problems were thwarting its enforcement
activit-es. Since the report. EEOC has made
many cnanges to correct its problems m han-
dling individual charges of employment dis-
crimination filed with it and in developing
and investigating self initiated charge*.
Additional steps need to be taken to help en-
sure :hat the changes are effective. For ex
ample

          EEOC needs to cease settling charges
          that are without reasonable cause be-
          cause this undermines its enforcement
          activities.
          The Congress needs to give EEOC au-
          thority to sue Sta'e and local govern
          ments.
tn October 1978 EEOC also started to assume
enforcement responsibilities transferred to it
by the President's Reorganization Plan No. 1
of 1978. Further, the Office of Management
and Budget need* to advise the President to
consolidate programs now administered by
EEOC and the Department of Labor.

COMPTROLLER GENERAL'S               FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED
REPORT TO THE CONGRESS              IN EEOC ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES

  DIGEST

  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
  has taken steps to correct most of the problems
  pointed out in a 1976 GAO report. (See p. 6.)
  However, some of EEOC's actiu.is may be thwarting
  its efforts to eliminate employment discrimination.
  (See p. 11.)

  EEOC enforces title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
  1964, which prohibits discrimination in employment
  on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or
  national origin. (See p. 1.) GAO reviewe EEOC
  procedures and practices at its headquarters and
  3 of 22 district offices. The three offices were
  "model" offices which EEOC used to test new proce-
  dures before implementing them nationally. (See
  p. 3.)

  After GAO's 1976 report, EEOC introduced the "rapid
  charge process" to resolve discrimination charges
  filed with it. This process emphasizes prompt
  charge resolution through negotiated settlements
  which are obtained in face-to-face meetings unong
  the charging party (employee), the respondent
  (employer), and EEOC staff. EEOC was settling
  about 50 percent of its charges through these
  negotiated settlements. (See p. 8.)

  However, the positive results of this process are
~ misleading-.- The r*pid charge process has over-

  emphasized obtaining settlement agreements with
  the result that EEOC has obtained negotiated
  settlements for some charges on which GAO believes
  there wa ? no reasonable cause to believe that the
  charges were true. The settlement agreements for
  these charges have little substance--\_hey normally
  provide for employers to remove information re-
  lated to the charge from the charging party's
  personnel file--and they distort the results of
  the rand charge process by inflating the number
  of settlements. (See p. 12.)

TamSt--x. Upon mma**. *w «··«

                                    HRD-81-29
                           320

Negotiated settlements of these charges also
undermine EEOC's credibility because

--charging parties and employers said they were
   pressured into settlements they disagreed with
   and

--charging parties were led to believe that,
   since the charges were resolved with settlement
   agreements, their charges had merit but EEOC
   handled them ineffectively. (See p. 17.)

GAO recommends that EEOC not obtain settlement
agreements fqr charges that, absent a settlement,
would be closed as no cause. When EEOC determines
tha^ persons have filed such charges, they should
be advised to withdraw them or EEOC should close
the charges with a finding of no cause. (See
p. 26.)

EEOC is required to refer employment discrimina-
tion charges filed with it to State and local
agencies that have their own employment discrimi-
nation laws. It has agreements with 65 of 91 such
agencies and refers a significant number of charges
to them, reimbursing them for some of the costs
for resolving charges. However, there are more
opportunities for EEOC to share its charge work-
load with these agencies, such as arranging with
those 26 with whom it does not have agreements,
to resolve charqes. (See p. 19.)

EEOC also needs to file suxt more timely once this
decision has been made. GAO's analyses in two of-
fices showed that EEOC averaged, more than 7 months
to file suits after informal settlement attempts
failed. However, title VII requires charging par-
ties to file suit within 90 days after receiving
a notice of right-to-sue from EEOC. EEOC should
establish similar time standards for filing suit
in Federal court for charges on which it decides
to sue, such as 90 days after the decision to
litigate, to help expedite relief. (See p. 22.)

EEOC does not have authority to litigate charges
filed under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 against a State or local government, but must
refer them to the Department of Justice. Because
of limited resources. Justice has not pursued many
of these charges. Consequently, EEOC does not
emphasize them in its enforcement activities.
                            321

Unri*r the equal pay and age discrimination acts,
EE'- can sue State and local governments. Por
coi latency with other legislation and to ensure
greater z -ention to this area, the Congress
should amend title VII to authorize EEOC to liti-
gate such charges. (See p. 23.)

EEOC has improved its system for addressing
patterns and practices of emplc/raent discrimina-
tion, referred to as "systemic discrimination."
Each district office has a systemic unit, which
is under the management control of the district
office but receives technical advice and direction
froa the headquarters systemic unit. GAO found
that, in two of four district offices, management
generally was not supportive of systemic activi-
ties because it used systemic staff to resolve
individual charges. Consequently, the systemic
program began operating slowly, and district
offices averaged only about two systemic cases
each by the end of fiscal year 1979. (See p. 32.)

EEOC's systemic program is similar to the Depart-
ment of Labor's activities to enforce Executive
Order 11P46, which prohibits employment discrimi-
nation by Federal contractors and requires them
to take affirmative action to employ minorities
and women. Consequently, EEOC either had selected
for investigation or was investigating employers
even though Labor had recently reviewed them.
JAO recommends that the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) advise the President that tha two pro-
grans should be merged to eliminate duplication.
A merger would be consistent with other consolida-
tion-changes made by President Carter under Re-
organization Plan No. 1 of 1978, which was used to
reorganize Federal enforcement programs dealing
with employment discrimination. (See p. 34.) .

GAO recommends that EEOC make other improvements
in the systemic program, such as obtaining more
complete data from employers about their employ-
ment of minorities and women and aggressively ,
monitoring employers' compliance with concilia-
tion agreements and consent decrees. (See pp. 36
and 37.)

AGENCY COMMENTS AND
GAP'S EVALUATION
EEOC disag*^ed with some of GAO's conclusions and
recommendations and stated that it was taking
actions related to others. EEOC disagreed, in
part, because it said that GAO's draft report was
not clear in its use of certain terms related to
rapid charge processing. - GAO has clarified this
in the final reoort, but believes that further
improvements are needed. (See pp. 26 and 39.)
OMB said it generally concurred with GAO's find-
ings that EEOC had made proo.eas since GAO's 1976
report. (See p. 30.) But OMB did aot agree with
GAO's recommendation to consolidate EEOC's and
Labor's programs, as well as some of GAO's recom-
mendations to solve problems identified. GAO be-
lieves its recommendations will improve the Fed-
eral equal employment opportunity program. (See
p. 39.)

  Senator SIMPSON. Then if I might return to this issue, because
you get into--and I talked about abortion, but let's get to privacy.
That keeps coming up because it is an attempt--and you handle it
very deftly--to simply lead you from the issues of privacy to abor-
tion. And that hasn't worked so far. It didn't work with anybody
that I have had the opportunity and the pleasure to serve on this
committee while they were presenting themselves to the Senate.
Sandra Day O'Connor, Justice Kennedy, Justice Scalia, Justice
Souter--none of them answered these questions.

  But just a quick word on privacy. You told me in a private meet-
ing earlier this year that you honestly had not made up your mind
on the terribly searing issue of abortion. I accept that statement.
And it is tough for me because I am pro-choice. I have always be-
lieved that a woman should have this choice. And it didn't come
from confirmation hearings. It came from practicing law with real
live human beings. So I have not come to that position through a
rigorous analysis of the U.S. Constitution, but through life as a
lawyer, dealing with the real live problems of real live people in
extremity, who came to me for, I hope, honest and real assistance
and that is what I tried to give; like, you know, I am going to
commit suicide if I have to carry this child to term. That is when
as a lawyer, a male lawyer, you really don't want to go much fur-
ther. At least I didn't. So at least here is what I hope is my
common sense, real life interpretation of privacy and how that
might extend to a right to abortion.

  Privacy in the west is a very extraordinary thing, perhaps not
more than any other State in the Union or place in the Union, but
in Wyoming, by God, it is the right to be left alone. And it means a
lot to people.

  This often-mentioned doctrine of family privacy protects against
legislation that interferes with certain universally respected rights.
But family privacy is not an absolute. It does have some limits.
Few things are absolute. It seems its most appropriate power is
when it protects the right of one individual without imposing in
any way on the rights of another individual.

  The Supreme Court has clearly established that a family has the
right to send their children to a private school--that is thePierce
case; that a family may decide which family members may live in
their home--we have talked about that one, East Cleveland;that
the family has the right to decide whether or not to practice con-
traception, Griswold. All in which I concur. However, that family
privacy doctrine is not absolute. A husband or wife does not have a
family privacy right or a constitutional right to batter and maul
the other one. And according to Roe v. Wade, a woman does not
have an unfettered right to abort her unborn child once the fetus
has become viable.

  Family privacy then does stop at certain barriers and boundaries
when the right of one person impinges on the right of another.

  My question to you is this: Is not the family privacy doctrine a
question of degree and not an absolute, clearly defined thing in
stone?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the courts have wrestled with defining
the contours of the right of--that important right of privacy. I
think I come from a part of the country where privacy is treated
                                         324

pretty much as the way it is treated out west; that you really value
your privacy, you learn to respect your neighbor's privacy. You
don't just ride onto someone's land without being invited, and you
certainly don't walk into someone's house, and definitely not their
bedroom, without being invited. So it is important.

  The Court, though, has wrestled with how far does this right
extend. What portions of this right are to be considered fundamen-
tal? And those contours I think over time will be defined in Su-
preme Court cases.

  Senator SIMPSON. IS it not inevitable that reasonable people
would disagree about whether a woman has a constitutional right
to abort a nonviable unborn child?

  Judge THOMAS. It is certainly an issue in the general public that
people have very strong opinions about, and as I have indicated
earlier, I can understand the depth of feelings and passions on both
sides of the argument.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, many special interest groups and many
politicians paint abortion as some black-and-white issue. And my
personal experience is that abortion is a numbingly difficult and
anguishing and ghastly issue just because it is not a black-and-
white issue. The toughest one perhaps that could ever be made by
a woman. But in my mind that is the only person that can make
that decision. I feel it very strongly, so I ought to be really zeroing
in on you more. But I am not because these other things that we
are going to see and we do see about you--integrity, honesty, char-
acter, judicial temperament--and you have got that, my friend. I
don't know who is keeping the score book, but judicial tempera-
ment, you have won the Oscar because I can see you on a bench, in
the midst of clamoring counsel--you won't get as many in the U.S.
Supreme Court, but they are there.

  So in my mind there is that decision to be made by the woman,
and I have trouble with it myself. It should not be made by legisla-
tors or judges, especially male legislators and male judges.

  I am going to ask you only one more question on that topic, and
it won't be the last one you will hear. I can assure you that.

  Do you promise--you used the word "promise' when you sat
before us first, that first day. Do you promise this committee to
consider the abortion issue as you face it on the Court with an
open and equitable and fair mind and with sympathy and compas-
sion for all who are involved in that terrible decision?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I would not only make that promise on
this important issue, not only to this committee but, if confirmed,
to the American people, and to myself. It is my solemn oath. I
cannot sit as a judge if that is not the way that I proceed on those
cases. And that is a promise that I take very deeply and under-
stand and appreciate and feel strongly about, on all cases, that I
approach them with an open mind and for the individuals involved
with an open heart.

  Senator SIMPSON. One final point. Earlier this morning Chair-
man Biden asked you about the--I think it was the 1972 Eisenstadt
case which held that a State could not prohibit a single person
from purchasing contraceptives. That holding was extended in a
1977 case of Carey v. Population Services, which struck down a New
York statute which allowed only licensed pharmacists to distribute
                                         325

contraceptives to persons over 16 and prohibited the sale of contra-
ceptives to persons under 16 except by prescription. However, I ask
you, these use-of-contraceptives cases do not imply that there is a
fundamental right somewhere of privacy for every single aspect of
sexual relations, do they?

  In other words, for example, the Court ruled in 1986 that there
was no fundamental privacy right to engage in homosexual
sodomy. I believe that was the decision. And I ask this question be-
cause I think you were hindered by a lack of time in your response,
partly because of my urging to conclude. And so I would ask you to
conclude that. I don't know that you did. I am not here to rehabili-
tate you. I didn't hear what came out.

  Did you have anything further to add on that?
  Judge THOMAS. Nothing more than this, Senator: The Supreme
Court, as I noted earlier, has wrestled in cases such as the one you
just mentioned, Bowers v. Hardwick, with the contours of the right
of privacy. And it is a difficult area, and it is one that I am sure
that the Court will be revisiting. But beyond that, I think that my
comments on the whole issue in the area of privacy have been
pretty full.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, Mr. Chairman, I will go on to a different
subject, and there is no time for that. But I did want to
  The CHAIRMAN. Take some more time, seriously.
  Senator SIMPSON. NO, no, Joe. That is fine. I will come back. I am
going on to the issue of affirmative action. I wouldn't have time.
But I did want to share with you what I found on the outside of the
Justice Department building--would you like to hear that?--up on
the wall there.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Why don't you continue on?
  Senator SIMPSON. What is that?
  Senator METZENBAUM. I like a sedative in the afternoon.
  Senator SIMPSON. YOU would like me to go on?
  Senator METZENBAUM. A sedative.
  Senator SIMPSON. Are you trapping me? You would like me to--
no, I shan't.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Continue on.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would love to hear what is on the wall.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Please, don't stop.
  Senator SIMPSON. This is over the main entrance. This is in my
35 seconds left.
  The CHAIRMAN. I don't want any graffiti.
   Senator SIMPSON. NO; it is no graffiti. I didn't put it on there, nor
did any of the committee.
   It says over the main entrance to the Justice Department at 9th
and Pennsylvania Ave. in Washington, DC, it says, "Justice is
founded in the rights bestowed by nature upon man. Liberty is
maintained in security of justice."
   Isn't that fascinating? [Laughter.]
   I just thought I would throw it in there.
   The CHAIRMAN. It is not only fascinating, but I wish more judges
believed it.
   We will recess for 10 minutes.
   [Recess.]
   The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
                                         326

  We are going to try our best, Judge, to see if we can hear from
two more Senators, and hopefully three before we finish. Again,
Judge Thomas, it is a long time for you to sit there, from 10 in the
morning, even with a break at lunch. Everyone should understand
that it is one thing to sit at a hearing on this side, where we only
have to be at the top of our form for one-half hour, and then we get
to rest. You have got to be at the top of your form the entire time,
so it is a tough job.

  Let me now yield to our colleague from Arizona, Senator DeCon-
cini, and then we will go to Senator Grassley.

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Good afternoon, Judge.
  Judge THOMAS. Good afternoon, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. I want to just finish up on yesterday's dis-
cussion of issues and complaints that have been brought to this
Senator's attention from different Hispanic groups.
  Let me first say that I have received a number of Hispanic com-
plaints about your handling of EEOC. However, I would like the
record to show and to reflect that my office was also contacted by
Fred Alvarez, who was a Hispanic Commissioner at the EEOC
during your tenure, Judge, and Mr. Alvarez indicated to us that
the EEOC, under Clarence Thomas, and these were his words--
"under Clarence Thomas' direction, we attempted to reach out and
assist Hispanics more than any other time in the EEOC's history."
I don't want the record to be left that no one person or any group
in the Hispanic community thinks you did not do a fine job, and
perhaps you did.
  My concern is that these problems have been raised to me. Yes-
terday, we touched upon them and your record as the Chairman of
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. My understand-
ing is that the EEOC is charged with the protection of the employ-
ment rights of many unrepresented groups, including blacks and
women, the elderly and the handicapped. You and I have had some
differences during your last confirmation hearing about what I per-
ceived was some callous approach or, let us say, difference of opin-
ion on how it should be approached as it was to the elderly.
  But you did answer my questions that I submitted to you and
you did so in comprehensive responses that, though I did not agree,
I must say that you laid your case out, and that is all I can ask of a
nominee, not that they have to agree with me, but that they are
prepared to give me their reasons for their decisions and then I can
ask nothing more of them.
  So, I want to make that perfectly clear, because I don't want
anyone to think that I am only concerned here with the Hispanic
issues, because Senator Metzenbaum has dealt with the elderly
issues, and I dealt with the elderly issues that I felt were necessary
during your last hearing. But I do have a couple of questions.
  Yesterday, you listed a number of examples to illustrate your at-
tempts to make the agency more accessible, including the initiation
of the 1-800 number, translating materials into Spanish, and
public service announcements. But let me get back to the National
Council of La Raza recent report on the EEOC, which I understand
has been made available to the White House prior to these hear-
ings.
                                         327

  If NLRS' figures are correct, the fact remains that, over the past
10 years, the rate of charges filed by Hispanics lag significantly
behind that of any other protected group. Now, as Chairman, do
you feel, quite frankly, if you conclude, as I do, that La Raza has
done I think an impartial job here, and maybe you disagree with
that statement, but do you feel you did everything you could to see
that Hispanic charges and claims were filed and Hispanics were
educated on the system, or do you think you could have done
more?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, first of all, let me just say that I am not
going to quibble with the numbers, because I haven t had a chance
to go back and look, but let's assume that they are accurate, and I
think that is the point you are making.

  With that assumption, I think that, on revisiting my tenure of
EEOC over the years, in the area that Senator Metzenbaum has
touched on a number of times and what you are talking about, in
retrospect and with the benefit of hindsight, the wisdom of hind-
sight, perhaps there would have been some approaches I felt that
would have worked better than others.

  I thought at the time, as Chairman of the EEOC, that I was
doing all I could. I tried to meet with organizations. I met with
MALDEF. In fact, one of the early concerns raised about the litiga-
tion and litigation not being available to individuals who didn't
have large cases, that is, EEOC was not litigating the individual
cases, if my recollection serves me right, it was an early meeting
with MALDEF. But I feel, in retrospect, that there could have been
some things that perhaps, with the benefit of hindsight, that I
would have done differently, but at that time I think I did all I
could.

  Senator DECONCINI. Well, based on that, Judge--and I appreciate
that observation, because I think that is a very honest approach. I
think we all feel in hindsight sometimes in our life we could have
done better on something that we thought we were doing pretty
well at the time, and I take that as a strength of yours.

  The information that was given to us after my questioning last
night from the White House indicates that, within the first year,
you as Chairman conducted one-on-one personal meetings with
MALDEF and with LULAC and with the National Hispanic Bar
and the Cuban-American Men & Women and the Personnel Man-
agement Association of ESLON and Los Angeles County Affirma-
tive Action.

  First I'd like to compliment you, I am glad to have that for the
record, I think it is important. My question is did you have contin-
uous meetings with these people? Did you meet any other times
with them and can you give us any background?

  Judge THOMAS. The group that I know I have attended functions,
I believe, and--again, I would have to go back and do a more thor-
ough search of my calendar, but my recollection, if it serves me
correctly, I did continue, but not in retrospect perhaps at a level
that would have been more appropriate.

   I had meetings from time to time with organizations such as
MALDEF. As I indicated, I gave speeches at some of the organiza-
tions and I would go to some of their functions. I cannot sit down
and tell you explicitly all of the meetings that I had or the routine
                                         328

meetings that I had. I worked with individuals, some of whom are
listed here, over the years in an informal basis, but not the routine
sit-down month-to-month sort of meetings.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, the reason I raise this is that if you
are confirmed and you become what is the 106th Supreme Court
Justice, you would have, in my judgment, based on your back-
ground, your educational background, your family background and
who you are, every reason to have a greater sensitivity than any-
body here. I really believe that. I would hate to see that sensitivity
not directed toward Hispanic and other minority groups. That is
why I raised this, in hopes that it might make a small impression
that some minority groups are fearful that, yes, you may stand up
for minorities that are black, and you have a record of doing that,
in my judgment, but what about us.

  I can't make you do that and I can't tell you to do that, but I can
express a deep feeling of at least Hispanics in my State and outside
of my State. I am surprised that they would not be coming forward
in support of your nomination, quite frankly, because I would think
that they would feel comfortable, and yet they don't, at least as
they have expressed to me.

  In a speech to the League of United Latin-American Citizens,
LULAC, in July 1983, you expressed concern that speaking Spanish
in the workplace appears to be a source of increasing tension in the
area of discrimination based on national origin, and you mentioned
that EEOC had received a favorable decision in a case involving a
group of women who had been fired for speaking Spanish in the
workplace. Can you elaborate at all, Judge, on the EEOC's position
under your tenure with regard to English-only policies? Did you
have any policy in the EEOC that you remember, or do you person-
ally have any?

  Judge THOMAS. We did have a policy that certainly made sure
that--yes, you can sort of flatly that the English-only policy was
inappropriate and could violate title VII. I have not had an oppor-
tunity to review that policy in preparation for these hearings. I
would certainly do that. But we did challenge employers who main-
tained English-only policies in the workplace.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU did do that?
  Judge THOMAS. We did do that.
  Senator DECONCINI. Was that your policy that you established or
the Commission policy while you were there?
  Judge THOMAS. It was the Commission policy while I was there. I
can't tell you--Senator, during my tenure, we continued to redraft
and upgrade our compliance manual sections, as well as our proce-
dures. The English-only, the national origin area was one of those
areas, so I could provide you with or have it provided to you.
  Senator DECONCINI. Would you mind doing that?
  Judge THOMAS. I would be more than happy to do that.
  Senator DECONCINI. Without too much burden, or maybe some-
body could help put it together. I realize that you have got a
lot
  Judge THOMAS. I would like to go back to one point, because
something came to mind when you mentioned sensitivity, if you
don't mind.
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, sir.
                                         329

  Judge THOMAS. When you mentioned that, it brought to mind my
trip to Pan American University in Texas, in order to deliver and
to participate in events to provide a quarter of a million dollar en-
dowment for student scholarships at Pan American University.

  What was so interesting and so warm about that and so good
about it is'that I remember the tuition per student was less than
$1,000 a year, and that a very large number of students, for the
first time who were attending college, Hispanic students, were
going to have the tuition made available to them as a result of
that.

  I thought that was important, and it is not listed here. I might
add also that I was not in the habit of keeping a running list of the
sorts or things that I did. I think that one should do them auto-
matically, rather than as a plan.

  The other university that I thought was making an important
contribution in a similar way was Native American University, D-
Q University in California, where we made a similar grant. It was
an effort, as I remember it, to reestablish some of the native Amer-
ican traditions that were being lost, and they were starting a uni-
versity in an old military facility, and I remember spending a day
with them and just how warm they were and how receptive they
were to the interest that we were showing in their efforts to devel-
op and restore and renew significant parts and important parts of
the native American culture.

  Those are just two that happened to come to mind while you and
I were talking. But it is important to me, even in my current job,
we as judges have a tendency to be isolated--and I was in the semi-
nary, so I know how isolation feels--but it is important to me to
always keep contact with the rest of the world, to talk with the
real people who are out here every day.

  One of the good things that I have seen from some of the arti-
cles--I have stopped reading the news accounts recently, and that
is not a reflection on my feelings about the first amendment, it is
just simply that when one is the object, one has to stay away
from

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU don't have to read the papers.
  Judge THOMAS. But one of the things that really made me feel
good was that the people in the building where I have spent the
last year and a half, the sorts of wonderful things that they have
said that suggest that there was some human contact between us,
but those two items that I mentioned, of course, were just items
that came to mind while you were speaking.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge Thomas, for that clarifica-
tion and expansion. One last question in this area. Would you
extend the prohibition of English-only policies in other areas, such
as education, and voting, to public service and that sort of thing?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, I don't know the answer to that. I
would be concerned that there is discrimination, and I think to the
extent that it does amount to discrimination, I think as a matter of
policy, that we should eliminate it. Again, I cannot predict how the
court cases
  Senator DECONCINI. I am not asking for a court case. I just
wonder how your feelings are about prohibiting English-only in the
area of education. Do you think there is a benefit of bilingual edu-
                                         330

cation programs? I am not talking about a substitute one, I am
talking about a bilingual one, for citizens who can't understand
always the English language and may feel that reading a long ref-
erendum doesn't give them the same access to information. What
are your feelings on that, or do you have any?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, we were sensitive to that at EEOC. I think
we went so far as to even include our brochures in Chinese, be-
cause of the significant population in San Francisco, I believe. I
think it is important that this country, as I have said before, be
accessible to everyone. I don't think that the language barrier
should prevent people or the erection of a language barrier should
prevent individuals from enjoying all the benefits of this country.
That is my sensitivity to the issue.

  Of course, I feel that way in other areas. I have said that with
respect to disabilities. You know, as I said, I had a friend in a
wheelchair, a quadriplegic, 6 inches, it may as well have been the
Berlin Wall to him. There was just no way he could get across that
curb. We have tried to make our agency accessible at EEOC, so I
think that those barriers, those unnecessary barriers could be dis-
criminatory.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU would equate English-only as simply
one of those barriers

  Judge THOMAS. One of those unnecessary barriers.
  Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. That would prevent a citizen to
have full enjoyment?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. Judge, let me turn to a question
that there has been a lot of writing on. I do this partly because I
think it is fair for you to get an opportunity to explain it. I was not
here for everybody's questioning, and if someone went into this I
apologize, although I am told that nobody has. I want to talk about
when you were head of the Office of Civil Rights at the Depart-
ment of Education in 1981 and 1982. As I remember, the issue was
not addressed during the hearings of your nomination to the circuit
court, and so I hope I am not beating anything that has already
been discussed.
  But while you were at OCR, the agency was under a court order,
as you well remember, based on the articles that have been written
in the 1970's, the so-called Adams v. Bell litigation that specified
time limits in processing complaints and taking other enforcement
actions with respect to discrimination in education. The order was
imposed, because of previous delays in a "general and calculated
default" in civil rights enforcement in education, so the court said.
  Now, while you were head of the OCR in 1982, a court hearing
was held concerning charges that the OCR was violating the court
order, and under oath you admitted to violating the court order's
requirements. Now, I understand that some of the problem in com-
plying with the time delays predates even your tenure there and
that you were not the one that entered into that agreement or con-
sent, if that is what it was called.
  However, you admitted in court that you were violating the court
order rather egregiously, and the court found that the order was
being violated in many important aspects. I think you can imagine
what the questions are, Judge Thomas. Were you defying the court
                                         331

order, because you personally disagreed with the Adams decision,
or were you trying to substitute your own judgment on the policy
of the Adams timetable? Can you give us an explanation?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, let me say that I was absolutely not defying
the court order.

  Senator DECONCINI. Explain that, would you, please?
  Judge THOMAS. And then I will explain. The court order in the
Adams case involved a consent decree in which there were fairly
rigid timeframes in which to investigate the cases that came to
OCR. The action I believe that you are mentioning started before I
became Assistant Secretary, and even the proceedings that I
became involved in and the reopening of that started before I
became an Assistant Secretary, I believe early in1981.
  OCR had never been able to meet those timeframes, and indeed
we devoted, as I remember in reviewing some of the documents, we
devoted about 95 percent of our staff at that time to attempting to
comply with the court order and were still--to the timeframes, not
the court order, the timeframes, and were unable to do that.
  When I was asked in court, are you complying with the time-
frame, I think there was a series of questions, my response wasno,
no, no, and I think ultimately the question was are you in violation
of the court order, obviously, as a result of missing the timeframes,
and my response was an honest yes, and I believe there was as
follow-up question--and I don't have the record in front of me--can
you violate the court order, with impunity, and my response was
no.
  The problem was that we were attempting, as I remember, and
that is now about 10 years ago, we were attempting to develop a
study so that we could propose new timeframes that were more
consistent with the way that we operate. Subsequent, of course, to
all of this, the order itself, the case itself was dismissed by the
court. But I can say uncategorically there that I was responding
truthfully to the question asked and was not defying the court
order, and I did everything within my power and the agency ex-
pended 95 percent of its resources to attempt to comply with that
order.
  Senator DECONCINI. Let me make it very clear, Judge, I don't
question or challenge your administrative skills, and I understand
that the case was reversed, so you turned out to be right, in the
sense that it was an unreasonable order or an impractical order.
  What troubles me about it is, when I practiced law and even
though I don't practice law now, an injunction or a court order is
pretty powerful stuff, and if you violate it, you can go to jail, if the
court so decides that they want to impose that. Also, if I disagreed
with it, as I did, particularly when I was a prosecuting attorney, I
would immediately file some sort of action to try to get relief in
another court, if I had to, whether it was a Federal court or an-
other superior court, instead of violating the court order, like it ap-
pears you said I am violating it and that is it, I can't say anything,
judge, but I am violating it.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, that certainly wasn't my attitude, Senator.
   Senator DECONCINI. NO, I understand, you have explained that,
but I believe that is how it is perceived. You have explained that
was not your attitude, and I accept that that was not your attitude.
                                         332

Why didn't you first go to the court and request that the order
either be changed or suspended, while you had a chance to come
forward with all the reasons and justifications that you now have
pointed out, which are: that you had exhausted all the capabilities
of your staff, you couldn't comply, and that your predecessor had
the same problems? Maybe you did that, but that is not in the his-
tory that I know about.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have not gone back and looked at all
the documents during my OCR days. I was represented, as the
agency was, by attorneys from the Civil Division of the Justice De-
partment, as I remember it. And the communications with the
courts were handled through those attorneys.

  I can't remember prior to this particular hearing that you were
talking about to what extent we had communications with the
Court and with the other parties. We were attempting, as I indicat-
ed to you--and perhaps we were too slow, and I had expedited a
study that was taking place prior to my going to the agency to de-
termine what the timeframe should be. I do not remember, howev-
er, to what extent we communicated our efforts to the Court.

  Again, that has been some 10 years ago.
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, I realize that, Judge Thomas. But don't
you agree that if you had anything filed or pending before the
Court, or even if you were prepared to file something you probably
should have raised it when the judge said you are violating the
court order. Rather you should have said, Yes, I am, but, your
Honor, I would like to tell you that we are preparing a suit right
now? You don't recall that there was any such action on your part,
is what you are saying? There might have been, but you don't
know.
  Judge THOMAS. I just don't know. That has been so long ago. I
did go on--I think there is further discussion in that case about
our efforts in trying to provide or to expedite the study that was in
place prior to my going to OCR.
  Senator DECONCINI. What would you do as a judge today if a
person appeared before you and you had written an order to do
something
going to
And they
come up with any plausible other litigation or other solution? How
would you treat that as a judge? How would you think about that
defendant or that person before you?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, first of all, Senator, I would hope that is
not the perception of what I did because we did everything we
could to comply with that court order. And I think ultimately what
the judge realized is that we were doing all that we could, that it
was impossible for us to comply with it.
  But if someone did come before a judge and refused to comply
with the court order, I think the judge would, of course, have to
take whatever steps he or she could with respect to
  Senator DECONCINI. TO get them to comply.
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator DECONCINI. And there were no steps taken, is that right?
  Judge THOMAS. From the court?
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes.
                                         333

  Judge THOMAS. I don't remember the outcome, but there were no
steps taken, and I think the judge understood that we were doing
all we could. That is my estimation. Again, I have not gone back
and reviewed the order.

  Senator DECONCINI. I raise it because I think it is important for
two reasons: One is I think it is important that you get to explain
your views and your actions. I really do. Secondly, Judge Thomas,
it really surprises me, but, you know, I was a young lawyer once,
and certainly I made some decisions before a court that perhaps I
wouldn't want to have to explain right now if somebody asked me.
But it is of concern to me when someone is going to be in the posi-
tion that you very likely will be in as a Supreme Court Justice,
having had a period of time even as a young green lawyer where
you did not, at least on the record there, explain the problems as
you have today and just admitted that you were violating the
court. I was fearful of saying that to a judge.

  Judge THOMAS. I was, too.
  Senator DECONCINI. I would have all kinds of reasons that I
would propound why I had to violate it. As a county attorney, I re-
member having to argue that I couldn't comply with a judge's
order, but I hopefully always did make enough of a plea to him
that he wouldn't hold me in contempt.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I can assure you, I was at that time, I
think, 33 years old, and I was scared to death. I had only been at
OCR for a very brief time, and there were a lot of decisions, very
difficult decisions to make during that period, and this was one of
the difficult, difficult problems that I inherited.
  Senator DECONCINI. What would you say, Judge Thomas, you
learned from that experience?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, with the benefit of hindsight and the ben-
efit of more years under my belt--and it is a much bigger belt
now
  Senator DECONCINI. That is true of a lot of us on this committee,
the chairman being the exception, of course.
  Judge THOMAS. I think that I would have perhaps made more ef-
forts along the lines of what you indicated and certainly made sure
it was in the record and to give fuller explanations.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge Thomas.
  Let me turn to a subject that has been touched on here, and that
is judicial activism. Over 20 years ago, the Miranda v. Arizona de-
cision defined the parameters of police conduct for interrogating
suspects in custody. I am sure you are more aware of it than I am
today, having served on the bench.
  As you know, over the years the Court has redefined various ele-
ments of the Miranda test, a redefining that many describe as
chipping away of the Miranda rule. Miranda is a preventive rule
imposed by the Court in order to enforce constitutional guarantees.
  My initial question to you on these types of issues is not your
opinion of those two rulings such as that, but rather do you believe
that it is within the Court's role to be imposing rules such as Mi-
randa or, say, the exclusionary rule? Is that, as you have quoted
before, considered judges running amuck? Have they gone too far,
in your opinion?
                                         334

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that what the Court was at-
tempting to do is to set out some guidelines to prevent, as you have
noted, constitutional violations and certainly to deter law enforce-
ment officials in the case of the exclusionary rule from benefiting
from improperly or unconstitutionally seized evidence.

  Senator DECONCINI. DO you consider that judicial activism?
  Judge THOMAS. I do not consider it judicial activism. I see it as
the Court trying to take some very pragmatic steps to prevent con-
stitutional violations.
  Senator DECONCINI. What do you think judicial activism is? Well,
before you answer that, what about the famous tax case where a
court, not the Supreme Court, imposed on a local school district to
raise the taxes? You were an assistant attorney general in Missouri
handling tax issues at one time. Would you consider that case judi-
cial activism?
  Judge THOMAS. I think there are some who certainly would. I
don't know
  Senator DECONCINI. Your good friend and mine sitting behind
you does, and I happen to agree with him.
  Judge THOMAS. I think there are some who would because of the
extent of the remedy. But I couldn't say because I have not re-
viewed that case and I haven't studied the record in that case. I
think any of us would be concerned in the area of judicial activism
when we conclude that a judge is imposing his policy decisions or
her policy decisions instead of the law.
  Senator DECONCINI. IS that your interpretation or definition of
judicial activism?
  Judge THOMAS. I think that is one such definition.
  Senator DECONCINI. Can you give me any other one? Then I will
wind up here.
  Judge THOMAS. I wish I had some off the top of my head. I just
think that when judges move away from interpreting the law and
applying the law as written or interpreting the Constitution in an
appropriate way and begins to read his or her views into those doc-
uments, I think we are venturing into an area of judicial activism.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU think, Judge, that you can refrain from
that as a Supreme Court Justice?
  Judge THOMAS. Oh, I certainly can, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Now we will go to Senator Grassley of Iowa.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, I think maybe just for the record I will go
through some of the issues with Adams v. Bell. I don't know
whether there is a necessity for you to answer any questions or
not, but just to make the record clear. I think that first of all we
need to make clear that not only has this issue been brought up at
this hearing, but it was also a basis for some special interest to find
fault and try to prevent your appointment and confirmation to the
Supreme Court.
  You took over as head of the Department of Education on July 3,
1981. You were appointed in May of 1981. The contempt motion
that is part of the discussion here was actually filed on April 21,
                                         335

1981, and, of course, that was before you were appointed and 3
months before you were sworn in. So the contempt motion was
based on somebody else's conduct since it was filed before you ar-
rived at the Education Department. That is your understanding of
that.

  Judge THOMAS. I believe that is accurate, Senator. Certainly
something that was in existence before I arrived.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Your predecessors at the Education Depart-
ment were Carter administration officials. They also had difficul-
ties meeting these timeframes. The timeframes were very unrea-
sonable. The Office of Civil Rights had 15 days to acknowledge the
complaint, 90 days to investigate it, 90 days to negotiate a settle-
ment, and 30 days to go into an enforcement, which was adminis-
trative litigation.

  If I could quote from the contempt motion which was based upon
actions or inactions of Carter administration officials, the plaintiffs
complained that enforcement under Carter appointees "demon-
strates wholesale violation by the Office of Civil Rights of the time-
frames for compliance review."

  "The plaintiffs also cited OCR's large number of very old unre-
solved complaints pending at the end of 1980." That last sentence
was also part of a quote.

  So I think it is fair to say, Judge Thomas, that you inherited in
that position a very unworkable situation, that you showed no dis-
regard or contempt for the law, that you simply admitted the truth
to the judge, the impossibility of meeting those timeframes that I
mentioned. And I guess it is a way of saying that you were being
very accurate with the judge.

  You were not held in contempt by the judge, and, of course, what
the judge directed was to go back and ask for more realistic time-
frames. And the judge let the parties come up with the timeframes.

  I don't think that there is much more to this that we need to go
into, but, Mr. Chairman, if there is a lot of concern about this, I
would very much ask--and I will leave this up to the judgment of
you as chairman, because there is no sense of printing a lot of
costly material if not. But if this is going to be in dispute, I hope
that we could put as part of the hearing record the transcript of
the hearing that has been referred to here, Judge Thomas' appear-
ance before the judge, so that the full explanation and discussion
with the judge can be reflected.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me suggest, unless anyone would like me to
do otherwise, that I will make copies of that hearing record avail-
able as part of the record, rather than have it reprinted in the
record now, unless that is the request of the witness or of you.

  Senator GRASSLEY. That is OK with me.
  Judge Thomas, moving on to another matter, I would like to
follow up on the matter of individual privacy. And as Senator
Simpson said, the right of family privacy is not absolute. There are
limits. The Supreme Court stated it best in the Bowers case: The
dimension of protected privacy will include fundamental liberties
that are either "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such as
neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed," and
are "deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition."
                                         336

  Let me simply ask you this, whether you have any objections to
this test as a method of determining the extent of protectable pri-
vate interests.

  Judge THOMAS. AS I indicated earlier in my testimony, Senator, I
think that that is an appropriate manner in adjudicating cases on
the liberty component of the due process clause of the 14th amend-
ment. Justice Harlan I think appropriately sets out a methodology
that I certainly find agreeable.

  Senator GRASSLEY. And you don't have any problems with the
Bowers decision?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, Senator, I think I have not commented on
the outcome in these important cases, and that particular case is a
recent case. It is an important case. The Court is continuing to at-
tempt to define the contours of the privacy interests, privacy pro-
tections. It is simply at this moment drawing the line with respect
to certain types of intimate relationships.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, Judge, this morning you said that you
didn't have any quarrel with the Eisenstadt case, and I don't have
any problems with that statement. And I can appreciate the fact
that the Bowers case is a very recent case. But I would like to point
out that the Bowers test was derived from Justice Cardozo's opin-
ion in the Palko case, and that dates from 1937, and from Justice
Powell's decision in the Moore case, 1977, which has been discussed.
And so I guess the Bowers decision, even though being a recent de-
cision of the Court, is based upon a lot of established precedent. So
what objections do you have with the Bowers decision based upon
my statement to you that it is not really just newly created law,
but based upon 14 years back and 50-some years back?

  Judge THOMAS. I did not certainly quarrel with the precedents
cited in that case, Senator. My point is simply that I am not ex-
pressing agreement or disagreement. My point is that I think it is
inappropriate for me to--would be inappropriate for me to com-
ment on the outcome in that case.

  There are important precedents in that case, and I would not
question those underlying precedents, the older precedents that
you are discussing, Palco and some of the others. My point is that I
think it is inappropriate for me to comment on a case, a recent
case in this very troublesome and very difficult area.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, let me think about what you said
before. I am not sure I am very happy with that. But we will have
another opportunity maybe to go into that.

  Let me continue with the subject of privacy. Like several of my
colleagues, I want to approach it a little bit differently. I would like
to talk to you about an appeals court case. You sat on an en-banc
panel on New York Times v. NASA. Although you did not write the
opinion, I think the case illustrates how the Government can recog-
nize and protect the right of privacy.

  Let me relate facts briefly. The New York Times filed a Freedom
of Information to get a copy of the black box tape from the Chal-
lengertragedy, and you know that was the shuttle blow-up. A tran-
script of the tape had been released, but the tape itself, because of
the anguish some of the astronauts expressed, had been withheld.
NASA asserted that the tape fell within exemption 6 of FOIA, and
that is personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure
                                         337

of which would constitute clearly unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy.

  The majority opinion found the tape came within exemption 6
but remanded the case to the lower courts so that it could balance
the privacy interest with the right of the public to be informed.
There was a clear split in the appeals court, and it was 6-5, and
the minority would have found the tape to be exempt and would
have allowed immediate disclosure.

  It seems to me that the majority in this case, some would say the
conservative on the court, actually had more sensitivity to the pri-
vacy issue. So I would like to have you offer us your perspective on
these competing issues, the right of privacy and the right of the
public to know.

  Judge THOMAS. That was, as you noted, Senator, an en bane case,
a very close one and a very important one, and the issue for us was
whether or not there was an exemption provided by statute for in-
formation about a person. The Supreme Court has held that per-
sonal information of that nature is not disclosable, if it would vio-
late the privacy of that individual.

  The question was whether or not this was personal information.
The transcript of the voices of the astronauts involved in the disas-
ter was made available under the Freedom of Information Act.
What had not been disclosed to the public was the voice recorda-
tion of the astronauts.

  The question became whether or not the information that was
disclosable in the record, the recordation of those voices was more
personal or different from the information, the actual transcript
that had been disclosed, and what the court essentially found is
that there was more information in the voice record of the astro-
nauts than there was in the transcripts, and that that information
was personal information and could only be disclosed after it was
balanced against the interests of the family and the interests of the
individuals involved.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Your answer is very correct, as far as that
specific case is concerned, but from your vote and your reasoning,
how do you in your own mind see the right of privacy versus the
right of the public to know, in other words, philosophically, as you
might approach some cases in the future where this is an overrid-
ing issue in the case?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, very generally, Senator, we are all con-
cerned, certainly those who are in the public arena and making
available to the public information about the operations of those
public agencies and about the officials in those agencies in their of-
ficial capacities.

  The concern in these cases, the Freedom of Information Act
cases, as I have seen them, and I think it is a general concern, is
whether or not one should disclose information that is personal to
the individuals, even if they are government officials.

  For example, should you disclose a person's personnel record or
should you disclose information that is similar to the personnel or
medical record. And if that information is a personnel or similar
record, then the question becomes what are the interests in disclos-
ing that, are there competing interests that outweigh the public's
interest in knowing what is in those records. And what the courts
                                         338

have attempted to do, and they certainly do at the trial level, is to
balance those competing interests, and certainly under the Free-
dom of Information Act, Congress has made a judgment as to what
that standard of review should be.

  Senator GRASSLEY. NOW, the reason that this case struck me is
because of my concern about the individual right to privacy and
something you wouldn't know about, but some of my involvement
is expressed in Senator Biden's Violence Against Women Act and
contains an amendment of mine expressing the sense of the Con-
gress that the name of the rape victim should be kept confidential
by the news media.

  There are parallels between I think this NASA case and the situ-
ation of rape victims. In the Challengercase, the transcript of the
tape had already been released, and the public could know and
read the last utterances of the tragic victims.

  There was a lot to be learned without the release of the tape
itself. There was a lot made public, without the release of the tape
itself. Likewise, of course, the public can learn a great deal about
the victim of a rape, without having her name disclosed by the
news media, and it seems irresponsible to me that the media would
make the victim a victim the second time by dragging her name
through the press.

  I realize that you cannot comment on protecting rape victims'
names, since there are first amendment implications and so-called
rape shield laws may come before the Supreme Court, so I think I
will leave you with my views on the subject and not ask for a re-
sponse from you.

  I would like to go on to a point dealing with the overall subject
of precedent. You have discussed this to a considerable extent even
with me. When you came to the Senate Judiciary Committee as a
nominee for the court you now sit on, you explained your obliga-
tion to follow Supreme Court precedent as an appeals court judge,
and I think sitting on that court, I believe that you have carried
out that obligation.

  In addition, you have shown appropriate deference to the find-
ings of lower courts and administrative agencies. We discussed that
some yesterday. Your opinion in the antitrust case of U.S. v.
Baker's Shoes is a good example of that deference. But on the Su-
preme Court, there are different considerations with respect to
precedent.

  For example, Justice Frankfurter wrote that precedent "is a
principle of policy, and not a mechanical formula of adherence to
the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such an
adherence involves collision with prior doctrine more embracing in
its scope, intrinsically sounder and verified by experience." That is
from way back in 1940,the Helveringcase.

  In your discussion with Senator Specter, you referred to the
length of time as being part of the evaluation of precedent, and in
your discussion with Senator Brown you referred to the develop-
ment of institutions as a result of prior precedent, and those are
your words.

  Are there any other factors which the high court should consid-
er, in deciding to overrule a prior case? And how would you weigh
or prioritize those factors that you might give me now?
                                         339

  Judge THOMAS. I certainly, Senator, could not give you a precise
calculus as to how that would be done.

  Senator GRASSLEY. NO, but just a general approach.
  Judge THOMAS. But I think, as I indicated yesterday, that when-
ever one begins to reconsider, as a judge, a prior precedent, that
one must understand that is a very serious undertaking, that it is a
matter, at least from my point of view, the burden is on that judge
to demonstrate why that precedent should be reconsidered.
  In the statutory area of law, in the case law involving statutes,
there seems to be less of an inclination on the part of judges to re-
consider or overrule cases, primarily because of the view or the
feeling that if it were wrong to begin with, then the legislature
would have corrected it, and I think that sort of underscores the
point that Senator Specter was making yesterday about revisiting
statutory interpretation cases or precedent.
  In the area of constitutional cases or constitutional law cases, at
least those cases are very, very important, but the feeling is or the
sentiment is on the part of the Court that those cases can only be
revisited in a realistic way by the judiciary, since the amendment
process is one that is very remote, as far as the possibility of occur-
ring, and that those cases are more likely to be revisited or recon-
sidered.
  Again, I don't think there is a precise calculus in approaching
those two areas. I do think that you start with the case being
wrong, one has to view that case as wrong, and I think one has to
understand and take into account the continuity in our legal
system and has to understand or I think demonstrate why this con-
tinuity should in some way be broken.
  I don't think that is necessarily an easy task, and it is certainly
one that should be considered with a high level of seriousness and
high level of concern about what the judge is doing, even if the
case is found to be wrong.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I appreciate what you said. I would say that
your approach is slightly different from that of Justice Rehnquist
in the recent Payne case, where he said that the most compelling
precedents are those which deal with property and contract rights,
and that decisions dealing with procedural or evidentiary rules
would be given less weight.
  On the other hand, some others have suggested other lines be
drawn. Justice Powell and Justice Brandeis have made a distinc-
tion between constitutional cases and cases involving interpreta-
tion of law, and I guess I would ask you to give attention to a Bran-
deis quote:

   In cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative
action is practically impossible, the Court bows to the lessons of experience and the
force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful
in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function.

  So, let me as you if you share views of Brandeis that the ap-
proach to precedent is different when the cases involve constitu-
tional interpretation.

  Judge THOMAS. I think that the underlying considerations, again,
without in any way suggesting that the cases aren't of equal, if not
in some instances greater importance, that the underlying concern
that dictates whether or not the court would revisit these more
                                         340

readily, those prior precedents more readily, the fact that changes
can't be made by the legislative body, that only the Court, if it
finds itself wrong, can make that change.

  I think that is an important consideration and it is not one cer-
tainly that I have a quarrel with, although I might add that I don't
precisely know how a judge can quantify the differences between
considering reconsideration of statutes, as opposed to constitutional
cases.

  Senator GRASSLEY. President Lincoln warned, in the context of
the Dred Scott decision, against Government policy irrevocably
fixed by the Supreme Court. He said the risk would be that the
people would cease to be their own rulers in those circumstances.
The reality is that the Supreme Court has overturned more than
260 of its decisions, and that figure is from the Congressional Re-
search Service. Of course, we never would have had the historic
Brown case, if the Court had declined to overrule the wrongly de-
cided Plessey case, and we wouldn't, of course, be carrying paper
money today, if the Court was strictly bound by precedent.

  This term, the Court has overruled five prior decisions, and one
of them sparked some discussion during these hearings, Payne v.
Tennessee. I am particularly interested in that case, because of my
work in the area of victims rights.

  Contrary to how some have characterized your testimony, I re-
viewed what you said, and I don't believe that you in any way en-
dorsed that decision, much as I would like you to state your ap-
proval of that case. But my point is that 5 decisions overturned this
term is a very modest number of decisions, when you consider the
activism of the Warren and Burger courts, 9 decisions overturned
in 1963, 10 in 1964, 9 in 1976, and 11 in 1978.

  In the closing days of last year's term, the remaining liberal
judges overturned a 1-day precedent which involved the constitu-
tionality of the Arizona death penalty. On one day, the full Court
upheld the death penalty, and the next day, in a similar case, but
one in which Justices O Connor and Kennedy had to recuse them-
selves, the Justices used their numerical advantage to strike down
the same death penalty provision.

  You know, this ought to bring to quick attention those of us or
anybody who speaks so highly of the sanctity of precedent, because
it can be a fleeting sort of thing on occasion, as well.

  The American people do not want a Justice who willy-nilly over-
rules prior cases. Stability and predictability have merit, but at the
same time I don't think that we can suffer, and I don't believe you
would allow us to suffer decisions wrongly decided.

  Let me ask you if you would agree with a Frankfurter statement
on this point that the test is what the Constitution says, and not
what nine people wearing black robes have said about it?

  Judge THOMAS. The Constitution is certainly, Senator, the law of
the land, and judges are called on to do the very difficult task and
engage in the very difficult endeavor of determining precisely in
specific cases before the court what that all means.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I would like one more comment, before I leave
this subject area, and I thank you for your responses. It is interest-
ing to observe that some now want to hold onto the past, whether
it is protecting criminals at the expense of victims or sanctioning
                                         341

special preferences or group entitlements. Some Supreme Court
cases have become enshrined.

  Justice William Douglas, one of the more liberal activist judges
that we have seen, and not someone with whom I agreed very
often, was actually quite prophetic when he wrote in 1949, and I
quote:

  Today's new and startling decisions quickly become a coveted anchorage for newly
vested interests. The former proponents of change acquire an acute conservatism in
their new status quo. It will then take an oncoming group from a new generation to
catch the broader vision, which may require an undoing of the work of our present
and their past.

  You may be part of that new generation.
  On the subject of natural law--and you are probably tired of
talking about this--I had some concerns about your view of natural
law when we started these hearings, but I think as I have sat and
listened to you respond--and I think I mentioned this with you in
the privacy of my office just for you to be thinking about it--but I
think I feel comfortable with your approach.
  The American people have probably been confused about natural
law, but I think you helped clarify things, when you explain it as a
basis on which our Government was constructed, the Founders
were inspired by higher law to erect a Government of limited
powers, one filled with checks and balances and ultimately ac-
countable to the people.
  You have indicated that the concept of natural law doesn't play
a role in the deciding of cases, and, of course, I am glad to hear
that you take that position. After all, Justice Brennan was motivat-
ed by natural law and it was license for judicial activism and legis-
lating from the bench. He saw his role as a great effort in achiev-
ing what he called the constitutional ideal of human dignity, the
meaning of the constitutional text that was constantly, in his
words, evolving.
  I sense that you see the Constitution more appropriately as an
anchor for judicial decisionmaking, and that you will leave morali-
ty to us in the legislative branch. Is that a fair conclusion?
  Judge THOMAS. I think it is important certainly that judges not
confuse their role as judges in interpreting the Constitution with
your role in this body, the important role of making policies and
determining the statutory or legislative policies that we should
have in this country in a variety of areas. I think it is very impor-
tant that judges realize that their role is a limited one.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Can I close with a passage from Robert Bolt's,
"A Man for All Seasons." I think it is a passage that you will rec-
ognize and I hope that will capture for us a proper place for natu-
ral law. Toward the end of the first act, Sir Thomas More is with
his wife Alice, his daughter Margaret and his son-in-law Roper.
They are clamoring for the arrest of an individual.
  Margaret tells her father that the man is bad. More replies,
"There's no law against that." Roper tells him, "There's God's
law." More answers, "Then let God arrest him." More continues
with a lesson to his son-in-law: "The law, Roper, the law, I know
what's legal, not what's right and I will stick to what's legal."
Roper accused him of setting man's law above God's. More an-
swered, "No, far below, but let me draw your attention to a fact: I
                                        342

am not God. The currents and eddies of right and wrong I can't
navigate, but in the thickets of the law, oh, there I am a forester."

  Well, Judge Thomas, we expect you to also see your way clearly
through the thickets of the law. We will count on you to under-
stand and apply the law, but natural law can be abstract, elusive
and uncertain. I hope we in the legislative branch, like the Found-
ers did, derive some of our inspiration for our work from natural
law, but I would equally hope that any individual judge's natural
law doesn't come into play as he or she decides a case, and I guess,
let me say, I think you would agree with that.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I have indicated in my conversations
with Senator Biden, with the chairman, and with other Senators,
there is a limited role only to the extent that we are looking to
what our Founders believe, and that is a part of our tradition and
our history in analyzing and in attempting to adjudicate under
some of the more open-ended provisions in our Constitution.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. I think the best line in that is the
one you didn't read, where he says, "And when the devil turns
around on you, Roper, what would you do then, all the laws being
flat?" I hope we all keep that kind in mind, because he says Roper
wants to cut them all down.
  At any rate, I don't want to cut any laws down or I don't want to
cut anybody off, but it is 5:20 and there is no possibility of us fin-
ishing this round today. So we will adjourn until 10 o'clock tomor-
row, and then we will begin with Senator Leahy and then Senator
Specter.
  We are adjourned.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I beg your pardon. The Senator from South Caro-
lina.
  Senator THURMOND. When we finish two rounds of each Sena-

t*QT*

  The CHAIRMAN. If we could have quiet for just a minute. The
Senator had something to say.

  Senator THURMOND. When we finish two rounds by each Senator,
which we will do sometime tomorrow, I was just thinking, on this
side of the aisle I think that we will feel that is adequate, except
one on this side will probably want to take 30 minutes more. Is
there any way we could come in earlier and get through all this
testimony with him tomorrow, so we can get through with him?

  The CHAIRMAN. We will try very hard to get through all the tes-
timony, but we will not come before 10 o'clock tomorrow. It is not
possible to do that before 10 tomorrow. It will depend on whether
or not Senators have questions beyond the second round. We unfor-
tunately go through this with every nominee in terms of this dis-
cussion. If there are no questions on the Republican side, I am sure
that will allow us to move much, much more rapidly. I don't know
how many people will have a third round over here, but we will
continue

  Senator THURMOND. I don't think that there will be but one on
this side that will want to question.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Could I correct that? I might want 10 more
minutes.
                                        343

  Senator THURMOND. Ten more minutes?
  Senator GRASSLEY. Ten more minutes.
  The CHAIRMAN. I expect there may be additional corrections as
we go, but the point is we will try to finish tomorrow, that is if it is
possible to do so within the framework that I set up when we start-
ed these hearings on Tuesday.
  Senator THURMOND. I think that will be fine. We appreciate it
and we will start with the other witnesses next Monday.
  The CHAIRMAN. If that is possible. I am not certain that is possi-
ble, but we will try.
  We will adjourn until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.

on Friday, September 13, 1991, at 10 a.m.]
NOMINATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                       FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1991

                                                                     U.S. SENATE,
                                                 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                         Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice at 10:10 a.m., in room
325, Senate caucus room, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon.
Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (chairman of the committee) presiding.
  Present: Senators Biden, Kennedy, Metzenbaum, Leahy, Heflin,
Simon, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley, Specter, and Brown.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Judge, welcome back. Welcome to your family and your extended
family, and to all of my colleagues.
  We are going to try our best today to go through this process.
Judge, it may be hard for you to believe, but there are some mem-
bers up here who are as anxious to finish this process as you may
be--although I doubt it.
  Today we are going to try our best to see if we can finish today.
But on Tuesday I told Senators they would not be kept late today
so they could plan for the weekend. There is a possibility we can
finish this thing by 4 or 5 o'clock. That is my objective. If we do, we
finish. If we don't and there are Senators who still have questions,
then I am going to ask you to come back on Monday. I don't antici-
pate that. I hope we don't have to do that. But I wanted to tell you
that at the outset.
  The Chair would suggest that, unless you tell me otherwise, we
will proceed essentially as we have in the past. We will go for an
hour with Senators and then take a short break. If it looks like as
we go on this morning that we may be able to finish today, we will
shorten the lunch break
  I have done more of these hearings than I want to recall, and I
have the fervent hope for the good health and longevity of every-
one on the bench. I don't want to do any for a long time hence. For
this one, however, I am going to keep to what I have always done.
As long as the Senators have questions and they are not badger-
ing--and none have, in my view--we will continue the process.
  With that, let me yield to my friend from South Carolina who, I
understand, wanted to make a statement, before I yield the floor to
Senator Leahy for his questions.

                                                         (345)

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I
think you anticipated what I was going to say and have already
agreed to do what I wanted to do.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that is good.
  Senator THURMOND. And that is to finish today.
  I want to say on this side we have only one Senator who will
take his 30 minutes, another one who will take 5 minutes. And so
there will be only about 35 minutes on this side, and I feel certain
we can finish today.
  I remember with Judge Souter we took only 3 days, and this will
be 4 days with this witness. And I think that is reasonable, and I
thank you for your cooperation. I feel certain we can finish today.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Senator SPECTER. I don't think that Senator Thurmond
  Senator THURMOND. On the third round. I said second round. On
the third round.
  Senator SPECTER. On the third round? Well, I just wanted to be
sure that Senator Thurmond had not intended to commit this Sen-
ator
  Senator THURMOND. I have not precluded you. I told you a while
ago you could talk. You will be the only one that is going to talk.
We will give you the whole time except 5 minutes.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I am still in some doubt, Mr. Chairman,
but I just want to say for myself that I want to see how it goes
without making a commitment at this time as to limitation. I want
to cooperate with the chairman and with the ranking member in
finishing today if we possibly can. I think that is a worthwhile ob-
jective, and I want to cooperate toward that. But I do not want to
be committed as of this moment until I see how my second round
of questioning goes. I have only had one round.
  The CHAIRMAN. The one thing I have found, I would say to the
Senator from Pennsylvania and to the committee, is that of all the
Senators, probably the person who talks the least but asks the
most pointed questions is the Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Now, let me yield to my friend from Vermont, another one of my
colleagues who uses the committee's time well.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge, Thomas, welcome back to you, Mrs. Thomas, and the
family.
  Judge you know, there has been a lot said by commentators and
written about the purpose of these hearings. In discussing this with
friends of mine back in Vermont, they ask what we are doing. For
instance, is it the kind of thing, where we will all ask a certain
question and you will give back a response, however prepared?
That can be kind of a stylized ritual. I think the press probably cor-
rectly reported even in advance of the hearings how some of the
questioning and how some of the ritual might go on here.
  But I think that if these hearings are to be important for all of
us--for me as a Senator and for every other Senator--they require
us to have some idea about how you would think when you go to
the Supreme Court. None of us is asking you, for example, how you
are going to rule on an upcoming case. I think all members of the
                                             347

committee agree that is an inappropriate question, and you would
not answer it if we did ask such a question.

  But it is appropriate for us to ask you how you think, what your
background is, and what kind of a Justice you might be, if the
advise and consent clause means anything. The President is asking
us to confirm you to an extraordinary position. There is really no
Supreme Court like ours in the world--lifetime positions, enormous
power, equal branch of Government; in fact, in some ways more
than equal because the Court becomes the arbiter between the
other two branches of Government.

  And each of us--whether conservatives, liberals, moderates,
Northerners, Southerners, white, black, whatever we are--as
Americans, we can always say to ourselves, "If somebody tramples
on my rights, I can go to the Supreme Court. I am an American; I
can go to the Supreme Court." Most Americans want to know that
whoever sits on that Court is somebody who is going to have the
qualities and the qualifications and the background and the integ-
rity and the impartiality to look at their cases and decide on the
merits of each case.

  So, with that in mind, and because I still have a difficult time--
even having met with you, and I think I have been here for 95 per-
cent of the time you have been in this room--I still do not have
quite the sense of how you think and what kind of Justice you
would be. So bear with me if I might ask a general question.

  Judge, you entered law school 20 years ago this year. In that 20
years, both you and I would agree, there have been some extraordi-
nary cases in the Supreme Court. They have decided hundreds of
cases, made rulings perhaps on hundreds more in that 20 years.
Some may be routine, but some have been pretty significant cases.

  Just tell me, to help me know how you think, what would you
consider a handful of the most important cases that have been de-
cided by the Supreme Court since you became a law student 20
years ago?

   [Pause.]
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, to give you a running list, I would have
to go back and give it some thought. But I certainly think that
during the time that I was in law school, two of the cases that were
considered the most significant cases, or among the most signifi-
cant cases, would have been certainly Griggs, which was decided
while I was in law school, and
   Senator LEAHY. Would certainly be which?
   Judge THOMAS. Griggs.
   Senator LEAHY. Yes.
   Judge THOMAS. And certainly I think Roe v. Wade. As you know,
during that time when I was in law school, there was significant
debate with respect to the inclusion and the rightful inclusion of
women in the legal profession, in the law school, in higher educa-
tion.
   I know, for example, my own college, which was all male when I
attended, had become coed. There were just very rapid changes, so
that certainly would have been a significant part of that change.
   Senator LEAHY. SO you would include Craig v. Boren?

         56-270 O--93 12
                                         348

  Judge THOMAS. Craigv. Boren also. That would have been during
law school. But, you know, I think that one certainly isn't as rou-
tinely used in the press as

  Senator LEAHY. Are there some other cases that come to mind
from the last 20 years?

  Judge THOMAS. There would be others, Senator. I can't off the
top of my head--as you mention them, perhaps I could accord some
weight to them. Just not off the top of my head.

  Senator LEAHY. But there are none that stand out, that might
have been cases that have influenced your thinking when you ac-
cepted the appointment to the court of appeals or when you accept-
ed this appointment? Did certain things stick in your mind. Did
you say, I am being nominated to the Court that decided--what-
ever the case might be?

  Judge THOMAS. Before my lifetime, I am being nominated to the
Court that decided Brown, and I-

  Senator LEAHY. What are some of the other-
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. And I think I mentioned that
  Senator LEAHY. YOU did.
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. When the President made the an-
nouncement that I would be nominated to the Supreme Court.
That is certainly one of the cases--even before I knew all of the
legal ramifications, it is one that changed my life and changed the
South, and, of course, even though I did not go to desegregated
schools until I was virtually an adult.
  Senator LEAHY. Let me ask you about some of the recent cases
that have been decided since you were in law school. One, of
course, very recent case is Rust v. Sullivan. That was the case in
which the Court upheld the regulations prohibiting abortion coun-
seling or referral in the title X family planning program.
  Now, I am not going to ask you to go into the particulars of that
case because it is still a matter of some controversy. But I would
like to go into some of the issues raised by the Rust decision. One is
whether the Government can require a recipient of Federal funds
to express only those views that the Government finds acceptable
in any broad area. I am obviously thinking of some of the first
amendment ramifications.
  Let me make some specific examples. These are not cases that
are about to come up before the Supreme Court, so let's talk just in
the abstract. Suppose the Government wanted to further a policy of
participation in the political process. Could they give out subsidies
but limit them just to people who say that they will vote Republi-
can or just to people who say they will vote Democratic? Could
they do something like that?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I certainly couldn't absolutely answer
that. I would be concerned that if the Government could do that, it
certainly would seem to me to be an interference with the way the
freedoms that we would expect in our political processes, as well as
the way that we think that we can function as citizens in this
country.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, let's go to another example. Suppose the
Government would lay out a policy to protect the public from sexu-
ally explicit material. So, say that you are a library and you re-
ceive public funds, but you cannot have certain listed books. You
                                         349

can't have Alice Walker's "The Color Purple." You can't have J.D.
Salinger's "Catcher in the Rye" available. Could the Government
do something like that?

  Judge THOMAS. Again, Senator, I would have the same concern. I
think the underlying problem that the Court has wrestled with and
certainly in using the receipt of Federal financial assistance to in
some way determine what the policies would be, that this body
would have to wrestle with also.

  I think the first that those sorts of issues arose, to my knowledge,
in a general way, would have been in the Grove City case, where
there were some concerns--at least the argument may have been
raised by the educational institutions, and the Court disposed of it.
But the concerns would always be whether or not the Government
is conditioning the exercise of constitutional rights or the exercise
of the engaging in conduct that we think that we are free to
engage in this society under receipt of Federal financial assistance.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, we understand, and you would accept, of
course, the fact that there are times when the demonstration of
Government policy or the requirement of Government policy can
conflict with the basic constitutional right of freedom of speech. I
mean, this has happened in our history over and over again, has it
not?

  Judge THOMAS. I think that particularly, Senator, with the signif-
icant involvement today of Government in virtually every aspect of
our lives, the potential conflict between the Government policies or
between the Government and rights that we consider fundamental
to us or rights that we have considered those that we have been
free to exercise, where that conflict--there is more of a potential
for that conflict today. And I think that we all have to be on guard
when the occasions arise when the conflicts are such that funda-
mental rights in ways are either denigrated or conflicted or under-
mined or interfered with in some way.

  Senator LEAHY. YOU mentioned some of the issues that we here
in the Congress have to wrestle with, but in addition, there is more
and more a feeling that we are putting strings on Federal taxpay-
ers' money. Now, some of those strings, I think most people would
accept, make sense. We impose accounting strings; you have to ac-
count for where the money goes. I don't think anybody disagrees
with that. Road-building funds must be used for road-building and
not for something entirely different.

  But what happens when you go to the next step--where we send
money for a significant purpose, and, by gosh, we are going to tell
you how to think to use that money?

  For example, say the Government says "We are in favor of nu-
clear families." A fine, good statement of policy. But then do we
also say, now, to any college receiving Federal funds--and most do
in one way or another--that they cannot include information in a
sociology course on divorce or illegitimacy or homosexuality or het-
erosexuality--whatever--because we feel it would interfere with
this policy? Can we do that?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that as you move more into free-
doms that we consider fundamental, I think, as I have noted earli-
er, that the conflict becomes more accentuated, and I think the
conflict becomes more evident. And to my knowledge, in those
                                         350

kinds of instances, the Supreme Court has to wrestle with whether
or not the Government has--if it is a fundamental right involved,
for example, whether or not the Government has a compelling in-
terest in doing that.

  I understand the concern, but I can't in each specific instance
say that I can resolve the problem or the specific problem. But I
would have deep concerns myself if someone said that in order to
receive financial assistance you are going to have to conduct your
life in a particular way.

  Senator LEAHY. What I am thinking of is this, Judge: What
standards does the Court use--because you are going to become the
arbiter of such things. If the Congress sits down and says "Here is
our money for a good use"--education, health, research--but in
effect, based on whatever the congressional mandate might be, we
are also going to tell you how to think.

  Now, when that happens, if the Congress does that, people are
going to resort to the Court. I am not asking you to prejudge a lot
of cases, but what basic standard--if you were to look at a case like
that, one in which we send money for a very valid reason, like
health care or education, and we say; "Here is what you can talk
about," and "Here is what you can't talk about"; "Here is what
you can read," or "Here is what you can't read," what standard
would you as a judge use to determine whether we have just set
aside the first amendment?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, that is, I guess, generally--and we are
talking I guess in very general terms. If the right involved, of
course, is a fundamental right, of course the appropriate test would
have to be the demonstration by the Government that there is a
compelling interest in some way infringing on that fundamental
right. But let me underscore one other point that does not quite get
to that and that would be a part of any analysis when this body
expresses its intent to regulate a particular area or to provide as-
sistance in a particular area, and that is accomplished in the ad-
ministrative agencies.

  When those agencies develop their regulations in the areas that
do not touch upon and do not involve the fundamental right, of
course we would have to defer to some extent to the agency and
certainly to the intent of the reasonableness of the agency's regs
and certainly the intent of this body.

  The separate test that I mentioned initially is to the extent that
it does infringe upon a fundamental right, I think the Court would
have to undergo the standard kinds of analysis involving the com-
pelling interest test, for example. In other words, hold the Govern-
ment to the very highest standard to show why it can or why it has
an interest in infringing on these rights.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge, in my earlier question I asked you about
what you considered to be some of the most important cases that
have been decided since you were in law school and then we went
to the next thing, what you considered some of the most important
cases, period, and you mentioned Brown v. Board of Education. I
absolutely agree with you that it is one of the most important cases
decided in my lifetime.

  But it triggered in my mind a speech you once gave in which you
said that you considered Morrison v. Olson--that is the special
                                         351

prosecutor case--the most important case since Brown v. Board of
Education. When I asked you about cases this morning, you did not
list Morrison,but in your earlier speech, you said that it is one of
the most important cases since Brown.

  But in that speech, you were not very kind toward the Olson de-
cision. You said it was a very important case, but you did not like
it. It was a 7-1 decision; Justice Scalia dissented. You called his dis-
sent "remarkable." But you said that Chief Justice Rehnquist and
the 7-1 decision failed not only conservatives but failed all Ameri-
cans.

  I was surprised that you did not list this this morning as one of
the most important cases, but let me ask you this specific question
about it: Do you feel still today that Chief Justice Rehnquist's deci-
sion failed all Americans?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I indicated yesterday, the point that I
was making there with respect to that speech, and certainly in the
rhetorical language, was this: That the structure of our Govern-
ment as I saw it--and, again, I gave that speech as Chairman of
EEOC--was to protect individuals. In other words, the Government
is arranged in such a way that individual rights and individual
freedoms are infringed upon as little as possible. And the point
that I was making was that when that structure was changed and
when there was a prosecutor that was not accountable to either
one of the political branches, or directly accountable, that that
could violate individual freedoms in a way that the three-part Gov-
ernment that we have, the three branches, would not permit and
would not allow.

  Senator LEAHY. YOU actually said that the special prosecutor
statute could undermine the individual freedom of the person who
is being investigated. You said you gave that speech and the rheto-
ric of it as Chairman of EEOC, but you were also at that time a
lawyer and one who had thought about these issues. And what
struck me is that when you link it with Brown v. Board ofEduca-
tion--a case which all of us look at as a most significant case and
you certainly would have strong and personal reasons, as you have
eloquently stated, for supporting it--when you put them together,
it concerns me. In your testimony, you have stated over and over
again how you want--even in your testimony here--to guarantee
your impartiality. But isn't that what the special prosecutor is
about--to make sure that if there is serious wrongdoing in the ex-
ecutive branch, Iran-Contra, Watergate, whatever, that there is an
impartial prosecutor?

  Should a President be in a position, for example, as President
Nixon was in 1973, to be able to fire the person who is investigat-
ing him?

  Judge THOMAS. With respect, Senator, to discussing that case in
comparison with Brown, as I noted yesterday, the point was to take
a case that most considered obscure and elevate it and attempt to
show some of the significance of that. The important point that I
was making as I told you; that individual freedoms were at risk. I
wasn't looking at the case per se as a lawyer to argue the next
case. I was looking at it in the context of the political theory and
philosophy that I was discussing at that point. The

  Senator LEAHY. Well, I--go ahead.
                                         352

   Judge THOMAS. The final--if you notice, I did not parse the stat-
ute per se. Another point that I would like to make is that at that
time, when we are in the political branch, I think that we advocate
for the political branch. I have made comment throughout this
hearing that when one moves to the judiciary, one must remain
neutral in any debates between those two branches. And I certain-
ly have done that in my position as a judge on the court of appeals
and would intend to continue to do that. And as you added, this is
a 7-1 decision. As I noted to Senator Kennedy yesterday, I believe,
this is the--the Supreme Court has spoken. It is the law of the
land.

   Senator LEAHY. I agree with you on the question of impartiality,
but you would accept, I would assume, that people don't expect
that the second judges put on robes that it is like an eraser going
across a blackboard and their whole lives are wiped out, all their
thoughts, all their feelings, their prejudices--and I don't use that
in a pejorative form--that all the feelings they have toward every-
thing are suddenly wiped out.

  Again, it goes back to what I said before. We are trying to see
how you think, so that the American people know how you think.
Because there is a great deal at stake for all of us. You or any
member of the Supreme Court are one of only nine, and the Court
is one of the three equal branches of the Government.

   Let me ask about a very important habeas corpus case that was
decided this past term, McCleskey v. Zant. I have seen your speech-
es and writings, and I understand your feeling that it is one thing
to write or speak as a member of the executive branch. But you
have frequently attacked what you call the "run-amock" liberal
judges.

   In McCleskey, the Court said that State prisoners should be limit-
ed to one bite at the apple in Federal court. I don't want to go into
so much the result of that. As a former prosecutor who had to face
an awful lot of habeas corpus cases, I felt that the nibbling ought
to stop and after a while there ought to be a limit on it. That is
fine.

   But I look at this case, hailed as the work of a good conservative
Court, as exactly what you are talking about in these judges run-
ning amock.

   In 1989, the Chief Justice appointed a committee that was
chaired by former Justice Lewis Powell, and the Powell committee
was supposed to study the possibility of limiting the constitutional
right to habeas corpus appeals. They testified before our Judiciary
Committee and did a great deal of work on it. In fact, they came up
with a proposal which would have sharply limited the right to
appeal.

   Now, the 101st Congress considered these proposals and did not
pass the legislation that would enact the Powell committee's pro-
posals. For whatever reason, the legislative proposals were not en-
acted. So after we did not, the Supreme Court went ahead this
spring and, in effect, did the legislation themselves in the McCles-
key decision.

   Is that judicial restraint or is that judicial activism?
   Judge THOMAS. Senator, could I address one point you made first
and then address the second?
                                        353

  Senator LEAHY. Sure.
  Judge THOMAS. With respect to judges and what happens when
you become a judge, I, quite frankly, don't know that any of us
who, prior to becoming judges, understood exactly how it would
change us. I could not have told you when I was here for the court
of appeals exactly how it would change me. I can tell you--and I
think most judges would tell you--that it is not necessarily like an
eraser, but it is a profound change.
  With respect to the comment, the question, and the concern that
you raise about that case, I think that activism, going beyond
either the legislation or beyond the law on either side, is inappro-
priate. I don't think that any brand, whether it is conservative ac-
tivism or liberal activism--if I could use those two general catego-
ries--is appropriate.
  A judge is to remain impartial. I believe that it is one thing to sit
in the executive branch and to take policy positions and to advo-
cate and to disagree with the Court and to challenge the Court. It
is another thing to be a judge and to be called upon to be the final
arbiter in some of the most difficult cases in our country. And I
think neutrality is absolutely essential.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, obviously I have dozens of other ques-
tions, but I just realized that the time is running down. I assume
by now you have had a chance to read the Lehrman article. I see it
sitting there. I did not want you to be disappointed. [Laughter.]
  I wanted you to have at least one question that the quarterbacks
behind you have been expecting here.
  You have read the article?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, I have, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you. So have I.
  In 1987, you called that article "a splendid example of applying
natural law." Lewis Lehrman's analysis concludes that because the
right to life attaches at conception that abortion of any sort is un-
constitutional. Do you agree with that conclusion?
  Judge THOMAS. AS I indicated, Senator, to you in our last discus-
sion, I have read this article; and as I have noted throughout my
testimony and in discussions in reference to this article, my only
interest was as stated: To demonstrate to a conservative audience
that one of their own used this notion of natural rights
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, I
  Judge THOMAS. And the second point is that, as I have indicated,
I do not endorse that conclusion. I do not think--and I have said
it--that the declaration or the argument should be made in this
fashion. And I have not concluded in any way or reached these con-
clusions or endorsed this conclusion.
   Senator LEAHY. I am not sure just which conclusion we are talk-
ing about. I am talking about Lehrman's conclusion that all abor-
tion, under any circumstance--which, of course, would go way
beyond any overruling of a Supreme Court decision or anything
else--his conclusion that all abortion is unconstitutional. Do you
accept that conclusion?
   Judge THOMAS. Senator, the
   Senator LEAHY. I am not trying to play word games with you,
Judge. I am not sure whether it is the natural law or the conclu-
sion that you disagree with. Do you agree with his--let me ask you
                                         354

this specifically: Do you agree with his conclusion that all abortion
is unconstitutional?

  Judge THOMAS. And what I am trying to do, Senator, is to re-
spond to your question and at the same time not offer a particular
view on this difficult issue of abortion that would undermine my
impartiality.

  The point that I am making is that I have not, nor have I ever,
endorsed this conclusion or supported this conclusion.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is up. I do
not want to intrude on anybody else's time. But I will hold my
other questions for the next go-round.

  Thank you, Judge. I appreciate it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  I apologize, Judge. It isn't that I am not interested in listening. I
am trying to find out what time Senators have to catch planes so
we can avoid the seniority route and let people have a chance to
ask their questions, if we get that far.
  Now I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, one of the reasons that I was
pleased to see your nomination was because of your background in
civil rights work and employment opportunities. Equality of em-
ployment is so very important for the future of America.
  I had asked you in the first round questions about affirmative
action and about the cases and your positions. I know that early in
your career, you took the position that flexible goals and timeta-
bles were desirable, and later you have shifted away from that. We
all agree that quotas are bad, but you have said in your 1983
speeches that you thought flexible goals and timetables were good.
  When you and I finished my first round on Wednesday, I had
started to discuss the Supreme Court decision in the Sheetmetal
Workers case and had not had time to really outline the facts. I had
raised a question as to why you opposed the remedy in that case,
because it was such an egregious, such a very bad case on discrimi-
nation.
  Very briefly, the facts are these: In 1964, the New York State
Commission found discrimination against blacks, and the New
York trial court ordered changes. In 1971, Federal litigation was
started to stop discrimination. In 1975, the Federal court found dis-
crimination and bad faith, and it was upheld by the court of ap-
peals. The court found that the union in the employment practices
had consistently and egregiously violated the Civil Rights Act, and
ordered a goal.
  In 1982, there was a contempt citation, and in 1983 a second con-
tempt citation. The discriminators were found guilty of contempt.
In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the contempt citation,
noting a standard of persistent and egregious discrimination and
found intentional discrimination. The EEOC took a position that
there should be an award of relief only to the actual victims of un-
lawful discrimination.
  Now, given the background of what had happened, it is clear
that the future would have held more discrimination for the black
workers there. In setting a goal, the Court was putting the employ-
ers on notice that they had to move toward hiring blacks. It was a
flexible goal and the timetables had been extended.
                                         355

  So, given the history, it was pretty plain that in the future there
would be discrimination against specific individuals, and when you
dealt with a base of about 3 percent, it was plain that there had to
be more blacks qualified. Whether you could get to a higher
number or what number you could get to was uncertain. But
wasn't that remedy reasonably calculated, in a remedial sense, to
prevent discrimination against specific blacks in the context where
it was obvious that would happen? Wasn't it in the context where
there would be blacks at least equal to, if not superior to, some of
the whites who would be competing for the same jobs?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, since you mentioned that in our last
round and that you would come back to it, I tried to give that some
thought on what the context of that case was. As you know, one
among many of those cases involving this difficult area of relief to
nonvictims of discrimination during the 1980's, and the Supreme
Court was going back and forth, I believe that this case occurred
after cases such as Stotts, in which the Supreme Court limited
relief or indicated that relief should not go to nonvictims.

  With that said and noted as I indicated in my prior testimony
that this is an issue that reasonable people have disagreed on, I
think that people who are well-intentioned all want to make sure
that you do include individuals who have been excluded, but at the
same time not violate the sense of fairness that is in the statute.

  In this particular case--and this is more of an intramural con-
cern of the EEOC and the way that the agency operated--at the
lower court level, the general counsel, which is quasi-independent,
and we respected that independence, had already been given the
authority to litigate the case, so that when it was appealed to the
Supreme Court, to my knowledge, there was no additional vote of
the Commissioners needed. That decision was made between our
general counsel, who has already been authorized to litigate the
case, and the Solicitor General.

  The argument, as I remember it, was consistent by the Solicitor
with what you said, but I will add this point: Independent of our
processes and as an individual in reflecting on this, I do recollect
urging the Solicitor to argue for contempt proceedings in this case
in the brief, and that there be sanctions brought against such an
egregious violation of a court order.

   That was consistent with the approach that I think I attempted
to outline in some of not only my speeches, but in some of my
other writings, that when there was a violation of the antidiscrimi-
nation laws or a court order that was in place to resolve it, that the
appropriate response should not be the numerical approach but,
rather, that the appropriate response should be for the court to use
its powers, its inherent powers to force compliance.

   Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, I quite agree with you that rea-
sonable men can differ on these issues, and I think that is one of
the good features about your participation in this field. You have
been able to advocate positions, as a black American which had
unique standing. When you were against affirmative action, that
had special significance, because of your unique background.

   You have affirmative action having been sanctioned on all sides
by the National Association of Manufacturers and the liberals on
one side and by the conservatives on the other. When you talk
                                               356

about contempt citations, I agree with you. But it is very hard--
and I have had experience in the law enforcement field--to deter
people or to penalize them enough to really get the job done, to ma-
terially affect their future conduct. So, that brings us back to the
remedy of establishing a flexible goal, which at one time you had
agreed with.

  Now, you have just repeated the position you have taken consist-
ently, and that is that there should not be relief to nonvictims. My
question to you goes to the likelihood of future victims. In a con-
text where blacks have been egregiously discriminated against, it is
clear that that is going to happen in the future under the same cir-
cumstances, and the way to prevent future victims is to set the
goal. My question to you is, isn't that a reasonable course which
the Federal court followed and the Supreme Court upheld, and, of
course, which you disagreed with?

  Judge THOMAS. It is certainly the course that the Supreme Court
has upheld, and I disagree with that as certainly a policymaker.
The point that I have made that underscored this--and it has to be
kept in the context and I have argued for it, it seems as though
only one side of the equation finds itself in the debate oftentimes.

  I felt, as a policymaker, that the best way to enforce the law, to
enforce antidiscrimination laws, is to increase the remedy, the
direct remedy for discrimination. I think that my view would be,
my view was that the first step should have been that the relief
under title VII should have been much stronger.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, when you say relief, you mean the sanc-
tion

  Judge THOMAS. Right.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. The contempt citation, the fine or
the penalty. But should that be the only relief? Where you have a
remedy which is directed to secure the employment of blacks who
may be predicted, with reasonable certainty, are going to be actual
victims, why not? Why not protect their rights, where you have vir-
tually certain grounds to conclude that they are going to be the
next victims, and the remedy is directed to future victims?
  Judge THOMAS. First of all, during my tenure at EEOC, Senator,
regardless of what my own concerns were, we did approve and did
use goals and timetables in instances in which we felt they were
appropriate, and the general counsel had developed and the Com-
mission adopted, I believe, if not used, a specific policy on goals and
timetables, but there are other approaches.
  One of the things that I thought was appropriate--and let's just
talk about the case where you are saying making sure, we know
these employers are not going to do what they should do. I felt very
strongly that EEOC should have been and we did become more in-
trusive in their personnel matters; that is, that it is one thing to
say, well, we are going to have goals and timetables and there is no
monitoring, you don't make sure that they are doing specific things
to achieve specific goals.
  We made sure that there was specific conduct required, and
EEOC monitored to determine whether or not that specific conduct
was, in fact, taking place or being engaged in. I think that is an
appropriate way. And we have talked earlier in these hearings
about outreach and recruitment, et cetera, but I felt that we could
                                         357

be much stronger with a combination of monitoring and a combina-
tion of specific activities. Again, I underscore that with saying we
did use goals and timetables.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I understand the variety of other process-
es, but it just seemed to me, in the context of that New York case,
where you knew that there would be future discrimination, the
remedy was very carefully tailored and that that was an alterna-
tive which would be reasonable to use.

  Let me move on to the question of--Mr. Chairman, you have
asked about the vote on and my preference. Perhaps this is as good
a time to break, since we must break and vote and return.

  The CHAIRMAN. We have about 10 minutes to get over to the
floor to vote, and the Senator has about roughly 15 minutes left in
his questioning, so I think it may be appropriate to take a break
now. You can decide whether you want to break after this as well.
Why don't we recess for--it will probably take us 12 or 15 minutes
to go over and back.

  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order.
  Judge we will resume now with the questions. I want to make
sure my time is precise. I said about 15 minutes, I am told the Sen-
ator has about 20 minutes, is that right, to be exact--19 minutes,
so I want to be sure we are clear on that. We will now yield back to
the Senator from Pennsylvania, and then we are going to go to the
Senator from Alabama, and then we will make a judgment wheth-
er that is the appropriate place to break for lunch or whether we
go back to Senator Brown.
  Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, before the break I had been dis-
cussing with you affirmative action, to gauge your own thinking as
you have moved in favor of flexible standards and goals to bring
against it, against the backdrop of deciding cases. I had asked you
about the pros and cons on having a remedy for a category which I
classified as affirmative action for future certain discrimination
victims. I think this was the fact under the New York case.
  Let me move now to another category--regrettably, there is not
a great deal of time to cover a matter of this importance, where I
think the American people really need to know what is going on. I
think there is no better person to tell them than you, sir, with your
background--to a category of what I would denominate as affirma-
tive action for previous discrimination victims in another context,
where that person has the potential or apparent potential for being
as good as, if not better than the person displaced.
  I want to come to the Yale Law School admission, and not to per-
sonalize it with you, but take Prof. Steven Carter, who is an Afri-
can-American and a distinguished professor now at Yale. Yale is a
very good law school. Professor Carter has just written a book, "Af-
firmative Action Baby," and he says flat out that he enjoyed the
benefits of racial preference.
  Let's assume, although it may not apply to Professor Carter, that
somebody who comes to Yale, an African-American, a product of
inferior elementary school, high school, and college, but has the po-
tential. Why shouldn't Yale give a preference? You in your testi-
mony, in response to my question, oppose a preference. But why
                                         358

shouldn't the law school like Yale give a preference. Shouldn't a
school give that person an opportunity to blossom fully, even
though on the test scores at the moment that African-American
doesn't measure up quite to the white person he has displaced?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I guess the difference that we have
there is perhaps semantics, but let me explain to you what I have
supported and what we argued for when I was in school, and that
was that schools like Yale or other schools across the country
should look at how far a person has come as a part of the total
person, that you can look at kids who had gone to elite schools or
had the finest family background and professional parents, or you
could take a kid from the inner city who did not have all those ad-
vantages, but had done very, very well, and assess whether, one,
the fact that this kid has done so well against the odds, is that an
indication of what kind of person this is or how good that kids can
be, is that an indication of how much drive that person has, how
much stick-to-itivity that person has.

  I think that during that era, those of us who were then the bene-
ficiaries of what were called preferential treatment programs--I
think that was the exact terminology--that it was an effort to de-
termine whether kids had been disadvantaged, had socioeconomic
disadvantages, had done very, very well in other endeavors against
those odds, and I think that the law schools, that the colleges in-
volved attempted to determine are these kids, with all those disad-
vantages, qualified to compete with these kids who have had all
the advantages.

  That is a difficult, subjective determination, but I thought that it
was one that was appropriately made. One of the aspects of that is
that the kids could come from any background of disadvantage.
The kid could be a white kid from Appalachia, could be a Cajun
from Louisiana, or could be a black kid or Hispanic kid from the
inner cities or from the barrios, but I defended that sort of a pro-
gram then and I would defend it today.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, what you are just saying,
though, is a preference implicit. If I understand you correctly, the
fact that the kid, as you put him, has come a long way, does not at
that precise moment, going into Yale, have as good a record as an-
other person. Take an African-American who has come a long way,
come from a disadvantaged circumstance, at the moment of critical
judgment, that applicant, an African-American, does not have as
good a record as a white student. Would you then give him the
preference, do I understand you correctly?

  Judge THOMAS. What I said is that kid, particularly with the so-
cioeconomic background, I think the law school--we all make that
determination, how much drive does this person have. You know,
we hear in playing sports, sometimes you hear coaches talk about
it's not the size of the dog, it's the size of the fight in the dog. I
think that the point that I am attempting to make is that Yale or
other schools try to make that subjective determination about the
total person, and I thought that was appropriate. I think there are
other individuals like myself, when we hire, we look for more than
just the person who has had all the advantages. We look for people
who have had some of the disadvantages and have overcome those
odds. I think it is very important.
                                         359

  Senator SPECTER. Judge, I hear you very close to my position. But
what I believe I am hearing is that you are in favor of affirmative
action preference, at least in that context.

  Judge THOMAS. I think I have said that.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I haven't understood it from all your
writings.
  The CHAIRMAN. Would the Senator yield for 30 seconds, because I
am confused.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU are going to destroy a 5-minute train, Mr.
Chairman, but go ahead.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS that constitutional?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have not looked at it in that context. I
assume that it was good policy to help to include others, and I have
not looked at it in that context, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, it will only take me 4 minutes
to get back on my train of thought. [Laughter.]
  If a preference there, Judge Thomas, if a preference there for the
disadvantaged kid, as you put it, has come a long way, but he can't
quite measure up at that moment, why not a preference in employ-
ment?
  Judge THOMAS. I think, again, Senator, I have looked at educa-
tion as a chance to become prepared. I have in my thinking person-
ally--and I am talking totally from a policy standpoint--that edu-
cation was that chance to be prepared to go on in life. It was an
opportunity to gain opportunities.
  For example, when we have our programs, even the ones that I
established at EEOC, the effort was to give training, to bring kids
in, to bring individuals in and give them an opportunity to prepare
themselves, not in a way that I thought was offensive or in a way
that was strictly based on race but rather, based on a number of
criteria, a number of factors, including how far that person had
come. I think that is important, and I think that you can measure
a person by how far that person has come and by what that person
has overcome to get there.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, that is fine for those of us who
have gone to Yale, but what about the African-American youngster
who doesn't have an educational background and is fighting for a
job. You have a case like Crawson v. Richmond, which upset a mi-
nority set-aside. After that happened, the Philadelphia plan was
one of the first in the country to move ahead with affirmative
action. You should see the figures taking an immediate nosedive in
African-American young people.
  So, that if you have a Judge Thomas or a Professor Carter, who
comes to Yale Law in that context, that is fine for their next step
ahead. But if you have someone who is a 10th grade dropout and is
struggling to get a job in a trade union in Philadelphia or in New
York in the case we talked about, why not give that person a pref-
erence, because of the discrimination which has affected that
person in his schooling. Where that person has the potential to be
ultimately as good as, if not better than the white applicant who
he displaces?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, of course, you do have the question that
I have indicated, and I don't think that the cases necessarily break
down that way. They don't make the distinction subjectively that
                                         360

way. I believe it just strictly says it doesn't say that this kid has to
come from a disadvantaged background, it doesn't say that the kid
has to have had problems in life. It is race-specific, and I think we
all know that all disadvantaged people aren't black and all black
people aren't disadvantaged.

  The question is whether or not you are going to pinpoint your
policy on people with disadvantages, or are you simply going to do
it by race. That is a difficult question. I was the first to admit that.
It is one that needed constructive debate and discussion. But I
don't think there is a person in this country who cares more about
what happens to kids who are left out. What I have tried to offer
and what I have tried to say, from the first days I entered the exec-
utive branch, was that we need to look at all avenues of inclusion.

  You talk about education. In this day and age of mandatory edu-
cation up to the 12th grade, I think we should ask ourselves a rhe-
torical question: Why is it that a kid who completes 12 years of
mandatory education can't function in our society. That is particu-
larly detrimental to minorities. We know it, and we know that
there is a tremendous correlation between education and the abili-
ty to live well in this society, as well as to be employed and to have
a good life in this society.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, I accept and applaud your sin-
cerity, and I agree that there are disadvantaged people who are not
in minorities. But focusing on minorities for just as moment, be-
cause that is the central problem, when you talk about the lack of
educational opportunity for African-Americans, it is true across
this country. That is why it seems to me that the logic that you
accept on a preference to get into Yale Law School ought to be ap-
plied as a preference to get a job in New York City, where the local
discriminated, or Philadelphia where the Philadelphia plan had
been put into operation, where there is good reason to conclude
that that person has the potential to succeed.

  Judge Thomas, have you seen this very recent report by the U.S.
Department of Labor on the glass ceiling?

  Judge THOMAS. I have heard of it. I haven't seen much beyond
my backyard in the last 70 days.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, it is a stark picture about minorities and
women holding less than 5 percent of managerial positions, and
one conclusion, to put it plainly, the glass ceiling existed at a much
lower level than first thought.

  I would turn to one critical line from Professor Carter's book,
which I think really puts in a nutshell much of this affirmative
action debate. He says, "The reason for the surge is to find the
blacks among the best, not the best among the blacks," and that if
you have the affirmative action, as you concur, on preference in
law school, then the potential is developed through a Professor
Carter or a Judge Thomas. I would submit to you that if you give
the struggling disadvantaged high school dropout who is African-
American a preference, because of the collateral past discrimina-
tion, and the high likelihood that he is going to be a victim of
future discrimination, that it makes sense.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, what I have said--and I don't know, you
know, I think it is easy to point out conflicts and to draw very
                                             361

sharp lines, but let me make a couple of points, Senator, if you
don't mind.

  I have been an aggressive advocate of giving minorities the op-
portunity and the occasion to develop potential. We have done that.
I have done that as the head of an agency, as well as my own ap-
proaches in my personal life. I think it is critical, and I have heard
the same arguments for most of my adult life, and we have, of
course, many of the same problems.

  With respect to the existence, the current existence of those
problems, we attempted, when I first arrived at EEOC in 1983, to
point that out in a project that we called Project 2000, what would
the work environment look like, where would minorities be, where
would women be, what would some of the problems be. I think
some of what the Department of Labor did later on involved simi-
lar approaches. That was an expression of our concern about what
was happening in the educational arena.

  When I was at the Office for Civil Rights, I think it was clear to
us then that there were going to be problems in the future, because
of the minority participation in education, and I think we are be-
ginning to see evidence of those problems. At every level, we could
begin to attack these problems. I have been concerned about it
from a policy standpoint, and I have spent my adult life being con-
cerned about it on a personal level.

  Senator SPECTER. YOU talk about your position in 1983. Judge
Thomas, you were in favor then of flexible goals and timetables,
and perhaps you will be again. The great advantage of a Judge
Thomas or a Professor Carter is a role model, and I think that is
one of the aspects which speaks very well for your current position
and is a big boost for the Supreme Court of the United States.

  There is a good bit of politics at all levels of this proceeding, but
one level of the politics which you wrote about in a speech back on
April 25, 1988, complaining that the liberals play with the ill-treat-
ment of the blacks and give them give-away programs, and your
point that blacks will move toward a conservative line.

   You may well be a role model which will attract many, many
blacks to the cause of conservatism and to the Republican Party,
and that is something that you and I discussed back in 1984, after
the reelection of President Reagan. You had made a speech that
the Republican Party did not reach out for blacks, and I picked up
the phone and you and I had lunch and had a program to bring
blacks into the Republican Party. We didn't do very much and we
began a year later, and we still haven't done very much, but we
may do something now.

   As stated in considering your nomination, I am undecided and
want to hear all the witnesses, and I am not going to vote for you
for helping bring blacks into the Republican Party. My support will
be based solely on your qualifications, but I think a collateral con-
sideration might well be the benefit of seeing an African-American
with a different line of thought as a role model.

   Let me move on to Rust v. Sullivan. Senator Leahy took it up,
but I want to approach it from a little different angle. The question
I have, Judge Thomas, turns on the change in the agency regula-
tion and you approve that principle in a speech you gave earlier
this year at Creighton University, on February 14. I have a concern
                                         362

about shifts in regulations, where the Congress has let them stand
very much in my first round as I expressed a very substantial con-
cern about disregarding congressional intent and having later Su-
preme Court decisions like WardsCove reverse cases likeGriggs.

  The background of the controversy arises from the Federal stat-
ute which says that no funds shall be used where abortion is a
method of family planning, but a regulation was issued in 1971
which said there could be counseling. Then in 1988, 17 years later,
the Secretary of Health changed that.

  In your speech at Creighton University, you agree with Justice
Scalia that agencies should be able to change their regulations.
You make reference to political accountability in a somewhat dif-
ferent context, but I think the political accountability is important.
And then the Supreme Court, in Rust v. Sullivan, says that the
Secretary can change the position, when the new regulations are
more in keeping with the statute's original intent, are justified by
client experience under the prior policy, and accord with a shift in
attitude against the elimination of unborn children by abortion.

  Now, without respect to the abortion issue, I have a grave con-
cern about a shift in regulation based on political considerations
which you appear to sanction in your Creighton speech. And I have
a very deep concern about the Supreme Court upholding a change
in regulation, because they accord with a shift in attitude.

  When Congress passes a law that no funds may be used for
family planning, where abortion is involved, no procedure where
abortion is used for family planning is acceptable, but that does not
preclude counseling or the exercise of freedom of speech, and
stands for 17 years, what is the justification for changing, when
Congress has ordained congressional intent which has stood, be-
cause there is a shift in attitude or some political change of wind?

  Judge THOMAS. With respect, Senator, to the change in regula-
tions, I think that what I pointed to in the Creighton speech was
the line of cases beginning I think with Chevron, which involved a
change in regulations and whether or not the agency could make
those changes. That is the controlling Supreme Court case with re-
spect to the Court's deference to the agencies, when reviewing their
regulations, and the point that I was making about accountability
is that this body, in its relationship with those agencies, could
change the rules for them, and I assume that is the kind of ac-
countability that the Supreme Court was referring to. I don't know.

  But if you note in that speech, also, I took issue with the sense
that this deference to agency can continue to be expanded and be
unlimited. That was a concern, because at some point you would
defer so greatly to the agency, even when the Court thinks it is
moving away from the intent of Congress, that there is no judicial
review, so the question became what are the limits of that. But, of
course, in deciding our cases, we would follow the lead case of
Chevron, which, as I indicated, permits changes in regs.

  My concern would be the similar concern that I expressed earlier
here, and I think that when you engage in judicial review in ad-
ministrative law, this would be the same concern and it would be
actually the bottom line or the baseline of analysis in those cases,
is the agency's interpretation a reasonable interpretation of con-
gressional intent. That is the important line to draw, with the ref-
                                         363

erence being, as it is in statutory analysis, what is the intent of
Congress, if Congress changes that intent, then the agency, of
course, can't go beyond that.

  If Congress is explicit about that intent, then the agency has
very, very little room within which to maneuver. If broad, of
course, the agency may be able to engage in a significant range of
reasonable conduct and choosing of options. That was the point
that I was trying to make in the Creighton speech, but the bottom
line for us, the baseline, the anchor in the administrative law cases
is always what is the intent of Congress and is this a reasonable
interpretation of that intent, whether we agree with the policy of
the agency or not or the change in the agency's policy or not.

  Senator SPECTER. My time is up. I will return to that in the next
round. Thank you very much, Judge Thomas.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Before I yield to the Senator from Alabama, I
would like to make a point of clarification. Did you say, Judge, that
affirmative action preference programs are all right as long as they
are not based on race?
  Judge THOMAS. I said that from a policy standpoint I agreed with
affirmative action policies that focused on disadvantaged minorities
and disadvantaged individuals in our society.
  The CHAIRMAN. For example
  Judge THOMAS. I am not commenting on the legality or the con-
stitutionality. I have not visited it from that standpoint, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS we all know, I went to one of those State
schools. My son went to one of those Ivy League schools. I didn't
realize that in those Ivy League schools you all attended, there are
preferences based on whether or not you are a--what is it called if
your father went there? A legacy. If you are a legacy
   Judge THOMAS. Or if you are a football player.
   The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. Or if you come from a certain part
of the country. My son might not have been accepted by the school
because his father didn't go there, even though his marks are
higher than the kid who got in. That is how it works. As long as
everybody knows that. If that is not preference, I don't know what
is. But I will come back to that point because it seems to show that
preference for whites is OK, but preference for blacks isn't.
   Let me go to the Senator from Alabama.
   Senator HEFLIN. Judge, just to follow up briefly, it is my informa-
tion that as the Chairman of the EEOC you hired 49 individuals
who reported directly to you in the headquarters office. Of these,
26 were women, 53 percent; 33 were members of minority groups,
67 percent; and that you hired 29 special and executive assistants,
of whom 14 were women, 15 were black, 1 was Hispanic, and 2
were Asian.
   Did you have a policy of preferences during the time you were
hiring them?
   Judge THOMAS. Senator, my policies were as I stated. I looked
long and hard to make sure that any number of people, whether
they were minorities, women, individuals with disabilities, were in-
cluded in my search. I always, to the best of my abilities, hired the
best qualified people.
                                          364

   Senator HEFLIN. All right. Now let me briefly visit this issue of
privacy. You have testified that you find in the word "liberty" of
the 14th amendment a right of privacy, and you indicated that this
right of privacy extended to the marital relationship. And then to
Senator Biden, you testified that you thought an individual had a
right of privacy.

  Now, I don't want to misquote you or anything. Would you clari-
fy your exact status as to the right of privacy and how it applies
particularly to individuals?

  Judge THOMAS. The point, I think the exchange that we had was
along this line: That there was a right of privacy as established in
Griswold, and that that applied to the marital relationship. The
question then became was there a right of privacy that applied to
nonmarried individuals, and the point that I was making was that
that right of privacy in the intimate relationship was established
using equal protection analysis under Eisenstadt v. Baird. And I
think that is where we left it.

  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, do you come to the conclusion that the
fifth amendment contains a right of privacy under the word "liber-
ty"?

  Judge THOMAS. That is a question that I have not considered, but
I don't see where there would be--in the analysis I would parallel
the analysis with the 14th amendment. But, again, that is an anal-
ysis that I have not--I don't know of a particular case that has
based it on that.

  Senator HEFLIN. What are your feelings regarding the incorpora-
tion doctrine?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I certainly have not any occasion--and I
certainly don't--to object or to criticize the incorporation doctrine.
I think the only concern that I have seen that has been raised has
to do with individuals who might think that the incorporation doc-
trine limits--I think along the lines perhaps of Justice Black,
would be the limit of rights that individuals have.

  Senator HEFLIN. Would you have any concerns with the selectivi-
ty of Justice Black's incorporation doctrine?

  Judge THOMAS. The exclusivity of it.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, under the Constitution, I don't think there
is any question that there is a right to life in the 14th and 5th
amendments. It may well be that one of the purposes of govern-
ment is to protect life.
  I think we have found that the right to life is not absolute and
that there are questions as to whether or not the right of privacy
would be absolute. Regarding the right to life, you have the death
penalty, for example, which is a limit. You have to go through the
due process of law and other aspects that might be controlling.
  In the event that there is a conflict between two principles of
constitutional right, do you have a methodology by which you
would give a priority to one right over another when there is such
a conflict?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that the occasions on which
there has been conflicts or the ones usually in which there is a
right asserted have to do with the Government in some way becom-
ing involved or regulating a particular right. And what the courts
have attempted to do, of course, is to determine how to value that
                                         365

right--is it a fundamental right? And if it is a fundamental right,
then, of course, the state would have to show that it has a compel-
ling interest in some way regulating this particular activity.

  I think that that is important. It is one thing to state what the
constitutional analysis is, but I think what it says to us all is that
we place a very high value on certain rights that we have that we
consider core fundamental rights in our society. And the state
must show a reason that is extraordinary, compelling, overwhelm-
ing as to when it decides that it is going to do something that inter-
feres with these rights that we value very highly. So I think that--
and that, of course, can be stated with different degrees of preci-
sion, but in the equal protection analysis, that is precisely what we
are attempting to do, is to value those rights and to require more
of the States--we are not going to defer to what the state is doing
simply because it is the Government, but rather you must have a
reason for doing it.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU have testified several times during this
hearing that when you were Director of the EEOC you felt that the
EEOC laws pertaining to discrimination in employment didn't have
enough teeth in them. What teeth would you advocate being added
to the discrimination in employment rights statutes that give reme-
dies?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I am not going to--let me answer it in this
way, Senator, without being evasive. I know that there is pending
legislation before this body in that area, and I don't think I should
get involved in that debate.

  But during my tenure at EEOC--and I think it is a matter of
written record that I abhor discrimination, and I think that title
VII undervalues the damage done by discrimination in the employ-
ment context. I have advocated damages. I have advocated con-
tempt proceedings. I have advocated penalties. Something that
would do more than say to an employer, All you have to do is hire
the person that you discriminated against or pay that person what
you would have paid that person.

  That was my approach to saying I think--or the country saying
we are serious about the damage done by employment discrimina-
tion, at least as serious as we are about other kinds of noncompli-
ance with our civil laws.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, you have stated a number of times that
you didn't think there were sufficient teeth in those laws. Did you
ever make a recommendation, in writing or orally, as to additional
teeth that should be added by the administration--that they ought
to look at it from a legislative viewpoint?

  Judge THOMAS. I certainly did.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU did?
  Judge THOMAS. I did. I can't remember whether I ever reduced it
to writing, but it was something--I guess at some point I probably
began to sound like a broken record.
  I advocated it in this context, Senator: I felt that we should have
had a positive civil rights agenda, a very aggressive civil rights
agenda, even if we disagreed as to specific policies. And I felt that
adding to and enhancing the sanctions of title VII could be a signif-
icant part of that.
                                         366

  Senator HEFLIN. DO you remember any of the specifics that you
advocated?

  Judge THOMAS. I think they were generally as I indicated to you,
that there should be increased damages, perhaps penalties, and
even treble damages, and certainly a use of contempt proceedings
where there were violations of court orders.

  Senator HEFLIN. Treble damages would be punitive damages,
then, wouldn't they?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I think discrimination--my view was that
discrimination was abhorrent enough to make that appropriate.

  Senator HEFLIN. All right. From your life and history, you are
somewhat of an enigma. You have gone through many changes in
your life, and American society in the last three decades has gone
through many changes. The thinking of individuals evolves, and in-
dividuals change with time.

  You have told us about your background in your opening state-
ment and through testimony here. It is interesting to note that you
decided at one time in your life that you wanted to study to be a
priest, and you went to a seminary and then to another seminary
in Missouri.

  Articles that I have read by Juan Williams of Atlantic Monthly
and by Karen Tumultree of the Los Angeles Times, among others,
have described your experiences--that you suffered the pains of
racial slurs in the seminary when at night people in the dormitory
would say, "Clarence, smile, so we can see you.

  Then I believe instances have been recited on the death of
Martin Luther King and the callous statements of hatred that
were made by your fellow students relative to that. Would you tell
us what happened?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, Senator, with respect to going to the semi-
nary, of course, that is always a very, very deeply personal choice,
it is a deeply personal religious choice. When you make that deci-
sion at 15, there is always opportunity for change and growth and
development.

  The point that I was in my first year of college, though, and be-
ginning to grow and to develop as an adult, I can still remember
that afternoon--actually, it was in the evening that one of the stu-
dents who was walking up the stairs in front of me, whose name I
have never revealed and won't, didn't know I was behind him, and
someone yelled from the basement, "Martin Luther King has been
shot," and he said, without looking behind him to see that I was
there, "That's good, I hope the s.o.b. dies." That was the moment,
the precise moment that I decided to leave the seminary and the
moment when I began to be involved personally in much of the
marches and participating in changing our society, and left the
seminary.

  The seminary, at Conception, was in a very, very remote area. If
you are in the area, it is Conception Junction, MO. That is near
Savannah, MO, near St. Josephs, MO. It is in the northwest corner
of Missouri. One would have to really be there or lost, to know
where you are. You either know where you are or you are definite-
ly lost.

  We went down immediately after that to Kansas City to partici-
pate in a number of the marches, and there were other events
                                         367

which I won't get into that occurred that summer that were equal-
ly as difficult and touching, and it was at that point that I trans-
ferred to and went to Holy Cross College.

  Senator HEFLIN. Also, I believe you told me in my private con-
versations with you that this was an influencing factor which
caused you to decide not to become a priest, is that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. It was as deeply influencing factor in that deci-
sion and many, many aspects of my life.

  Senator HEFLIN. Of course, I think part of this shows you do
have a sensitivity to the factors that have occurred relative to the
movement or progress of race relations, and I think that ought to
be brought out, in fairness to all parties concerned.

  Now, you went to Holy Cross. What did you major in at Holy
Cross?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I transferred to Holy Cross for my sopho-
more year and I majored in English literature. People would ask
me why I majored in English literature, and my response has been,
and it is accurate, I majored in English literature as a second lan-
guage. I simply did not have the capacity to speak and use English
at a level that I thought necessary to function in this society, so I
decided to major in English. I had been fortunate enough in the
seminary to have had Latin, to have had German, and to have had
French, which all were helpful in teaching grammar, but I needed
English, I needed to be immersed in something that I found pain-
fully difficult, and that was the basis of my major.

  Senator HEFLIN. What did you minor in?
  Judge THOMAS. I think protest. [Laughter.]
  Senator HEFLIN. Protest?
  Judge THOMAS. I didn't have a minor, Senator. We had a core re-
quirement, those were the last years of core requirements, and you
were required to take specific courses, metaphysics, philosophy,
those sorts of things.
  Senator HEFLIN. At Holy Cross, of course, you were proud of that
time that you had been involved in demonstrations. In Karen Tu-
multree's Los Angeles Times article, it says,

  In combat boots and army fatigues and sometimes a leather tarn of the Black Pan-
thers, Clarence looked the part of the angry radical, as he strolled down the campus
of Holy Cross College. He opposed the Vietnam War, but helped found the College
Black Student Union. Thomas' most notable act of defiance came after a 1969 pro-
test against the parents of a recruiter from General Electric Company, a company
that had been heavily involved in the Vietnam War. Thomas was one of a group of
black students who believed that blacks had been unfairly singled out and disci-
plined by campus officials. They walked off, effectively resigned from the college in
protest. The protestors didn't wear T-shirts and jeans, but suits and ties. Later, they
were granted amnesty and allowed to return.

  Other articles would indicate that you led a protest against the
South African investments of Holy Cross trustees. Is that a descrip-
tion that is fairly accurate of your attitude and your participation
in various protests and affairs of that time?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think as I have attempted to indicate
over the past few days, that I have always been--not always, but
throughout my adult life and perhaps since the age of 16 or 17,
very much involved and interested in all of these issues.

  When I went to Holy Cross, there was as tremendous amount
going on, and one of the areas that was of great concern to me was
                                         368

what I perceived at that age as injustices in our society, and what I
attempted to do was to be involved and to protest and be active in
protesting what I thought were injustices in a way that is permit-
ted in our society.

  One of the activities was what we designated in later years, in
1969, the walkout, that is that we felt that some students, minority
students, were being unfairly treated, and as I remember it, we did
not walk out with the intention of coming back. The walkout was,
to my way of thinking, a walkout, it was leaving, in fact returning
home. The only thing I hadn't figured out was how I was going to
face my grandfather.

  But the other activities that we were involved in included free
breakfast programs, tutoring programs, and I think that interest
has been true throughout, the same interests that I have had
throughout my life, that has not changed, although I have es-
chewed the combat boots and the fatigues for suits that I think are
overpriced. [Laughter.]

  Senator HEFLIN. In this Los Angeles Times article, it says,
"Today, he seems embarrassed about those days."

  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HEFLIN. DO you want to respond to that?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I am no more embarrassed about feeling
strongly and passionately about injustice than I am about doing
anything else in my life. I think that I would rather have those
days of wanting to participate in our political process, even though
I have grown and matured, than saying that I spent all of my col-
lege days drinking beer and having a good time.
  Senator HEFLIN. In this article, it goes on and says,

  In a November 1987 interview with Reason Magazine, he lamented, the thing that
bothered me when I was in college was that I saw myself rejecting the way of life
that got me to where I was. We rejected a very stable and disciplined environment,
an environment with very strict rules, an environment that did not preach any kind
of reliance on government.

  Do you want to comment on that?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, as I have indicated in these hearings, the
environment in which I grew up was a disciplined environment, it
was one in which you were expected to be up early. I can still re-
member my grandfather on Saturday mornings, when he thought
we were going to sleep until 7 or 7:30, he would come to the open
windows of our bedrooms and just simply say, "Y'all think y'all
rich," and that had a way of inspiring me to get up. [Laughter.]
  But it was as disciplined environment and it was one that re-
quired a lot of effort. My concern wasn't so much or juxtaposing
that environment with the protests that we were engaged in. I
thought that was appropriate. But if you remember that time, it
was as protest or challenging of all authority and all rules that we
grew up by, and it was that. The question was raised, why should
we take metaphysics, why should we study until 11 or 12 at night,
all those questions were raised.
  I thought that the efforts or among the factors that had permit-
ted me, in addition to Holy Cross being so good as to accept me, the
things that had permitted me to survive and to do welt there was
to take advantage, to work and to take advantage of those opportu-
nities, again, as I said earlier, to burn the midnight oil, and that
                                         369

was a part of the past that I saw us beginning to challenge or ques-
tion.

  Senator HEFLIN. Why did you decide to go to law school and
become a lawyer?

  Judge THOMAS. There were a couple of reasons, Senator, that I
thought at the time were of major proportion. You know, we all
wanted to change the world at that time. I guess at that age you
think you actually can go out and change the world. I wanted to
right some wrongs that I saw in Savannah, some specific wrongs
with respect to my grandfather and what he was able to do with
his life, as well as to the overall wrongs that I saw as a child there.

  During law school, I did go back in the one summer that I
worked for a law firm to Savannah, in an effort to do that. I did
not decide to return to Savannah and, instead, went to Missouri,
but it was my goal during the entirety, it was my reason for going
to law school and it was my goal until my third year to return to
Savannah and practice law.

  Senator HEFLIN. I started talking about your background. You
were in an enigma or experiencing a good deal of uncertainty or
changing ideas. During these hearings I think you have maybe sur-
prised some people with your position, for example, on the fact you
don't think natural law ought to be used as a method of constitu-
tional adjudication, that you support, in effect, public housing, that
you believe multiple languages ought to be used and we ought not
to have an English-only approach in governmental activities and
schools. You found a right of privacy. You seem to have an adher-
ence to the present methodology in deciding cases on separation of
church and state. You have expressed some ideas that would indi-
cate you believe that the Constitution evolves and develops, as
issues change, and certainly in your own office, it is subject to the
idea that you did follow some affirmative action, which brings us to
the question of what is the real Clarence Thomas like or what will
the real Clarence Thomas do on the Supreme Court, if he is con-
firmed.

  Some believe you are a closet liberal, and some, on the other
hand, believe you are part of the right-wing extreme group. Can
you give us any answer as to what the real Clarence Thomas is like
today?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that during the past 10 weeks,
people have written and formed conclusions about me, and that has
gotten to be a part of this process. I think they are free to do that.
But it reminds me of the story that I heard about Judge Hayns-
worth during his ill-fated nomination and confirmation process in
which he was reading about himself in the morning paper, and
having read the story, he looks up and says to his wife, "You know,
I don't like this Haynsworth guy either." [Laughter.]

  Senator HEFLIN. I thought it was otherwise; that his wife said
that. [Laughter.]

  Judge THOMAS. Well, either way, it works.
  The point is, though, Senator, that people form conclusions. The
one aspect of a lot of the publicity that I did like was that my
friends from as far back as my college years--and I mean my
friends, not people who have claimed to be friends--have pointed
out the continuity and consistency, the growth and development.
                                         370

That has been one of the most touching aspects and rewarding as-
pects of the past 10 weeks in reading and hearing.

  But those conclusions that people form about you were not--
about me were not the real Clarence Thomas. I am the real Clar-
ence Thomas, and I have attempted to bring that person here and
to show you who he was, not just snippets from speeches or snip-
pets from articles. The person you see is Clarence Thomas. I don't
know that I would call myself an enigma. I am just Clarence
Thomas. And I have tried to be fair and tried to be what I said in
my opening statement. And I try to do what my grandfather said,
stand up for what I believe in. There has been that measure of in-
dependence.

  But, by and large, the point is I am just simply different from
what people painted me to be. And the person you have before you
today is the person who was in those army fatigues, combat boots,
who has grown older, wiser, but no less concerned about the same
problems.

  Senator HEFLIN. I believe my time is up.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. I think we will continue to go, and
we will move to Senator Brown, and then we will break for lunch
after Senator Brown finishes.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, I must confess this morning's testimony has
helped me understand you a great deal better, particularly your
comment about why you chose English. If I heard it correctly, you
said it was because it was painfully difficult for you. It does help
me to understand why you would want to undergo a fifth confirma-
tion hearing, if nothing else.
  I am sure you appreciate the reason for this extended confirma-
tion hearing and the multitude of questions. Some have alleged
that the Senate is made up of 100 Secretaries of State, but I have
long thought it was more like 100 Justices of the Supreme Court
than Secretaries of State. And it is obvious that we have a fascina-
tion and a continued interest in the work that you may well take
on.
  Over the course of our hearings, you have declined to indicate
how you would rule on specific cases, and clearly that is in line
with what both Democrats and Republicans on this committee have
indicated is the practice and, in effect, the canons of ethics for
judges, to not rule on a case without hearing the facts and listening
to it.
  The media advise us that you had a meeting with the President,
however, up at Kennebunkport, and I am wondering if in your dis-
cussions with the President you took a similar position. Did you de-
cline to discuss with the President or indicate to the President how
you would rule on specific cases?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, after I arrived in Kennebunkport, some-
what bewildered and not knowing exactly what was going to
happen--in fact, not knowing what was going to happen--the
President asked me to chat privately with him, and he said that he
had two issues that he wanted to discuss. The first was: If you are
nominated, will your family be able to sustain or to survive this
process, because it will be a difficult process? Not knowing really
what would come, my answer was yes. In retrospect, I might adjust
                                             371

that a little bit and certainly would have conversed with him more
at length about it.

  The second question that he asked me was--and I think this is
almost verbatim: Can you call them as you see them? And then he
went on to indicate that if he did not agree with me, were I to be
confirmed and sit on the Supreme Court, that I would never see
him criticizing me in public, even if I disagreed with him or he dis-
agreed with me. And I assured him that I could call them as I saw
them and that I would as honestly as I could and to the best of my
abilities. And he indicated that he was going to nominate me at 2
o'clock and suggested that we have lunch.

  Senator BROWN. Since that meeting, have you had any discus-
sions with the President where you have committed how you would
vote on a particular case or a particular legal doctrine?

  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator BROWN. In other words, you have given the President
the same ethical treatment you have given us?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I have tried to be consistent across the
board, Senator.
  Senator BROWN. Earlier, Senator Heflin had mentioned property
rights, and we discussed a great deal about various theories of pro-
tecting property and individual rights. If I understand the cases
correctly, our courts protect personal rights like abortion and
others with a standard called "strict scrutiny"--that is, the Gov-
ernment has to have a compelling Government interest for any re-
strictions on those rights--but that a different standard applies for
the protection of property rights, called the "rational basis test,"
"rational relationship test," protected by requiring some rational
relationship between the legitimate, not necessarily compelling,
purpose and means chosen to achieve that purpose.
  At least in my mind, I think there are a number of reasons why
this distinction between personal rights and property rights simply
doesn't hold water, is artificial.
   First, it strikes me that the property rights are of obvious con-
cern to the Framers of our Constitution. They are named specifical-
ly in the Constitution with explicit references both to contracts and
property.
   Second, I believe that property is simply an extension of personal
rights and vice-versa, that to separate them, to assume that they
are different somehow, really reflects, I think, a distorted view of
how our society works.
   Third, the political and moral values that we all hold dear strike
me as dependent upon private property and the freedom to con-
tract.
   When I first decided to run for the State legislature, I was very
dependent on a job. My boss was a very liberal Democrat who was
active in the Democratic Party. If I had lost my income to support
my family, if I had lost my job, I think it would have had a major
effect on my freedom of speech and my political rights. And for the
courts or this country to pretend that somehow your right to prop-
erty is inferior or isn't integrated with your personal rights, I think
is ignoring the reality of our society.
   I must say I am troubled by the artificial distinction that has
been discussed. To provide a lower level of protection for property
                                         372

rights I think endangers personal rights, and perhaps the opposite
is true.

  I raise this because I think that artificial distinction, that differ-
ent treatment, the second-class protection that some have advocat-
ed strikes me as a real problem. We have talked a lot about a
zoning case, the Moore case, calls it to mind. It strikes me that that
was as much a violation of the right to use property as it was a
violation of the personal rights of the individuals involved. And it
seems to me it is an insult to the American people to somehow
think that you can protect one without protecting the other or that
there is a second class of rights even though they are specifically
mentioned in the Constitution.

  Well, I mention that because I want to ask you about that again.
Professor Tribe is one who has great credibility, I think, with many
members of this committee, and many members have quoted the
professor. I thought it would be worthwhile to quote him in this
case on this subject.

  Here is a quote of what he wrote:

  The attempt to distinguish between economic rights and personal rights must fail.

  He later wrote:

  It will not do to draw a bright line between economic and civil liberties or be-
tween property and personal rights. As Justice Stewart observed, the dichotomy is a
false one. Property does not have rights. People have rights. In fact, a fundamental
interdependence exists between the personal right to liberty and the personal right
to property. That rights in property are basic civil rights has long been recognized.

  The question, Judge, is this: Do you find laid out in our Constitu-
tion language that calls for a second-class level of protection for
property rights?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that we have certainly--as we
have discussed in these hearings, I have said in my own writings
that there should be a recognition of property rights--economic
rights, and I was talking in that case more about my grandfather
and his ability to, as you say, earn his living, not be denied that.

  But I think what the courts have done in the regulation of the
social and economic affairs of our country has been--and I think
appropriately so. As I have noted, I have no quarrel with the equal
protection analysis that the Court uses. The Court has tried to
defer to the decision of the legislature. In other words, the balances
should be struck by this body or by the political branches and not
second-guessed by the courts.

  I have no reason to quarrel with that approach. It recognizes
that the considerations are very complex and involve any number
of factors that are best left to the legislative branch.

  Senator BROWN. In relation to the comments by Professor
Tribe--by phrasing it this way, I am not suggesting that I want
you to become an adherent of the good professor. But on this sub-
ject, thinking about the comments of Professor Tribe and Justice
Stewart, when they conclude that the dichotomy between personal
rights and property rights is a false one, would you agree with
that? Do you find yourself in agreement with that? Do you have
any observations about that?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think certainly I have not re-examined
that or looked at that as a judge. It would require me to sit here
                                         373

and attempt to formulate an opinion on that. Of course, I think we
all at bottom feel strongly that we should have the freedom to
work and to support our families or to provide a part of the sup-
port for our families and for ourselves. And we certainly don't feel
that--that is one of the reasons why this body passed title VII of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and made those difficult choices. But it
is also reasons why you protect individuals in the work force so
that they are not harmed in a variety of ways by the conduct of
their employer or the environment itself.

  I think that those are complicated decisions. We value our ability
to own property and to engage in work. But there is a balancing
that must take place, and I think that the courts have appropriate-
ly chosen to defer to the Congress or to the legislature, the political
branches, in making those balances.

  Senator BROWN. Well, I appreciate that comment. I must say
from my own point of view, at least my judgment in society, those
that are extremely wealthy don't have to worry about this very
much. They have got theirs. But a right to work and save and have
an opportunity to keep a fair share of what you produce in this
world is darn important to somebody who starts off in life without
much, because it is one of the ways they go from the bottom to the
top. And I would hate to think in this country that we would
assign second-class treatment to someone's ability to go from the
bottom to the top, to acquire property, to save, to reinvest, to have
a chance to protect the things that they produce for themselves.

  I for one think a distinction, an artificial distinction between
those rights misses the whole point and perhaps jeopardizes that
fundamental ability to be a mobile society, to move up.

  A couple other areas that I want to invite you to comment on. I
appreciate that these are areas that the Court may take up, but if
you have observations you would care to make, I would like to
have them on the record.

  The interstate commerce clause is one that has critical impact in
terms of Congress and its ability to direct the States and others in
this society. Over the years we have had a wide variety of decisions
regarding the extent of the interstate commerce clause. One of the
landmark cases in the early 1940's basically indicated almost any-
thing we do in any way can affect interstate commerce.

  I would be interested in your view of the interstate commerce
clause and how philosophically you would approach the questions
that deal with it.

  Judge THOMAS. I think that you are right in the sense that the
Court has read those provisions rather broadly. But I make this
point, and I underscore that by saying I don't have any objection or
basis to object or at this point any quarrel with the way that the
Court has interpreted the interstate commerce clause.

  But I make this point--and I have heard some academic objec-
tions from time to time. But I can remember reading, I believe the
Heart of Atlanta Motel case which challenged, I believe, the accom-
modations provisions in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which is based
on the interstate commerce powers. And one of the factors that
was used there was that blacks who traveled across the country
were impeded from traveling because of the lack of accommoda-
tions.
                                               374

  What that brought to mind was that when I was a kid and we
would travel occasionally--I think two or three times during my
childhood--by highway from Savannah to New York, my grandfa-
ther would go through this long exercise of making sure that the
car was working perfectly, that you had new tires, that we had a
trunk full of food, et cetera, because there were no accommoda-
tions. And should you break down, you would be met with hostil-
ities. That was the reality. So there was indeed some, I would con-
sider significant, impediment on the ability of us to travel and cer-
tainly, by extension, on the flow of commerce or travel in our socie-
ty.

  I have no quarrel, Senator, with the approach that the Court has
taken and certainly have had no opportunity to review all of the
cases.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  The ninth amendment has come up a great deal in the hearing,
and I think continues to be an evolving area of the law. Some have
viewed the ninth amendment as providing a limitation on the
powers of the Federal Government over the individual. Others
have viewed the ninth amendment as a provision that, in effect,
mandates governmental activity of a certain nature.
  Would you share with us your thoughts on that particular
amendment?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I have indicated earlier, I think that
whatever we do with open-ended provisions such as the ninth
amendment, that we make sure as judges that those decisions are
fettered to analysis or something other than our own predilections
or our own views. That would be the concern, the generic concern,
as I have said before, with any of the open-ended or more open-
ended provisions.
  The Court, to my knowledge, has not used the ninth amendment,
a majority of the Court, to decide a particular case. And there has
been debate about what the purpose of the ninth amendment is.
  There could be a time when there could be an asserted right
under the ninth amendment that would come before the Court in
which there could be found to be a basis for that right in the ninth
amendment. I don't know. But as scholars do more work and cer-
tainly as individuals begin to assert rights and the Court begins to
consider those, I wouldn't foreclose that from occurring.
  Senator BROWN. One last question--and I think I still have time.
There has been a great deal of discussion about antitrust policy in
the last several decades. I end up viewing antitrust policy as essen-
tial for helping guarantee a competitive economy. It is one of the
features about America that is somewhat unique. While many
other countries have sanctioned monopolies, sanctioned conglomer-
ate control over the markets, the United States has really been a
pace-setter in demanding that we have competition within our
marketplace.
  There have been many challenges to those concepts of antitrust
statutes in recent years. I can appreciate that you do not want to
deal with specific cases, but I would be interested in your view of
the antitrust concepts and any remarks you would like to make
about their merit.
                                         375

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my grandfather was a small business-
person, one oil truck, an ice truck, and a vacuum cleaner to clean
stoves, and two little kids to run with him and also to help answer
phones.

  I think that competition in the private sector is healthy in our
society. It is healthy not only from the standpoint of the businesses
themselves, particularly the smaller businesses, but it is also
healthy from the standpoint of products, quality of products that
are brought to consumers, as well as prices.

  I think that our economy and our country expands and provides
opportunities to absorb individuals who otherwise would not have a
chance. It is one that is very interesting. After growing up in a
household where there is a small business, literally not a separate
office, it is the house, you get the feeling of how important it is to
have this opportunity to be a part of this competition and to not be
foreclosed by certain individuals monopolizing an entire area. So,
just reacting as a person, I think that it is important that we have
healthy competition in the economic arena.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  It is 20 minutes to 1 now. Do you want to keep going? Actually, I
think that we should break for lunch, and come back at quarter to
2. We will recess until quarter to 2.
  [Whereupon, at 12:45 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 1:45 p.m., the same day.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order, please.
  We will attempt to finish tonight, but I want to emphasize that if
Senators continue to have questions, we will not. I still think that
it is possible to finish. All of the Senators were told at the begin-
ning of thse hearings that we would not go late today, and I want
to be able to accommodate those Senators who made plans in their
home States. Since deregulation, I know you can't catch a lot of
planes to a lot of places other than at specific times.
  Our good friend from Wyoming has such a commitment based on
the assertion the Chair made that we would not go late on Friday.
My two colleagues from Illinois and Wisconsin, who have not yet
had a second round, have been gracious enough to yield to him for
a third round or part of a third round so that we can try to meet
the twin obligations.
  Just as the Court always has to balance things, Judge, we are
having to balance needs here, and we are going to apply a strict
scrutiny test after Senator Simpson asks his questions to determine
whether he met it.
  But, at any rate, all kidding aside, the Chair recognizes Senator
Simpson, and then we will go in order, Illinois and Wisconsin.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I do very much appreciate that.
I do have to catch a plane. There are others, and you have accom-
modated us all on both sides of the aisle, but particularly I want to
thank my friends, Paul Simon and Herb Kohl, I appreciate that
very much. And I really intend to just do 2 minutes, and then that
will conclude my activities. Thank you for your courtesies on that.
  My remarks I wanted to share, I think the committee would be
interested. I became so intrigued as to the EEOC issue that I went
down to the EEOC. I had seen our colleague from Missouri go
                                         376

there. I don't know how many of my colleagues on the committee
have paid a visit to the EEOC, but I made it a point to do that
about 6 weeks ago.

  I spent a couple of hours there at the agency's offices on 18th
Street speaking with their employees about the effects and the re-
sults of Clarence Thomas' tenure at that organization. I visited
with employees who were black, white, Hispanic. I spoke with per-
sons who were handicapped, old, and young. I spoke with employ-
ees holding jobs from that of manager to maintenance man. Some
had worked for both Eleanor Holmes Norton and Clarence Thomas.
Some had been there for many years while others had come during
his tenure.

  And I was stunned, as I looked in my notes, from what those
people said that day about Clarence Thomas; from just plain, you
know, "He did a hell of a good job," to things like, "We are a lot
better agency than we were when he came"; "We came further in
his 8 years than we did in the previous 18." I am quoting now. "We
feel proud now. Many of us didn't used to."

  "He may have opposed affirmative action goals and timetables
but told us that was his personal philosophy, and that we were to
follow the letter of the law." And then they did, and they cleaned
up the backlog.

  "From the time I got here until he left, I never saw Clarence
Thomas try to influence the way a case was being handled." "His
honest and integrity are what inspired me." "Clarence Thomas'
way was you follow the law."

  Another lady in this instance, "Clarence Thomas believed in re-
warding good work." And Hilda Rodriguez said, "Clarence Thomas
told us that we were the EEOC and that he was not, that he was
just a short-timer."

  One other person said, "We feared for our jobs when he came,
but I felt very proud about working for him after he came. Before
Clarence Thomas came here, you could just not move forward. On
his last day, one of the employees followed him out crying."

  Another person: "Over the last decade, this agency has gone
from mediocre to one of the Government's premier agencies. We
have earned that reputation, but Clarence led us there. The prob-
lem now is that other agencies hire away our good employees."

  One attorney said to me, "When I told Clarence Thomas about
the lapses in the age discrimination cases, he said, 'That is nearly
as bad as a lawyer dropping his client's case,' and he personally
told Senator Melcher about the laspses." However, the attorney
pointed out that "Less than 1 percent of all cases had lapsed."

  A handyman who went to work there in 1984 told me about a
problem he had with his daughter and how he could walk right
into Clarence Thomas' office and talk to him about that. That is
what he said.

  Another employee told me that, "He is the kind of person I
would like to have decide my case if I ever go before a judge. He
listens, keeps an open mind, and makes a decision based on
reason."

  I was told that, "When he left, on his last day he went down
from his upper floor office to the ground floor to leave. Every foyer
on every floor was filled with people." No one was out drumming
                                         377

that up. The employees were doing this. These employees made an
effort to have the building named after him, but they found they
couldn't do that because the Government didn't own the building.
However, the employees purchased, with their own funds, and put
up a plaque in the lobby. I have never seen that in any building
because it is really quite--it is almost corny in Washington, DC,
that that could happen. That is something out of one of those old
black-and-white movies.

  The plaque says:

  Clarence Thomas, Chairman of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion, May 17, 1982, through March 8, 1990, is honored here by the Commission and
its employees with this expression of our respect and profound appreciation for his
dedicated leadership exemplified by his personal integrity and unwavering commit-
ments to freedom, justice, and equality of opportunity, and to the highest standards
of government.

  Well, those are the folks from all walks of life who worked with
Clarence Thomas during his 8 years at the EEOC, and I think it is
very important that we hear those who know Clarence Thomas
best and what they have to say about him.

  And it came to me when Senator Leahy this morning noted that
we shouldn't ask or expect answers to questions about how you
might rule in specific cases. I do greatly concur obviously with
that. But Senator Leahy also noted that we need to know "how you
think, your background, your integrity, and impartiality, what
kind of a judge you will be." And I agree with that ever more.

  So I just wanted to share with the committee as to how the
people that worked with you felt about you. I think to a politician
it is like the moment of truth, and that is how many votes do you
get in your home precinct. I always like to look at that when I see
people here in this place. I always go back and go into their State
record and see how many votes they got in their home precinct. It
gives you a better idea of how they do and how they operate. So
among those that know you best, those are the things that I
wanted to share--integrity, impartiality.

  And my question--and I am going to conclude here. You were
interviewed for an article by Sarah J. Davidson. Do you recall that
article titled "Clarence Thomas, The Pragmatic Chairman of
EEOC"?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't recall specifically the interview,
but I know the name.

  Senator SIMPSON. YOU were asked a question by that lady in her
journalistic pursuit. Her question was: "How do you think that his-
tory will record your achievements?" Do you recall that question?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't recall the question, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. Oh, you should because you gave quite a glow-
ing answer to her. You don't remember the answer to it either?
  Judge THOMAS. It is probably still the same answer.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, let me give it to you, and then I am going
to leave, get on the plane and skip out of here.
  You were asked the question, How do you think that history will
record your achievements? "Well," you say,

   I just hope that whatever is said, whether someone agrees with me or disagrees
with me, they don't waste a whole lot of time on nonsensical things like where I
went to school and where I have worked and what I did before I came here. Simply
                                         378

bottom line, after everything is said, to hope that at least they say, "This was some-
body who tried to do what was right." That is all. They don't have to say anything
else. Just that, "In his lifetime, when he came to this agency, he tried to do what
was right and did not try to play politics and did not succumb to pressure from vari-
ous interest groups or politicians; he just took a mandate, took a job, and tried to do
what was right."

  That was your response to that lady's question. So it was. And I
wanted to report that very moving trip to the EEOC, and I really
have no questions.

  I thank you for your courtesies and thank especially my col-
leagues, Paul and Herb, Senator Simon and Senator Kohl, for their
courtesies. And thank you, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator. Have you an-
swered the question?

  Senator SIMPSON. He did answer the question. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  One of the questions that we face is: What really makes Judge
Thomas tick? That is really what Senator Heflin's questions were
approaching.
  When you told the story about Judge Haynsworth saying to his
wife, "I don't like this Judge Haynsworth guy," if we were to vote
in this committee on whether we like this Clarence Thomas guy, it
would be unanimous that we like Clarence Thomas. That is not the
question that we have to face. It is where you are going.
  When you told about being a student at Holy Cross, I would feel
comfortable voting for that student for the Supreme Court. And
then in describing yourself, you said, "Then we thought we really
could change the world"--making it past tense.
  Some of us still think we can change the world. Maybe not in
huge giant steps, but in little steps. And you are going to a place
where you are going to change the world for a lot of people.
  The people on the Supreme Court who voted for Dred Scott
changed the world. The people who voted for Plessy v. Ferguson
changed the world for a lot of people. The people who voted in the
Brown decision and Roe v. Wade, changed the world.
  Members of the Supreme Court who voted on the Crowson deci-
sion that Senator Specter referred to, the set-aside, the Richmond
decision, have denied the right, the opportunity for a great many
people. They have changed the world for a lot of people.
  The Ward's Covedecision changed the world for a lot of people,
people like--again, quoting Senator Specter, "that lOth-grade drop-
out." And that is, I guess, the person that I am concerned about.
  Frankly, a person with Clarence Thomas' ability is going to
make out all right. Whether you get confirmed or not confirmed,
you are going to do very well. That lOth-grade dropout may not do
well.
  We all bring something of a philosophy to our jobs, and Senator
Simpson perhaps partially answered this question with his quota-
tion from that interview, the bottom line. But what is the political
philosophy, what is the judicial philosophy you bring to the U.S.
Supreme Court?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, when I spoke earlier about changing the
world, I think I would distinguish between the way that as a youth
                                         379

you feel that you can go out and take on everything tomorrow
morning and get it all accomplished tomorrow morning. At some
point I think you realize that you have to take a step back and
begin to approach it more--not so much in a rush or impatiently,
but persistently. And if there was one lesson that I learned during
that period, it was the difference between impatience and persist-
ence, the difference between being upset and being committed to
something.

  So today I didn't suggest or mean to suggest by using the past
tense that we felt that we could make a difference, or that we
could change the world, that we can't do that today or have an
impact today. I indicated earlier that I felt that if I were confirmed
by this body and were fortunate to be on the Supreme Court that I
could make a difference. And I also indicated that the same person
that was at Holy Cross with the same feelings, a little older and a
little wiser, is sitting before you.

  There was a time when in law school--and I was asked why I
went to law school. But there was a time actually before I went to
law school that I didn't think there was any reason to go to law
school. There was no further reason to prepare, to be ready to
make some of the changes in society. There was a time when many
of us didn't feel that working through the system, as we called it,
was worthwhile.

  So at some point we had to make the decision that if we pre-
pared ourselves--and as Abraham Lincoln said, I paraphrase it, I
will prepare myself and when the time comes I will be ready. What
will you be ready for? I don't know exactly, or didn't know. With
respect to my own approach, though, I tried to be persistent about
preparing to make a difference.

  As far as overall philosophy, Senator, as a judge I think that the
approach that I have taken has been one of starting with the legis-
lation or the document before me. It has been one to arrive at the
intent of this body in statutory construction and certainly in broad-
er analysis to not certainly impose my own point of view, but to be
honest, intellectually honest and honest as a person in doing my
job. I have done that.

  But there is something that you point to also that goes beyond
that, and I think this is either the third or the fourth time I have
appeared before you for confirmation. And the something that you
have been interested in is this, and I took it to heart--perhaps you
don't remember it, but in my job, my current position on the court
of appeals, one of the things that I always attempt to do is to make
sure that in that isolation that I don't lose contact with the real
world and the real people--the people who work in the building,
the people who are around the building, the people who have to be
involved with that building, the people who are the neighborhood,
the real people outside. Because our world as an appellate judge is
a cloistered world, and that has been an important part of my life,
to not lose contact.

  Senator SIMON. I think that is important, incidentally, and it is--
if you are confirmed--I assume that is not a message for me to stop
here, Judge.

  The CHAIRMAN. A vote.

        56-270 0--93 13
                                         380

  Senator SIMON. I think it is important, if you are confirmed, to
go out of your way to do that. It becomes very easy, whether you
are a Senator or a Supreme Court Justice, to become isolated.

  How do I reconcile what I sense are two Clarence Thomases? One
is the Clarence Thomas who is testifying here, that Holy Cross stu-
dent, and the other is the Clarence Thomas that says government
cannot be compassionate. Though here you have said, "I favor
public housing," if I can use another illustration, you were in the
magazine, Reason. You were interviewed. And they say, "So would
you describe yourself as a libertarian?" And you say, part of the
answer, "I certainly have some very strong libertarian leanings,
yes." And then you say, "I tend to really be partial to Ayn Rand,
the author. When she died, the New York Times had this comment
about her. It said, "Her morality constituted"--and I am quoting
now--"a reversal of the traditional Judeo-Christian ethic because
it viewed rational selfishness as a virtue and altruism as a vice."
She was opposed to Medicare. She was opposed to a lot of things
that a lot of us would say are part of having a responsibility to
those less fortunate in our society.

  Anyway, I see these two Clarence Thomases: One who has writ-
ten some extremely conservative and I would even say insensitive
things--maybe you wouldn't agree with that description--and then
I hear the Clarence Thomas with a heart. And Senator Heflin says
you are in part an enigma, and that is part of the enigma here.

  How do I put those two Clarence Thomases together, and which
is the real Clarence Thomas?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, that is all a part of me. You know, I
used to ask myself how could my grandfather care about us when
he was such a hard man sometimes. But, you know, in the final
analysis, I found that he is the one who cared the most because he
told the truth, and he tried to help us to help ourselves. And he
was honest and straightforward with us, as opposed to pampering
us, and prepared us for difficult problems that would confront us.

  With respect to the statement about government, I think I at-
tempted--the government being compassionate, and I don't have
that full quote. But I think the rest of that statement was some-
thing to the effect that people are compassionate. Government in
my view has an obligation to solve those problems and to address
those problems. We may disagree as to what the best solution is as
policymakers, but the fact of the matter is that from my stand-
point, as a community, as people who live in an organized society,
we have an obligation as a people to make sure that other people
are not left out. And I think I have said that, and it is important.

  But as individuals, I think that we have the capacity to be com-
passionate to others without that obligation, beyond that obliga-
tion.

  Senator SIMON. Well, as individuals, no one will argue with that.
But collectively we also have responsibilities.

  Judge THOMAS. Exactly.
  Senator SIMON. Your statement, "I don't see how Government
can be compassionate. Only people can be compassionate, and then
only with their own money, not that of others."
                                         381

  We have to make decisions here where we are going to say we
are going to take some money from taxpayers for public housing,
for food stamps, for things that are important.

  Anyway, this is one of the dilemmas that we face. And in this
quote here you are siding with the privileged on a lot of things, and
that is the reason for my question about South Africa yesterday.
One of the reporters said, "Why do you ask him about South
Africa? He is not a nominee for Secretary of State."

  I want to know what makes Clarence Thomas tick, and in that
connection, I mentioned the article where you were quoted as ob-
jecting to the tactics of the protestors at the South African Embas-
sy. Does anyone remember any more of the details of that?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, you asked me a question, as I remember
it--and correct me if my recollection is inaccurate. You asked me
whether or not that was coordinated in any way.

  Senator SIMON. Yes.
  Judge THOMAS. And my response and recollection remains the
same; that to the extent there was any--to the extent that those
comments coincided, I think it was as a result of a reporter calling
around.
  Senator SIMON. I also asked about Jay Parker, and yesterday's
Newsday, New York newspaper, has this article by Timothy M.
Phelps:

   Clarence Thomas asserted in Senate testimony yesterday that he did not know
that his good friend, James J. Parker, represented South Africa although former
aides say he did. A former assistant of Thomas, who asked not to be identified, said
recently that Thomas brought up the subject of Parker's representation of South
Africa in 1986. At that time Parker and a partner, William Keyes, were being paid
more than $360,000 a year to lobby for South Africa's foreign agents, according to
Justice Department records.

  Then I will skip a few paragraphs, but I don't think I am taking
anything out of context here.

   Thomas was asked yesterday by Senator Paul Simon about a New York Newsday
story outlining his relationship with Parker. The 43-year-old Federal appeals court
judge said he knew that Parker had represented some South African homelands but
not South Africa itself. "I was not aware, again, of the representation of South
Africa itself," Thomas said. "I was aware of Mr. Keyes' relationship with South
Africa. I was not aware of Mr. Parker's." But the former aide of Thomas at the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in an interview that Thomas
talked about Parker's representation of South Africa for 45 minutes at a staff meet-
ing in 1986. He said that somebody had to represent the South Africans, and that if
sanctions were passed, it would affect the black people more harshly than support-
ers of apartheid. "--well, I will not comment on that, though I think you would find
most blacks in South Africa differing--" the former aide said. She said that when
staff members entered the room for the meeting, Thomas had with him a newspaper
article outlining Parker's relationship with South Africa. She said he asked the staff
members what they thought of the article and became very angry when one said it
was hypocritical of Parker to take money from South Africans.

   Do you recall that at all?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator. As I indicated to you, I understood
or I knew about Mr. Keyes' representation. That is the best of my
recollection. I did not recollect nor was I aware until recently of
Mr. Parker's representation. I was aware, as I indicated, about his
involvement with the homelands. And I don't know who that aide
is or what article she is talking about.
   Senator SIMON. And you do not recall that meeting?
                                         382

  Judge THOMAS. I do not recall that exchange at all. I was aware,
however, of his representations and his trips to South Africa and
his representation of the homelands, but not the paid representa-
tion of South Africa itself.

  I do remember reading an article at some point indicating the in-
volvement of Mr. Keyes and the significant amount of money that
he was paid. I do recollect that.

  Senator SIMON. In the exchange, you mentioned your position on
divestiture at Holy Cross, and I commend you for that position.
You say, "I took a strong position on the board of trustees of Holy
Cross that we divest of stocks in South Africa. That was important
to me then, and, of course, that is contrary to a position that they
might take. But it was one that I felt strongly about."

  I have to say I find a little bit of conflict in that and your opposi-
tion to sanctions for South Africa. But a publication that has just
come out says--and I ask you whether this is accurate or not: "The
Reverend John Brooks, the school's president, says there was no
significant board opposition to Brooks' recommendation for divest-
ment and that he does not recall Thomas or anyone else taking or
needing to take a strong stand."

  Judge THOMAS. AS I indicated yesterday, there was significant
discussion, and it is as I recall it at the board meeting.

  Senator SIMON. OK. So that there was division
  Judge THOMAS. There was no opposition. Whether or not we
would act now or later was the nature of the discussion, as I re-
member it.
  Senator SIMON. One of the people you quote from in the course of
some of the speeches--and in fairness, if somebody went over all of
my speeches as carefully as I have gone over yours, I am sure they
could find a lot of things that I wouldn't be too proud of today. But
one of the things you say--Thomas said that the congressional
committee "beat an ignominious retreat before Colonel North's
direct attack on it and, by extension, all of Congress." That was a
speech before the Cato Institute in 1987. And then in a speech a
few months later, you say, "Congress' aggressive oversight of Fed-
eral agencies"--in commenting on it, I am quoting, it says, "As
Ollie North made perfectly clear last summer, it is Congress that is
out of control."
  I am concerned about quoting Oliver North, who I assume you,
along with all Americans, knew shredded papers, destroyed evi-
dence. This was done, in fairness, before he was convicted of a
felony. But how does Oliver North end up getting quoted, someone
who is, at least in my mind, not a hero, not for what he did as a
member of the Armed Forces, where he apparently was outstand-
ing. But when he shredded paper, when he destroyed evidence, he
is not the kind of person I would want to quote and I would think
Clarence Thomas would not want to quote.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I do not think I condoned--in fact, I
think I remember us having discussions about whether he had
done something improper, and my saying very distinctly that I felt
that if he had done something improper or wrong, that should be
addressed.
  The point that I was making there, and you note it in the con-
text--and I do not have that speech before me, but it was in the
                                         383

context of oversight hearings, and I think during a time when I
was having my own difficulty in that oversight process, and some-
times those hearings, though they serve the very, very important
function of ferreting out facts and responding to those, they can
often become highly charged, politicized public events.

  I think myself, like many others, that in that highly charged po-
litical environment that Colonel North took the advantage to him-
self and used that environment to his advantage, as opposed to suc-
cumbing to it.

  Senator SIMON. Since you are talking about the process, you have
spent 4 days now before this committee and you have had to go
through this grueling process, and it is that. What is your feeling,
as you reflect upon this process that you are going through? Does it
serve the Nation well, or does it not serve the Nation well?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, even before I was nominated, I was
asked that question, because when I was nominated to the court of
appeals, that was not exactly a joy ride and it had its difficulties. I
would

  Senator SIMON. I helped create those difficulties, as I recall.
  Judge THOMAS. Pardon me.
  Senator SIMON. I helped to create those difficulties, even though
I ended up voting you for the court of appeals.
  Judge THOMAS. That is OK, Senator. You know, we each have to
do what we think is best.
  Senator SIMON. Right.
  Judge THOMAS. I was asked that question then, and my response
to people who felt I should have returned to the kind of acerbic
comments about the process, was simply this, that we are, as
judges, in the least democratic branch of government. We have life-
time appointments. We make very, very important decisions, and
we do not stand for reelection. This process has to work.
  People can disagree as to the nature of the process, we can say
that it is flawed in one way or the other. Even in the speeches
where I talk about oversight, I may talk about the flaws, but I also
point out the importance of the legislative and oversight process.
  This process is necessary and it has to me become more clearly
necessary since I became a judge, and I have no reason to change
that view and, in fact, would feel very strongly about it, even
through this process, even if the process is difficult for me.
  Senator SIMON. Earlier, Senator Heflin asked you about the fifth
amendment and privacy implications. I mentioned yesterday, I
guess, or the day before, we were talking about the ninth amend-
ment, and there are in the Constitution some specific privacy
things about quartering militia and searching your home. When
you combine those specifics with the history of the ninth amend-
ment, is there a privacy implication also, in your opinion, in the
ninth amendment?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think I have made two points with re-
spect to that and with respect to the finding of the right of privacy.
I indicated that I felt that it was the analysis that I tended to
agree with or agreed with, was the finding of that interest or that
right in the liberty component of the due process clause.
                                         384

  The approach that you are talking about, of course, and I think
we discussed, was the approach that Justice Douglas took, and
similar to that was Justice Goldberg's approach.

  I think that no one really knows the extent to which the ninth
amendment can be used. There is a considerable amount of scholar-
ly working being done, as I said before, and there may be a point
where the Court has a case before it in which an asserted privacy
right or privacy interest is or could be found in the ninth amend-
ment. To date, though, a majority of the Supreme Court has not
done that.

  I would not foreclose it, Senator, but with respect to the privacy
interest, I would continue to say that the liberty component of the
due process clause is the repository of that interest.

  Senator SIMON. Let me just lobby you here now, if I may. This is
the only chance we get to lobby future Supreme Court Justices. I
think the ninth amendment is a very fundamental protection of
basic liberty and I would hope--there is an article written I believe
by a person named Rappaport at the University of--maybe it is
William and Mary, I am not sure where it is, but I will send you
the article, that gives some additional background on the ninth
amendment. I think that is important.

  I just received today, and I assume my colleagues have received,
a letter from 12 subcommittee and committee Chairs from the
House who worked with you in the EEOC, asking that--well, let
me just read the final line, and we can put the full letter in the
record:

  "We conclude Judge Thomas should not be confirmed as an Asso-
ciate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. His conformation
would be harmful to that Court and to the Nation."

  I do not know if you have seen the letter at all. There was a
somewhat similar letter when you were up for nomination for the
appellate court. Do you care to comment on that?

  Judge THOMAS. AS you indicated, Senator, there was a similar
letter when I was nominated to the court of appeals, and I think as
I may have indicated, either privately to you or maybe even in the
hearings, I can't remember which, that, of course, I would want in-
dividuals with whom I have had dealings in the past to be support-
ive of me, certainly to be as supportive of me as the people who
worked with me every day.

  But during my tenure at EEOC, we did have some differences of
opinion and some disagreements in a political and policymaking
context. I certainly do not agree with them and do not think

  Senator SIMON. I did not expect you to agree with their letter.
  Judge THOMAS. I think it is unfortunate, but, Senator, we had
our disagreements and I did not think that they rose to the level to
require a letter of that nature, but I can understand that they have
to take positions that they feel comfortable with.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you. I see that my time is up. I also see
we have a vote over on the floor.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Judge, Senator Kohl, to accommodate your schedule and every-
one else's schedule, went over to vote and should be back here by
the time we all are up and leaving. The committee will recess until
                                         385

Senator Kohl returns, which should be momentarily, and at that
time I would ask the staff to inform him that I would like him to
begin his questioning before I return or chair the hearing and start
the matter up.

  We will recess until Senator Kohl arrives.
  [Recess.]
  Senator KOHL [presiding]. The hearing will come to order.
  We are awaiting the return of Chairman Biden, but in the inter-
est of expediting the hearing, I will begin my conversation with
Judge Thomas.
  Let me say, Judge, as I said to you a minute ago, I am not sure if
I will be back for round three, but I have enjoyed having a chance
to talk with you this week. I think you have been just as forthcom-
ing as you possibly could be with the committee, to the best of your
ability, and to the best of my ability I have tried to be honest and
fair with you, and it is an experience that I will not forget and I
have enjoyed having a chance to be with you.
  Judge THOMAS. The same here, Senator.
  Senator KOHL. I would like to ask you for a minute about cam-
eras in the courts, Judge Thomas. As you know, many, many
States have cameras in the courts to some extent, and I think it
has been highly successful in helping to educate the public.
  Just in passing, I would like to say that I watch television per-
haps 10 hours a week and I would say 9 or 9V2 hours of C-SPAN,
which I think does an outstanding job of educating the American
public about public affairs and Government and things that are
really important in our society, if we are to foster democracy and
its growth and enlightenment--which certainly is very important
nowadays.
  But we do not have cameras in the Supreme Court. If you had to
make a judgment--yes or no--would you support the experimenta-
tion, at the very least, with cameras in the Supreme Court? After
all, as you know, virtually everybody in this country knows who
Judge Wapner is, and no one knows who Chief Justice Rehnquist
is. Can we do something about that?
  Judge THOMAS. Maybe we should give Chief Justice Rehnquist
his own sit-com. [Laughter.]
  Senator I too watch C-SPAN and, as a citizen, have had the
same reaction. It is a wonderful opportunity to see our governmen-
tal processes at the national level disseminated over the entire
country.
  With respect to the court systems, the only reservation that I
would have is that it not be disruptive of the exchange between the
Court and the individuals who appear before the Court. It is a dif-
ferent environment, particularly at the appellate level than per-
haps at the trial court level, but I have no objection beyond a con-
cern that the cameras in the court room be unobtrusive or as unob-
trusive as possible. Of course, that is just my own reaction. I have
not looked at that in detail.
  Senator KOHL. SO you have a positive feeling about it, you think
if we can do it without disrupting the activities of the Court it
would be a good thing for the American public?
  Judge THOMAS. I think it would be good for the American public
to see what is going on there. I do not know how long they would
                                         386

be interested in what goes on in appellate argument. It tends to be
not so--it does not rivet your attention, except maybe perhaps in
the cases that have garnered a tremendous amount of publicity,
but I see no reason why, beyond that concern, the American people
should not have access to the courts.

  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Thomas, no doubt you have been
reading the newspapers and listening to members of this commit-
tee. It is clear that many here on the committee seem troubled by
your failure to answer some of our questions, and others on the
committee seem troubled because they think that you have been
badgered too much.

  In terms of your own role and our role, what parts of the process
would you keep the same, if you could make a recommendation at
this time, and what do you think we ought to change to make these
hearings as productive and useful as possible--which is, after all,
what we are attempting to do in behalf of the American public that
we serve?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, you know, Senator, I probably would be
freer to make that kind of an analysis after the fact. [Laughter.]

  I would certainly love to come back. [Laughter.]
  Senator, the process of advice and consent is an important proc-
ess, it is critical, particularly for judges. In the executive branch,
we have appointments and serve at the pleasure of the President.
As judges, we serve for life. This process may have its flaws, but it
is so important that, with flaws and all, it is worthwhile.
  From my own standpoint, just going through the process, of
course, I would like to have been able to have gone through it in a
shorter period of time, but that is not an indication of anything
other than the manner and the timing of my appointment, but I
think that the process has been overall a very fair process to me.
  Senator KOHL. All right. I would like to quote from today's New
York Times, and ask your comment:

  Justice Souter did not feel pressed to remake himself, rather, his fluent testimony
gave the impression that his entire adult life had been a natural preparation for
being a Justice. On the other hand, in Thomas' case, strenuous efforts have been
made to fit what he has described as the proper judicial role. Judge Thomas has at
times given the appearance of having wrenched himself from his most authentic
personal moorings.

  Do you agree, disagree, or have some feelings about that--some
comments you would like to make, as we try to understand you
and your background, where you are today and where you have
come from?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, let me make two points, and one I allud-
ed to this morning. I think that various individuals created their
own images of me and what they see is that the real person does
not fit those images. I think the more accurate assessments to
follow would be the people who have worked with me every day
over the past or for significant portions of my adult career, both in
the executive branch and in the judiciary, as well as my other jobs,
and not to individuals who have created this persona.

  I am the same Clarence Thomas. I have been a sitting Federal
judge, Senator, for about a year and a half, and the person that
you see here is the same sitting Federal judge, someone who at-
                                         387

tempts to be openminded, who works at it, being impartial, objec-
tive, listen and to work through very difficult problems.

  And a final point: When I was in the executive branch, as I indi-
cated to you yesterday, there were battles and there were give and
takes. I participated in that, but I am not in the executive branch
any more, I am not a part of the tension between the two political
branches. I am a sitting Federal judge, and those are entirely dif-
ferent roles, and to the extent that individuals may see legitimate
differences, they are the differences in the roles.

  Senator KOHL. Would you agree that if, in Justice Souter's case,
we were seeing a person more natural and comfortable in the judi-
cial setting, it is simply a reflection of the fact that he had been in
that setting for a much longer time than you have been in the judi-
cial setting?

  Judge THOMAS. I think there is an additional factor, as well as
that, and that is that he did not have 138 published speeches in the
executive branch and he was not in agencies in the executive
branch involved in very, very controversial policies and difficult
policy areas. I brought with me a background in some very difficult
areas and areas in which people have strong, but honest opinions
on different sides. I think that is an important difference.

  If I had had the opportunity to remain, as he did, in an environ-
ment as a judge, without those controversial sorts of policy-making
positions, I think much the same would have been said about me,
because that is more suited to my personality.

  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Thomas, you have been extreme-
ly critical of the Senate's rejection of Judge Bork. In fact, in a 1987
speech to the ABA Business Law Section, you said that the Sen-
ate's failure to confirm Judge Bork was "a tragedy." I am interest-
ed in your views on how the Senate should discharge its advice-
and-consent responsibility, so would you tell us what it was about
the Senate's rejection of Judge Bork that was so improper?

  Judge THOMAS. I guess, Senator, the point for me there and,
again, my approach if I were making the decision, I think each
member of this body would have to decide for himself, but my view
was that Judge Bork was qualified as to his temperament, as to his
competence, and certainly qualified as to his overall abilities.

  The others may have had disagreements and for other reasons
felt that he should have been excluded and, of course, you have to
discharge your duties in the best way you see fit, but that was my
view at the time.

  Senator KOHL. SO, you are saying your overall assessment of the
man is that he was qualified, and that fact simply makes his rejec-
tion, in your opinion, a tragedy, just that simple overall assessment
that you

  Judge THOMAS. The other aspect of it
  Senator KOHL. Why was it
  Judge THOMAS. I thought, again, as a person and someone who
knew Judge Bork, that the publicity surrounding him and the
characterizations of him were ad hominem in nature and that the
articles that I read and the things that had been said about him
simply, even if there were substantial disagreements on attack of
the person, I have, even as I indicated during my own confirmation
                                         388

processes, I think ad hominem attacks on individuals, even when
there are legitimate differences, are just simply wrong.

  Now, I do not think that this committee and did not say that this
committee engaged in that, but that was certainly a part of the
overall process from the outside.

  Senator KOHL. And had you been sitting on this committee, the
chances are you would have voted for his confirmation?

  Judge THOMAS. Again, my view from where I sat, was, as to his
competence, as to his temperament, that he was qualified.

  Senator KOHL. For the past few days, Judge Thomas, you have
repeatedly suggested that this committee disregard a number of
the articles you wrote and speeches that you made while you were
in the executive branch. Using the same logic, should the Senate
have ignored Judge Bork's writings, because when he did them he
was in another area--he was an academic?

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, that the one point I made was
that if I gave speeches as a Federal judge, I thought that particu-
larly those should be closely examined, what I said as a Federal
judge, my opinions while I was in the judicial branch of Govern-
ment, in the judiciary.

  I think that you have to weigh or discount to the best of your
abilities or in your judgments speeches that are made outside of
the judiciary, when one has a different role, for example, a person
who is a law professor or a person who is in the executive branch,
but I think it would be important to look closely at a speech that I
made as a judge.

  Senator KOHL. What I said is that he made many of those
speeches when he was an academic, and you made many of the
speeches that you have asked us to disregard when you were out-
side of the judiciary. So using the exact same logic, it would be con-
sistent for you to say that you would support the contention that
the things Judge Bork said when he was an academic should, at his
request, be disregarded?

  Judge THOMAS. I would not say disregarded, Senator, and I do
not think I said disregard everything I have written. I think what I
suggested is that is a different role.

  Senator KOHL. Qualified or whatever the word is.
  Judge THOMAS. Exactly. I think that they are different and that
difference should be taken into account. One is freer to make com-
ments outside of the judiciary and to discuss issues in different
ways than one is within the judiciary, just as one is freer to make
policies and make decisions in a different way. In the judiciary, it
is more confined and I think appropriately more neutral.
  Senator KOHL. Judge Thomas, throughout the hearings, when
asked about specific speeches or articles, you have said that you
have not read or reviewed the articles or speeches recently. The
question I would like to ask is why you have not or why you did
not, in preparation for this hearing. I would have expected that
you anticipated being questioned about them. Why is it that you
did not read some of these obvious things that you or your advisers
would have forewarned you we were going to be talking about and
deserved a look? Why wouldn't you have become familiar with
them?
                                         389

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, there are a lot of speeches and
it is hard to review all of them, but what I have attempted to do is
review some here and some there, the ones that I felt were going to
be raised.

  Senator KOHL. Well, let us talk about the Lew Lehrman article.
Now, that was clearly a focus since the day that you were nominat-
ed, and it could have been understood by you--or anybody with
whom you were having breakfast from time to time--that this was
going to come up. There has got to be some reason you did not read
it other than you didn't think it was important. I mean you knew
we were going to talk about it, and yet you said at this hearing
that you haven't read it and are not really fully familiar with it. I
want to understand that from the point of view of one who wants
to believe what you say, so explain it to me a little better.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I re-read my speech at the Heritage Foun-
dation. What I suggested was I did not read his article. There is
just so much material, Senator. I attempted to read as much of my
own material, as well as to consider the fact that there was going
to be just a vast body of legal material, as well as my biographical
material, my background, my days at EEOC, my days at the Office
for Civil Rights, my opinions on the court.

  Senator KOHL. Yes, I understand, but this was an article that
had been referred to dozens of times all summer and, as I recall,
you came here--and correct me if I am wrong--but I think you
said, look, I can't really talk about that article, because I haven't
really read it or I will have to go back and re-read it, so don't hold
me responsible for its content, word for word, because I am not
really familiar with it. That was part of your distancing yourself,
however sincerely, from natural law and its applicability.

  Again, this may be my last opportunity to speak to you, and I
want to walk away with the strongest positive feelings I can, I am
puzzled as to why, in all the hours that you spent this summer
thinking about this week, why that article would not have been an
article that, in your mind or your friends' minds, wouldn't have
been something that you have to read it and understand what is in
it, because it is going to come up?

  Judge THOMAS. I guess to this extent, Senator, that my response
to questions concerning that article was that I cited it or praised it
for a very limited purpose or made comments about it for a very
limited purpose, and I stated what that purpose was. And that pur-
pose didn't suggest from my standpoint the need to go back and
learn everything about that particular article.

   The point that I am trying to make with respect to the volume of
other material, there were a lot--there were any number of areas
beyond that that have come up also that I have had to attempt to
address.

   Senator KOHL. Well, that is true. But I still want to say it was
clear that this article was going to be discussed in detail because of
what you said about it with relationship to natural law and its ap-
plicability. It was clear.

   There may have been other things, too, which you are alluding
to, but it was clear that this one was going to be talked about. So I
think it is logical for me to ask the question and expect some
answer on that--that I can feel comfortable about--why you
                                         390

wouldn't have come here fully familiar with the article and what it
said, and the fact that you had regarded it with great admiration

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I guess I would have to respond to that in a
similar manner to the way I just simply did, and that is that I did
not refer to it for the portions of the article that raised the ques-
tions.

  Senator KOHL. OK. Last subject, and that is antitrust law. Judge
Thomas, last year we celebrated the centennial of the Sherman
Act. For over 100 years, this landmark measure has protected the
principles that we consider most important--of competition, fair-
ness, and equality. The antitrust laws are important to us because
they ensure that competition among business of any size will be
fair and that consumers will pay the lowest possible prices for all
sorts of goods that they buy. These laws, as you know, are nonpar-
tisan. They have been vigorously enforced by both Republican and
Democratic administrations.

  I know you have worked on antitrust issues as both an advocate
and a judge. In fact, in a 1983 speech, you suggested that we create
treble damages for violations of the civil rights laws so that they
would have the same deterrent effect that the antitrust laws have.

  My question is: Do you agree that the antitrust laws have been
very important in shaping our economy?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that all of our efforts, including
the antitrust laws, to keep a free and open economy, one in which
there is competitiveness, where the smaller businesses can have an
opportunity to compete, and where consumers can benefit from
that--those efforts, including the antitrust laws, have been benefi-
cial to our country from my standpoint.

  Senator KOHL. Judge, do you believe that an important purpose
of the Sherman Act is to protect against consolidation of economic
power to make sure that consumers are not charged high prices by
large companies that have swallowed up their competition; that an
important purpose of the Sherman Act is to protect against consoli-
dation of economic power?

  Judge THOMAS. Yes, Senator.
  Senator KOHL. All right. So you believe the principal benefici-
aries of vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws are the consum-
ers?
  Judge THOMAS. I think the consumers and the country benefit
from strong competition. We certainly as consumers benefit when
there are new products, when there is development of products,
when the quality of the products are improved as a result of com-
petition, and, of course, when there is no temptation toward supra-
competitive pricing; in fact, pricing is at the lower levels.
  Senator KOHL. Well, then, how do you square this philosophy,
with which I agree, with a decision like the Illinois Brick decision
which bars the actual victim of any pricefixing from recovering
damages, which would, for example, prevent mothers claiming that
they were victimized by a conspiracy among infant formula compa-
nies from filing suit and collecting damages?
  Judge THOMAS. I can't say exactly, Senator, how I would square
it with that opinion. Certainly from my answers and certainly from
my own position, I would be concerned if any consumers are
having a more difficult time raising challenges in areas where they
                                         391

have been harmed by practices of--unfair practices or unlawful
practices of businesses.

  Senator KOHL. SO a decision like Illinois Brick is a decision that,
if it came before you again in a similar fashion, you might review
with great interest?

  Judge THOMAS. I would certainly be concerned when consumers
don't have access to our judicial system to have their injuries as a
result of unfair practices or illegal practices or unlawful practices
remedied.

  Senator KOHL. All right. Judge Thomas, I am concerned that
some judges would disregard the legislative intent of the antitrust
laws and substitute their own ideological agenda, an agenda that
may mean helping large corporations and ignoring consumers. I
would like to read you a statement by Judge Posner of my own sev-
enth court: "If the legislature enacts into statuary law a common
law concept, as Congress did in the Sherman Act, that is a clue
that the courts are to interpret the statute with the freedom with
which they interpret a common law principle, in which event the
values of the Framers may not be controlling at all."

  Do you believe that this is a legitimate approach to interpreting
statutes in general, and should the courts interpret the Sherman
and Clayton acts without exploring the legislative intent of their
authors?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I have indicated--and I think it is
very important for a judge to always be in search of, in adjudicat-
ing a case or interpreting a statute, the intent of the legislature
and certainly not to ignore that intent and not to substitute his or
her point of view or predilection for that intent.

  Senator KOHL. All right. And the last question is on resale price
maintenance, Judge Thomas. I want to talk about price-fixing for
just a minute, because it is particularly of concern to me with my
background. Since the Dr. Miles case in 1911, we have had in this
country a rule that prohibits the manufacturer from dictating the
retail price of his product. But some people have begun to argue
that we should treat vertical price-fixing differently from horizon-
tal price-fixing. And Robert Bork suggested in "The Antitrust Par-
adox," that it should be completely lawful for a manufacturer to
fix retail prices.

  Would you comment on that, please?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have no basis and have had no basis to
take a position different from the one that finds that there are
problems or concerns or perhaps illegality in vertical price-fixing
or that vertical price-fixing be exempt from the antitrust laws--let
me restate that.
  I have had no reason to argue or basis to argue that vertical
price maintenance should be exempted from the antitrust laws.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Judge Thomas.
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN, [presiding]. Judge, it is my responsibility to ask
questions now, but one of our colleagues, again, based on our belief
at the outset that we would end early on Friday, has a plane to
catch. We are going to try to finish, but we may have to go late in
order to finish. With the permission of my colleagues, I will go out
of order and yield to him, and then return to myself. I would yield
                                         392

at this time to my colleague Senator Grassley. It will not affect
who gets to ask questions next, except Senator Thurmond indirect-
ly. You are next in line after me.

  Senator THURMOND. Oh, you are through?

   The CHAIRMAN. NO.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, go ahead.
  The CHAIRMAN. I was just trying to
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, you go next.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is seldom that it is recognized that I am the
chairman by the chairman, but I am delighted that I am the chair-
man. [Laughter.]
  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, if I could go back to an area that we discussed
yesterday, the privacy area, and set a little background by remind-
ing you, in response to the chairman's question, you agreed that
"single people have the same right of privacy as married people on
the issue of procreation." And you agreed with the chairman that
"the privacy right of an individual is fundamental."
  Yesterday I tried to find out parameters on the constitutional
right to privacy, and let me make very clear I don't expect you to
prejudge any case. But if I could, I would like to get an idea of the
framework of the test to be applied in analyzing privacy rights.
You have endorsed the rationale and the holding of Eisenstadt.
Yesterday Senator Simpson and I raised the Bowersdecision.
  Now, the dissenters in Bowers found that Eisenstadt compelled
the opposite results from the outcome that the majority reached.
So the four people who were on the dissent did so on the basis of
Eisenstadt to recognize a broad and sweeping constitutionally pro-
tected privacy right. So I hope that this puts in context my con-
cerns and why I am bringing this up again.
  I wonder if your endorsement of Eisenstadt could lead you to the
same conclusions that the Bowersdissenters reached.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't think that the majority in
Bowers in any way felt compelled to undercut Eisenstadt in order
to reach the conclusion that they did. Again, I have not gone back
and re-read the majority opinion in that case, but I believe what
the majority did is simply say that in looking at our history and
tradition, the fundamental right of privacy did not include homo-
sexual sodomy. I believe that was Justice White. But the point is
that it left intact the holding in Eisenstadt that the right of priva-
cy attached to the individual.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, that helps me a little and makes me feel
better than the answer that you gave yesterday.
  You agree that the right of privacy is not absolute; indeed, pro-
tection is derived from the liberty clause of the 14th amendment as
part of the Constitution. And so then in conclusion--and this is the
only question I have of you in this round--I would like to read for
you a portion of the majority opinion in the Bowersdecision, and it
is a few sentences long so I hope I read it carefully for you.

  The Court is most vulnerable and conies nearest to illegitimacy when it deals
with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the lan-
guage or design of the Constitution.
                                         393

  That this is so was painfully demonstrated by the face-off between executive and
the Court in the 1930's which resulted in a repudiation of much of the substantive
gloss that the Court had placed on the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Four-
teenth Amendments. There should be, therefore, great resistance to expand the sub-
stantive reach of those clauses, particularly if it requires redefining the category of
rights deemed to be fundamental.

  "Otherwise"--and this is the last sentence.

Otherwise, the judiciary necessarily takes to itself further authority to govern the
country without express constitutional authority.

  While you have probably stated this already, but as a sort of
summary, can you agree that this expression of judicial restraint is
an important consideration in determining the parameters of the
right of privacy?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that in areas in which a court or
a judge is adjudicating or interpreting the more openended provi-
sion of the Constitution that judges should restrain themselves
from imposing their personal views in the Constitution; that their
adjudication must be rooted in something other than their personal
opinion. And as I have indicated and the Court has attempted to
do, attempted to root the interpretation or analysis in those areas
in history and tradition of this country, the liberty component of
the due process clause, and I think that that is an appropriate re-
straint on judges.

  Senator GRASSLEY. IS what you just said, your way of telling me
that you agree with those statements?

  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and also thanks to
my colleagues for the courtesy of going out of order.
  The CHAIRMAN. This may be an appropriate time to take a
break. We will break until 3:30.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Let me say that, after consultation with Senator Thurmond and
with Judge Thomas, it looks like our best efforts to get finished
today--finished in the sense that Judge Thomas' testimony is fin-
ished--are not going to work. We would be here well into the night
for that to happen. But it also appears after consultation with
Judge Thomas and with Senator Thurmond, that we can get still a
good hour-and-a-half more, maybe even more than that, in today,
and can then resume at 9:30 on Monday morning. And I believe
that we can finish by lunch on Monday. That will be the Chair's
express intention, and it looks like that is very reasonable that
that could be done.
  So, Judge, instead of being finished today at 5, you will in all
probability be finished at lunchtime on Monday. With that, why
don't we just get under way and see how much more we can get
finished tonight, if everyone is agreeable.
  Now, unless I have miscounted, I believe it is my turn to ask
some questions, Judge. I would like to go back and ask one very
straightforward question because it has been mentioned 87 differ-
ent ways by 6 or 8 different people. And I don't think you in any
way have confused it. I think maybe we have confused it--we, the
members of this committee, Republican and Democrat, and as I
read some of the press accounts, the press even seems mildly con-
                                         394

fused on it. Again, not you. I think you are perfectly clear on it,
but let me make sure my recollection is right.

  I want to ask you a very precise question, similar to what I indi-
cated I would ask you. And if it requires more than a yes or no
answer, obviously elaborate. But if you could answer it yes or no, it
sure will save a lot of time and be on point.

  Judge very simply, if you can, yes or no: Do you believe that the
liberty clause of the 14th amendment of the Constitution provides
a fundamental right to privacy for individuals in the area of pro-
creation, including contraception?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think I answered earlier yes, based
upon the precedent of Eisenstadt v. Baird.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you know, what folks are going to say is
that Eisenstadt v. Baird was an equal protection case. All right?
That is not the question I am asking you. Let me make sure and
say it one more time. Do you believe the liberty clause of the 14th
amendment of the Constitution provides a fundamental right to
privacy for individuals in the area of procreation, including contra-
ception?

  Judge THOMAS. I think I have answered that, Senator.

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes or no?

  Judge THOMAS. Yes, and
  The CHAIRMAN. I like it. I mean, not I like it. I think we can end
confusion. If it yes, the answer is yes
  Senator THURMOND. Well, if he wants to explain it
  The CHAIRMAN. If you want to go on, go on. But, I mean, I think
that is what you mean.
  Judge THOMAS. I have expressed on what I base that, and I
would leave it at that.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Let's switch to what I thought was a very,
very interesting and informative exchange you had with Senator
Brown earlier. Now, we don't have the actual record because it is
not able to be transcribed as we move, although they do a phenom-
enal job of transcribing it quickly, and we don't have it yet. But
here is what I understood that exchange to say.
  In your exchange with Senator Brown, Senator Brown in my
view accurately stated the law and Supreme Court decisions. He
accurately stated the law and the stated decisions in the Court as
to where the law now stands with regard to the standard of review
that judges use in determining whether an action taken by the
Government against an individual is constitutional, against their
individual rights of privacy or against their individual right relat-
ing to their property. And he pointed out that when the Court
looks at whether an action by a State to limit an individual's fun-
damental right to privacy, like in Griswoldor Moore, the State has
an overwhelming burden. He pointed out the Court says the State
in those kinds of cases has to apply a standard of strict scrutiny.
They have to have an overwhelming reason to justify their action
impacting upon that person's right.
  But, he went on to say, if a State impacts on a person's use of
their property, they now apply a rational basis test, he said. Now,
he went on to explain that the Court looks at the State and deter-
mines whether or not it had a rational reason for impacting on
                                        395

that person's property right, not an overwhelming reason, a lower
standard.

  Senator Brown said that he thought this was wrong. He said that
property rights should not be separated out in that way, and he
went on to point out--if my notes are correct--that property is the
basis of all our moral rights. And he further pointed out that--he
said--I believe this is the quote, "The courts ignore this reality
now."

  Senator Brown then cited Moore v. East Clevelandas an example
of the failure of the Supreme Court to recognize what he calls the
reality of their mistake. He said that Moore was a violation--the
way the Supreme Court ruled, Moore was a violation of the right of
someone to use their property.

  He then quoted as authority for that Professor Tribe. He prob-
ably knows it, but he didn't have an opportunity to say it. He
quoted Tribe's comments on Lynch v. Household Finance. The
Tribe quote he read was about Lynch v. Household Finance, al-
though he didn't state that, not about Moore.

  Now, he then looked at you and he said, Do you agree? Do you
agree that these two different standards--the Court has a strict
scrutiny standard for matters with regard to privacy and matters
with regard to other things other than property--race, suspect cat-
egories, classifications. They have this standard, and with property
they have this standard. And he said, That is wrong; do you agree?

  And the answer you gave, as I understood it, was exactly the op-
posite of the position he staked out--if I understood it correctly.
You said you have no quarrel with what the Court does, how the
Court deals now with regard to regulations of property. You said
that this is where the Court should defer to the legislative branch.
As you and I know, there is a venerable theory in constitutional
law that says the reason why there should be a strict scrutiny
standard on matters like privacy and suspect categories is because
that is where democratic institutions have erred the most. That is
when the legislative bodies have made the most mistakes, like
saying people can be slaves. So, historically, we have applied a
stricter standard.

  But, as you pointed out, in areas where it related to property, the
legislature didn't err that much. That is the basis of the thesis un-
derlying the argument--the point, I should say. They don't err that
much, so the courts have been more ready to rely on what the leg-
islature says. A different standard.

  And you went on to say, "I don't quarrel with this approach."
That was the quote I do remember writing precisely.

  Now, Judge, either you completely fundamentally disagree with
everything that Senator Brown said and he thought you agreed
with him, or the following: You said you had no quarrel with the
equal protection analysis in this area, which is, of course, the area
where terms like rational basis and strict scrutiny are most often
used. But, of course, Judge, technically we are not dealing with the
equal protection analysis when we are talking about the taking of
property, as you well know. We are dealing with the fifth amend-
ment and the due process analysis.

  Now, there are always two questions in analyzing whether a reg-
ulation is valid, whether the regulation by the Government to reg-
                                         396

ulate somebody's property, take their property, is valid. I can see
the press and others are bored by this, but this is the single most
important question you can be asked in this entire hearing.

  One of the tests they apply is whether the object that is being
served by the law, taking the property, is an object that falls
within the scope of police power. And the other, as you well know,
is whether the means chosen to legislate accomplishes an objective
that is reasonably related to the reason they say they are doing
this thing.

  Now, Judge, the Court's current approach is to give the legisla-
ture a broad latitude in both these areas--the area of determining
whether or not the means is an appropriate means and whether or
not the objective being served is an objective that falls within the
police power. That is the state of the law now, and they essentially
use a rational basis test for a much lower standard.

  So my question is this: Do you agree with the state of the law as
it is now with regard to property, as I understood you to say it? Or
do you agree with Senator Brown who said it is wrong the way we
are doing it now; property and the test applied to the taking of
property should be elevated to the same level as other constitution-
al rights^--that is, the case he cited, the right to privacy in Moore?

  What is your position?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that I indicated to Senator
Brown as well as, I believe, to the question from Senator DeConcini
on equal protection analysis, that the current manner of equal pro-
tection analysis I have no quarrel with.
  The CHAIRMAN. But do you have a quarrel--I am sorry. Go
ahead.
  Judge THOMAS. With respect to the area of the current law, in
the area of taking, I have no basis to quarrel with that either.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is what Senator Brown was talking about.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I thought that he recognized that we dis-
agreed.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Good. That is all I want to make sure be-
cause
  Judge THOMAS. I thought that was recognized.
  The CHAIRMAN. Because I thought Senator Brown--Senator
Brown, please correct me if I am wrong. I thought Senator Brown
said, well, I understand, we agree, and, you know, property should
have a higher scrutiny and should be treated with more respect in
the law, et cetera. I thought he thought you agreed.
  Senator BROWN. I was doing my best to get him to agree.
  The CHAIRMAN. But you are aware that on the record under oath
he does not agree with that.
  Senator BROWN. And was very disappointed that he disagreed
with Professor Tribe. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, if you have an opportunity to read the case
that Tribe was talking about, you will know that it is not related to
the issue that we are talking about.
  Anyway, now--in that I don't mean to defend Professor Tribe. I
don't care one way or another whether Professor Tribe is right or
wrong. It is just that it doesn't relate directly to this issue.
  Now, Judge, the reason I bothered to take you through all of this
I think you know well, and that is that it is a big deal at least to
                                         397

me, and a big deal, in fact, to this country, that if the theory and
thesis promoted by Senator Brown, espoused in great detail with
significant annotation and with great articulation, and is a first-
rate book by Professor Epstein, if you agree with this view, it
means that, as the Brown-Epstein view, it means very simply that,
to use his phrase, that--let me get it straight here--"if what fol-
lows, I shall advocate a level of judicial intervention far greater
than we now have and, indeed, far greater than we have ever
had"--that is what is being advocated by a very brilliant, informed,
respected school of thought.

  Now, I will not go into all the nuances of it. You understand
them well. I might add that a couple newspaper articles that have
written about this thesis said it has nothing to do with natural law.
Let me quote from the book, so they are informed, quote from Mr.
Epstein: "Thus, the political tradition in which I operate and to
which the Takings Clause itself is bound rests upon a theory of nat-
ural rights."

  I read from a very informed newspaper that natural rights had
nothing to do with this theory. It is the thing upon which this
theory is based. So, I am happy to hear your answer. If you would
like to elaborate or speak on anything at all about this subject
matter, I would be delighted to hear it. If you do not, that is OK,
too. It is up to you. I do not want to cut you off.

  All right. Now, let me move to another area, if I may, and that is
to the area we have touched on very briefly, religion, if I may, not
your religion or mine, how the court deals with religion.

  Judge this is one area where the level of protection accorded fun-
damental rights is changing, and I do not think most of us even
know it. You know it, and that is the right of free speech and the
free exercise of religion. These rights, which, perhaps more than
any other, are central to what most of us believe to be what it
means to be an American.

  In my view, these rights deserve the highest level of protection
by the court, and I would like to start first with the Free Exercise
Clause of the First Amendment, which provides, as you well know,
"Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise of reli-
gion.

  Now, until last year, the Supreme Court applied the standard
known as strict scrutiny, when reviewing legislation that restricted
religious practice. Under the strict scrutiny standard we have dis-
cussed a number of times, but it bears repeating, the State first
needed a compelling reason for restricting the religious practice,
and, second, the State had to show that no other alternatives were
available for it the State to achieve its goal. It has been a test now
for about 40 years, 35 years, a two-prong test.

  Under this doctrine, the Supreme Court held, for example, that
the compulsory education law could not be used, for example, to re-
quire Amish children to attend school, when their parents believe
that they have a religious duty to be educated at home, the Yoder
case, Wisconsin v. Yoder.

  The Court reasoned that, even though the State was not acting
out of any hostility, and even though the State had a compelling
reason for making children attend school, in general, in Yoder they
held the State law could not constitutionally be applied to the
                                         398

Amish, because there was "no compelling reason for abridging the
religious freedom to educate their children."

  Then, last year, the Supreme Court decided the case of the Em-
ployment Division of Oregon v. Smith. In the Smith case, the Court
held that the Free Exercise Clause permits the State to prohibit
sacramental use of peyote. I think that is how it is pronounced, is
that correct? Never having used it, I am not sure of the pronuncia-
tion. Peyote, it is a drug used in an Indian ceremony and it has
been used historically by them. Thus, a State could deny unemploy-
ment benefits to those who were discharged from employment for
such use.

  Now, I do not want to discuss the specific case of the case nor the
specific outcome. Instead, I want to ask you about your understand-
ing of the reasoning the Court used in this case. Justice Scalia,
writing for a 5-to-4 majority, concluded that, as long as the Govern-
ment is not specifically trying to restrict religion or as long as it is
not trying to discriminate against religion, it can apply a general
law against a religious activity, and it doesn't matter what effect
the law has on that religion, in a sense striking down what histori-
cally--not historically, what the last several decades has been the
second test needed to be passed, in order for the State to be able to
take such action.

  In other words, even if the law passed by the Government has a
devastating impact upon a religious practice, the law is still consti-
tutional, according to the majority, Scalia writing for them, is still
constitutional, so long as the Government acted with a legitimate
purpose when it passed the law.

  Now, Justice O'Connor, on the other hand, said she would have
upheld the ban on peyote, without changing the legal test that has
historically been applied, without abandoning the strict scrutiny
test. Now, Judge, which approach do you agree with, not whether
or not it should be outlawed or not outlawed--that is not the issue
as far as I am concerned. Do you agree with Scalia's approach, or
do you agree with O'Connor's approach?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think as I indicated in prior testimony
here, when the Sherbet test was abandoned or moved away from in
the Smith case, I think that any of us who were concerned about
this area, because, as we indicate, I think we all value our religious
freedoms, I think that there was an appropriate reason for concern,
and I did note then that Justice O'Connor, in applying the tradi-
tional test, reached the same result.

  The CHAIRMAN. Correct.
  Judge THOMAS. I cannot express as preference. I have not
thought through those particular approaches, but I myself would
be concerned that we did move away from an approach that has
been used for the past I guess several decades.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I asked the same question of our most
recent Justice and Justice Souter had no problem telling me that
he agreed with the O'Connor approach. I do not care which ap-
proach. You obviously know the area well. You obviously know the
facts of the cases. You obviously have an intense and deep commit-
ment to religion and your faith in God. Do you mean to tell me you
have not thought, when this came out, which approach you
thought was appropriate.
                                         399

  Judge THOMAS. Let me restate my answer. My concern would be
that, without being absolutist in my answer, my concern would be
that the Scalia approach could lessen religious protections.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, as a matter of fact, it does. I mean it is
not whether it could or should. I mean it does, it limits the protec-
tion, for example, in the case--I guess it was in New Mexico, where
they passed a law saying minors cannot drink wine under any cir-
cumstances. As you know, in our church and in many churches,
there is a sacramental taking of wine at communion, and in most
churches that occurs in most Christian religions--I cannot speak
for others--and it occurs when kids are 7 years old or 8 years old,
and it impacts significantly.

  You know, it was struck down, that restriction in New Mexico, it
never got up to the Supreme Court, to the best of my knowledge.
But clearly, under the test applied by Scalia, such a law could be
passed and it would be held constitutional. It has a big impact, it is
a big deal, not a minor thing.

  Judge THOMAS. And I guess my point is our concerns are the
same, that any test which lessens the protection I think is a matter
of concern. The point that I am making, though, in not being abso-
lutist is that I think it is best for me, as a sitting Federal judge, to
take more time and to think that through, but my concern about
the approach taken by Justice Scalia is that it may have the poten-
tial and could have the potential of lessening protection, and I
think the approach that we should take certainly is one that maxi-
mizes those protections.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, you know, when your confirmation is over
and if you are on the bench, you are on the bench and the next
nominee comes up, we now talk about the Souter standard and
how Souter did not answer questions that some suggest he should
or shouldn't have, I am not making a judgment on that. We are
going to have a new standard, the Thomas standard, which is you
are answering even less than Souter.

  Senator HATCH. First of all, Mr. Chairman, I do not think that is
true. I think he has answered forthrightly and very straightfor-
wardly all the way through this thing. He may not give the an-
swers you and I want

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I am not looking for an answer that I want,
let me make it clear, Senator. I am just making a statement of fact.
I asked the precise same question of Judge Souter. Just Souter, sit-
ting not as a Federal judge, sitting as a State court judge, said "I
agree with O'Connor," no ifs, ands, buts about it, just click, bang, I
agree with O'Connor. That is the only point I am making.

  Senator HATCH. But he has answered things that Justice Souter
had not answered, so I am saying

  The CHAIRMAN. I cannot think of any, but maybe yes.
  Senator HATCH. I can.
  Senator BROWN. Mr. Chairman, if I could have 30 seconds, I
would like to comment on the previous business you were kind
enough to bring up.
  The CHAIRMAN. Surely.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  I thought perhaps it was worthwhile, while the transcript is not
out, as you noted, to note a couple of things that had been dis-
                                         400

cussed. First, my concern about having property rights treated as
second-class rights, I did not mean to indicate that property rights
are the basis for moral rights. I do believe they are integral, that
they are interdependent, but I do not believe that is the basis for it.

  Second, the tribe citation was meant to indicate their interde-
pendence, not necessarily as a support for more.

  Third, at least my view of it is the tribe showed the interrelation-
ship between personal and property rights, not necessarily having
a different implication than that, so I cited it for its interdepend-
ence of those rights and not for another purpose.

  Thank you for allowing me to interject, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I did misunderstand, though, you do think Moore
was wrongly decided, you did say that, did you not?
  Senator BROWN. I cited Moore as an example of a case where it is
very difficult to separate personal rights and property rights,
where the problems that were exemplified by Mooreclearly affect
both.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right. I thank my colleague and I think that is a
perfect case, because where two rights come in conflict, the right of
the government to tell someone that they cannot live in an area,
unless they live in that area with what is defined as a traditional
family, and that a woman moves in and lives there, grandparents
live there and they have two grandchildren who are cousins, not
brothers and sisters, and the State, in the form of the county or
city, East Cleveland, says you must leave, you are violating our
laws, our zoning laws which affect property, and the Supreme
Court says wrong, is a basic fundamental right to privacy for
grandmom to have her grandchildren, even though they are cous-
ins and not brothers who live together.
  The reason I raised this is a perfect example of this. That is why
I raised the White House Working Group report. I do not want to
go into whether or not you signed it or did not. I am not talking
about you now. There are a number of very intelligent, very well-
intended, and maybe even right, but people have a very different
view than I do, and I believe you are one in this score, Senator,
who argue that, hey--not you, I am not talking about you, Judge, I
am talking about my colleague--but there is a whole group of
people in this town, in this country who say wrong, we ought to let
States, counties, cities make those judgments, and if they do they
should be upheld by the Supreme Court.
  From my perspective as to how I read the Constitution, I think
that is absolutely, categorically wrong to say that the State should
be able to tell a grandmother she cannot have two grandsons living
in her house, fine kids, no problems, cannot have them living in
the house because they are cousins and not brothers. I think that is
bizarre, but there are a lot of people who do not think it is bizarre,
and that is why I asked you questions about that, because if you
thought that way, Judge--which you said you did not--but if you
did, I would do everything in my power to keep you off the Court,
but you do not, so you said and I believe you.
  My time is up, but that is what the debate is about and that is
why I am asking the questions. I can think of no way to frame it
better than it was just framed in terms of your discussion with me,
Senator.
                                         401

  My time is up, and I yield now to my colleague from South Caro-
lina.

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I
have no questions of my own, but I will reserve my time in case
something comes up I have not anticipated.

  I do have one question to clear up something that was asked this
morning by Senator Leahy.

  Judge Thomas, this morning when you answered Senator
Leahy's question about important Supreme Court cases, did you
understand him to be referring tc important cases decided when
you were in law school?

  Judge THOMAS. My understanding was that he was asking me for
cases decided during the period that I was in law school, from 1971
to 1974, and I think I answered him in response to that Griggs and
Roe v. Wade.

  Senator THURMOND. I just wanted to clarify that if there is any
question about it.

  Now, Mr. Chairman, I believe the distinguished Senator from Il-
linois brought out that 12 Members of the House have opposed you.
Is that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, Mr. Chairman, I wish to offer for the
record a letter signed by 128 Members of the House endorsing
Judge Thomas, several of whom are Democrats, and ask that that
be made a part of the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be made a part of the
record.
  [The letter follows:]

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden

Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Biden,

      We are writing to express our strong support for the nomination of Judge
Clarence Thomas as anAssociate Justice ofthe United States Supreme Court.

      In our view, Judge Thomas is a man of impeccable character. Judge
Thomas, a grandson of a sharecropper, was born in the segregated South and
faced seemingly insurmountable obstacles. But through hard work and
discipline hewas able to overcome his impoverished condition achieving
success in every task he undertook.

      In Washington, Clarence Thomas has served in an exemplary manner as a
judge on the U.S. Court ofAppeals for the District ofColumbia, and hewas
an outstanding Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission which
he chaired from 1982 to 1989.

      Judge Thomas has worked with the United States' civil rights laws for
more than a decade and his commitment to equal opportunity for all is second
to none. Under the chairmanship ofJudge Thomas, the EEOC effectively
streamlined operations and clarified the rules and regulations of the
Commission while enhancing its ability to fairly respond to claims of
discrimination. Consistent with the purpose of the EEOC, Judge Thomas played
a vital role in ensuring that older Americans and minorities have access to a
fair and equitable means of redress.

      Together with his tenure at the U.S. Court of Appeals, Clarence Thomas'
record--both past and present--reveals that he has the qualifications and
character to uphold the high standards the American people demand. We"
strongly support the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the United States
Supreme Court.

                     Respectfully yours,

  Senator THURMOND. I will reserve the rest of my time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy
  Senator THURMOND. And, Judge Thomas, let me just say this,
since I think I am through, unless something comes up I don't an-
ticipate. I want to compliment you on the way you have conducted
yourself during this hearing. I think you have shown that you are
fair, you are open-minded; and you have answered all the questions
you could without violating the oath that you will have to take as a
judge on cases that might be coming up in the future. We are very
pleased with the way the hearings went.
  I want to compliment the chairman, Senator Biden, and the
other members on this hearing and the way it has been conducted
throughout. In my opinion, you deserve to be confirmed on the Su-
preme Court, and I anticipate you will be.
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, if it is agreeable
with the other members of the committee, even though I am enti-
tled to the half-hour, Senator DeConcini will be at the Gates hear-
ing on Monday. What I would like to do is just--there were three
areas I would like to get into. I would like to divide the half-hour
with Senator DeConcini and take 15 minutes, or try even to take
less time and give the remaining time to Senator DeConcini and
then go back over to the other side. But I would like to be able, at
a reasonable hour on Monday, to be able just to finish up those ad-
ditional areas, if that is agreeable.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, you will be.
  Senator KENNEDY. Judge, the right to vote is at the very core of
our democracy, and the Voting Rights Act has been extremely im-
portant in assuring that all Americans can exercise that funda-
mental right.
  In a speech at the Tocqueville Forum in April 1988, you criti-
cized Supreme Court decisions applying the Voting Rights Act. You
said, and I quote, "Unfortunately, many of the Court's decisions in
the area of voting rights presuppose that blacks, whites, Hispanics,
and other ethnic groups will inevitably vote in blocs. Instead of
looking at the right to vote as an individual fight, the Court has
regarded the right as protected when the individual racial or
ethnic group has sufficient clout."
  Do you remember what the Supreme Court decisions on the
Voting Rights Act were that you were referring to?
  Judge THOMAS. I can't remember precisely, Senator, but I was
perhaps referring to the effects test. Again, that has been quite
some time.
  I do know that I also was critical of the administration for not
supporting the Voting Rights Act, and I do treasure it, of course,
coming from a background or an area where that right was consid-
ered enormously important and difficult to secure.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, prior to the meeting, I think we made
available to the Justice Department that we would be talking
about the voting rights cases. I gave, I believe, some notice that I
would be getting into these because I read through your speeches
where you talked about the administration's position on the exten-
                                         411

sion of the Voting Rights Act. But also in the speeches it has the
criticism of the Voting Rights Act, and I think in the speeches, as I
mentioned here, you were talking about the ethnic group having
sufficient clout, and you were critically generally, as I understand,
of many of the Court's decisions. There are only really three impor-
tant decisions by the Court. You mentioned one. The other two
were the White decision and the Thornburghdecision.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my only concern would have been that
in that context whether or not we were assuming that--for exam-
ple, if you had an all-black district or an all-white district, whether
that would necessarily always be good for black Americans. And I
think some of the concerns would be that even now, as I have fol-
lowed in the newspapers or in other journals, that perhaps some of
the black individuals feel that the district, the white district that is
left becomes more conservative and offsets the newly created mi-
nority district. That would have been the only concern.

  I certainly have absolutely nothing but the greatest support for
legislation that secures the right to vote.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, of course, the point that you make here
is explicitly prohibited by the Voting Rights Act, which says that--
the Voting Right Act explicitly says, "No group is entitled to legis-
lative seats in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.
The Act simply bans States from taking actions which result in a
denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United
States to vote on account of race or color."

  In these two cases, they basically struck down the at-large dis-
tricts, both in North Carolina and also in Texas, specifically in
Dallas, Texas, and San Antonio. And I was wondering if--other-
wise, what we can do is come back on Monday to give you a chance
to review these, if you would like. That is fine. I thought I had
mentioned to the Justice Department that we would get into it.

  Judge THOMAS. YOU did, Senator, and the underlying concern
that you have is the same as the one that I have; that minorities
have the ability to vote and to have an effective participation in
our political processes.

  My concerns were not intended to suggest that I was in any way
opposed to voting rights or concerned that we have them. I think
that they are critical, and I certainly have been most supportive
and felt that we should have been more aggressive in stating that
position during the Reagan years.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I understand from reading your speech-
es that you were in support of the Voting Rights Act. Also in your
speeches you talked about the criticisms of the Supreme Court on
the voting rights.

  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator KENNEDY. And what I was interested in is finding out,
you know, what the nature of the criticisms really were. You had
said many Supreme Court decisions in voting rights are unfortu-
nate, and I am just trying to find out what aspect of the Voting
Rights Act that was decided by the Supreme Court and the major
Supreme Court decisions affecting the Voting Rights Act dealt with
at-large districts in the areas which I have just outlined.

         56-270 O--93 14
                                         412

  I was just trying to understand what in particular the Supreme
Court decided on voting rights that you found objectionable. That
was basically my question.

  Judge THOMAS. I think my only concern, Senator, was with the
effects test. But it was not--I did not go into detail into the voting
rights cases, and that certainly was not my area. But what I am
trying to, I guess, communicate to you is that my view is that
voting rights should be aggressively protected, and I felt that we
should have done that during the Reagan years.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, we all agree.
  What was your trouble with the effects test, the holding?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I guess the only point that I was making,
Senator, was whether or not it was on--again, this is general--
whether or not we could really judge from the number of individ-
uals who held office, for example, how effective a person's voting
rights were being implemented or how effective the statute was im-
plemented or how effective the minorities were in participating in
the political process. I think it is one measure, and I felt that it
was one measure.
  But I underscore that by saying this, Senator: I did not study
that area in detail. That was simply a concern. And I think that
other individuals now are concerned because of the creation of
what is perceived as more conservative districts, political districts.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, do I understand you correctly that in
two of the major decisions by the Supreme Court that struck down
the at-large districts, both in San Antonio and Dallas, also in North
Carolina, at-large districts which historically had been in effect for
years by individuals that wanted to deny effective rights to vote by
minorities, blacks and Hispanics--that in one case, the White case
decided unanimously by the Supreme Court, that there had been
significant diminution of the effectiveness of the right to vote in
Dallas as well as in San Antonio. I understand that their require-
ments that they go to single-member districts is not offensive to
you.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I again would go back and look at those
cases, consistent with what you are saying, but I underscore that
by saying that that was my general concern. It was not an objec-
tion to the aggressive enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.
  Senator KENNEDY. Perhaps over the weekend, if you can sort of
refresh
  Judge THOMAS. I will try.
  Senator KENNEDY [continuing]. Your recollection about what
were the particular aspects in the voting rights cases, because this
was something that many of us were very much involved in here at
the time of the extension.
  I have just 5 minutes left of the 15.
  In your article in 1989, "The Higher Law Background of the
Privileges and Immunities Clause, the Fourteenth Amendment,"
one of the arguments you made for using the natural law to inter-
pret the Constitution was that it is, and I quote, "The only alterna-
tive to the willfulness of both run-amuck majorities and run-amuck
judges." I think those words have been used at other times in the
hearing.
                                         413

  Are you willing to name any judge whom you considered to be a
run-amuck judge? [Laughter.]

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I thought about it when I looked at that
language again, and I couldn't name any particular judge.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, was Oliver Wendell Holmes a run-
amuck judge?

  Judge THOMAS. He was a great judge. Of course, we all, when
you have opportunities to study them, we might disagree here and
there. But I had occasion to read a recent biography of him, and
obviously now he is a giant in our judicial system.

  Senator KENNEDY. Because in your speech on how to talk about
civil rights, you called Justice Holmes a nihilist who, and I quote,
"sought to destroy the notion that justice, natural rights, and natu-
ral law were objective." And you went on to say about Holmes, and
I quote, "No man who has ever sat on the Supreme Court was less
inclined and so poorly equipped to be a statesman or to teach."

  Judge THOMAS. I think that was a quote from someone else, Sen-
ator.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I will
  Judge THOMAS. I may be wrong on that, but I think it was a
quote from someone else.
  Senator KENNEDY. I will provide that for you over the weekend.
Maybe you can get a look at it.
  Whatever time is left I will yield to Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Senator Kennedy, thank you very much. I
am sorry to impose on you and the committee, but I do intend to be
at the Gates hearing.
  I only have a few follow-up questions. I may not even take 15
minutes, Judge Thomas. Yesterday, when I was asking you some
questions on judicial activism, I made reference to Missouri v. Jen-
kins, which is a current case of 1990, and, as you may recall, it was
a case where the Court imposed an increase in taxes.
  The only question that I did not quite get an answer from you,
although perhaps it is because of my own inadequacies, is do you
believe that taxation is within the Federal power of the Federal
bench, or is taxation power exclusively that of the legislative
branch of government?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that is explicit in the Constitu-
tion that the legislative branch imposes taxes.
  Senator DECONCINI. SO, without talking specifically about this
case, which, who knows, might come up again, although I rather
doubt it, do you feel that it would be judicial activism, if the court
does impose taxes?
  Judge THOMAS. I think, just in the abstract, I think it would be,
and I do not know that it would be tolerated.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, judge.
  Let me just touch on another area, a little bit of concern of mine,
and you may have answered this and I might have missed it, and
that deals with the Equal Protection Clause. You have taken a
very strong position on the case of Brown v. Board of Education.
Its companion case is the Boiling v. Sharpe case. Are you familiar
with that case?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, sir.
                                         414

  Senator DECONCINI. AS you know, the Court recognized that the
14th amendment's equal protection clause does not apply to the
Federal Government, as a result, the Court held that the Federal
law segregating the District's schools violated the due process
clause of the fifth amendment, and the Boiling court ruled that the
fifth amendment embodied the quality principles of the 14th
amendment. Do you agree with the Boiling decision? Do you have
any problems with that?

  Judge THOMAS. I have no quarrels with Boiling v. Sharpe, Sena-
tor.

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  Last, in the area of literacy, I just want to go back to that case.
When Judge Bork was here, and just so people understand that I
make a great distinction so far, Judge Thomas, between you and
Judge Bork. Bork was very critical of the Boiling decision and he
said it was a clear rewriting of the Constitution by the Warren
court. He labeled it "social engineering from the bench." I do not
bring this up to open up wounds or anything else, but I do bring it
up to point out that I think you are very different in your philoso-
phy and in your approach to the Constitution than Judge Bork
was, and, as far as I am concerned, that is important for your con-
firmation process.
  In section 5 of the 14th amendment, it gives Congress the power
to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of that par-
ticular amendment. Invoking its authority under section 5, the
Congress, in 1965 and in 1970, adopted provisions of the Voting
Rights Act banning literacy tests in certain instances, and those
provisions were upheld in the Katzenbach case and in the Oregon v.
Mitchell case. The Court held in those cases that Congress had the
power to determine that requiring literacy tests in specific in-
stances deprives voters the equal protection of the law.
  Again, just for the record, Judge Bork told the Senate Judiciary
Committee during his confirmation hearing that Katzenbach was
bad constitutional law. How do you feel about that case? Maybe
you have already answered that, but I missed it, if you did. Have
you had a chance to review that voting rights case, and do you be-
lieve that they were correct in their interpretation?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I did read that case. Again, I do not re-
member all the details of it and I cannot and did not have a basis
or any quarrel with the case or the result in the case.
  Senator DECONCINI. SO, you feel that is, in your philosophy, a
proper interpretation of the Constitution of this particular section
5?
  Judge THOMAS. I just have no quarrel with it, Senator. I do not
object to it.
  Senator DECONCINI. When you say you have no quarrel, you
mean that you agree with it, is that fair to say?
  Judge THOMAS. I mean I do not disagree with it. I do not have a
basis to disagree with it and I have not raised any objections about
it.
  Senator DECONCINI. Fine. I do not mean to quarrel with you,
Judge. It is just a lot easier to yes, I agree with it, than to say I do
not have any quarrel with it. It immediately raises a flag in some
                                         415

people's mind as saying, gee, he won't take a position. I think you
have taken a position.

  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator DECONCINI. I was just trying to get you to say yes, I
agree with it, that is all.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I guess the difficulty that I have, I was
more apt to say that when I was in the executive branch and be
more categorical in answers. You asked me yesterday about my
comments at the hearing, the contempt hearing, and my answer
was categorical.
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, it was.
  Judge THOMAS. And you asked me what I learned from that and
the response was not to be categorical. Certainly, as a judge, I
think that it is important that when I do not know where I stand
on something or I have not reviewed it in detail, that it is best for
me to take a step back and say I have no reason to disagree with it,
rather than saying I adopt it as mine.
  Senator DECONCINI. I guess that is a fair idea. But when we are
talking about a literacy test on the right to vote and if you have
read the Katzenbach case or the Oregon case, it does not seem un-
reasonable to say yes, I agree with those cases. Now, if a different
set of circumstances came up and it was a different kind of literacy
test, it seems to me it gives you every ample right, once you are on
the bench, if you are confirmed, to say, well, this is different than
the Katzenbach case. My only concern is I think these cases, and I
have read them and I'm sure you have too--seem to make sense to
me, and my question is does it eminent sense to you?
  Judge THOMAS. It makes eminent sense to me to find unlawful
literacy tests that are used to deprive people of the right to vote.
  Senator DECONCINI. That is all I wanted.
  Judge THOMAS. And let me just give you
  Senator DECONCINI. That is all I am looking for.
  Judge THOMAS. I want to give you a quick anecdote as to why it
is so important.
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes.
  Judge THOMAS. I can remember my grandfather poring over the
Bible, in order, as he said, to go and get his right to vote and it was
a painful experience watching that, so I understand what you are
saying.
  The only point that I was making in the reservation is that the
way you approach it and the way you reached that result, but the
underlying concern I think we both share.
  Senator DECONCINI. Oh, I do not think there is any question, we
share that underlying concern. It is just that we have certain cases
that are beacons in a particular area, and these two cases are. And
without having you comment on what you are going to do if an-
other voting rights case comes, it just seems appropriate for you to
take a position and answer it. And I think now that you have an-
swered it, that, yes, you believe these cases are correct, and that is
really all I want to know. I only say that because I think some
people get disturbed up here when they cannot get you to say yes
or no. And after maybe what I asked you yesterday, you are a little
bit leery of saying yes or no. But when there is as a case as clear as
this, I appreciate the affirmative answer, clearly.
                                         416

  Those are all the questions I have, Judge.
  I want to thank my friend from Massachusetts for permitting me
to intervene here. I think there still is some time, Senator Kenne-
dy, on your time, because I do not think I have taken the full 15
minutes.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I understand from the previous agree-
ment that would conclude this portion of the hearings for today
and, as the chairman has pointed out, we will resume the hearings
at 9:30 on Monday morning.
  The committee stands in recess.
  [Whereupon, at 4:30 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
on Monday, September 16, 1991, at 9:30 a.m.]
NOMINATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                       MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1991

                                                                   U.S. SENATE,
                                               COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                         Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:35 a.m., in room 325,
Senate caucus room, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph
R. Biden, Jr. (chairman of the committee) presiding.
  Present: Senators Biden, Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini,
Leahy, Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley,
Specter, and Brown.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Welcome back, Judge. It is a pleasure to have you back. As I
said, I expect this will be our last day to hang out in this room to-
gether. And I know things are moving along, and you have begun
to take this process seriously because I have now met your eighth-
grade nun. She is here today, which means that we had better end
it. I assume that is why you have her here, just in the event that
somehow if we couldn't finish, she would remind me of the fact
that I said on Friday we were going to finish. So I assure you we
have an added incentive to finish today.
  With that, why don't we get right to the order of questioning,
Judge. Again, anytime that you would think it is appropriate to
take a break, we will do so. I think what we should do is sort of
play it by ear as to when we have lunch, because I would like to
finish before lunch. Lunch may mean 12 or it may mean 1. But
let's make that judgment as we go, if that is all right with you.
  All right. Where we are now is the next questioner will be the
most senior Republican who has any questions, and I yield to Sena-
tor Thurmond if he has any.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I have no more questions,
and none on our side have any except the distinguished Senator
from Pennsylvania. I believe he cares for a third round.
  Senator Grassley, did you have any questions on the third round?
  Senator GRASSLEY. I have used 6 or 7 minutes of the third round
and don't anticipate using any more unless something happens.
  Senator THURMOND. SO you have no more at this time. Well,
then, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.
  The CHAIRMAN. We yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Senator SPECTER. I thank the Chair.

                                                         (417)
                                         418

  Judge Thomas, if you are confirmed and if you join the current
revisionist Supreme Court--and I call it a revisionist Supreme
Court as opposed to a conservative court because the current court
has gone beyond the conservative judgments illustrative of the
unanimous opinion of Chief Justice Burger in the Griggs court. I
think--I would ask if you would be philosophically attuned more to
the Justice O'Connor line or the Justice Scalia line. And I will deal
with two cases for illustrative purposes.

  When I had finished my questioning, when my time ran out on
the second round, I had been asking you about Rust v. Sullivan.
And in Rust v. Sullivan, Justice O'Connor dissented. That was the
case where you had a regulation by the Department of Health and
Human Services which had stood from 1971 to 1988 and then it
was changed, and the Supreme Court upheld its change on a varie-
ty of grounds which I had specified in my last round. But the one
which struck me the most peculiarly was the ground that it is ap-
propriate to change a regulation when it is in accord with a shift in
attitude. That has related, in part, to your compliment of Justice
Scalia in your Creighton speech where he had referred to political
considerations on changes in regulations.

  Justice O'Connor on the other hand voted to uphold the original
regulation and to strike down the new regulation because, as she
put it, "It would raise serious constitutional problems and would
constitute a serious first amendment concern." But I would ask
whether you would side with the O'Connor branch or the Scalia
branch of the revisionist court.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, without reference to Rust, I think as I
attempted to explain when we addressed this last week, Chevron v.
U.S.A. involved an instance in which EPA changed its regulation,
an existing regulation concerning the bubble concept. That was a
concept that was hotly contested, and EPA had adopted a regula-
tion rejecting the bubble concept, as I remember it.

  Subsequent to that, EPA revisited the concept and adopted it,
and the question was whether or not this new regulation was a rea-
sonable interpretation of EPA's underlying statute, or the statute
in that case. And the Court held that it was, indeed, and upheld
the regulation.

  That is generally the existing law with respect to deference to
agencies' reasonable interpretations in the administrative law area.
Whether or not that is easily transported to the difficult case that
you have just mentioned or is easily reducible to an instance in
which there seems to be just a change and, as you say, shifts in
political--shifts of attitudes and whether shifts of attitudes would
constitute a reasonable basis for making such a change or that
shift in attitude comports with a reasonable interpretation of the
underlying statute is, I think, a totally different question.

  But the point that I am making is simply that the Supreme
Court has permitted--in the leading case in the administrative law
area has permitted there to be a change of regulations by the
agency, even when the existing regulation had been in place for
some time.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, in Rust v. Sullivan, the Court
concluded that the regulation was acceptable, saying that:
                                        419

  The regulations simply ensure that appropriate funds are not used for activities,
including speech, that are outside the Federal program scope.

  That ruling gives me enormous concern. It has given many,
many people in this country enormous concern in light of the very
extensive Federal rule on funding. So that if you have a Federal
program which is funding a given activity and you say that no one
can speak in opposition to that program, there is an enormous lati-
tude for restricting freedom of speech. And my question to you is:
Do you think that it is appropriate when there is Federal funding
involved to limit speech when that speech is outside the Federal
program scope?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that in this case, with respect to
the question, the underlying question in Rust v. Sullivan, I think it
would be, from my standpoint, moving too far to comment on the
underlying issues.

  Senator SIMON. Why?
  Judge THOMAS. AS I have indicated in other instances, Senator,
in these difficult cases, it is important to me that I not compromise
my impartiality should cases of this nature, similar cases be consid-
ered by the Supreme Court in the future, if I am, of course, fortu-
nate to be confirmed.
  Senator SPECTER. But, Judge Thomas, I am not asking you about
any specific issue, let alone any specific case. I am asking you
about a very broad--a broad, broad philosophical question. It is as
broad as the areas of Federal funding, which are gigantic, and it is
as broad as the first amendment freedom of speech, which we hope
even exceeds the breadth of Federal funding. And the issue is, just
because the Federal Government gets into funding and establishes
a scope of a program--and I am not talking about any specific
issue--doesn't that give you at least some concern about limita-
tions on speech, if you could curtail speech where Federal funding
is involved?
  Judge THOMAS. I think as I suggested last week, Senator, I was
very concerned in instances in which it appears or in instances in
which regulations by the Government curtail our fundamental
freedoms, and in this case freedom of speech. I share that concern.
  What I am attempting to avoid is offering a judgment on an
agreement with a point of view on a very hotly contested and diffi-
cult case that could certainly come before the Court again.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge, I am really beyond the case, but I
will not press it further. Let me move on with my question to you
about the revisionist court and, if you join, whether you will be on
the Scalia branch or the O'Connor branch, and go back to Johnson
v. Santa Clara. Justice O'Connor takes Justice Scalia to task for
his dissent which he says is an academic discussion, and then I
think in a very important doctrinal view says that:

  Justice Scalia's dissent rejects the Court's precedents and addresses the question
of how title VII should be interpreted as if the Court were writing on a clean slate.

  You have already stated that you believe the constitutional inter-
pretation is a moving body, depending on the tradition and customs
of our society, without being rigidly controlled by original intent.
And here you have Justice Scalia taking title VII, as Justice O'Con-
nor says, writing on a clean slate. And Justice O'Connor rejects
                                         420

that and says that we have to take into account the Court's prece-
dents.

  My question to you: Would you choose a preference between the
approaches between Justice O'Connor and Justice Scalia on that
issue?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is important for any judge to
take into account, even when he or she disagrees with a particular
case, to recognize that there is the additional burden and addition-
al question of whether or not this case should be overruled; that is,
a question about the doctrine of stare decisis.

  I do not think that judges should assume, simply because they
disagree with a particular case, that we are operating as though
there was no prior case law or there are no precedents and feel
free to act as though they are not in any way controlled or re-
strained or constrained by prior case law.

  My sentiments, without expressing a particular judgment on that
case, my sentiments would be toward a preference for recognizing
that there is significant weight to be given to existing case law and
that the burden is on the judge who wants to change that prece-
dent, to not only show why it is wrong, but why stare decisis
should not apply.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you. I am going to score that one for
Justice O'Connor, which may make it one to one.

  Let me move on to the war powers issue, Judge Thomas, a ques-
tion which has not yet been broached and one that I think is enor-
mously important and one which you and I had discussed in the
informal session which we had before the hearings started.

  We have just seen a historic event in the course of the past year
with the gulf war and the vote by the Congress authorizing the
President to use force in the gulf war. In your writings, you have
been concerned about congressional activity in many areas; and in
your speech at Brandeis University on April 8, 1988, you said:

  In many areas of public policy, including foreign policymaking, Members of Con-
gress can thwart or substitute their will for that of the Executive.

And you focus on foreign policy.
  You have been very critical of the Congress, as I had commented

earlier, noting that there is little deliberation and even less wisdom
in the manner in which the legislative branch conducts its busi-
ness. And in your speech on September 3, 1987, at the American
Political Science association, you quoted with approval a statement
by Gary Jacobson that in Congress there is great individual respon-
siveness, equally great collective irresponsibility.

  There are many issues where there is a confrontation between
the President and the Congress, which we all know, and I would
like your views as to the authority of the Congress under its consti-
tutional, exclusive responsibility to declare war, as opposed to the
President's authority as Commander in Chief, which is a very cen-
tral issue, was a central issue earlier this year.

  Let me start with the question that I told you I was going to ask
you, and that is whether the Korean conflict was, in fact, a war.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I, in response to our informal discus-
sions, did attempt to resolve an issue that scholars and political sci-
entists, lawyers, seem to have been debating for the last 40 years
                                         421

and I recognized, I believe as I indicated to you, the hostilities in
Korea and the President's response. Of course, I don't think that
there was a suggestion that the President could not respond, but
your question at the time went to whether or not there should
have been a declaration of war.

  Senator SPECTER. Correct.
  Judge THOMAS. And the short answer to that is, from my stand-
point, I don't know. I have attempted to look at that question, but,
again, it is one that scholars haven't resolved and that legal minds
haven't been able to resolve. And I think that I would be impru-
dent to attempt to resolve it in this environment.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Thomas, when I asked you the
question at our informal session as to whether the Korean conflict
was a war, you said, "You asked that question of Judge Souter."
And I said, "That is right." And he ducked, and then I said, "Well,
let me give you the weekend." He came back and he said, "I don't
know."
  Now, I thought that was OK under those circumstances where it
was from Friday to Monday, but you and I talked about this on
August 1 and now it is September 16. And I don't think that the
Korean incident is going to be repeated. It is not asking you to
comment on a pending case, and it is well established historically
as to what happened. And this is a crucial issue as to whether
American troops are going to be committed to combat on the Presi-
dent's word alone as Commander in Chief or whether it is going to
require a congressional declaration of war.
  So, to the extent that I can push it just a little bit, let me repeat
the question. Was it a war?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, this isn't one of the instances in which I
am saying that the issue of whether or not the Korean--the hostil-
ities in Korea was a war would be coming before the Court. This is
an instance when, as I have indicated to you, I simply don't know.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, let me try again. Instead of moving to an
easier question, I will move to a harder one.
  In early January of this year, there was a lot of debate as to
whether the President had the authority to commit troops in the
gulf war without a resolution. President Bush asserted he did. And
this Judiciary Committee held hearings in early January, and some
even suggested, I think ridiculously, that the President would be
impeached if he moved ahead without waiting for a congressional
resolution. I thought it was ridiculous because Congress had sat on
its hands for months and had allowed the United Nations to set a
date for the use of force January 15, and finally--finally--Congress
acted, started some discussions on January 10 and moved on it on
January 12.
  I am not going to ask you whether you think the Constitution
required congressional action or the President had the sole author-
ity to act as Commander in Chief, because if you won't answer the
Korea question, you are not going to answer that one. So let me
ask you instead: What would the considerations be that you would
work through in approaching that kind of a legal issue?
  Judge THOMAS. It is a very difficult issue, Senator. I have ad-
dressed whether or not--in the War Power Act, resolution, of
course, is very complex and has a variety of reporting provisions,
                                             422

as well as the more difficult provision involving the withdrawal of
troops.

  I think that, as I may have alluded to in our conversation earlier
in private, the whole issue of what the President's authority is, as
opposed to the authority of Congress, seems to be one that is more
amenable to the kind of process that this body and the Executive
went through or engaged in the Persian Gulf conflict; that is, one
in which the conflict is resolved in the political context.

  I don't think there is certainly not very much in the way of judi-
cial precedent or judicial consideration of this particular issue. And
as I have noted before, there is an ongoing debate among scholars
on both sides of the issue. I for one, just as I have viewed the issue,
as I have looked at it, it seems to be one of those instances in
which the differences, particularly when there is an existing con-
flict, are better worked out in cooperation between the executive
and the legislative branches.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Thomas, I agree with you totally
that it is better to work them out, but that issue could come before
the Court. And a concern which I have expressed is your state-
ments suggesting a lack of wisdom in the Congress, and I know you
have already said that you will be fair and impartial and that what
you had said in the past was as an advocate as opposed to where
you stand as a judge. So I don't think there is any use in pursuing
that one any further.

  Let me turn to a specific case which you have decided, Judge. Al-
though you did not write the opinion, it is a case of some signifi-
cance involving the United States v. Jose Lopez. It is a case which
involves the interpretation of socioeconomic status under the Uni-
form Sentencing Guidelines which have been enacted to try to
bring uniformity on sentences in criminal cases. Those guidelines
say that socioeconomic status should not be considered on the sen-
tencing issue.

  The facts in this case were very compelling about Mr. Lopez in
terms of his own background, where, as the opinion of the court
said, the tragic circumstances involved the death of his mother by
his stepfather murdering her, his own threats that he had to leave
town to avoid problems, his growing up in the slums of New York
and Puerto Rico, and of not fitting in because of his dual back-
ground.

  The U.S. attorney prosecuting the case on behalf of the Govern-
ment in asking for a tough sentence argued that--and this is also
from the opinion:

  The Government urges that a focus on particular life experiences would permit
every defendant to distinguish himself from all others, and this would undermine
the purpose of the uniformity of sentencing procedures.

  You were on the panel which upheld an expansion of the sen-
tencing guidelines which prohibited considering socioeconomic cir-
cumstances. And my question to you is: How far do you think it is
appropriate to go in that line? And was the U.S. attorney prosecut-
ing the case, in asking for a tough sentence, really totally wrong in
the concern expressed that it would permit every defendant to dis-
tinguish himself from all others and thus undermine the purposes
of uniformity in the guidelines?
                        423

Judge THOMAS. The concern--as you indicated, Senator, I didn't
write the opinion, and
Senator SPECTER. But you joined in the opinion.
Judge THOMAS. I joined in the opinion. After awhile, you learn
that when you don't--after about 150 or 200 of these cases, they
are a little hard to recall. But this case was a difficult case. It is
one that took into account the notion or the concern that this body
had that sentences be uniform, that there not be wide disparities in
sentences.

At the same time, the question was when there is an individual,
such as Mr. Lopez, who has had very difficult and traumatic cir-
cumstances in his or her life, is this a factor that is not socioeco-
nomic. Even though it may have resulted from socioeconomic
status--that is, where he lived--are these factors that should be
considered?

I think what the court did in that case--and I haven't had an
opportunity to review that opinion--is to wrestle with that difficult
issue, but also to recognize that there was in the uniform guide-
lines a prohibition against considering socioeconomic status and I
think ultimately feeling compelled to comply with that require-
ment.

Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, the issue of the death penalty
has not arisen in these proceedings except for one reference earlier
to Federal court habeas corpus, but that is a very important sub-
ject. There are deep-seated differences of opinion on the matter. I
was a district attorney in Philadelphia for many years and believe
the death penalty is a deterrent. Philosophically, is there anything
about the application of the death penalty which would bother you
from upholding it, if confirmed for the Supreme Court?

Judge THOMAS. Philosophically, Senator, there is nothing that
would bother me personally about upholding it in appropriate
cases. My concern, of course, would always be that we provide all
of the available protections and accord all of the protections avail-
able to a criminal defendant who is exposed to or sentenced to the
death penalty.

Senator SPECTER. Well, since Furman v. Georgia, there have been
elaborate circumstances set up for consideration of all the mitigat-
ing circumstances. But there has been a concern beyond the impo-
sition of the death penalty in terms of its not violating the eighth
amendment to cruel and unusual punishment. And I frankly am
pleased to hear your answer that you would support it in the ap-
propriate case.

  There has been another concern    about the   t8rxe/2myeenadrosu. sAdnedlatyh,eirne
some cases as long as 17 years, an  average of
are proposals pending which I have authored which would set time
limits within the Federal system to give an opportunity in the Fed-
eral court for a full hearing, but to make it a priority case because
it is really watched by so many people as to whether law enforce-
ment is really serious in carrying out penalties.
One of the legislative provisions calls for a time limit in the Su-
preme Court to decide these matters within 90 days, unless the
case is so unusual that it requires an extension of time, in which
event the Court could take longer on a stated reason.
                                               424

  But I have two questions for you. One is--and people said this
was too much for Congress to do because the Court didn't sit in the
summertime, and the response to that was, well, the Court could
sit in the summertime like other courts do. And my question to you
is: Do you think that Congress has the authority to establish a
timetable--as we have under the Speedy Trial Act, for example--
and, second, to try to abbreviate it, whether 90 days is a reasonable
time? Or if not, what time limit would be?

  Judge THOMAS. Of course, there is precedent, as you have alluded
to, Senator, for establishing timeframes. Whether or not Congress
has the authority to do it in this particular case I have not had an
opportunity to think about. But Congress certainly has established
timeframes in a procedural way that governs the way Federal
courts at the district court level, certainly in our Rules of Civil Pro-
cedure that govern the way that we do business. The Speedy Trial
Act I think is the best example, the one best example.

  The question as to whether or not 90 days is the appropriate
time, I don't know. My concern would be this: I know that there is
the attitude that we must move on, that you must clear these cases
from the docket. We feel that way. We certainly feel that pressure
as judges. But I think that there can be instances in which 90 days
is not enough. There can be instances in which it may take more
time to assure oneself that a particular defendant has been accord-
ed all of his or her rights.

  I would be reluctant to say that I endorse a particular cookie-
cutter approach, but at the same time, I have no alternative to
offer as to what is an appropriate length of time. But my concern
would always be that we do not put ourselves in the position of
adopting an approach that would ultimately in some way curtail
the rights of the criminal defendant.

  Senator SPECTER. Moving, Judge Thomas, to the Voting Rights
Act, you have criticized Supreme Court decisions there and have,
as noted in your Wake Forest speech back on April 18, 1988, re-
ferred to the individual right to vote as opposed to protecting some
ethnic group with sufficient clout. But the Voting Rights Act has
been very carefully tailored to try to provide that there is organiza-
tion of voting districts so that a specific group does have some
clout, as opposed to a large representation or a configuration which
deny a group of some meaningful participation in the electoral
process.

  My question to you is: Don't you think, aside from the general-
ization of individualism, that there is some very important objec-
tive to be reached through the Voting Act to have a group with an
adequate meaningful participation in the political process?

  Judge THOMAS. Yes, I agree with that, Senator. My concern--I
think when I wrote that, these speeches on individual rights versus
group rights, I believe, and that was a one-paragraph example. I
was using this general example, and it is the general concern that I
have had throughout my speeches, and that is in according group
rights that you don't overlook individual rights. I was not--I loose-
ly, I think, referred to the voting rights cases, but the debate that I
was referring to was the school of thought when--I remember in
the early 1980's there was some suggestion and some feeling that
the Supreme Court cases prior to the amendments of the Voting
                                     425

Rights Act required proportional representation. And, of course,
there were denials to that, but there was that school of thought.

  My attitude was that if, indeed, there is proportional representa-
tion that that presupposes--I think that is the word I used in that
speech--that presupposes that all minorities would vote alike or all
minorities thought alike. And that is something that I have--those
kinds of stereotypes are matters that I have felt in the past were
and continue to feel are objectionable.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Judge Thomas.
  I know my time is up, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Our next questioner would be Senator Kennedy, but I under-
stand he is prepared to yield to Senator Metzenbaum because Sena-
tor Metzenbaum is also required to be at the Gates hearing and to
question there.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank
you, Senator Kennedy.
  Good morning, Judge Thomas. It is nice to see you again.
  Judge Thomas, your testimony before this committee has
touched upon the subject of economic rights several times. This is
an area of concern because over 50 years ago, the Supreme Court
used economic rights arguments to strike down laws that were de-
signed to protect workers' rights and establish a minimum wage.
  In a 1987 speech to the Business Law Section of the American
Bar Association, you stated that, "The entire Constitution is a Bill
of Rights and economic rights are protected as much as any other
rights."
  You also stated that, "Legislative initiatives such as the mini-
mum wage in Davis-Bacon provided barriers against black Ameri-
cans entering the labor force." You went on to say, "It is amazing
just how little attention has been paid to these outright denials of
economic liberties."
  Frankly, Judge Thomas, I am amazed to hear you say that legis-
lative initiatives such as the minimum wage provided a barrier
against black Americans. I would say percentage-wise in my opin-
ion--I don't have the statistical data, but I would guess that per-
centage-wise no group of Americans benefited more from the fact
that employers could not pay them less than $3.35 an hour. And, of
course, it has gone up since that time.
  But, Judge Thomas, in this 1987 speech you characterized the
minimum wage as "an outright denial of economic liberty," and
you stated that, "Economic rights are as protected as any other
rights in the Constitution."
  My question to you is: In 1987 did you believe that the minimum
wage law violated economic rights which you thought were protect-
ed by the Constitution?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator. And I think I have made myself
clear here, and I have discussed it here. I don't have a copy of the
speech in front of me.
  The point that I was making with respect to minimum wage was
a policy point, not a constitutional point. But let me address the
constitutional point first.
  I have indicated that I believe that the Court's post-Loc/mer deci-
sions are the correct decisions; that those cases were appropriately
                                         426

decided; that the Court is not a super-legislature to second-guess
the very complicated social and economic decisionmaking of the
legislative and executive branches.

  With respect to the minimum wage, there was an ongoing policy
debate concerning what the impact of the minimum wage was on
certain minorities, particularly minority teenagers, and there is
data to suggest that each time the minimum wage rises, minority
teenagers, the unemployment rate increases.

  Now, that is not to suggest that the minimum wage itself is not
beneficial; indeed, it is. I think we all want everyone to make a
decent wage. I certainly believe in that. But I think that there was
a legitimate debate as to what are some of the impacts or unin-
tended consequences of it, and that was the basis of that comment.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, Judge Thomas, as Chairman Biden
pointed out on Wednesday, economic rights currently are not enti-
tled to the same degree of protection as other rights, such as due
process, equal protection, and free speech. If they did receive that
degree of protection, it would be much harder for Congress to pass
laws protecting the environment, workers' rights, and the safety of
workers in the workplace.

  The speech in which you made that statement regarding econom-
ic rights was not a speech on political philosophy that you were
giving to the Cato Institute. You were talking about the Constitu-
tion and economic rights, and you were talking to the Business
Law Section of the American Bar Association. These were corpo-
rate lawyers. I am sure many of them were delighted to hear what
you had to say about economic rights being protected by the Consti-
tution as much as any other rights.

  But on Wednesday, in response to a question from Chairman
Biden, you stated that in constitutional adjudication, it would not
necessarily be the case that the protection of economic rights
"would be at the same level that we protect other rights."

  Now, based on what you said in 1987 and what you told this com-
mittee, it would appear to me that today, as well as in your re-
sponse to the chairman, that you have changed your views regard-
ing this subject. You didn't make a distinction in your speech be-
tween young blacks and older blacks. You were talking about all
blacks.

  What has prompted you to change your views on this matter of
economic rights?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have not changed my views. The point
that I was making is that we do have rights, property rights, eco-
nomic rights, within our Constitution. Now, we have other rights
in our Constitution. The question becomes in constitutional adjudi-
cation at what level of scrutiny can those--or at what level of scru-
tiny does the Court look at regulation of those rights? They do
exist. They are in the Constitution. I don't think there is any dis-
agreement about that. The level of scrutiny for socioeconomic--in
this case, the relevant factor for economic rights is rational basis. I
have not quibbled with that, and I have made that clear.

  In fact, in that very same speech or in one closely related to that,
I made the point that the individuals who wanted to revisit the
level of scrutiny for economic rights, I disagreed with them--indi-
viduals, as Chairman Biden mentioned, such as Macedo. But the
                                         427

mere fact that you don't review those rights in the same way
doesn't mean they don't exist, and it does not mean that they are
not important.

  However, I think what we do recognize in this society is that
there are some rights that we value that are so deeply embedded in
our society, at the core of our society, such as our first amendment
rights, that we will review with a different standard. But to review
it as a different standard in no way says these rights are unimpor-
tant. It recognizes our political process.

  The CHAIRMAN. Will the Senator yield on my time?
  Senator METZENBAUM. Of course.
  The CHAIRMAN. Professor Macedo has come up several times. I
have raised him. And I would like for the record to read a letter I
received from Professor Macedo on Friday afternoon. I am sure he
wouldn't mind. And this is his book. He said I kept holding up Ep-
stein's book. I might as well hold up his book. [Laughter.]
  It says, "Dear Senator Biden: Many thanks for giving me 15 min-
utes of fame, as Andy Warhol promised. Quite apart from this,
though, it might be hard to profess objectivity now"--that is not
relevant.
  He said, "I could not agree more that the natural law issue is
worth pursuing and have been a bit disappointed by Judge
Thomas' vagueness." I might note parenthetically I have been very
happy with that.

  As a token of my appreciation, I wanted to offer a few pieces of work to you and
your staff. The article, "The Right of Privacy: A Constitutional Moral Defense" is
pretty clear and straightforward, I think, on the question of why something like
natural law is inescapable in constitutional adjudication, as you have said at the
hearings. I send along the book.

  Then I want to read from just one paragraph of the article he
sent along to make sure everything is clear in the record as to why
both Senator Metzenbaum and I are pursuing this about Dr.
Macedo. This is Steve Macedo's article, "Economic Liberty and the
Future of Constitutional Self-government," sent to me Friday by
Professor Macedo, and it is Macedo, M-a-c-e-d-o. He says: N

  The future economic liberty under the Constitution depends on the viability of the
double standard--

his words, the double standard--

that has for nearly half a century characterized judicial interpretations of our fun-
damental law. The modern court applied a searching level of scrutiny to challenge
laws that interfere with a list of preferred freedoms, including liberties associated
with speech, religion, and privacy, or that involve discrimination against discrete
and insular minorities. At the same time, and despite the Constitution's several ex-
plicit supports for economic freedom, laws interfering with economic liberties and
property rights are typically subjected to a lax test designed to establish only the
merest rational basis exists for the law in question. In applying this double stand-
ard, as I shall explain at greater length below, the modern court ignores the Consti-
tution's support for economic liberty, disparages close connections between economic
and other forms of freedoms, and invests legislators with unwarranted measures of
trust, trampling at the core ideal of our constitutional regime the aspiration of rea-
sonable self-government.

  Now, the judge knew and I knew and everyone else knew why I
asked that question, because Professor Macedo believes that the
standard--which I understand you have no quarrel with and
                                         428

accept, that has been around for half a decade, as he points out, is
one that we should continue.

  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. He believes it is one we should jettison. That was
the reason for the questions and the reason why I appreciate--
whether I agree with it or not--your answer distinguishing the fact
that you do not agree with Macedo that we should jettison this
double standard, as he called it. Am I correct?
  Judge THOMAS. Right.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank the Chair, and I ask unanimous consent
that the letter to me be introduced in the record as if read.

Dear Senator Biden:

         Many thanks for giving me 15minutes of fame - as Andy
Warhol promised.

         Quite apart from this - though itmight be hard to
profess objectivity now - I have been very impressed with
your questioning. I could not agree more that the "natural
law" issue isworth pursuing, and have been a bit
disappointed by Judge Thomas's vagueness.

         As a token of my appreciation, I wanted to offer a few
pieces of work to you and your staff. The article on "The
Right to Privacy: A Constitutional and Moral Defense" is
pretty clear and straightforward, I think, on the question
of why something like natural law is inescapable in
constitutional adjudication, asyou have said in the
hearings.

     . X send--along-- the -bookr---in_part, in case you need
-another prop. It was a good visual--effect when you waived
the Epstein and Fried books - but I wouldn't want you to
wear them out!

May I make one humble request? I believe that Warhol's

promise has a proviso to the effect that when you get your

15 minutes they've got to spell your name right. Mine se'e.ms

to have entered the transcript as "Masito," according to the

New York Times at least. Since I am not Japanese but           \

  The CHAIRMAN. I thank the Chair for allowing me--not the
Chair.

  Senator METZENBAUM. YOU are the Chair.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I thank you very much. Sitting next to
Senator Thurmond I am never sure what I am. He is always the
Chair. But thank you very much for the interruption, but I thought
it important to put that in the record. Anyone who wants to look
at the book, this is it, "Liberal Virtues."
  Senator METZENBAUM. One last question on this matter of the
minimum wage. You gave me a rather lengthy answer, but I think
this just takes a simple yes or no.
  Do you still believe that the minimum wage law is an outright
denial of economic liberty for employers?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that I characterized it in the
way that I think that I meant it, and that is that it does have unin-
tended consequences of eliminating certain individuals or preclud-
ing them from entering the job market. There is data on that. I
have
  Senator METZENBAUM. YOU haven't answered the question, Judge
Thomas, I beg to point out to you. You are talking about the
impact. I am not asking about the impact. You are saying it does
preclude certain individuals from obtaining jobs. My question is:
Do you still believe that the minimum wage law is an outright
denial of economic liberty? Which is what you had stated, I think it
was in 1987?
  Judge THOMAS. And I explained, Senator, I think, what I meant
by that. It does not allow certain individuals to enter the work
force. And I did not intend to suggest, as I have also indicated to
you, that this was some sort of constitutional judgment.
  If we are talking about constitutional law, liberty in that sense,
then the answer is no. That is not what I am saying.
  Senator METZENBAUM. One of the most puzzling parts of your
testimony to the committee last week is your suggestion that we
should discount most of your past statements on legal and policy
issues because those were made in your role as a policymaker
rather than as a judge. The interesting thing is that your support-
ers assert that your childhood experience of growing up poor in the
segregated South is a very important part of our consideration, and
I agree with that. Your supporters argue that your personal history
demonstrates that you will bring sensitivity to the bench when con-
sidering issues of race and poverty. I am not sure whether I agree
with that.
  You have basically said the same thing to us. In other words,
your argument seems to be that your childhood background is
more relevant to assessing your qualifications for the High Court
than are a decade of speeches and writings and an 8-year record
while head of the EEOC. Frankly, Judge Thomas, I have difficulty
with that. Your tenure at EEOC is the major portion of your
record. That is what qualified you for the court of appeals. Quite
frankly, your tenure on the appellate court has been so brief that it
gives us little indication of what kind of Justice you would be on
the High Court. By your own admission, you spoke out on a
number of issues during your chairmanship at the EEOC.
                                         431

  Judge I start from the assumption that public officials mean
what they say. I do not think you were going around the country
articulating views and advocating policy positions that you did not
believe in. And if you were articulating views or advocating posi-
tions that you did not believe in, I think it is incumbent upon you
to tell this committee when and why you were doing that.

  I have to assume that when you expressed views on legal and
policy issues as EEOC Chairman, those were your views. I can
accept the idea that your views on certain matters may have
changed between now and the time which you expressed yourself
on a particular issue. But it is difficult to accept the notion that
the moment you put on that judge's robe, all the views and posi-
tions which you held prior to going on the bench just magically dis-
appeared. That is not my experience of the way it is in the real
world.

  If that was the case, then there would be no point in looking at
anything beyond the past 16 months of your life. The pre-judicial
record and positions of a nominee are usually a good indicator of
what kind of judge that nominee will be. That is why we have
these hearings--to explore that record and those positions.

  You have spoken out a great deal on contemporary social and po-
litical issues. I want to ask you about some statements you have
made on these issues because so often today's political or social
issue becomes tomorrow's legal issue for the Court.

  I think it is important for the Senate to have a sense of how you
think about these matters. I have copies of speeches I want to ask
you about. If you need to refer to those speeches or believe that a
quote has been taken out of context, you should say so. I am trying
to get a sense of how you think about political and social issues,
and it is important that we be accurate.

  For example, in an April 1987 speech at the Cato Institute,
which has been referred to quite often, you stated that you "agree
wholeheartedly" with former Treasury Secretary William Simon's
statement that:

   We are careening with frightening speed toward collectivism and away from free
individual sovereignty, toward coercive, centralized planning and away from free in-
dividual choices, toward a statist, dictatorial system and away from a nation in
which individual liberty is sacred.

  Now, Judge, this statement frankly does not comport with the re-
ality of American political life in 1987. Why is it that in the sev-
enth year of one of the most conservative administrations in this
century you believe that this country was "careening with frighten-
ing speed toward a statist, dictatorial system"?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that I have not an opportunity
to go back and review that speech in detail. I have looked at it and
don't know exactly where that quote appears in it. But the point I
think throughout these speeches is a notion that we should be care-
ful about the relationship between the Government and the indi-
vidual and should be careful that the Government itself does not at
some point displace or infringe on the rights of the individual. That
is a concern, as I have noted here, that runs throughout my speech-
es.

  In quoting former Secretary of the Treasury Simon, I think I was
just underscoring that point.
                                                 432

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, Judge Thomas, if you have the
speech in front of you--if you don't, I will send it to you--let me
point out to you where it appears because I think that is very sig-
nificant, and I think you have made a significant point. It is in
your windup. "I find myself agreeing wholeheartedly with former
Treasury Secretary William F. Simon when he asserts that"--and
then I read the whole quote. And then you go on to say, "I can't
think of a more appropriate time for truth than the Bicentennial of
our Constitution"--thank you. Was there some material in be-
tween?

  I am informed by my staff that
  Judge THOMAS. Which speech
  Senator METZENBAUM. That was the very end of the speech.
  Judge THOMAS. Which speech was that, now, Senator?
  Senator METZENBAUM. This was the speech to the Cato Institute
on April 23, 1987. My question to you, so we don't lose sight of it, is
that this was the seventh year of the Reagan administration, and I
am trying to find out from you how you concluded that the country
at that time was "careening with frightening speed toward a stat-
ist, dictatorial system."
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I indicated to you and I think as I
indicated throughout this speech, the point that I was making is
that we were losing sight of the--it was my feeling that we were
losing sight of the relationship, the appropriate relationship be-
tween the individual and the Government. And in quoting former
Treasury Secretary Simon's speech, I think it was simply to under-
score that point.
  Senator METZENBAUM. And you thought this was happening
during the Reagan administration?
  Judge THOMAS. I think the relationship--my point was, again, as
I indicated, that the concerns seemed to be diminished about the
rights of the individual, and I was underscoring that point with
that quote.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I will go on. In an April 1988 speech at
Cal State University, you declared that:

  Those who have been excluded from the American dream increasingly are being
used by demagogues who hope to harness the anger of the so-called under class for
the purpose of advancing a political agenda that resembles the crude totalitarianism
of contemporary socialist states much more than it does the democratic constitution-
alism of the Founding Fathers.

  Now, Judge Thomas, I think most Americans believe that any
laws that resemble "the crude totalitarianism of contemporary so-
cialist states"--your quote--would be inconsistent with our Consti-
tution. I think most Americans believe that, if you are confirmed,
you would have a duty to strike down any such laws. That is why
we need to know what you meant when you used such terms.

  In 1988 when you made that statement, what programs and poli-
cies did you have in mind when you spoke of "a political agenda
that resembles the crude totalitarianism of contemporary socialist
states"?

  Judge THOMAS. The point that I was making in that particular
portion of the speech, again, was this: That there seemed to be
some efforts to disenchant or to encourage or to take advantage of
disenchantment of certain individuals in order to, I think--and this
                                        433

was, again, a policy point of view--to enlarge the role of Govern-
ment. That was a concern of mine, and I think it is consistent with
the concern that I expressed to you or that I expressed in the Cato
speech.

  I think that that was an appropriate concern. Of course, once
again there is quite a bit of rhetoric there, but the point is quite
simply that the relationship that I felt was getting lost in the shuf-
fle and in the confusion was the relationship of the individual to
the Government.

  Senator METZENBAUM. That speech was in 1988, and in your
speeches in 1987 and 1988, you seem to be talking about running
toward this totalitarianism, toward a socialist state. And yet it is in
a very conservative President's administration.

  I sort of wonder, were you just using words to make a good
speech, or did you really believe the things you were saying? Be-
cause the facts belie your assertions.

  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, I also made it a point to bring
the same concerns with respect to particularly minority individuals
whom I have noted in this speech in its relationship even with the
administration, that the administration was not addressing those
concerns and certainly were not at that time addressing minorities
as individuals. I think that that was one of the reasons and one of
the bases of the Heritage speech.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Yes, but the concern for the minorities
was not being expressed by that administration. It was the reverse,
and it wasn't that totalitarian socialist state about which you
speak. That wasn't the problem. The problem was to try to prevail
upon a conservative Republican administration to be concerned
about minorities' problems. It wasn't this other concern about
which you speak that was affecting minorities, as I see it.

  Let me go on.
  You wrote a chapter of a 1988 book entitled "Assessing the
Reagan Years," in which you dismissed as an invention the argu-
ment that the ninth amendment undergirds the right to privacy. In
the article, you expressed concern that the ninth amendment pro-
vides judges with a blank check to strike down legislation deemed
by the Court to violate certain unenumerated rights. You also state
that, "The ninth amendment will likely become an additional
weapon for the enemies of freedom."
  In 1988, Judge Thomas, who are these enemies of freedom that
you were referring to?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the point, again, that I was making, I
have noted what my approach and concern about the ninth amend-
ment itself was. It was the concern that judges would use the ninth
amendment without reference to anything more than his or her
own predilections, and that the adjudication of the ninth amend-
ment had to be rooted in something other than that, had to be
rooted in tradition and history.
  With respect to my concern, the larger concern, it was that the
efforts would be to enlarge the Government at the expense of the
individual, not so much a commentary on the ninth amendment,
but it is the overall point that I have made throughout these
speeches, the relationship of the Government to the individual.
                                                 434

  Senator METZENBAUM. But you didn't answer. Who were these
enemies of freedom?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I don't think I named any. I think it was
just a general--those who

  Senator METZENBAUM. Did you have anybody in mind?
  Judge THOMAS. Not in particular, Senator.
  Senator METZENBAUM. In an October 1987 speech at the Cato In-
stitute, you expressed concern that:

  Maximization of rights is perfectly compatible with total Government and regula-
tion. Unbound by notions of obligation and justice, the desire to protect rights
simply plays into the hands of those who advocate a total state.

  It sounds like you had serious misgivings about protecting rights.
In 1987, how did you think the protection of rights could lead to a
total state?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think the point that I made earlier in
the hearings is that I wasn't talking about the rights that we con-
sider fundamental, but that one could just simply say that he or
she has a particular program and that program then becomes a
right, and that it would actually be nothing more than one's pref-
erences, as opposed to the rights protected in the Constitution, and
that a proliferation of these rights or policies would actually under-
mine the value of the rights that we hold near and dear or the
rights that are currently protected by our Constitution.

  Senator METZENBAUM. But in a 1988 speech at the Pacific Re-
search Institute, you said, "Too great an emphasis on rights can be
harmful for democracy." I needn't tell you that if you are con-
firmed, your job on the Supreme Court will be to protect the rights
of Americans.

  What made you believe that emphasizing rights can harm de-
mocracy?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I indicated, the rights that I was talk-
ing about there were not constitutional rights but rights that could
proliferate simply by name, and these rights are nothing more
than programs or policies as opposed to our constitutional rights or
our fundamental rights.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Let me go to a different subject. During
the past 15 years, a number of American companies adopted poli-
cies which barred women from certain jobs unless they could prove
that they were not capable of bearing children. These so-called
fetal protection policies left the working women in the unconscion-
able position of having to undergo irreversible sterilization if they
wanted to keep their jobs. Tragically, that is just what happened to
a number of women at companies such as American Cyanamid and
Johnson Controls. Six months ago, the Supreme Court completely
banned these policies as illegal sex discrimination.

  Judge Thomas, as head of the EEOC from 1982 to 1990, you had
responsibility for protecting the millions of working women in this
country against sex discrimination. Shortly before you took over,
the EEOC decided not to resolve allegations of sex discrimination
involving these fetal protection policies until it developed a formal
position on the issue. In the interim, the sex discrimination charges
were investigated in the field and then simply sent to the Commis-
                                        435

sion's headquarters in Washington where they were held, pending
the development of an EEOC position.

  But under your leadership, under your command, the EEOC
failed to address this intolerable situation, not for 1 week, not for 1
month, not for 1 year, but for over 6 years. During this entire
period, dozens of charges of women involving fetal protection poli-
cies sat at your headquarters without resolution. The women who
filed those charges had rights, but their right became meaningless
in the absence of enforcement. And they didn't just lose their
rights, Judge Thomas. These working women lost their jobs, their
careers, their dignity, and in some cases even their ability to bear
children.

  Under increasing pressure from a House Education and Labor
Committee investigation, the EEOC finally took a position in 1988
and began to resolve these charges in 1989. By that point, over 100
charges had piled up. Your agency couldn't even find many of the
women who had filed the charges, so their cases were thrown out.
For these women, justice delayed was justice denied.

  I am very troubled by the EEOC's complete abdication of its
entire enforcement responsibilities in this area. I am particularly
disturbed because it appears that you were personally--personal-
ly--involved in the Commission's decision not to protect women
from these policies. First, a memorandum prepared by the EEOC's
Office of Legal Counsel described your personal preference that the
EEOC refrain from deciding whether these fetal protection policies
could be illegal under any circumstances:

   On Chairman Thomas' suggestion, the EEOC staff manual now emphasizes that
the Commission has not decided whether an exclusionary policy or practice is or can
lead to a violation of Title VII.

  In a second memorandum written to you in 1983, one of your
own staff aides emphasized the need for the EEOC to decide wheth-
er these policies were illegal. "Since the charges, once investigated,
will have to"--this is the quote in a memo--"Since the charges,
once investigated, will have to be dealt with in some fashion, I rec-
ommend that the staff now begin preparing options for handling
them. Otherwise, the Commission could end up with an inventory
of unresolved and unresolvable charges." That was in 1983.

  You responded by writing at the top of the memorandum, "Let's
discuss. I have serious problems with this area."

  You must, indeed, have had serious problems because you ig-
nored that staffer's warning and left women unprotected for a total
of 6 years.

  Judge Thomas, why did it take you 6 years to help the women or
to take any action to help the women who had filed these charges?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as you noted, this was as very difficult
area. The question for us was if an employer has a policy that says
that women will not be allowed in a certain job, because the job
itself, the radiation or, I believe in Johnson Control, battery acid
could lead to harm to the ovaries or to the woman's ability to bear
a healthy child or the next generation could have problems such as
cancer, et cetera.

  Initially, the concern was how do we make a judgment as to
these health risks. I think we had extensive coordination or worked
                                         436

with OSHA. I believe we worked with the EPA, et cetera, to try to
make this determination, what standard do we apply and what role
do we play. Again, I am basing this on my recollection of the early
1980's.

  We subsequently decided to--our normal procedure in that in-
stance is to bring the cases into headquarters until we develop a
policy. This was one of the more difficult areas, as we were devel-
oping other policies. This was not the only policy.

  Ultimately, I think we moved to giving guidance that indicated
that the decision would have to be made based on business necessi-
ty, which was a strict standard. Finally, the position which we
adopted was that if an employer were going to exclude women, it
had to be based upon a bona fide occupational qualification, and
that is ultimately the standards that the Supreme Court adopted.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, I have about 10 or 15 min-
utes more on this one subject, and then I would be concluded. I am
perfectly willing to wait my turn and come back for the next
round. I just wanted to know if the Chairman desires me to con-
clude.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I would think that we should take a break
now, in any event, to give the Judge an opportunity to stretch his
legs, and we can just huddle here for a second.

  I might say right now, Judge, I am trying to figure out the time,
because we are going to finish with you today and early, as I said
on Friday, even if we have to declare 2 o'clock the lunch hour. It
looks as though we have somewhere between 20 minutes or half an
hour more on the Republican side, maybe. I am not positive of that.
I think that is right. Senator Hatch has a few questions and I do
not know whether anybody else has any more questions.

  On the Democratic side, my questions, depending on how quickly
we go through them, could take anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes, I
do not know. It depends on the discussion we get into, if we do get
into one. It is mainly recapitulation. I can tell you now I am going
to talk to you a little bit about expressive conduct in speech and
separation of powers.

  Senator Kennedy has around 20 or 30 minutes. The Senator from
Ohio has 15 minutes or so. The Senator from Vermont has

  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I think I will take my full time. I
understand Senator Thurmond stated that the witness misunder-
stood my question when I asked about cases during the past 20
years. I may want to go back into that, too, now that the question
is fully understood. But I also have some other areas of question-
ing, so I would expect to take my full time.

  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Alabama has roughly one
round, half an hour, is that correct?

  Senator HEFLIN. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. And the Senator from Illinois is about 10 min-
utes.
  Senator SIMON. Less than that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Less than that. So, we are down to the wire now.
What I would do is ask you, as we break these 10 minutes, to make
a judgment as to how we are going to do that, but let us
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, in view of Senator Metz-
enbaum's question, Senator Hatch desires some time to answer it.
                                        437

  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Well, let us not get upset about it. We are
close and let us just keep plugging along.

  Let us take a 10-minute break now, Judge, and then maybe Mr.
Duberstein and I can speak a minute here.

  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order.
  Before I yield to Senator Hatch, what we have been doing, I say
to the public, in the interim is trying to figure out how we best
order bringing the testimony of Judge Thomas to an end, without
cutting off legitimate questions that are left, and there are some. I
think if we just let the string run here, we are going to do just fine.
  I received an admonition, though, Judge, I want to tell you this.
Your mom may be angry. She said she wants to go home. She told
me she has one of her patients who is 104 years old, has been
watching this on television, saying when is she coming home, and
she told her patient, "Clarence won't let me," and I am sure you
are going to tell her, "Biden won't let Clarence. [Laughter.]
  Let us see if we can move this along now. Again, I do not mean
in any way to disparage you. There are some very important ques-
tions that are left, but I think if we can just move with dispatch
here, whether or not we get it done by lunch, we will get it done.
We are not going to be long beyond that. I think we may still be
able to do that, but let us just move along.
  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Chairman Biden.
  I do not want you to go home, either, just yet. I think you have
really added a lot to these proceedings, so we are proud to have you
here.
  Judge, I think you fully understand that it is awful tough when
you make a lot of speeches in the past, and I am sure that some of
those speeches were written by an ardent and well-intention staff,
as they are for us in many cases, and I think we all understand
that.
  You are being criticized on one side for not being liberal enough,
and then I notice in the press this morning there are other articles
that are criticizing you for not being conservative enough, so I
think it just goes to show that you cannot please everybody.
  I do just want to take a few minutes, because Senator Metz-
enbaum did go into your EEOC record, and I think the Washington
Post sums it up pretty well, because on May 17, 1987, the Washing-
ton Post said this--and you had been in there for, what, 5 years at
that time?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator HATCH. OK. Here is what the Washington Post said:

  Things are markedly different at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion. Here the caseload is expanding and budget requests are increasing under the
quiet, but persistent leadership of Chairman Clarence Thomas.

  Now, that is pretty darn good, after 5 years, being in this very
tough maelstrom of a position, to have the Washington Post praise
your leadership, knowing that you were in the Reagan administra-
tion, which they did not very often praise, and some people think
with just cause, but I think it is important to point that out.
                                         438

  Second, let me point out some more. When you became Chair-
man of the EEOC, I was chairman of the Labor Committee at that
time. Senator Kennedy was my ranking member, and now it is re-
versed. He is chairman and I am ranking. But we overviewed the
EEOC. When you became Chairman of the EEOC, the General Ac-
counting Office right at that time issued a report on the state of
the EEOC, and that report listed the numerous financial and man-
agerial problems at the Commission. In fact, it was entitled, "Con-
tinuing Financial Management Problems at the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission," and it was issued May 17, 1982, right at
the time you came into office.

  Now, if you would just look at some of the--well, first of all, the
1982 GAO report, talking about the predecessors who operated the
EEOC, they found that the agency up to that time couldn't even
control its funds or its accounting practices. They said:

  The Commission has failed to properly maintain and operate the system. Records
and reports produced were unreliable, receivables were not properly collected, and
bills were not paid on time. Also, in failing to follow some established procedures,
the Commission's employees have created violations of law that now must be dealt
with.

  These problems predated you coming into the Commission. In the
1981 interim report, GAO stated that, "Some of EEOC's actions"--
now this is even before you were put in--"Some of EEOC's actions
may be thwarting its efforts to eliminate employment discrimina-
tion."

  Then the Office of Personnel Management released another
report on the EEOC in May 1982. It was entitled, "A Report on
Personnel and Administrative Management in the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission." They had audited some 60 jobs at
the EEOC's Office of Administration before you became Chairman
or went to that Commission. They audited the 60 jobs to determine
the relative accuracy at the EEOC's pay scale, and they found that
53 positions were overgraded, 42 percent of the positions were over-
graded by 3 or more grades, 26 percent were over 2 grades, and 32
percent were by 1 grade.

  Just look at the headings of the summary of findings. I think
they indicate the disarray the EEOC was in when you came, No. 1,
"Substantial overgrading exists within the Office of Administration
and likely exists in other parts of the agency." This is before you
came in. This is the predecessor agency.

  No. 2, "The supervisory structure is excessive and expensive."
No. 3, "The Personnel Office's two core programs, staffing and clas-
sification, are not in compliance with OPM requirements." No. 4,
"Administrative operations are deficient in closing out contracts,
accounting for physical property, cataloging in the library and mail
room operations." No. 5, "The agency's management accountability
plan may be failing to account for quality of its achievements." No.
6, "Management appears to have tolerated and contributed to a
work environment beset by acrimony, improperly employee con-
duct, poor performance, and favoritism." Those are the titles or the
headings of the sections in that OPM or Office of Personnel Man-
agement report.

  Let me ask you a question: Did you work on those problems?
                                        439

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, during my confirmation hearings in
1982, one bit of advice that you gave me, indeed you told me you
would hold me accountable for, was within a short period, to cor-
rect particularly the financial problems within a short period of
time, and we were able to do that. In fact, we were able to correct
the financial accounting problems and have a GAO certified
system, I believe within 2 years.

  Senator HATCH. In fact, the EEOC had $1 million they could not
even account for, is that not so, at that time?

  Judge THOMAS. That was one of the items that you told me spe-
cifically to account for in the travel area.

  Senator HATCH. And you cleared that up and resolved it?
  Judge THOMAS. We cleared that up and put in place a variety of
procedures and a variety of checkpoints, so that would not reoccur.
I think it would not be overstating the case to say that EEOC today
has one of the finest financial accounting systems in Government.
  Senator HATCH. IS it not true that each one of those problems
listed in that OPM report and listed in the GAO report, you either
improved or resolved?
  Judge THOMAS. We resolved those, I believe, shortly after you in-
structed us to do so, as chairman of the Labor and Human Re-
sources Committee. We attempted to address some of the long-term
problems, but the recommendations that were made in the GAO
report became the basis for our short-term plan, the immediate ac-
tions that we had to take upon arriving at EEOC, but most of those
problems were corrected, I believe, within the first year or two.
  Senator HATCH. In fact, you cleared up monitoring consent de-
crees and settlements, you insured not only that the judgments
were won, but that they were enforced. I think most would say,
having watched your tenure, would say you were creative when
changed circumstances necessitated an alteration in ongoing con-
sent decrees, some would cite the Ford Motor Co. situation as one
of the highlights. You certainly aggressively corrected and im-
proved management of the systemic litigation system, which was in
disarray at the time.
  I could go into all of that, but I do not want to take the time. I
just want to make the point that some of these criticisms that are
being brought up about the EEOC are not only wrong and misin-
formed, but they are distorting what really happened, because you
inherited an agency that was in disarray, the people were fighting
with each other, they were not bringing the litigation as they
could. Even the age discrimination cases were in disarray. You did
not have a central management system that was working well, you
did not have a good accounting system or a good financial system,
you had a lot of back-biting among employees, because they were
upset with each other because there was not a management team
that was necessary. All of that, as far as I could see, during your
tenure was improved upon or resolved. Is that a fair statement?
  Judge THOMAS. We did our best, Senator, and we think that we
not only addressed those problems, but we were able to engage in
some practices and to engage in some programs and develop pro-
grams that took EEOC far beyond where it was in 1982.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I have to say that I think most who really
know the situation, and I happen to know it, can find something to
                                         440

criticize, no matter what, because it is a big agency with a lot of
problems, and they are tough problems, they are among the tough-
est problems in our society today, they involved equal employment
opportunities and all kinds of other civil rights issues. It is a very
complex area, so they can find fault, but the fact is that you
cleared up all of these tremendously difficult problems that existed
down there.

  Some would say that you really--in fact, most who know would
say, in fact, I think all would say who know that you put forth an
aggressive effort to stamp out workplace discrimination at the time
that you ran the EEOC. In fact, some would say that is unques-
tioned.

  Litigation recommendations received from district offices in-
creased dramatically. The changes went up as high as 400 or 500
percent increase in better approaches of the EEOC.

  I do not want to take the time of the committee, because I know
we are trying to get through this and do our very best to finish
today, and I do not want to take anybody's time. But let me just go
into this one problem on fetal and reproductive hazards that Sena-
tor Metzenbaum brought up.

  If I understood his charge, it was basically that, at the EEOC at
the time you were Chairman, women who were barred from certain
jobs because of fetal protection concerns did not have their rights
enforced, but let me just respond to that.

  During your tenure there at the EEOC--and you correct me if I
say anything wrong here--there was a legitimate difference of
opinion among lawyers and others over whether title VII forbids
employers from excluding women from jobs that might endanger
any unborn children that they might be carrying or that they
might carry in the future.

  Now, that is a very, very complicated area of employment law
and title VII law. It involves scientific and medical considerations,
as well as legal considerations. And because of the complexity of
the issue and because other Government agencies such as OSHA,
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the EPA,
the Environmental Protection Agency, had to weigh it in their
views or weigh in with their views on this issue, it naturally took
some time for the EEOC to formulate a position on this issue, and
as it did, fetal protection discrimination charges that were filed
with the EEOC were naturally held in abeyance, because a judg-
ment had to be reached, a fair judgment, taking into consideration
all of the matters, including medical and legal and other matters.

  But because the charges were filed that were held in abeyance,
they were not prejudiced because they actually had been filed, is
that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
   Senator HATCH. SO, you had protected the rights of these people
during the time that the medical, legal, scientific, and other consid-
erations were taking place, and the filing of the charges tolled the
statute of limitations and stopped it from running.
  Moreover, the plaintiffs whose charges were held in abeyance,
they were free, as I understood it--and correct me if I am wrong--
they were free to sue privately in Federal court, is that correct?
                                         441

  Judge THOMAS. They could have perhaps received the right to
sue later and gone into Federal court, Senator.

  Senator HATCH. If they had wanted to.
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator HATCH. SO, nothing was interfering with their rights to
do that, which was a very important right.
  Judge THOMAS. That is right. The difficulty, Senator, as you
pointed out, was that it was as very complex area and an area that
involved a tremendous amount of work safety-related problems, as
well as health and medical problems and concerns, and we at-
tempted to work them out or to wrestle with them, but EEOC does
not have the scientific and medical capability on its own to make
or did not have the capability to make all of those determinations.
  We attempted to coordinate, as I said to Senator Metzenbaum,
with the other agencies and that took some time. However, even
during that process, we gave significant detailed guidance, I believe
in 1983 or 1984, to the field on how to handle and how to investi-
gate these charges, and then ultimately to forward those to our
headquarters.
  Senator HATCH. After study of the issue in 1988, the EEOC, as I
understand it, issued regulations reflecting case law as it had de-
veloped up to that time in the Federal courts of appeals.
  Now, the regulations permitted fetal protection restrictions on
female employees only when the employer demonstrated that there
was a substantial risk of harm to the fetus and that there were no
other reasonably available less discriminatory alternatives that
would effectively protect female employees' offspring, is that cor-
rect?
  Judge THOMAS. That sounds accurate, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Further, the EEOC regulations required that if
there was a similar danger to male offspring, that fertile men be
excluded from the positions, as well, so you handled it that way.
When I say you, I mean the EEOC, because you just do not do
these things by yourself.
  After the seventh circuit ruled in 1989 that plaintiffs had to bear
the burden of disproving that an employer's sex-based fetal protec-
tion policy is justified by business necessity, the EEOC announced
that it rejected that decision and that its regulations, the burden of
proof remained on the employer to show that a fetal protection ex-
clusion was a bona fide occupational qualification under the crite-
ria of the 1988 regulations.
  This year, the Supreme Court, in International Union v. Johnson
Controls, Inc., agree with the EEOC, that the burden of proof is not
on plaintiffs in fetal protection exclusion cases, so they came down
to the same point of law that you had come up with. In addition,
however, the Court went further and held that a fetal protection
exclusion policy can never be justified as a bona fide occupational
qualification.
  But the bottom line is that no one was prejudiced by the EEOC's
consideration of this extremely complex set of cases or issues,
should I say, and that the position taken by the EEOC was reason-
able, in light of the fact that it was based on the developing case
law in the courts of appeals.
                                        442

  I just wanted to bring that out, because I think that if that is not
brought out, you are not being treated very fairly, because you did
everything you knew how to do under the circumstances, and final-
ly the Supreme Court resolved it, and it resolved it going a little
further than EEOC went, but, nevertheless, adopting basically your
ideas up to that point.

  Now, one last thing: When the Justice Department was consider-
ing amicus participation in the Meritor Savings Bank v. Vincent
case, concerning whether sexual harassment on the job constituted
a title VII violation, would you be kind enough to tell us what role
you played in formulating the Government's position?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, that case, of course, involved the in-
stance of whether or not there could be sexual harassment outside
of the context in which a woman does not receive her promotion as
a result of not agreeing to engage in the prohibited conduct; that
is, if a woman does not concede to the wishes of the supervisor. It
was whether or not there could be a hostile working environment.

  Our agency, as was the practice, communicated with the Justice
Department that we felt that the Government should be actively
involved in this case. There was some resistance. Some individuals
argued that hostile environment was not a violation of title VII as
sexual harassment.

  My direct role was not only at EEOC in developing the argu-
ments that were transmitted to the Justice Department, but to per-
sonally meet with the Solicitor, his staff, individuals who disagreed
throughout the Justice Department, and to argue for the Govern-
ment's involvement in that case in the Supreme Court. And ulti-
mately EEOC itself played a very extensive role in the develop-
ment of the legal arguments in that case in the Supreme Court.

  Senator HATCH. Well, that is great, because that issue of whether
sexual harassment on the job constituted a title VII violation, then
Solicitor General Charles Fried of the Harvard Law School said
that that was an open question the Court had not resolved. So he
then sought the views of the EEOC.

  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator HATCH. He came to you and said, We would like to have
your ideas on this tough question, we would like to know where
you stand. And he personally said that you, Judge Thomas, then
Chairman Thomas, Chairman of the EEOC, forcefully argued that
the Federal Government should side with the woman plaintiff that
sexual harassment is clearly discriminatory and cognizable under
title VII, this issue that was not decided, had never been decided by
the Court.
  As you know, the Government did side with the woman plaintiff
in the Meritor Bank v. Vincent case, and the Court finally held
that sexual harassment creating an offensive, hostile, or abusive
work environment constitutes sex discrimination under title VII.
  I think it needs to be pointed out, for a number of reasons, but
the principal reason is that when the chips were down, when that
case could have gone either way, as either not within the confines
of title VII--in other words, outside of title VII and therefore not
enforceable, or within, Chairman Thomas argued forcefully with
the Solicitor General's office and with the administration that
sexual harassment of women should be included within title VII,
                                        443

and the Supreme Court upheld your position. Now, I just wanted to
bring that out.

  I think it is also important just to conclude with this comment.
These are very difficult areas of law. Reasonable people can dis-
agree and without any prejudice on the part of anyone. And I con-
tend that, Chairman Thomas, once you get on that Court, you are
going to be watching out for the people, the little people out there
that many are worried about, who-need help and who need their
rights resolved and watched over. And you will do it in a fair and
reasonable, responsive way, as you did at the EEOC.

  I have to say the EEOC still has plenty of room for improvement,
as does every agency of Government. But compared to what it was
in 1982 when you took over, it is worlds apart. And you are the
person who helped bring about the effective and good changes.
That needs to be said by somebody like me who has watched it for
all these years and takes a special interest in it and who wants
that agency to work right and well.

  So I just wanted to say that and correct the record and commend
you for the service you have given, and I have absolutely no doubt
that you will give equal service, if not better service, on the Su-
preme Court in the interest of everybody in America.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I took about 15 minutes. I
didn't intend to take more than 10, but I apologize.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  The Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I wanted just to return very briefly to a couple of areas that we
talked about last Friday, Judge Thomas. Welcome back.
  Judge Thomas, I want to come back briefly to the subject that we
talked about on Friday, your view of Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes. On Friday, when I asked you for your view about Justice
Holmes, you said that--and I quote

   He was a great judge. Of course, when you have opportunities to study him, we
might disagree here and there. But I had occasion to read a recent biography of
him, and obviously now he is a giant in our judicial system.

  I then read your quotation from a speech you gave at the Pacific
Research Institute in 1988, including a portion in which you quote
a statement by Walter Burns on Holmes. And you correctly stated
that I was quoting your reference to Walter Burns' view of Holmes.
But I just want to read the entire passage into the record so that
your view of Justice Holmes in 1988 is not misunderstood.

  You stated, and I quote:

   We cannot expect our views of civil rights to triumph by acceding the moral high
ground to those who confuse rights with willfulness. The homage to natural rights
inscribed on the Justice Department building should be treated with more reverence
than many busts and paintings of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in the Department
of Justice. You will recall Holmes as one who scoffed at natural law, that brooding
omnipresence in the sky. If anything unites the jurisprudence of the left and the
right today, it is the nihilism of Holmes. As Walter Burns puts it in his essay on
Holmes, most recently reprinted in William Buckley and Charles Kessler's "Keep-
ing the Tablets"--

and here you quoted Mr. Burns--

   "No man who ever sat on the Supreme Court was less inclined and so poorly
equipped to be a statesman or to teach what a people needs in order to govern
itself."

        56-270 O--93 15
                                         444

End of quote of Burns.
  And then you continued, "Or as constitutional scholar Robert

Falkner put it"---and here you quoted Mr. Falkner--"What John
Marshall had raised, Holmes had sought to destroy" That's the end
of the quote of Falkner.

  And you continued:

  And what Holmes sought to destroy was the notion that justice, natural rights,
and natural law were objective, and that they exist at all apart from willfulness,
whether of individuals or officials.

  So I think it is quite clear from the full quotation, Judge
Thomas, that you were harshly critical of Justice Holmes for what
you described as his nihilism in his effort to destroy your view of
natural law. It doesn't sound to me like you thought he was a great
judge in 1988.

  Judge THOMAS. I guess, Senator, much of that perhaps resulted
from the concern about some statements in cases like Buck v. Bell
of Justice Holmes'.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, which is Judge Thomas' opinion of Jus-
tice Holmes: the one you gave on last Friday or the one you gave in
1988?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, as I indicated, Senator, I have concerns
about statements like "three generations of imbeciles is enough or
sufficient." I think that we certainly would find problems with
that. What I indicated to you was that I did take the time to go
back and re-read about him. Even though I may have had disagree-
ments, that was not the end of the inquiry. I spent a considerable
amount of time going back and trying to understand him more
during my tenure on the bench.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, that was then and last Friday is now?
  Judge THOMAS. NO. Last Friday, as I indicated, I had gone back
recently and read a biography of him subsequent to the speech.
That was the point.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, as I understand--and we will leave it at
this--your view last Friday is your current view, and your state-
ments that you said in 1988 was your view of Justice Holmes in
1988.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, my point that I was making, notwithstand-
ing criticisms, the point that I made last Friday is that he was a
great Justice, whether we agree or whether I agree with him or not
or whether others agree or disagree with him. The point that I am
making now is that even though I might have had a point of view
in 1988 that was critical, that did not stop me from going back and
reading and learning more about him. I think that the important
point that I am trying to make is merely having a point of view is
not the end of the process for me. It is, indeed, the beginning of the
process of learning and growing and attempting to change if there
is evidence there.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let me go on to the voting rights. We talked
briefly about it last Friday. You made some comments earlier in
the course of the hearing this morning. In 1988 you stated:

   Unfortunately, many of the Court's decisions in the area of voting rights have
presupposed that blacks, whites, Hispanics, and other ethnic groups will inevitably
vote in blocs. Instead of looking at the right to vote as an individual right, the Court
                                         445

has regarded the right as protected when the individual's race or ethnic group has
sufficient clout.

  In reviewing the Supreme Court decisions, the principal decisions
decided on the voting rights case, White v. Register and the Thorn-
burgh case--there is the Allen case as well, but that deals with pre-
clearance provisions. But on basically that very issue, these, as I
understand it, are the principal cases, and both on their very face
rejected the bloc voting:

  In White v. Register, we have entertained claims that multi-member districts are
being used invidiously to cancel out or minimize the voting strength of racial
groups. To sustain such claims, it is not enough that the racial group allegedly dis-
criminated against has not had legislative seats in proportion with voting. The
plaintiffs burden is to produce evidence to support findings that the political proc-
ess leading to nomination and elections were not equally open to participation by
the group in question, that its members had less opportunity than did other resi-
dents in the district to participate in the political process and elect legislators of
their choice.

  We are talking here about how State legislatures in Texas and
North Carolina had at-large elections, allegedly, and I think sup-
ported by the evidence considered in both of these cases decided by
the Supreme Court, that the at-large elections rather than the
single-member district elections were being used to diminish and
undermine the effectiveness of the rights to vote of individuals, the
blacks in Dallas, Hispanics in San Antonio, blacks in the Thorn-
burgh case, similar statements in the Thornburgh case, I think
even stronger.

  Those and the Allen case were the three, as I understand it, the
major guiding beacons in terms of the Supreme Court's upholding
the importance of the right to vote, certainly in judging the actions
of legislatures, which in many instances, particularly in the Texas
Legislature, had a history of supporting segregation activities at
that time.

  And we have seen subsequent to those decisions the changes in
the membership in those particular districts rather dramatically, I
might mention.

  Well, what were you so critical of in terms of those cases, the
principal cases?

  Judge THOMAS. The comment wasn't about the Thornburghcase,
Senator. The concern that I raised, I think the word I used was
"presupposed" bloc voting, and that had to do with--and as I
noted, I think, on Friday, I was not engaging in an exegesis of the
voting rights cases. The comments were made in a speech that was
about individual rights and the concern for individual rights and
what would happen to individuals versus--when you considered
groups versus individuals. And I simply used as an example and re-
ferred to, I think in one paragraph, maybe two, the Voting Rights
Act as one of the examples, and then I moved on.

  The point that I was trying to make was that--and it was my--
there was a school of thought. There was thinking, I remember, in-
volving--being involved or reading about the debates in the early
1980's about the Voting Rights Act that felt that the early cases
that presupposed or would lead to proportional representation. It
was that kind of mentality that I felt presupposed that blacks
would vote a particular way, that there was the stereotypes. And
throughout all my speeches, I argued against the use of stereo-
                                               446

types. I think there was even some debate up to and immediately
prior to the amendments to the Voting Rights Act in 1982 concern-
ing proportional representation. But I was not, as I indicated, going
through any cases and specifically saying here is the precise lan-
guage in that case, but rather to that general school of thought
that interpreted those cases to require proportional representation.

  I think that was also a concern, as I remember--and, again, I
was not directly involved in the debates over the Voting Rights
Act. But I think that there was some concern even then with the
legislation that came from the House of Representatives that it
might lead to--the results test might lead to proportional represen-
tation. The language, of course, in the Voting Rights Act, in the
amendments, preclude that. And, of course, the Thornburgh case
makes it clear that you don't presuppose now that there is bloc
voting, but rather it has to be proven.

  So what I was talking about was this general assumption about
had to do with the school of thought with respect to proportional
representation and the presupposition that minorities all voted the
same way or thought the same way or acted the same way.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I am interested in your view of the leg-
islative history because Senator Mathias and I were the principal
sponsors of the extension of the Voting Rights Act, very much in-
volved in the debate, and the legislation specifically includes in
title II, explicitly says that no group is entitled to legislative seats
in numbers equal to their proportion of the population. At least
among those that were very much involved in the legislative histo-
ry as well as the Supreme Court

  Judge THOMAS. That is where
  Senator KENNEDY. The only point I raise is when you mention
here many of the Court's decisions, I was just trying in my own
mind--and recognizing the importance of voting rights, to find in
my own mind what were the areas of the Supreme Court decisions
in voting rights that you are most critical of. But I understand
now--and I would like to move on--that with regards to White and
Thornburghthat you support certainly their
  Judge THOMAS. I absolutely support the aggressive enforcement
of voting rights laws and certainly support the results in those
cases. I think I said that or attempted to say that last Friday.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let me move on to another area that was
touched on during the course of the hearings but which I would
like to just clarify. Judge Thomas, in your exchange with Senator
DeConcini yesterday, you talked about your role in Adams v. Bell.
The Secretary of Education, Terrel Bell, was the defendant in that
lawsuit. Back in 1977 the Court had ordered the Office of Civil
Rights in the Department to process discrimination complaints
more properly and conduct compliance reviews within specific
timeframes. And you arrived as the head of the Office of Civil
Rights in May of 1981. So we have the Court going back to 1977,
you arrive in 1981. You were the official responsible for compli-
ances with the court order. Your agency was accused of ignoring
the court-ordered timeframes to act on race discrimination com-
plaints, sex discrimination complaints, and other discrimination
complaints in a timely manner.
                                        447

  The plaintiffs in the case petitioned the Court to hold you in con-
tempt for violating the court order, and the Court held a hearing
on the petition in March 1982, which is 9 months after you had
taken office. You told Senator DeConcini the judge did not hold you
in contempt or take any other steps. You said, and I quote, "I think
ultimately what the judge realized was that we were doing all that
we could, that it was impossible for us to comply with it"--mean-
ing the order, and that is the end of the quote.

  That, as I understand it, is not quite right. I would like to quote
from the contempt hearing on March 15, 1982. The judge concluded
that instead of enforcing the civil rights laws, you were dragging
your heels, carrying them out in your own way and according to
your own schedule, instead of complying with the timetable or-
dered by the Court. Here is what the judge said, and I quote:

  I would like to see some kind of manifestation by the people that administer these
statutes that they realize they are under the constraints of a court order and ac-
cordingly are going to make a good-faith effort to comply.

  It is true that the judge did not take the extreme step of actually
holding you in contempt of court, but this is what the judge went
on to say, and I quote the judge:

  We do find, though, that the court order has been violated in many important
respects and that we are not at all convinced that these violations will be taken care
of and eventually eliminated without the coercive power of the court.

  So the judge said very clearly that you violated the court order
in many important respects, used the word "violated." He was con-
cerned that you were still not making the good-faith efforts to
comply. He was clearly threatening you with contempt. He was ob-
viously pretty upset with you.

  What do you think he meant when he said he might have to use
the coercive power of the court to get you to comply with the court
order?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, when I responded to Senator DeConcini,
I think I also noted--and I did not go back and review the tran-
script--that I had not had an opportunity to review the entirety of
the record or any orders by the court. It has been, again, now
about 10 years.

  With respect to what the court was doing, the petition that was
filed with the court was filed prior to my going to the Office of
Civil Rights. I went to the Office of Civil Rights, I believe, in May
of 1981. That was filed sometime, I believe, in February or March. I
can't remember exactly when.

  The office had never been able to comply with those timeframes
under the consent decree, and, indeed, we improved--in the brief
time that I was there, I actually became Assistant Secretary in
July. Even though I was there before, I was actually sworn in in
July of 1981. During that brief period, we were able to improve the
performance and to comply with the timeframes, certainly did
better than the individuals prior to us, but still were not able to
comply. And we devoted 95 percent of our resources in an attempt
to comply.

  What I suggested to Senator DeConcini is perhaps that I did
not--I should have gone back and perhaps looked at some addition-
al steps in communications with the court in order to prevent the
                                             448

matter from reaching the point where it could be suggested that I
was in any way not acting in good faith or in defiance of the court
order.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, didn't the judge draw some conclusion
in terms of your performance and the previous official's perform-
ance?

  Judge THOMAS. Again, I have not reviewed the record, Senator. It
has been quite some time ago.

  Senator KENNEDY. I believe it did, but you can correct the record
and take a look at it and comment on it.

  The judge may not have taken the harsh step of holding you in
contempt, but he did take other steps. Contrary to what you told
Senator DeConcini, he set a deadline for the completion of a study
that you had told the court you needed prior to taking any action.
He set a deadline for both parties to consider the results of the
study to agree on the revisions of the court-ordered timeframes, if
any were necessary.

  Also, you had told the court--you told the committee this week
that you had expedited the study when you arrived at the Office of
Civil Rights. In both instances, you cited this as an example that
you were making your best effort to comply with the court order. I
would not say the judge thought you were making the best effort.
In a March 1982 hearing your lawyer commented that you had told
the court you expected the study to be completed within the next
month or two, the judge responded, "I think he kind of hedged on
that prediction. I think if we were going to leave it up to Mr.
Thomas, you might not get it this year." That is what the judge
said. He sounds pretty skeptical that you were going to comply
with the order.

  Judge THOMAS. AS I indicated, Senator, the study that we were
referring to was begun prior to my arriving at the Office for Civil
Rights. And as I remember--again, it has been quite some time--it
had been scheduled for completion at one point, and I expedited
the schedule so that we could have that study in place so that we
could make the appropriate changes consistent with that study.

  Senator KENNEDY. This is what the judge stated in reference to
your predecessor, Mr. Tattle:

  I contrasted Mr. Tattle on the one hand, who was sitting in the same position Mr.
Thomas was AYzyears ago. Mr. Thomas and I contrasted Ms. Chong and Mr. Rigau.
It seems the difference between these two people is the difference between day and
night. Now, Rigau admitted that they were behind in their work as far as the Office
of Federal Contract Compliance was concerned, but he manifested an active interest
in improving the machinery. Things weren't getting any worse. I think they were
probably better. And while things weren't completely in accordance with the time
frames, Mr. Tattle went out of office in the fall of 1978 or 1979.

  This was the fall of 1979.

  Things were on their way to being improved; whereas, at the time he took over,
things were in bad shape. That is my basic problem. I don't like to hold people in
contempt. On the other hand, I like to see some kind of manifestation by the people
that administer these statutes that they realize they are under the constraints of a
court order and accordingly are going to make a good-faith effort to comply.

  Judge THOMAS. He was not
  Senator KENNEDY. YOU can put in the record, whenever you get
a chance to examine the transcript
                                             449

  Judge THOMAS. But he was not my immediate predecessor. My
immediate predecessor was Cindy Brown.

  The difficulty that we faced, Senator, that I did not allude to--
and it is one that the office continued to labor under, and I think it
was an important difficulty--is that when the Department of Edu-
cation was created out of HEW, to my knowledge the Department
of Education Office for Civil Rights had about 80 percent of the
work and 60 percent of the staff and was inundated. I think it was
in a much different position from the HEW staff. But that is some-
thing that is a part of what you inherit when you move into a de-
partment, and it was a very difficult problem.

  The assurance that I made and that I make here--and it is a
very firm one--is that we attempted to do all we could to dig our-
selves out from under the workload. That is quite a bit different in
terms of accomplishing than it was, say, at EEOC where I was not
a part of a larger department that controlled decisions over the de-
ployment of personnel and budgets.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, did you complain about the staff and
the resources?

  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely. In fact, internally I complained, as
my successors complained, but there were competing interests. As
you remember, at that time the Department of Education itself,
the full Department, was undergoing a RIF. And though the OCR
did not have the same budgetary constraints, it was held to the
same standards and not permitted, for example, to hire staff.

  Senator KENNEDY. Let me move on to another area. During your
opening statement, you praised civil rights leaders for having
changed society, and you stated, "I have benefited greatly from
your efforts. But for them there would have been no road to
travel." But in the past you have condemned those same civil
rights leaders in five different speeches. In 1985, for example, you
denounced, and I quote, "a civil rights community wallowing in
self-delusion and pulling the public with it." You omitted that
phrase from only two speeches during this period, the two speeches
you gave to predominantly black audiences.

  What did you mean when you said that the civil rights communi-
ty was wallowing in self-delusion and pulling the public with it?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, let me make two points there, Senator. I
have many other speeches in which I extensively praised the civil
rights community and its efforts, and speeches on Martin Luther
King's speeches with respect to the NAACP and many organiza-
tions, and I have always given credit concerning the efforts and the
major, major contributions of the civil rights movement and the
civil rights groups in our society.

  The difficulties that we had during the 1980's was an important
difficulty, and that was this, that there was, to my way of thinking,
a need to begin to debate anew some old problems and to begin to
look at them with fresh ideas.

  What you see in those speeches are my frustration or is my frus-
tration that that debate never took place. Instead, you see a similar
frustration expressed to the conservatives in the Heritage Founda-
tion speech. Rather than ultimately sitting down and beginning to
try to work out the problems, we were spending our time yelling
across the table at each other.
                                         450

  I had hoped that would not have been the case during the 1980's.
As we all know, much to our chagrin, and I think to the chagrin of
anyone who is involved, that that did not occur.

  Senator KENNEDY. Then, in a 1987 interview with Reason maga-
zine, you were asked whether there were any areas where the
NAACP and the civil rights establishment were doing good, and
you interrupted the question to respond no. When the interviewer
asked, "None?" you said, "None that I can think of."

  In at least three speeches, you said, "Members of the civil rights
movement had given in to the cult mentality and childish obedi-
ence"--this is your quote--"which hypnotizes blacks into a mind-
less political trance."

  Again in 1988, here is a quote, "We must now not merely be crit-
ical of the many blunders and follies that have occurred in the
practice of civil rights, we must show how our reliance on Ameri-
can principle produces better results than those of our enemies."
That is pretty powerful stuff, calling leaders in the civil rights
movement "the results of those of our enemies," and then in 1987,
you publicly castigated civil rights leaders who, "bitch, bitch, bitch,
moan and moan and whine."

  Judge THOMAS. I think that was made before, Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY. The point that appears of the kind of debate
you were trying to begin, I remember the time also as most of
those leaders very much involved with working with Congress on
the extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1982, when we had initial
opposition. William French Smith, right before this committee, ex-
pressed his opposition, and he was going to recommend that Presi-
dent Reagan veto it.
  I can remember the work that was done by the civil rights
groups in 1984, 1985, and 1986, when we were trying to overrule
the Grove City case, which affected all Federal funding, whether
they could be used in terms of discriminatory purposes.
  I remember the work that many have done in terms of the sanc-
tions against South Africa. I know you have a different opinion
from many of the civil rights leaders, although that opinion was
different evidently from what you had at Holy Cross, where you
supported disengagement and the economic sanctions. They were
very much involved in overriding a Presidential veto.
  And I remember the civil rights leadership in 1987 and 1988,
when for the first time we worked out fair housing legislation,
which had been basically stalemated in the Congress. These are
major kinds of proposals that they are very, very much involved in,
and what we find is a series of extremely critical comments about
all.
  Then the time is moving on and you had in the 1987 interview,
you stated, "That I find exasperating and incomprehensible the as-
sault on the Bicentennial, the founding of the Constitution itself by
Justice Thurgood Marshall, his indictment of the Framers alien-
ates all Americans, not just black Americans." That is a strong
attack on Justice Marshall. He was criticizing the original Consti-
tution for accepting slavery.
   I will give you
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator.
                                        451

  Let me go back and I will try to cast this generally. I will not
attempt to go through each one of those seriatim, unless you would
want me to.

  I think in the interview, my point was that I was the wrong
person to ask with respect to comments about the existing civil
rights community, because of the manner in which the civil rights
community had treated me and that I am no more or less human
than anyone else, that there was serious disagreement, and I do
not think that the disagreements were at the level that they should
have been, and I suggested that.

  I attempted to conduct myself in a way that we could have a con-
structive debate, and I reiterate the point that I have major speech-
es throughout my tenure that are very, very supportive and very
strongly indicate my allegiance to the civil rights community and
to the civil rights movement, but I do not think that allegiance and
that support should undermine the ability to disagree.

  And the comment that I made with respect to the unanimity, the
homogeneity of our points of views I think are important. I think
that there is a need for debate. I have said from my early speeches
in 1981 that it is important, these issues are so difficult, and the
problems are so bad, that we need all of the talent, that we needed
all of the ideas possible, not just one point of view.

  I did not feel that that opportunity ever occurred or that we had
the chance or I had the chance personally to engage in that debate,
and I thought it was a lost opportunity, and I said it on both sides
of the aisle with respect to the civil rights community, as well as
with respect to the Reagan administration.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, it would appear, and the record will
show, whether these are expressions of disagreement or strong neg-
ative statements.

  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator KENNEDY. Judge Thomas, I continue to have serious con-
cerns about your nomination. In your speeches and articles, you
have taken many strong positions, but again and again you have
asked this committee to ignore the record you have compiled over a
decade.
  On natural law, despite your previous clear advocacy of using
natural law in construing the Constitution, you now tell us that
you do not see a role for the use of natural law in constitutional
adjudication.
  On the right to privacy, you have walked away from your record
and statements. You now say that you support a right to privacy,
but you refuse to comment on its controversial applications.
  On abortion, you have explained away your strong praise for
Lewis Lehrman's extreme article supporting the right-to-life posi-
tion, and said you just mentioned the article in the hope that the
rightwing audience would be more inclined to support enforcement
of civil rights.
  You ask us to believe that an intelligent and outspoken person
like yourself has never discussed Roe v. Wade with another human
being.
  You ask us to be confident that you will enforce a woman's right
to be free from gender discrimination, despite your prior stereotype
statements about women and work.
                                         452

  You have abandoned your previous statements that business
rights are as important as individual rights or any other right. You
now claim you are satisfied with the Supreme Court decisions that
give less importance to business rights and greater importance to
individual rights.

  You have criticized Supreme Court decisions protecting voting
rights and sustaining the power of Congress to appoint independent
prosecutors, to investigate wrong-doing in the executive branch,
now you seem to be supporting those positions.

  You have trashed the leaders of the civil rights movement in
many speeches, but now you emphasize your debt to them. You
have trashed Oliver Wendell Holmes in one of your speeches, but
last Friday you called him a giant in the law.

  You have harshly criticized Congress, and, as an executive
branch official in the Department of Education, you were on the
verge of being held in contempt of a Federal court for failing to en-
force civil rights laws.

  You urge lower courts to follow a Supreme Court dissenting opin-
ion restricting job opportunities for women, instead of the Court's
majority opinion expanding those opportunities.

  The vanishing views of Judge Thomas have become a major issue
in these hearings. If nominees can blithely disavow controversial
positions taken in the past, nominees can say those positions are
merely philosophical musings or policy views or advocacy. If we
permit them to dismiss views full of sound and fury as signifying
nothing, we are abdicating our constitutional role in the advise-
and-consent process.

  Some say that the Senate should consider only the nominee's
qualifications and not his ideological views, but the Constitution
gives the Senate a shared role with the President in the appoint-
ment of Justices to the Federal courts, and for very good reason.

  The Supreme Court thrives on the diversity of views of nine Jus-
tices who comprise it. It is our system of checks and balances. The
role of the Senate is one of the most important checks on the
power of the President to pack the Court with appointees who
share a single one-dimensional view of the Constitution.

  When ideology is the paramount consideration of the President
selecting a nominee, the Senate is entitled to take ideology into ac-
count in the confirmation process and reject any nominee whose
views are too extreme or outside the mainstream.

  As we move to the next stage of these hearings, I continue to
have major concerns about your nomination and about your com-
mitment to the fundamental rights and liberties at the heart of the
Constitution and our democracy. This is no time to turn back.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Now, where we are at this moment is that all Republican Sena-
tors have had a third round and we should be just going down the
row here, but Senator Grassley, who did not complete a third
round last week, apparently has a couple of minutes he would like
to use now, is that correct?
  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes, at least not more than 5.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Well, if it is all right with the Senator from
Vermont, if we yield to the Senator from Iowa. Everybody will
                                               453

have more time if they want it on the Republican side. Senator
Brown is entitled to any time he wants and we will do that. I just
wanted to make sure that people who have had a chance to ask
three times already yield to those who have only asked twice. Sena-
tor Brown has only asked twice, so he will get another chance.

  At any rate, after all of that, why don't I just yield to the Sena-
tor from Iowa for whatever questions he has, and then we will go
to the Senator from Vermont.

  Senator SIMON. Are we going to be breaking for lunch?
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, my point
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Senator. I have been asked a ques-
tion, are we going to be breaking for lunch. I think that is going to
be inescapable. The question is whether we break immediately
after the Senator from Vermont, and I think that depends on how
long the Senator from Iowa goes, and he has as right to go long if
he wants, or whether we break after the Senator from Alabama.
That being the case, we would be down to very few minutes after
that, but we are probably going to have to break for lunch, and we
will do a very short break, meaning an hour, not an hour and a
half, when that time comes. But let us see how far we get right
now.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I take some time now just for
further clarification, more than anything else. I had previously dis-
cussed for the committee's benefit, more so than to question the
Judge, about the Adams v. Bell matter, and I thought maybe it
would be closed, but it is apparent that it is not closed.
  Last week, I had asked that the transcript of the proceedings be
printed in the record; and you said it would be made available, and
at the time I thought that would be sufficient, but now I think it is
only fair that the transcript on the Judge's order in which Judge
Thomas was not held in contempt be printed in the public record,
and I think that it should be clear that Judge Thomas, as I said
previously and as I laid out in a factual record, only inherited a
very difficult situation and in no way intentionally violated the
law, so I would like to have that printed in the record, if I could,
Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be printed in the
record.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I would also like to correct what seems to be a
wrong impression here regarding Judge Thomas' relationship with
civil rights groups and leaders.

  In an October 23, 1982, speech before the Maryland Conference
of the NAACP, as the then newly installed Chairman of the EEOC,
here is something that I thought Judge Thomas said well that ex-
presses his working relationship:

  I would like to talk with you about why I believe that you are the group that can
truly make a difference for blacks in this country, what I think of the challenges
will be in the future, and what we are doing at the Federal level to address the
problems of discrimination. The pervasive problem of racial discrimination and prej-
udice has defied short-term solution. The struggle against discrimination is more a
marathon that short sprint.

  Political parties have come and gone, leaving behind them the failures of their
quick fixes. Promises have been made and broken, but one group, the NAACP, has
remained steadfast in the fight against this awful social cancer called racial discrim-
ination. The NAACP has a history of which we can all be proud. From its inception
in 1809 until today, the work this organization has done in the area of civil rightr is
unmatched by any other such group. At each turn in the development of blacks in
this country, the NAACP has been there to meet the challenges.

  Judge Thomas has often acknowledged the significant role of
civil rights movements and how he personally has benefited from
it. In volume 21 of the "Integrated Education" publication in 1983,
Judge Thomas wrote, "Many of us have walked through doors
opened by civil rights leaders, and now you must see that others do
the same.

  In a January 18, 1983, speech at the Wharton School of Business,
in Philadelphia, Judge Thomas said, "As a child growing up in the
rural South during the 1950's, I felt the pain of racial discrimina-
tion. I will never forget that pain. Coming of age in the 1960's, I
also experienced the progress brought about as a result of the civil
rights movement. Without that movement and the laws it inspired,
I am certain that I would not be here tonight."

  An October 21, 1982, speech to the Third Annual Metropolitan
Washington Board of Trade, EEO Conference, Judge Thomas de-
scribed himself as "a beneficiary of the civil rights movement."

  An April 7, 1984, speech at the Yale Law School, Black Law Stu-
dents Association Conference, Judge Thomas noted the freedom
movement of black Americans was not a sudden development, but
"had been like a flame smoldering in ihe brush, igniting here,
catching there, burning for a long, long time before someone had
finally shouted fire."

  He asked, in effect, who was responsible for this. Then Judge
Thomas went through a litany of people and events that helped fan
the flames of black freedom. He asked in part whether it was--

* * * the founders of the NAACP or the surge of pride which black folks felt, as
they huddled around their ghetto radios to hear Joe Louis preaching equality with
his fists, or hear Jesse Owens humbling Hitler with his feet, was it A. Philip Ran-
dolph mobilizing 100,000 blacks ready to march on Washington in 1941, and FDR
hurriedly signing Executive Order 8802, banning discrimination in war industries
and apprenticeship programs, or the 99th Pursuit Squad, trained in segregated units
at Tuskegee, flying like demons in the death struggle high over Italy, was it Rosa
Parks, who said no, she wouldn't move, and Daisy Banks, who said yes, black chil-
dren would go to Central High School, of the three men who had been the black
man's embodiment of Blitzkreig, the most phenomenal legal brains ever combined
in one century for the onslaught against injustice, Charles Houston, William Hasty,
Thurgood Marshall, or a group of students who said we have had enough, I mean
                                         458

what is so sacred about a sandwich, Jack, or men named Warren, Frankfurter,
Black, Douglas, who read the Bill of Rights and believed.

  I realize, Judge Thomas and for members of this committee, it
may seem more newsworthy to report the judge's remarks only
when they have been critical of traditional civil rights leadership,
and I realize some of his critics who object to his expressed views
against reverse discrimination and preference wish to make him
look ungrateful, but it is a false portrait of character being drawn.

  So, Judge Thomas, I think you have a lot to be proud of in not
only your statements, but your actions in support of efforts of
others in the civil rights community who carry the ball and run
with it, and I think you have adequately recognized their contribu-
tion, and I thank you for it.

  That is the end of the time that I will use now, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I want to thank you, Senator.
  After conferring with Judge Thomas' spokespersons in the break
here, it seems appropriate we will take a break for lunch now.
  Now, let me just give everyone a heads up on where we are going
to go from here. We will go to Senator Leahy next, unless Senator
Metzenbaum comes back and claims his 15 minutes. Then what we
will do I hope, as I count the time, we should be able to finish ev-
erything by 4 o'clock today with Judge Thomas.
  We will then move to the ABA today, and they will probably
move to the first panel of witnesses. We will move at least to one
other panel, maybe two, and tonight we will go with the public wit-
nesses until sometime close to 6:30, to try to move this along, be-
cause we are going to end early tomorrow night and we will not be
in session on Wednesday, so we will see how much we can move
along and catch up with the other end here.
  Now, we will break for lunch until 1:30, at which time, in all
probability, we will resume with, if it is convenient for Senator
Leahy, with Senator Leahy
  Senator LEAHY. I will be prepared to start my questioning right
at 1:30, if that is what the Chair wants.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, we will start at 1:30. We will recess until
1:30.
  [Whereupon, at 12:17 p.m., the committee was recessed, to recon-
vene at 1:30 p.m., the same day.]

                                      AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order, please.
  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Ohio, Senator Metz-
enbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, before the break this morning, I was inquiring
about the EEOC's failure for 6 years to process sex discrimination
charges involving fetal protection policies. I am frank to say that I
regret that I missed your ensuing discussion of this issue with Sen-
ator Hatch and, as has been publicly stated, I missed it only be-
cause I am also sitting on the Gates nomination hearings which
are going on at the same time.
  But as I am informed by my staff, you agreed with Senator
Hatch's statement that "women were not prejudiced by the EEOC's
                                         459

failure to act on this issue for over 6 years while you were Chair-
man."

  Judge Thomas, I simply cannot accept the idea that women were
not harmed by the agency's default on this issue. The women who
lost their jobs due to sex discrimination were certainly harmed.
Some of them didn't get their jobs back for 10 years, and some of
them never got their jobs back at all.

  Had you acted in a timely manner to resolve their charges, they
surely would have been spared much of this harm. And had the
EEOC declared fetal protection policies to be illegal in 1982, as it
did in 1991 after your departure, the women who were forced to
undergo sterilization in order to keep their jobs might have been
spared that terrible outcome.

  Judge Thomas, you pointed out that women were free to file
their own lawsuits challenging fetal protection policies. The women
who lost their jobs, that were sterilized as a result of fetal protec-
tion policies, were blue collar women working at an hourly wage.
These women came to the EEOC, because they could not afford to
file their own cases or they needed assistance with the complex
issues involved.

  These women sought the help of the EEOC in fighting for their
rights. That is why the agency is there. But under your direction, it
didn't hear the cases, it turned its back on these women.

  My question is do you really believe that these women did not
have their rights prejudiced at all, simply because they retain their
right to bring a private lawsuit?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the point that I thought Senator Hatch
was making was that the right to bring a lawsuit or to engage in
litigation continued to exist and did not expire. I do not think
either one of us intended to suggest that individuals who have to
wait for long periods of time to resolve these issues aren't in some
way and to some extent prejudiced to that degree.

  The point with respect to what we did during my tenure I think
has to be refocused in this way: In thinking about this issue, where
we eventually arrived in developing a policy, I believe the BFOQ
approach was originally rejected prior to my going to EEOC, and
there was significant debate about that.

  We attempted to resolve the issue in what I think was an appro-
priate way. It didn't happen as fast as most of us would like it, but
it was a very, very difficult issue and it was one the rulemaking
and the final resolution that you are talking about or that you
commented on was one that was developed during my tenure, al-
though finalized after my tenure.

  It again was something that in these difficult areas you would
hope to have been able to done a lot quicker or done in a more ex-
peditious way, but this was one of the most difficult issues we wres-
tled with.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, before the break this morning, you
stated in response to my question that it took 6 years for the EEOC
to take action on charges involving fetal protection policies, be-
cause you were faced with difficult issues outside its area of exper-
tise. However, Judge Thomas, even if these charges did present dif-
ficult issues, that would hardly justify taking no action on them for
so many years.
                                              460

  In addition, although some of the charges may have turned on
complex scientific issues, many others represented clear violations
of title VII. For example, in one case, a female job applicant was
denied a job requiring exposure to lead due to fetal health risks
which might arise if she became pregnant. The employer's person-
nel manager told her that she wouldn't like plant work, anyway,
that plant work would be too dirty for her and that he could use a
pretty face in his office.

  The applicant, understandably, filed a discrimination charge in
1981. The Commission investigated the charge, but took no action
to resolve it for 8 years. In 1989, the commission closed the case,
because it was unable to locate the charging party.

  Now, some charges filed with the Commission languished, even
though the employer had offered no evidence at all to back up its
discriminatory assumptions regarding the health risks posed by the
hazard in question. In other cases involving x-ray technicians, the
commission had already issued their decision prior to your tenure,
finding violation based on parallel facts. I do not dispute that some
of these issues may have raised difficult issues, but do you really
believe that that justifies the EEOC's total inaction for 6 years?
One has to say why did it take so long for any action at all to
occur.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I have indicated, I think that the
agency during my tenure could not be said not to have been taking
any action. The results may not have occurred in a way that we
would have liked it to have occurred, as expeditious as possible, but
to say that we took no action is incorrect, I believe.

  The agency, the Commissioners, including myself, attempted to
review this particular policy in a professional way and a way that
would protect the rights of women. We recognized--and there was
disagreement among staff, as well as Commissioners, and I think
even within the Government--we recognized that this was a diffi-
cult issue that involved scientific, as well as health problems or
health concerns, and we attempted to resolve it in a way that took
those factors into consideration.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Thomas, I must also take issue
with Senator Hatch's suggestion that, in the Johnson Controls deci-
sion, the Supreme Court "adopted basically your ideas on fetal pro-
tection and carried them a little further." As Senator Hatch point-
ed out, your position in the EEOC's 1988 policy guidance was that,
where a substantial risk to a fetus or potential fetus existed, em-
ployers could use fetal protection policies which applied only to
women.

  What Senator Hatch did not mention is that your 1988 policy al-
lowed women to be excluded from jobs, even if those women were
fully able to perform their jobs, but the Supreme Court expressly
rejected that position in Johnson Controls, holding that these poli-
cies could never be justified by reference to the well-being of a
fetus or potential fetus. In short, it took the EEOC 6 years under
your tenure to develop a position that the Supreme Court rejected
out of hand.

  Judge THOMAS. I could be--if my recollection serves me right,
Senator, I think Senator Hatch must have been referring to I think
the 1990 policy. Again, I do not have that in front of me, but I
                                             461

think the 1990 policy was consistent with the Supreme Court deci-
sion. I would have to go back and look at that. Again, I am operat-
ing just off memory.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Thomas, the facts actually speak
for themselves. This was an issue of great significance to women in
the workplace. According to the Bureau of National Affairs, as
many as 15 to 20 million jobs may involved reproductive hazards,
and thus could have been affected by exclusionary fetal protection
policies.

  Given the fact, it is not surprising that one Federal judge said
that the Johnson Controls case was "likely to be the most impor-
tant sex discrimination case since the enactment of title VII."

  You were sworn to protect the rights of the millions of working
women in this country against employment practices that com-
pletely barred them from high-paying industrial jobs. Frankly,
Judge Thomas, based upon the facts, not on opinion, but based
upon the facts, it would appear that, instead of protecting these
women, you abandoned them. For most of the 1980's, you refused to
resolve over 100 discrimination charges that had accumulated at
Commission headquarters.

  In addition, when you finally began to act, you sold women short
by allowing employers to adopt facially discriminatory policies that
excluded women who were fully capable of performing their jobs.

  In this year's Johnson Controls decision, the Rehnquist Supreme
Court concluded that employers have no business depriving women
of their jobs in the name of protecting non-existent future fetuses.
The Court expressly held that "decisions about the welfare of
future children must be left to the parents who conceive, bear, sup-
port and raise them, rather than to the employers who hire those
parents." That is the Court's language.

  Three months ago, the EEOC finally took the position that "poli-
cies that exclude members of one sex from a workplace for the pur-
pose of protecting fetuses cannot be justified under title VII." The
EEOC conceivably, probably should have reached that conclusion
10 years ago. You had an opportunity to make it occur. You didn't.

  The EEOC's failure to protect women apparently at your direc-
tion gives me and millions of American women and men cause for
concern, because it appears on the basis of the facts that you didn't
protect their rights, when it was your sworn responsibility to do so,
and I am very worried that you won't protect their rights as a
member of the Supreme Court.

  Judge Thomas, as I reflected on our last 4 days of hearings and
as I reflect back on your answers to my questions this morning, I
feel compelled to repeat a point I have made to you. I am struck
and can't figure out a reason, I can't comprehend the number of
times in which you suggest that this committee should discount
past statements which you have made.

   For example, you gave speeches to lawyers and wrote articles in
law journals advocating the use of natural law, a subject to which
the chairman has addressed himself quite extensively, but now you
say that you never meant to suggest that natural law should be
used in deciding cases.

   You have condemned aggressive legislative oversight, character-
ized Congress as unprincipled and out of control, and commended
                                          462

Justice Scalia's narrow vision of congressional power under the
separation of powers clause, but now you say that those remarks
were just part of the normal tension and give-and-take between
Congress and the executive branch.

  And other issues such as economic rights, the minimum wage,
and affirmative action, there is a conflict between your testimony
to the committee and statements which you have made in the past.

  But in the area of abortion, one of the most important issues
facing this Nation, one that has been discussed and about which
you have been asked at great length, it is in that area that you
have most seriously sought to distance yourself from your past
record.

  To the millions of American women who are wondering where
you stand on that critical issue, your answer is "trust me, my mind
is open, I don't have a position or even an opinion on the issue of
abortion." Judge Thomas, that is just incredulous. It is difficult for
millions of Americans, whether they are pro-choice or pro-right-to-
life, to accept.

  You have a record in this area. You simply don't want us to take
account of it. You are asking us to believe that you didn't really
mean it, when you said Lehrman's antichoice polemic was splendid.
You are asking us to believe that you didn't really mean it, when
you signed onto a report that criticized Roe and other pro-choice
decisions.

  You are asking us not to worry that you criticized the key consti-
tutional argument supporting a woman's right to choose. You are
asking us not to worry that you were on the editorial board of a
journal that has only published articles on the abortion issue which
vehemently attacked a woman's right to choose. You are asking us
to ignore the fact that your nomination is championed by antiabor-
tion groups and that you were selected by a President who has
pledged to appoint Justices who will overturn Roe. And you are
asking us not to be concerned that you, like other nominees have
gone onto the Court and undermined the right to choose, have sin-
gled out this particular subject for silence.

  Judge, I cannot ignore your past statements on the abortion
issue and on other critical legal issues and policy issues. I cannot
accept the idea that we should give little weight to what you said
or did before going on the bench. I reject the notion that what you
said or did about certain issues becoming a judge bears no relation
whatsoever to what you will do with respect to those issues once
you are on the bench.

  And I cannot accept your suggestion that we should discount
some of your most controversial statements, such as your praise of
the Lehrman article or your condemnation of the Morrison case, on
the grounds that you didn't endorse or agree with what you were
saying. That explanation only raises more questions than it an-
swers.

  The bottom line is this, Judge: You have a record and I believe
this committee and the Senate must evaluate your nomination
based upon that record and based upon the way in which you have
discussed that record with this committee.

  Thank you, Judge Thomas.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                               463

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Brown would be next, if he were here, but I yield to Sen-
ator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, I am told that, at least for your testimony, the
end is near--a matter that I was going to say you probably see
with mixed emotions, but I doubt that would be a fair statement.
You are probably happy to have it end. I hope you and your family
had a pleasant weekend.
  I must admit, while I was up in Vermont this weekend with my
family, I heard more discussion about you than I have heard--well,
ever since your nomination. Many people came up to me in grocery
stores and at gas stations and on the street, virtually every place I
was---in fact. And I believe that all but one person I talked with
during the weekend mentioned you, and their views either for or
against your confirmation.
  I told them what I have told others here; that I have been here
for virtually all of your testimony. I have done this so that I might
know you better. I am one who spends the time here with you. For
many of those who will speak either for or against you, I will read
their statements, but they are not the ones about to be voted on
one way or the other. You are. And so I have been here to get to
know you better.
  I want to know how you think, what you consider most impor-
tant in the law or cases, what kind of Justice you would be if con-
firmed, how qualified you are. In many ways I don't really have
those answers. I probably never will, even at the time you finish
testifying today. Apparently the judgment has been made, either
by you or your advisers or in conjunction with each other--I don't
know--not to answer many questions, for whatever reason. And
you have stated in a number of instances--when people suggested
you weren't answering the questions--you have stated your rea-
sons why. So I will re-read the transcript to see if a better view of
you develops.
  One of your advisers, Senator Danforth, feels he knows you very
well. I am sure he does. He has had years and years of getting to
know you, and all of us on both sides of the aisle have the greatest
respect for Senator Danforth. But we haven't had that experience
with you, so every Senator has had to make up his or her mind
based on what you said or have not said here.
  I said to somebody this noon that I wanted to look into the
window of your soul, if I could, although I find the shade down
quite a ways. And that may be me. That may be ineptitude on my
part. That may be design on yours. That may be the ships in the
night. I don't know.
  Let me ask you a few more questions. While I could ask dozens
and dozens more beyond the ones I will ask, I suspect that I might
not know any more than I do now if I were to ask them. So let me
just take a few.
  Even though you have been asked a number of questions on nat-
ural law, I find that I still get asked a lot of questions about that.
Again, when I was home in Vermont, people would ask just exactly
what is meant by natural law, or what you mean by it. You have
testified here that natural law plays no role in constitutional adju-
                                               464

dication. You told Senator Hatch on Tuesday, I believe it was, that
a constitutional amendment was required to outlaw slavery. Does
that mean that you believe that the Dred Scott case, which was de-
cided before the 13th and 14th and 15th amendments were enacted,
was correctly decided?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't think I
  Senator LEAHY. At the time it was decided.
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I don't think I have suggested that and didn't
analyze it in that way. But I believe the question there was wheth-
er or not--since he was not an escaped slave, the question was
whether or not he enjoyed the privileges and immunities of a citi-
zen, and I think it would have been analyzed a bit differently. But
my own reaction to that is that it was not correctly decided, and I
have not gone back and redecided it.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you not argued that Justice Taney failed to
take into consideration the natural law principles in the Declara-
tion of Independence, particularly those that all men are created
equal?
  Judge THOMAS. I don't have that before me, and I don't have the
analysis before me, Senator. But I think that I could be wrong on
this. I think that was a privileges and immunities case.
  Senator LEAHY. But did you argue that Justice Taney failed to
take into account natural law principles in the Declaration of Inde-
pendence?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I think I--and, again, I don't have that
before me, but I think the reference was to the Founders' under-
standing of natural law and what they were including in the Con-
stitution.
  Senator LEAHY. Did you tell Senator Hatch that a constitutional
amendment was required to outlaw slavery?
  Judge THOMAS. I did. But the issue there was a different issue. I
think the issue was a black individual who had been taken to a
nonslave territory rather than having escaped to that territory.
That would have been the similar arguments that were made by
individuals who were free blacks and what their rights were.
  Senator LEAHY. Should Justice Taney have used natural law in
the Dred Scott case?
  Judge THOMAS. I think he should have, again, read the Constitu-
tion and attempted to discern what the Founders meant in drafting
the Constitution.
  Senator LEAHY. But if he did that before the 13th, 14th and 15th
amendments, would he not have had to uphold slavery? I mean,
slavery was allowed at the time the Constitution was drafted.
  Judge THOMAS. I think the separate issue is, the individual and
complicating issue is if you are in a State that does not have slav-
ery or in which slavery is outlawed.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, let me quote from a couple of your
speeches. At Wake Forest in April 1988, you said, "I thought that
OUie North did a most effective job of exposing congressional irre-
sponsibility. It forced their hand, revealed the extent to which
their public persona is fake." You said then a year later, "Lieuten-
ant Colonel Oliver North made perfectly clear last summer that it
is Congress that is out of control."
                                         465

  Now, I don't want to debate the issue of how you felt and what
you said at those times, but I take those particular statements be-
cause last year, as a judge on the court of appeals, you ruled in
favor of Colonel North in his criminal case. You voted, in effect, to
sustain the opinion of the panel which had overturned his convic-
tion on the ground that it was tainted by the use of congressionally
immunized testimony.

  Now, the reason I mention your vote in that case in which you
were with a substantial 8-2 majority, as well as your earlier state-
ments, is because I have heard you say over and over again, during
your testimony, that you were concerned that in giving us an
answer you might affect your judicial impartiality. You said, in
effect, that you did not want to recusfc yourself from cases that
might come before the Supreme Court because of what you said
here.

  Did you ever consider disqualifying yourself from sitting in judg-
ment on Colonel North's case on the grounds of either the strong
support that you expressed for him in 1988 or your criticism of the
Iran-Contra congressional hearings?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, first of all, let me address the statement
itself. As I have indicated, *xiy statement was in reference to some-
thing that happens sometimes with respect to oversight hearings,
or I guess in the political environment, and that is that hearings,
substantive hearings become overly publicized or over politicized.
And in this instance, I indicated--and this is the way I felt in
giving that speech. Colonel North exploited that to his own advan-
tage. I at no time expressed--and, in fact, in reflecting on my feel-
ings toward him during that time, my own view was that if he lied
to Congress or if he had engaged in any kind of unlawful conduct,
then he should suffer the consequences. At no time did I condone
that.

  On the court of appeals, the issue was a rehearing petition,
whether or not that case should be reheard en bane. And I didn't
feel that I was in any way less--in any way or anything other than
impartial in considering that.

  Senator LEAHY. SO the answer to my question is "no."
  Judge THOMAS. I did not. I felt that I had not expressed any opin-
ion on his culpability or on his criminal conduct.
  Senator LEAHY. I want to make sure I understand the answer.
The answer to my question is "no"?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you think that there is a core of political
speech that is entitled to greater constitutional protection than
other forms of speech?
  Judge THOMAS. I think that, Senator, the value that we place on
speech, whether it is freedom of the press or whether it is freedom
to engage in discussions about politics or whether it expressive con-
duct, we see those as--and the Court has treated those as--funda-
mental rights and has protected those accordingly.
  Senator LEAHY. IS all speech the same, though? Is all speech
given exactly the same constitutional protection?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I think that the Court, of course, has not
accorded the same protection of speech to commercial speech, for
example. But the issues that have faced the Court have usually in-
                                         466

volved whether or not--the difficult issues have involved expres-
sive conduct as opposed to pure speech. And

  Senator LEAHY. What about--I am sorry.
  Judge THOMAS. And the exercise that the Court has gone
through has, in essence, been whether or not the Government or
the State can in any way regulate that expressive conduct and
under what circumstances, in cases, for example, like O'Brien or
the cases such as Texas v. Johnson, the flag-burning case.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU are not saying, then, by any stretch, that
only political speech is protected? I mean, there is a lot of other
speech beyond political speech that is protected by the first amend-
ment.
  I realize what you said about the expressive forms of speech.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have not analyzed every single speech
case, but my own value would be to protect the entire amendment
in all of its fullness and not to find ways to creatively read out that
protection. I think it is important that we protect all of the amend-
ment.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, for example, if you had non-political
speech, like say a scientific debate, that would be protected by the
first amendment? I am not trying to get you to a specific case. You
understand, Judge. I just want to make sure we differentiate be-
tween the types of speech. But a scientific debate, first amendment
protections?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I think that speech, we value all of our
speech. What I am trying to say is I don't limit and see no reason
and haven't seen the Court limit our freedom of speech to whether
or not we are talking about science or whether we are talking
about politics. Certainly the Court has attempted to accord protec-
tion to speech such as, for example, the most recent case being
Texas v. Johnson, the flag-burning case.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, in that case, that was a 5-4 decision, as I
recall. The Court refused to uphold a conviction on the basis that
flag burning was a political statement. Is that a fair shorthand
  Judge THOMAS. NO. It was expressive conduct.
  Senator LEAHY. Expressive conduct?
  Judge THOMAS. Expressive conduct, that the individual was
making a statement, a political statement in burning the flag, and
that was protected by the first amendment. And the analysis nor-
mally is whether or not the Government can in some way control
the conduct or regulate the conduct; whether the Government, if it
is expressive conduct, has a compelling interest in regulating that
conduct.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you agree with the Johnson case?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, Senator, I have not--I think it is inappro-
priate for me to express agreement or disagreement, but I agree
that we certainly should--that expressive conduct should be pro-
tected by the first amendment. And I think that the difficulty for
the Court has been to what extent can it be regulated, not whether
or not it should be protected.
  Senator LEAHY. Would it be safe to say you would draw the line
at certain kinds of expressive conduct? Suppose somebody says, "I
am going to make a political statement by driving 95 miles an hour
                                         467

down Constitution Avenue." Might you say that that might stretch
the first amendment guarantees a tad far?

  Judge THOMAS. I think the analysis would be along the lines of
whether or not the Government has an interest, a compelling inter-
est in regulating this conduct. And I think that we would probably
both--and that is an extreme example. We would both have some
difficulty with the Government not regulating someone speeding
down Pennsylvania Avenue at 95 miles an hour, although at times
you feel in some cabs that you are going 95 miles an hour along
Pennsylvania Avenue.

  Senator LEAHY. In New York Times v. Sullivan, which I think we
would all agree is the benchmark libel case, the Court held that a
public official could not recover damages unless he could prove
that the defamatory information was made with actual malice.
Does that standard provide sufficient protection for public figures
in your mind?

  Judge THOMAS. I guess I haven't looked at it from that stand-
point. You know, I think all of us who have found our names occa-
sionally in the newspaper would like to feel that we have

  Senator LEAHY. Never happened to you, has it, Judge?
  Judge THOMAS. Well--but as I was telling my wife during this
process, no matter how badly it turned out as far as the publicity, I
think that the freedom of the press is essential to a free society.
And she sort of looked at me, because we were going through the
midst of it, sort of, Are you out of your mind? But I believe that,
and I believe that even as I was going through it and even as I am
going through it.
  But I think what the Court was attempting to do there was, of
course, to balance the first amendment rights, the freedom of the
press as we know it, and to not have that in a way impeded by
one's abilities to sue the media or to intimidate the media, and ap-
plied a standard of actual malice and struck a balance by protect-
ing the rights of the individual with the standard of actual malice.
  That is something, of course, that one could debate, but I think it
is demonstration, a clear demonstration on the Court's part that
the freedom of the press is important in our society, is critical in
our society, even though individuals may at times be hurt by the
use of that right.
   Senator LEAHY. DO you see any need to change that standard?
  Judge THOMAS. I at this moment certainly have not thought
about changing that standard and have no agenda to change that
standard. I think the Court is--my view, as I have attempted to ex-
press here, is that we should protect our first amendment freedoms
as much as possible.
   Senator LEAHY. When you were at the EEOC, you spoke often
about preparing our young people for the high-technology jobs of
the future. You mentioned especially minorities. I totally agree
with you, and I would hope that more and more Government offi-
cials would continue to say the same thing and that more and
more people in the private sector would say it, because I don't be-
lieve we are doing anywhere near enough.
   I also know that as new technologies come along, we need to look
at some of the civil liberties questions they bring up. One scholar
even suggested a 27th amendment to explicitly extend civil liber-
                                         468

ties, including freedom of speech, privacy, and protection against
unreasonable search and seizure, and apply it to these new technol-
ogies. I am not endorsing that proposal, but it raises the questions
that come up all the time about how we interpret the Constitution
in light of technologies that were totally inconceivable at the time
the Constitution was written, and some that were inconceivable
even 50 years ago.

   Do you have any comment on the adequacy of constitutional pro-
tection for computer and new telecommunications technologies?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think perhaps some of the same ques-
tions were raised with respect to search and seizure and certainly
addressed by the Court when telephonic communication became an
important part of our way of life, and I am certain many of the
cases or many issues will arise as to tapping in the computer data
bases, as well as issues involving such things as caller ID.

   I have not explored all of those issues. I certainly have seen our
laws, particularly our constitutional laws, moving and developing,
as those technologies move and develop. It certainly has done that
in the past, and I would have no reason to believe it won't have
that capacity in the future.

   Senator LEAHY. We have talked to you about specific issues here,
on civil rights, on relations between the Federal Government and
States, Roe v. Wade, and a number of others. On some of those spe-
cific issues, you have said that you did not want to discuss them or
you had certain parameters beyond which you would not discuss
them, because they might come up again.

  Let me ask you, then, in the abstract, about your basic sense of
stare decisis. Say a case comes before you, you have to make a
judgment in deciding whether you should overrule a decision. You
feel that the case law that might otherwise control was wrongly de-
cided. The new case you have now is perhaps on all fours, and you
have to decide whether to overrule the earlier decision.

  Tell me the kind of weight that you would give to these various
points. How much weight would you give to the Supreme Court's
acceptance of the basic principles of the case--subsequent accept-
ance--after the Court had decided the earlier case, which you
happen to think was wrongly decided?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, it is hard to say exactly and precisely
how much weight you would, in judging a case, I give to a particu-
lar component. I think, though, that when you have a precedent
that has been relied on in the development of subsequent Supreme
Court law, it is not one that was simply there and has never been
relied on by the Court, but I think that you would give significant
weight to repeated use of that precedent and repeated reliance on
that precedent. I think that is very important.

   Senator LEAHY. DO you give weight also to changed circum-
stances? Suppose we have changed substantially, as a country even,
since the earlier case was decided. Is that something that can at
least be considered or should be considered?

   Judge THOMAS. I think what the Court does, and it depends on a
particular case, Senator, is if a precedent or a rule becomes un-
workable, the circumstances change to a point that it is no longer a
useful precedent and it is one that is not applicable--I can't think
                                         469

of one off the top of my head right now, but I think the Court could
revisit a precedent when it becomes unworkable.

  Senator LEAHY. What about the importance of stability, and ad-
verse consequences that might result from overturning a case that
people had relied on up to that point?

  Judge THOMAS. I think what is critical there, Senator, is this,
that one of the reasons in our case-by-case system of adjudication
for having stare decisis is to provide for that continuity, and I
think that continuity is a basis for the stability of our system. It is
certainly a basis around which institutions can develop, it is a basis
around which people can develop some sense of predictability in
our system, it is a basis upon which I think people can react in a
positive way to our system. I think that the continuity and the sta-
bility is important.

  Again, let me just add and underscore the factors that you are
isolating here, by saying that I think the burden is on those who
would change a precedent to show more than simply that they dis-
agree with the underlying opinion. I think there is that additional
burden, which would include an analysis or would certainly include
the factors that you set out here.

  Senator LEAHY. Absent changed circumstances, does the lapse of
a significant amount of time weigh heavily in such thinking, or
should it?

  Judge THOMAS. I think that to this extent and perhaps in this
way, I think that in two ways, at least, that the passing of time
will certainly have some relationship to the manner, maybe not di-
rectly, but the way that the Supreme Court has used that prece-
dent, whether it has cited that precedent over a long period, wheth-
er it has built a body of case law around that precedent.

  The other point is that, over time, an important precedent could
be a basis upon which or around which institutions develop and
grow, expectations develop and grow, and I think that those would
certainly be taken into consideration, so in that sense I think time
is important. But I add this, though, that there have been prece-
dents in our time, for example, Plessy, which was overruled, which
had been around for quite some time, and certainly I don't think
there is any argument that that should not have been revisited,
notwithstanding the significant time that it had been around, but I
only use that as a caveat.

  Senator LEAHY. But in Plessy v. Ferguson, there were, of course,
at least to some extent in our society, changed circumstances, or
were there?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, society had changed somewhat, not totally.
I think that sometimes we think that it changed more than it actu-
ally had and we hope that

  Senator LEAHY. Some might ask if it has changed all that much
since then.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, some do ask rhetorically.
  Senator LEAHY. HOW do you feel?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the fact that I am sitting here engaged
in a discussion with you at a confirmation hearing for the Supreme
Court of the United States indicates that there is some change, but
throughout there has been much discussion about my speeches and
interviews, but you would find a common theme running through-
                                               470

out them, and that is this, that there may have been changes, but
there is still so much yet to change.

  There are so many individuals who are left out of our society
who deserve and should have a central role or full participation in
our society and all that it has to offer, and that is something that I
believe in, it is heartfelt, it is something that I have reiterated over
the years, and, notwithstanding the changes, there needs to be
more.

  Senator LEAHY. Let's go through all the different things we have
talked about: Changed circumstances and what you said about
that; the length of time the case has been on the books, weight to
be given to what a change or overruling a case might do to practice
that may or may not have become accepted practice.

  What if, after you have gone through all of that analysis, in your
heart you look at that decision and you say "I don't like it. I read
that decision, I disagree with it." Preceding from all the questions
of changed circumstances, the affect of time on society, acceptance,
et cetera, you Judge Thomas sit there--if you have been confirmed
as a Supreme Court Justice, you sit there as Justice Thomas--and
you say "I don't like that case, I disagree with that case in my
heart, morally, politically, emotionally, legally, whatever the
reason is, I disagree with it." What weight does that carry, as com-
pared to all the other things we have talked about?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there is Justice Marshall's dissent in
Payne v. Tennessee, I think is a very important admonition, and
that is that you cannot simply, because you have the votes, begin
to change rules, to change precedent. That is not a basis for doing
it. I think it is a very stern and necessary admonition to everyone,
all of us who are judges.

  On a personal level, as a judge, I at the end of the day, if I made
a decision in a case that way, that willfully, I could not say to
myself in the mirror that I have acted consistent with my oath and
the way that I see my obligations as a judge. I do not think that it
is appropriate to just simply say, as a judge, this is the way I feel
and that overrides everything else. I don't see where we have order
to our system, and I certainly don't see where that is consistent
with the discharge of my obligations under my oath as a judge.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Mr. Chairman, I thank you. I have many, many more questions,
that I do not anticipate going through.
  Judge I commend you for being here and I hope you won't think
it inappropriate if I also commend your wife and the rest of your
family who have been here. I mentioned to your son last week that
I admire his aplomb and his ability to stay there, and you would be
pleased in his response of why he was willing to do that for you.
Thank you, Judge.
  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  We will break for 10 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama,
Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, your explanation of the
                                         471

  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Senator. I am sorry. I apologize for
interrupting. I was told by staff that Senator Brown, in fact, had
no questions. I misunderstood. I guess you wish to make a state-
ment. Is that correct, Senator Brown?

  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I can com-
plete this within

  The CHAIRMAN. Take your time. I am sorry. I just was told you
had no questions or nothing to say. Senator Brown. I apologize to
my friend from Alabama.

  Senator BROWN. I thank the chairman. I simply wanted to make
an observation that I think is important to appear in the record.

  There is a lot riding on this consideration, and I don't think any
of our members have made statements that they intentionally
meant to be misleading. But as I review the record, one thing, at
least in my mind, is quite clear. Judge Thomas' remarks with
regard to how he would use natural law in my view are very clear
and very consistent. He stated before this committee that he would
not use natural law in the interpretation of the Constitution if he
sat as a Justice of the Supreme Court.

  In viewing the consistency of that, I have looked back at the 1V2
years of his tenure on the circuit court of appeals, and also at a
very similar question that was asked of him when he came before
this committee for confirmation to the circuit.

  The transcript of what he said at that time is virtually identical
to what he said before us. And the suggestion by some that there is
some sort of a change in his commitment to not use natural law to
interpret the Constitution I think simply is not borne out by the
facts. I wanted that observation as part of the record.

  I will yield back, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  The Senator from Alabama.
  Senator HEFLIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, your explanation of the apparent inconsistency in
your evaluation of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, from a speech
in 1988 to the explanation that you give today, troubles me. Let me
read this again, the speech at the Pacific Research Institute civil
rights task force, which I will read shortly. But as I understand
your explanation, it is that when you made this speech you were
not as familiar with the work and the opinions and the writings of
Oliver Wendell Holmes as you are today; and that when you made
this speech, you didn't realize as much as you do today about
Holmes; and that since making this speech, you have read books on
Holmes and you have changed your opinion.
  Now, is that a correct statement of your explanation?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I don't think so, Senator, and it is probably
because I didn't make myself clear. What I was attempting to say
was that I did make the statement, and the concerns that I did
have were expressed there. But I said that I did not stop there in
my development; that he was someone that I continued to look at,
and after going on the bench I decided to go back and to read more
about him and to look at him as a person. There was a recent biog-
raphy of him, "The Honorable Justice," which I read. And it didn't
necessarily mean that I didn't--that what I said there is what I be-
lieved at that time, but rather that I didn't stop with just that
                                         472

point of view. I wanted to know more about him and that clearly
he is a great Justice, but that doesn't mean that we can't disagree
with him.

  Senator HEPLIN. Well, basically you are saying, as I understand
you, that you read a biography, you studied his writings, his opin-
ions, his life, and you came to a conclusion he was a great Justice.

  Judge THOMAS. With the--no. I came to the conclusion that I had
differences of opinion with him, but, you know, I think it is one
thing to read about a judge or a Justice, I think, when you are on
the outside. It is another thing to read about him when you are sit-
ting on the bench also. And I think know more about him now, but
I still have that disagreement, as I said, with him that I expressed
in that speech.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, in that speech, you basically are express-
ing a disagreement with Justice Holmes about natural law. Are
you not?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, no. The disagreement, I think the overall
disagreement was one in which I felt that he did not look back to
the Declaration that is the backdrop of our regime, not to use it to
interpret the Constitution, but rather to not think that there is
anything back there at all. As I indicated, our Founding Fathers
believed in natural law, and not to recognize that

  Senator HEFLIN. I don't see anything in here about Founding Fa-
thers and looking back--let me read to you the statement that has
caused this criticism.

  The homage to natural right inscribed on the Justice Department building should
be treated with more reverence than the many busts or paintings of Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes in the Department of Justice. You will recall Holmes as one who
scoffed at natural law, that "brooding omnipresence in the sky." If anything unites
the jurisprudence of the left and the right today, it is the nihilism of Holmes. As
Walter Burns put it in his essay on Holmes, most recently reprinted in William F.
Buckley and Charles Kessler's ' Keeping the Tablets," "No man who ever sat on the
Supreme Court was less inclined and so poorly equipped to be a statesman or to
teach what a people needs in order to govern itself well."

  As constitutional scholar Robert Falkner put it, "What Marshall--

  Meaning John Marshall--

had raised, Holmes sought to destroy." And what Holmes sought to destroy was the
notion that justice, natural rights, and natural law were objective, and that they
existed at all apart from willfulness, whether of individuals or officials.

  Now, that is the quote.
  Now, from reading this, it would appear that in your scholarship
prior to this speech that you had read Walter Burns' essay on
Holmes and you agreed what constitutional scholar Robert Falkner
said about him. But for you to attack with words like this in a
speech a Justice of the Supreme Court, as well as one who is gener-
ally regarded as one of the giants of the Supreme Court, raises
some question in my mind.
  First, what was your scholarship in determining at that time
before making those statements about Holmes? How much had you
read about him at that time?
  Judge THOMAS. I think I had read what I cited there, and, Sena-
tor, as I noted earlier, one of the points that I had felt that, you
know, his statement in Buck v. Bell was troublesome to me. My
point was not so much that he did not use natural law or anything;
it was a matter of my attempting to understand natural law at
                                         473

that time as a backdrop to our Constitution, not as a method of ad-
judication.

  What I was saying recently to Senator Kennedy here with re-
spect to Holmes is that, as a judge, I decided that--I knew I had
read Mr. Kessler and some of the others. As a judge, I decided that,
look, I want to go back, and I want to learn more about Oliver
Wendell Holmes. I want to know more about Warren Burger. I
want to know more about all of our judges and Justices. And as a
judge, as I indicated, in my readings my point was that even
though I may have had in that context, in pulling together my own
political theory and trying to develop my own way of looking at our
country, my own philosophy, I wanted to look at him from the pos-
ture of a judge. And that was a comment that I was trying to make
to Senator Kennedy earlier this morning.

  I think that it is totally different, at least it has been for me. I
have heard comments here that it doesn't make any difference.
You don't change when you become a judge. And, of course, you
have been a judge. But for me, becoming a judge, as opposed to
being in the executive branch, was a dramatic change. And it is
one that certainly required me to take a step back and to look at
the responsibilities of the job and to look at the difficulty of decid-
ing cases. It also gave me a different appreciation of the role of a
judge, one that I could not have had when I was on the outside
talking about how we govern our country as opposed to how we ad-
judicate our cases.

  And I think that any of us who became judges or who have
become judges look to someone like an Oliver Wendell Holmes,
whether we would agree with him from a political theory stand-
point or not. My job, my effort has been as a judge to learn from
everyone. That is what I was attempting to do, and that is why I
indicated to Senator Kennedy--I was trying to suggest a sense of
humility that one learns when one sees the daunting task of being
a judge.

   Senator HEFLIN. Well, now, reading this from your speech, it ap-
pears to me--well, it is certainly subject to an interpretation, but it
is a very strong interpretation that you are criticizing Holmes be-
cause Holmes takes the position that natural law should not be
used in constitutional adjudication.

  Judge THOMAS. That was not my intention there, Senator. My in-
tention was solely to indicate that I didn't believe that he had an
understanding of what it meant to our regime, as a teacher or as a
political theorist. I think it would have been easy enough to say
that he should have used it in constitutional adjudication. I have
not said that.

   My effort was solely to look in that speech and the speeches that
I have given, to solely look at how our Constitution and how our
form of government relates to the Declaration and our Founding
Fathers, et cetera. I think I have tried to say that throughout these
hearings.

   I in no sense considered myself a jurist or considered myself
someone who felt that the role of natural law was to be a part of
constitutional adjudication. I did not feel that. And I have indicat-
ed--attempted to indicate that.
                                                474

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I read this part of that toward the end of
your speech. These are your words: "And what Holmes sought to
destroy was the notion that justice, natural rights, and natural law
were objective, and that they existed at all apart from the willful-
ness, whether of individuals or officials."

  Earlier in the speech, you say, "You will recall Holmes as one
who scoffed at natural law, that brooding omnipresence in the
sky."

  Now, this language isn't talking about Holmes the political theo-
rist, but it is speaking about Holmes the jurist.

  Now, explain--this leaves me that you at this particular time are
criticizing Holmes because he said and believed that natural law is
not to be used as a means of constitutional adjudication.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, I think my criticism perhaps was a bit
broader than that, Senator. Certainly--I know I am repeating
myself. I did not then nor do I now see a role for natural law in
constitutional adjudication except to the extent that I have noted,
and that is as the Founding Fathers saw it.

  What I was attempting, the point that I was attempting to make
in my speeches, in this speech, was that you couldn't just simply
ignore it and say it doesn't exist at all, it didn't exist, it had no role
in our regime, it had no role with the Founding Fathers.

  The Founding Fathers did believe in that. It did have a role in
our Declaration, and it did in some significant ways influence the
kind of government that was established in our country. But at no
point--at no point--did I suggest that it had a role in constitution-
al adjudication.

  Senator HEFLIN. All right, sir. Now, let me ask you about the
Sears & Roebuck case. This was a case that EEOC was the plaintiff
and brought against Sears & Roebuck, largely based on a reliance
upon--almost entirely I would say, a reliance upon statistics to
prove disparate impact. And I think that you were not the head
when this suit was filed.

  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator HEFLIN. But as the suit went along, you personally au-
thorized the increase of money for statistical studies in that case.
On March 30, 1983, you authorized an increase of $135,000. In May
1983, you again authorized the increase of another $534,000. On
August 10, 1984, you authorized another payment of $315,896. Now,
close to $1 million was authorized to you, as I understand it, for
statistical studies as the case went along.
  Then in the case, as the case was proceeding and had not come
to any judgment, you made the speech in which you criticized, rely-
ing on statistics, and basically said that the agency had relied too
heavily on statistics and investigations initiated by the Commission
itself and in its review of complaints filed by individuals. And in
that statement, you said, "For example, he said a case filed by the
Commission in 1979 against Sears & Roebuck Company, still pend-
ing in the Federal court, relies almost exclusively on statistics to
show discrimination against women."
  I am not arguing statistics or whether it is proper or not, but
with the investment that had been made in that case, isn't it un-
usual for a head of an agency to, in effect, cut the feet out from
                                         475

under the agency's lawyers by making such a statement pending
the litigation?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I believe that that statement occurred
once in an interview in 1984. The circumstances of the interview I
will not get into. It was not in a speech, and it wasn't in prepared
remarks. Not that that excuses it.

  There had been an ongoing debate about the use of statistics, not
statistics alone but the use of statistics. And I felt that in specific
cases in the agency that we had used broad statistical comparisons
or broad statistical disparities. I think we discussed it a little earli-
er in my testimony before this committee. We used those broad dis-
parities as a basis for deciding whether or not discrimination oc-
curred, and it didn't necessarily always show that. I have expressed
that concern, and we made changes in the way that we operated at
EEOC to address that concern and to solve that problem.

  With respect to this case, I indicated immediately after I made
that statement--it was an inadvertent statement and it was an un-
fortunate statement, and I said precisely that. And I think I said
that in my last confirmation hearing or in the interview that I
had--I can't remember--that it was an unfortunate statement. I do
not believe that it either undermined the case or impeded the pros-
ecution of the case. It was, again, an unfortunate statement, nor
did it in any way undermine my commitment to pushing that case
and financing that case.

  We pushed to the point of having to choose between furloughing
employees and financing that case. Although it didn't come to that,
we had chosen or decided--I decided that we would furlough em-
ployees rather than underfinance that particular case.

  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, the age discrimination problem and the
fact that Congress had to come in twice to pass laws to give people
who had lapsed claims the right to pursue them causes some con-
cern that has been gone into, basically because there was a charge
against you, and it was made at your court of appeals hearing, too,
at that time. First there were some 78 cases that had lapsed; later,
continuing to grow, one figure was 900 and then 1,608 and then fi-
nally somebody came up with the idea of 13,000 of the cases. Your
explanation, as I recall, was that you didn't know how the 13,000
came along and that you, as head of the agency, after Congress
gave them the right to continue to sue, passed laws in effect elimi-
nating the hurdle of the statute of limitations. You all sent out let-
ters to those--over 2,000 letters went out pertaining to it.

  In your explanation in the court of appeals--I don't believe I
have heard it here--you raised the issue that there were two stat-
utes of limitations and that there was confusion as to which one
would apply; that there was a 2-year statute and there was a 3-year
statute. And then came along the case of TWA v. Thurston that, in
effect, strictly construed the 3-year statute. The 3-year statute was
based on willfulness.

  Now, there was some misunderstanding and confusion, not only
in your office but in the district offices, the State and the local of-
fices, pertaining to this. The statutes of limitations are always in
the minds of a practicing lawyer. He gets a lawsuit, and he investi-
gates, and he has got real fears that if the statute of limitations
ran against him. His client couldn't pursue in court because of the

       56-270 0--93 16
                                         476

statute of limitations, and he would be subject to malpractice suits
as well as losing for his client outright. And it is a thing that prac-
ticing lawyers sometimes wake up in the middle of the night in
horror and dream of something like that. All practicing attorneys
develop a methodology in order to prevent the statute of limita-
tions from running on any case that is in their office. You try to
develop it where you will be sure that it doesn't happen.

  Now, in this case, let me ask you, was the issue of the statute of
limitation an issue that was involved in the interpretation of this
as to why these claims lapsed?

  Judge THOMAS. It was early on. When I arrived at the EEOC,
Senator, it was commonly felt that the agency had basically con-
flated the two statutes and considered the statute that really limit-
ed it to be the 3-year statute.

  After TWA v. Thurston, there was certainly concern that you
could no longer do this. The agency had interpreted willfulness to
mean basically that if a company knew that it was covered by the
Age Act, then any violation during that period was a willful viola-
tion. That is a generalization. That was basically the agency's view.
So the agency simply responded to the 3-year statute. After TWA v.
Thurston, the agency had to take a look at and be concerned about
the 2-year statute.

  Your view of the response to statutes of limitation is my view. I
think I noted earlier in the hearings that I have made that mid-
night run to the office of the attorney general, to the attorney gen-
eral's office. I wasn't in private practice, but you wake up in a cold
sweat and you throw something over your pajamas and you run
down to the office to make sure that you haven't missed the date
for filing a notice of appeal or responding to interrogatories or
what have you.

  I felt that everyone responded when you heard "statute of limita-
tions." You responded with fear or apprehension, et cetera.

  That was not the case, however. The response wasn't always that
way. It depended on the individuals in the particular offices, and
that is not a criticism of all the individuals. But some individuals
responded the way you and I responded. Some individuals did not
respond. Indeed, some individuals said that the statutes were
missed because it was a management decision, which horrified me
that anyone could feel that way.

  But we did eventually put in--some managers had their manual
tickler system to show when the statute was running. What we had
to do in headquarters was to help to develop an automated tickler
system in the computer so that there was absolutely no reason why
anyone could say that he or she didn't know that the statute of
limitations was approaching.

  But I would not pass off the change in the TWA v. Thurston
ruling in the way that we viewed the statute of limitations as a
reason for missing those statutes. It was a complicating factor. It
was one of the many factors. But I don't think that there is any
excuse for missing a statute of limitations. Indeed, when this whole
matter came up, I offered none.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, in order to clarify a distinction between
two statutes of limitation, isn't it from an administrative view-
point, since this involved primarily an issue of whether or not you
                                         477

or somebody can proceed to sue, whether you sue on behalf of
them, whether the EEOC sues on behalf of, or whether they allow
them to sue?

  Now, it seems to me that any uncertainty would have called for
a managerial approach to try to at least take the thinking don't
take a chance on the third-year statute, you had better work on the
2-year statute if there is any question at all about it. Was there
any activity on the part of you or your lawyers in the EEOC to so
advise all people that were handling such claims on behalf of the
EEOC?

  Judge THOMAS. That was certainly my response, Senator. I didn't
think that it made sense to rely on the 3-year statute of limita-
tions. That may have been a secondary approach, but it certainly
should not have been our primary approach.

  We did, as I have indicated, I think in discussions with Senator
Metzenbaum, that when I arrived at the agency, the agency didn't
attempt to investigate most of the age charges. I don't know what
the percentage is, but it was a small fraction of the charges that
were actually investigated. Unlike title VII, the Age Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act does not require that there be an investi-
gation. There were normally some attempts made at conciliating or
reaching the employer, and the case was closed out by the agency
in about 60 days, and the charging party was told to find a lawyer
and pursue your case in court.

  When I arrived at the agency, what we attempted to do as Com-
missioners was to recognize that we should put the age cases from
an administrative standpoint on parity with our other cases; that
is, we had an obligation to investigate them. Actually investigating
them, however, took more time.

  We realized that, and we attempted to inform our managers and
to instruct them, cajole them, put it in their performance agree-
ments, to get them to realize that the inventory had to be managed
with this consideration in mind that there is a 2-year statute of
limitations that must be taken into consideration, not just the first-
in, first-out approach that had been used in the past.

  That worked in many instances. In a number of instances, how-
ever, it did not work. We followed that up, again through perform-
ance agreements with management directives, as well as with re-
quirements that they take into account age cases that are ap-
proaching the statute of limitations, that they move those to the
head of the line. We did all those things.

  The problem, however, was that in some offices there simply
wasn't a response, an appropriate response. Hence, we missed the
statute of limitations in a number of cases.

  Senator HEFLIN. I believe my time is up.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge let me just add, your family deserves some kind of a spe-
cial medal for patience, sitting through all of this, and we appreci-
ate their doing that.
  If I may get back to a question that you declined to answer, for
reasons I understand, and that is the Rust v. Sullivan decision. But
                                         478

what is involved there is something very basic, and that is whether
the Federal Government can restrict speech if we fund something.

  Let me take some hypothetical cases that you will not be faced
with. The Federal Government funds libraries through the Library
Services and Construction Act; just a small amount, but we provide
some funding.

  Would it be constitutional for the Federal Government to decide
there are certain books--let's just say back when we viewed com-
munism as an immediate threat, if the Federal Government decid-
ed you can't have any books by Karl Marx in the library because
we provide funding. Would that be constitutional?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that we could take an example
like that, and I could offer an opinion on it and say that that would
not be--that was a problem, a violation of the first amendment.
But I think that the difficulty would be in offering an opinion on
those kinds of examples would lead me back to Rust v. Sullivan.
But let me make this point: I would be concerned by any effort--
and I think that we all should be concerned that when the Govern-
ment can, especially with the Government being involved in more
and more parts of our lives every day, we should be concerned that
if the Government funds or attaches strings that limits fundamen-
tal rights merely because of the receipt of those funds. I would be
concerned about it, and I think as I noted earlier, I certainly would
be concerned in this case that there would be some condition on
the exercise of first amendment rights.

  Senator SIMON. And I am not suggesting that--obviously you
have not had a chance to look at anything in depth here. But to get
a feel for where you stand, a little more of a feel than the generali-
ty that you just gave us, your off-the-top-of-your-head instinct,
would the Government have the right to restrict what books they
can have in a library?

  Judge THOMAS. Without committing myself, Senator, could I
  Senator SIMON. Without committing yourself
  Judge THOMAS. I might
  Senator SIMON. I don't want you to commit yourself to doing cer-
tain things: I don't want you to be on the bench and think, well, I
told the Senate committee this or that. But I am interested in
knowing what your feeling is on the first amendment.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I would hope that the Government can't do
that. I would have grave concerns if the Government can, through
simply providing funding, undermine fundamental rights. It would
be my hope that that could not happen.
  Senator SIMON. All right. I have some other examples, but let me
get to a more specific example that you were involved in at the
EEOC. There was a man named Frank Quinn who was in charge of
the San Francisco district. He was the district director. In 9
months he was going to retire. He had high ratings. He was asked
by Newsweek magazine to comment, and he gave a comment that
was not complimentary to the Washington office of the EEOC. And
then he was transferred to the Birmingham office--meaning no
disrespect to Birmingham here now. I may get in trouble with my
colleague. He was transferred to the Birmingham office where they
had had a vacancy for a full year.
                                         479

  He went into court, and a judge appointed by President Nixon,
Judge Schnackey, in upholding Frank Quinn's right not to be
transferred, said,

  We have, I think, an overly outraged reaction to the initial publication demon-
strating at the very least deep anger at the temerity of anyone in Mr. Quinn's posi-
tion to make the statement that he did. On the evidence before me, I can find abso-
lutely no rational basis for the agency's conduct. All of the evidence tends to sup-
port Mr. Quinn's view that this was a deliberate, arbitrary, and capricious desire to
punish him. I haven't the slightest doubt Quinn was transferred as punishment for
the exercise of his First Amendment right.

  Now, you may want to comment on the case. But the more fun-
damental question is: How do you view first amendment rights for
Government employees?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I fundamentally disagree with that
statement. And I did then and I do now. When I arrived at EEOC, I
established a policy and made it clear to all district directors, who
are members of the Senior Executive Service, that they would be
rotated. I had rotated some into headquarters from the field of-
fices--in fact, one from Birmingham--and intended to rotate the
others across the field.

  The indication that this was in response to an article, I do not
believe I have seen the statement in the article, and certainly it
had no bearing whatsoever on my decision to move Mr. Quinn. I
have stated that and would continue to state that. And if I did, I
think it is inappropriate.

  My own view is that individuals--I would hope that individuals
who worked for me wouldn't feel the need to criticize me publicly,
but I think they have the right to do so.

  Senator SIMON. And they have the right to do that without being
transferred or anything like that?

  Judge THOMAS. I think so. But this case was not that point.
Others have criticized me, and there certainly were no efforts
against them. I think that this was confused in this case with a
policy that I thought was important to the development of EEOC
as an agency. When I arrived at the agency, the agency was stag-
nant. The agency needed some stimulation, and I believe that the
agency needed to have the managers moved around, sort of stir up
the waters somewhat. And I made that clear, and we did rotate
managers and continue to rotate managers.

  Senator SIMON. YOU can understand the judge's assumption, be-
cause it happened only a few days after the Newsweek article ap-
peared, that he was transferred because of that.

  Judge THOMAS. That has been quite some time, but I think that
that had been in the works prior to the Newsweek article. I had
made a number of decisions early on in my tenure and simply
began to implement them. That had, from my standpoint, no rela-
tionship whatsoever. And I don't think--I don't remember that
what he said was particularly offensive anyway.

  Senator SIMON. YOU gave a talk to the Kansas City Bar Associa-
tion in which you refer to the Newsweek article. You were unhap-
py with the Newsweek article, obviously. Do you happen to remem-
ber
                                         480

  Judge THOMAS. But not the Quinn--I don't think I referred to
Mr. Quinn. I thought that the article was off base, but I didn't
refer to him, I don't think.

  Senator SIMON. I don't have that here. I don't know. But in
terms of basic freedom of speech, if an employee of any Federal
agency speaks--and obviously some things are confidential, some
things are classified. There are some limitations. But just because
something would be embarrassing to an agency is not cause for re-
stricting freedom of speech for a Government employee?

  Judge THOMAS. It certainly wasn't from my standpoint, and I
would be concerned if as an employee my speech was in some way
impeded.

  Senator SIMON. In an area where you have expressed your opin-
ion here to the committee, on the death penalty--where I happen
to be in the minority on this committee--two realities are a part of
the imposition of the death penalty in our country. One is it is a
penalty we reserve for people of limited means. If you have enough
money, you hire the best attorneys; you never get the death penal-
ty. The second reality is that it is much more likely to be applied to
minorities. If you are black, Hispanic or Asian, you are more likely
to get the death penalty.

  We have executed in this country literally hundreds of blacks for
killing whites. So far as I have been able to determine, my staff
has been able to determine, only two whites have ever in the histo-
ry of the country been executed for killing blacks.

  If you were on the Court and the circumstances were such that
you felt that economic circumstances dictated a lack of qualified
counsel for someone who received the death penalty, or you were
persuaded that the fact that a person was a minority was a factor
in receiving the death penalty, what would your attitude be?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, it would be similar to the attitude I
have now and that I expressed here. I don't know of any judge who
could look out the back window of our courthouse and see busload
after busload of young black males and not be worried and not be
concerned and not be troubled. I think it is only exacerbated by the
fact that it is the death penalty.

  As I have noted earlier in these hearings, one of the reasons that
it is so troubling is that it is a very fine line between my sitting
here and being on that bus. And I think that any judge who has
that obligation and that responsibility of adjudicating those cases
and has that responsibility of reviewing those cases should be con-
cerned if the death penalty is imposed based on socioeconomic
status and certainly imposed on the basis or at least to a large
extent disproportionately on the basis of race. It is certainly some-
thing that I am concerned about at this point and would continue
to be concerned about as a judge.

  Senator SIMON. And it would be something that you would have
to weigh as a member of the Supreme Court. Am I reading you cor-
rectly?

  Judge THOMAS. It is something that I certainly go there with in
my mind and in my calculus when I think about these issues.

  Senator SIMON. But it is not just that you go there with that in
your mind. If you were convinced someone received the death pen-
alty because he or she did not have adequate counsel, for example,
                                         481

because of economic circumstances, would that be a factor that you
would weigh, among others?

  Judge THOMAS. I think it would be important for me to take that
into account, Senator.

  Senator SIMON. OK. Let me shift to a couple of loose strings. The
Jay Parker/South Africa issue we have talked about. We have re-
ceived one additional phone call from someone who verified that
there was a staff meeting. We talked about it; you did not recall.
Do you recall this any further upon reflection, or has anyone re-
minded you or anything at all?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have attempted to reflect on it. My
recollection is as I have told you. I have attempted to try to under-
stand where the confusion could come from. And I knew that Jay
Parker, for example, represented one of the homelands. That could
be a source of confusion as to whether or not he represented South
Africa. I also knew that a colleague and friend of mine who worked
with me here in the Senate and went on to other endeavors, as
well as worked with me during the Reagan administration, repre-
sented South Africa. That was a matter of public knowledge.

  I don't think--I do not remember or recall Jay Parker's involve-
ment being a matter of public knowledge prior to my nomination. I
certainly was not aware of it until the last few months.

  The only confusion that I could think of, based on my own recol-
lection, would be that he has had significant dealings in South
Africa, and someone may have felt--or I may have imprecisely
stated that, and they may have felt that he was representing South
Africa. But I simply didn't know. I don't recall knowing, and I
don't recall such a meeting.

  Senator SIMON. DO you now or have you ever had any financial
dealings with Jay Parker?

  Judge THOMAS. NO. We had no financial dealings. He is a friend
of mine.

  Senator SIMON. And, again, on recollection, you were not aware
prior to your nomination and the publicity that came with it of any
involvement on his part with the Government of South Africa
other than the homelands?

  Judge THOMAS. NO, I was not. My recollection was that, again, a
mutual friend of ours, a Bill Keyes, was representing--and that
was public knowledge. He represented South Africa.

  I was not aware of Mr. Parker's involvement, and I do not recall
the meeting that you indicated. Again, there may have been confu-
sion, as I have indicated, but I did not--I was in no way aware of
that.

  Senator SIMON. Thank you very much, Judge.
  I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Kohl.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like to commend you on your patience and open-minded-
ness during this hearing, particularly under circumstances which
were at times trying.
  Judge Thomas, I would like to give you one more opportunity to
talk about what many of us are concerned about, and that is the
                                         482

possibility that you have a philosophy that tends to change with
your audience.

  I would like to quote for you a part of a column that appeared
this morning in the New York Times and then ask you if you
wouldn't think about it for a moment and then comment on it,
hopefully to enlighten us.

  The most striking aspect of Judge Thomas' testimony was his disavowal of just
about everything that he said in speeches made while he was Chairman of the
EEOC. The strident right-wing message was appropriate to his role in a right-wing
administration, he suggested, but he donned a new skin of impartiality when he
became a judge. Indeed, Judge Thomas went further in his disavowal. He implied
that he had made some of his conservative comments partly to please conservative
audiences. That was his explanation for his praise for the extreme anti-abortion po-
sition of Lewis Lehrman. But if he tailored his philosophy to please his audiences in
the past, might he not be doing so at this time in the Senate Caucus Room?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there is much that has been said, but I
don't think that I said that I tailored my message to please an au-
dience. In fact, the Heritage speech was precisely the opposite of
that, it was to make the audience uncomfortable. My explanation
with respect to the Lew Lehrman reference was simply to convince
the audience to re-look and revisit the issue of civil rights. The
bulk of that speech, the first part of that speech is a criticism of
conservatives as well as the Republican administration.

  The second point I would like to make, Senator, is that I do think
it is important to have be a member of the judiciary, as opposed to
being a member of the executive branch. There is a significant dif-
ference, and I have not through my history at EEOC or on the
bench or any place else attempted merely to please individuals.
That has not been a suggestion of mine.

  I was a member of the executive branch and I think I conducted
myself as a member of the executive branch. I am a judge now, and
I think I conduct myself as a judge.

  Senator KOHL. But you said that there was a difference--and you
said that consistently--between being a member of the executive
branch and being a member of the judiciary. And certainly there is
a difference, it is a simple fact. But you are being considered here
to become a member of the Supreme Court, because of whatever
your philosophy is--and we are attempting to get at that.

  Now, are you saying that that philosophy has changed, as you
moved from the executive branch to the judicial branch, or are you
saying that you had a philosophy in the executive branch, but you
come now to judiciary with no philosophy?

  Judge THOMAS. I said that, I think I have indicated I engaged in
ideological and political debates and discussions. I participated in
debates and policymaking, I participated in debates between the
two political branches. As a member of the judiciary, I do not think
that ideology is important and I do not engage in those political or
policymaking battles or discussions.

  Senator KOHL. Just one more question and then we move on. I
don't differentiate perhaps as much as you might between ideology
and philosophy. I think that what we are saying here is we are
asking ourselves and asking you whether the philosophy that you
expressed when you were in the executive branch is the same phi-
losophy that you have today.
                                         483

  Judge THOMAS. I am the same person, my outlook, I believe in
our country, I believe in trying to look at a problem and solve that
specific problem, to look at a statute or a case and be true to my
obligations with respect to that statute or that case.

  I do not believe, however, that there is a role in judging for the
expressions of the kinds of personal views or the policymaking or
the personal opinions that you have in the executive branch.

  Senator KOHL. That is all right, but would you say that I can
assume that, in general, the kinds of philosophies that you had ex-
pressed, however we interpret those, when you were in the execu-
tive branch, are not that dissimilar from the kinds of philosophies
that you carry today?

  Judge THOMAS. I am the same person. I think the role, again, the
judicial philosophy versus being a policymaker is different. I think
that there is an indication of the kind of person I am when I was
in the executive branch and my outlook on life.

  The only point that I am making is that, to the extent that those
are political statements or policymaking statements, I don't think
they are relevant in my role as a judge.

  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Judge Thomas. I don't sup-
pose I will be speaking to you again, at least not in this capacity. I
found you to be an intelligent, bright, and humorous person.

  With respect to the process itself, Mr. Chairman, I think that one
of the things that has come out of this confirmation hearing is that
we need to do as much as we can to ensure that the hearings in the
future leave us all, at least most of us, with a little more definite
feeling about what kind of a person, in terms of philosophy, we are
voting on.

  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  I have questions. It is my turn to come around. What I will do is
I will ask a few of them and then I will yield to the Senator from
Pennsylvania who has questions on his last round, and then I will
conclude.
  Judge I would like to go right back to methodology, if I may,
without any preamble. I would like to talk to you about the Mi-
chael H. case, and famous footnote 6, if I may. I don't want to bore
the listening public with the esoteric underpinnings of that debate,
but let me just simply ask you: Do you concur with the rationale
offered by Justice Scalia as to how one is to determine whether or
not an interest asserted by a person before the court, an interest
asserted that there is a fundamental right that that person has,
whether or not you must go back and look at the most specific
level of that interest as asserted, like he suggests, or as has histori-
cally or traditionally been viewed, a broader look back at the more
general interest asserted, as Justice Kennedy and Justice O'Connor
indicated, notwithstanding the fact they concurred in the opinion
with Justice Scalia in the Michael H. case? Would you speak with
me a little bit about that?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, that is a very recent case and I
am in the position of not wanting to comment on that specifically,
but I am very skeptical
  The CHAIRMAN. I am not asking you to comment on the case. I
am asking you to comment on the footnote.
                                         484

  Judge THOMAS. I am skeptical, when one looks at tradition and
history, to narrow the focus to the most specific tradition. I think
that the effort should be to determine the appropriate tradition or
the tradition that is most relevant to our inquiry, and to not take a
cramped approach or narrow approach that could actually limit
fundamental rights.

  I think that Justice Kennedy's reference to Loving v. Virginia
was a very catching reference in his reference and one

  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, Justice Kennedy's reference to
Loving v. Virginia?

  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. Was a very telling reference and one
that certainly caught my attention. But I think that I would be
skeptical of that kind of an approach, Senator, very skeptical
of

  The CHAIRMAN. The Kennedy kind of approach?
  Judge THOMAS. The Scalia approach.
  The CHAIRMAN. I hope so. Justice Kennedy's references to Loving
I think are--and there are other cases we could point to and not
just Loving--as to whether or not we go back and look in history as
to determine whether or not there is a protected fundamental
right. In the case of Michael H., the issue there, as you know as
well or better than I do, was whether or not a father who, in fact,
was the father by blood of the young person in question, whether
or not he had any rights to visitation, notwithstanding the fact
that the child was born at the time when the mother was married
to another man. Justice Kennedy asserts that--Justice Scalia as-
serts that when you go back to determine whether or not there is a
personal right to privacy of a father to be able to visit his child,
that you go back and not look at whether or not fathers have those
rights, but whether illegitimate fathers have those rights, and he
concludes, as you well know, that nowhere in our English jurispru-
dential tradition are illegitimate fathers treated the way that "fa-
thers are treated."
  When you narrow the scope to look that way, you can come out
with the ability to suggest that there is no historical background or
tradition that protects illegitimate fathers, ergo, in Loving y. Vir-
ginia, as you know better than I, it was a case that ended miscege-
nation in this country, at least in Virginia and the country, and if
you apply the Scalia method, you would go back and say is the
right of marriage, one that we always look to, and Scalia says no,
no, you don't look at marriage, you look at whether or not the mis-
cegenation laws were legitimate, they have always been viewed as
that in our unfortunate background, therefore. So, that is why it is
so important, as you well know, and, as I understand it, you are
not taken with the Scalia approach.
  Judge THOMAS. Skeptical.
  The CHAIRMAN. I hope you are more than skeptical, Judge.
  Judge THOMAS. Well
  The CHAIRMAN. At any rate, let me move on, if I may, for a
moment now to the issue of separation of powers, if I may, and go
back to Morrison v. Olson, if I may. I won't bother you with the
quotation. We have talked about it before, which is the quotation
about Morrison being the most important case since the Brown v.
Board of Education. We have talked about this passage several
                                         485

times, and you talked about it with Senator Leahy, and I want to
ask you why you thought the independent counsel case was the
most important since Brown.

  Your answer, if I understood it when we spoke about it the last
time, was that you were addressing an audience for whom the topic
of separation of powers would seem, to quote you, "obscure" or a
topic that "doesn't excite people in the audience." Now, is that cor-
rect?

  Judge THOMAS. And also it dealt with any case that dealt with
the structure of our Government. For example, INS v. Chadha
deals with the structure of our Government and the congressional
veto. I think those are important cases, because I think the Su-
preme Court has very few cases directly addressing the structure of
our Government.

  The CHAIRMAN. I can understand the need, we all do in each of
our businesses, you when you were in the executive branch and us
in the legislative branch, trying to get the attention of an audience
that may not want to pay attention to an esoteric subject. It never
happens in these hearings, but it occasionally happens in other
places, so I understand the technique, and I don't say that critical-
ly, I mean that sincerely.

  I never did get around to asking you whether you actually do
consider Morrisonv. Olsonthe most important case since Brown v.
Board of Education.

  Judge THOMAS. I think it is one of the most important cases. I
think it is among the important cases. Of course, I say that because
I think the cases that deal with the structure of our Government
are important cases.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I am sure you know why I was drawn to
this quote and comment, and it wasn't so much because it had a
darn thing to do with Brown v. Board of Education and looking
whether you thought something else was as important or the most
important since then.

  As you know, there is a group of people beyond yourself who con-
sider the independent counsel case very important and maybe even
the most important case since Brown, and I am thinking of the lib-
ertarians who are devotees of Mr. Epstein and others, those people
who have two major items on their agenda and they state them
very forthrightly. One is to use the takings clause of the fifth
amendment to limit the power of society to regulate. You and I
have talked about that. And the other is to limit the power of socie-
ty to regulate by revitalizing the doctrine of separation of powers.

  Now, when you gave that speech at the Pacific Research Insti-
tute, did you realize the significance of the independent counsel
cases for the people with what I will characterize as with these
views?

  Judge THOMAS. This is the first I have heard of that. I have
heard of the takings argument, but I haven't heard of the separa-
tion of powers argument.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, the reason why again it was brought to my
attention, I am reading Solicitor General Fried's book, as we men-
tioned in another context, and Solicitor General Fried and I have
had our little disagreements before this committee and he has
                                         486

never been accused, at least in the circles I travel in, of being a
liberal.

  In the book he wrote about his years as Solicitor General in the
Reagan administration, he refers to a group of executive branch
employees, primarily in the Justice Department, whom he refers to
as "Reagan revolutionaries." Professor Fried writes of the so-called
revolutionaries and what they thought about the Independent
Counsel case and why they thought it was such an outrage, such a
horrible decision, that is, upholding the Independent Counsel.

  But they also thought something else, he said. They thought that
if they could get the Court to strike down the Independent Counsel
statute, they would have a basis for striking down all independent
agencies, because the rationale that allows the Independent Coun-
sel case to be struck down would allow the Securities and Ex-
change Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal
Communications Commission, the Federal Reserve Board--which is
one of their primary targets--to be struck down.

  According to General Fried, this group wanted all of these agen-
cies placed under the thumb of the President, rather than continu-
ing to operate with a modicum of independence from the day-to-day
political influence, and I quote from his book, on page 154, "Order
and Law."

  He says, "To the revolutionaries of the Reagan administration,
the independence of the independent regulatory commissions, for
instance, the ICC, the FTC, the FCC, the SEC, and, most important-
ly, the Federal Reserve Board, was on a fence against the principle
of the unitary Executive and of the separation of powers."

  "So," he goes on to say, "that is why Morrison was such a big
deal to so many people, and still is to so many people, bright, at-
tractive and energetic people who would like very much, nothing
wrong about it, but would like very much to change the regulatory
process in agencies of this country."

  If Justice Scalia's opinion, the lone dissent that you found so re-
markable--and that is your word, remarkable--in the Morrison
case, had been the majority opinion, all of these agencies would be
unconstitutional, if Scalia's dissent were the majority opinion, in-
cluding the Federal Reserve Board, an independent agency that
has served this country extraordinarily well in recent years, most
might suggest, because the rationale of Scalia's opinion does not
stop at the Independent Counsel statute, it would outlaw all inde-
pendent agencies.

  Now, Judge, do you believe that the separation of powers re-
quires the abolition of independent agencies in the Federal Govern-
ment?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have not thought that. In fact, I was
on the other side of that debate, but let me just walk through it a
second.

  The CHAIRMAN. Please.
  Judge THOMAS. EEOC was one of the rare independent regula-
tory agencies in the executive branch.
  The CHAIRMAN. If I could stop you there, as you know, there was
a debate at the outset as to whether or not EEOC was, in fact,
truly an independent agency and designed to be one, unlike the
FCC and others which clearly unequivocally were meant to have
                                         487

independence in that the President could not dismiss without
cause.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, that debate about EEOC was, for all practi-
cal purposes, conceded in the Reorganization Act of 1978. My argu-
ment, as the Chairman of EEOC, was that EEOC needed to be inde-
pendent, that it was enormously difficult, as one of my Commis-
sioners put it, we had the worst of both worlds. We were one of the
few independent agencies or commissions that had to have its regu-
lations cleared through the Office of Management and Budget and
engage in a process that the other executive branch agencies had
to engage in, and there were problems with that, so I advocated
just the opposite, that it be truly independent.

  I was aware of the academic debate years ago, particularly after
the New Deal era, concerning administrative agencies. I did not
participate in that debate during my chairmanship of EEOC, and I
really just thought it was nothing more than the debate that you
would place next to the gold standard debate.

  The CHAIRMAN. It is alive and well, I must tell you. [Laughter.]
  Judge THOMAS. There are some limits to the things that I can
spend my time on, but I was not involved in that debate and was
not aware that there was a relationship or there was a second
agenda to Morrisonv. Olson.This is news to me, as you explain it
today.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, in light of what you know now, you
do understand why this is such an important issue to question you
on, don't you? If you look again at the dissent in Justice Scalia's
dissent--and he has been consistent, by the way, this is not a new
notion for Justice Scalia--he takes separation literally and, as you
well know, he is in a position where he suggests that articles I, II,
and III set out the parameters for each of the branches and they do
it very precisely, and that any branch that in any way, voluntarily
or involuntarily, treads on the prerogative of another, in this case
if there is any executive capacity or judicial capacity that any of
these agencies possess, then, in fact, they have gone beyond what is
legitimately authorized in the Constitution under the separation of
powers doctrine, doctrine, I might add, that is not anywhere men-
tioned explicitly in the Constitution.
  So, this is a big deal, and if there were five Justice Scalias on the
bench, we would find ourselves with a radically different means by
which we would be able to have this Government function. I am
not being pejorative, when I say that. For argument purposes, he
may be right, but it would radically change it.
  The FCC has judicial functions as well as legislative functions, it
has rulemaking capacity. He argues, no, no, rulemaking capacity,
that's legislative, it can't be done. In Morrison, he argues, wait a
minute, you still have the--you put, in effect, the executive branch
in the position where it has to assign a special counsel, so notwith-
standing the fact you allegedly give independence, whether or not
to determine whether or not such counsel exists, you have already
stepped over the line, therefore, it is unconstitutional, because the
legislature is taking on some executive function.
   I am not being facetious when I say this, but do you understand
why his dissent is so significant, if it were to be the majority view
of the Court, or do you disagree with my assessment of his dissent?
                                         488

  Judge THOMAS. Well, in the context that you explain, I can un-
derstand your concern. My quote and my reference in the speech
was that with respect to the individual rights that were affected in
this particular case, but

  The CHAIRMAN. I will accept that on its face, because I believe
you mean that and, believe it or not, I am delighted to hear that is
the case, and not the larger case, because it is a--when I say
agenda, I don't mean it again to sound so pejorative, when I talk
about an agenda out there unrelated to you, but I think we should
understand that there is a good deal of intellectual ferment.

  I must admit, one of the reasons why the right has been so suc-
cessful is there is much more intellectual ferment on the right
than there is on the left today. I think the left has fallen back on
its laurels in many ways. It finds there is no need to come up with
new methods and means by which to promote its objectives, but
that is not lacking on the right and there is an explicit desire, not
at all denied by any of the young intellectuals who wish to see a
change, that the way to deal with too much Government bureauc-
racy and regulation is to eliminate the regulatory bodies that exist,
thereby giving the Executive total control over those elements of
regulation, as opposed to the legislative bodies.

  I won't bore you with that. I accept your answer for what it is to
be the truth, and I will at this moment, unless you would like to
add anything, I will yield to my colleague in a moment.

  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  The CHAIRMAN. I suggest we break and give you a break, unless
you have a comment to make on what I said, and then I will yield
to my colleague when we come back, Senator Specter, and we will
have you question then, Senator.
  We will recess, to give the witness time to stretch his legs a little
bit, about 10 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, in my last round of questions, I was discussing
with you the topic of the revisionist court, which is a name that I
affix to our current Court because it is not a conservative court; it
is a revisionist court, as I see it. And I want to discuss with you
two cases which are illustrative of its being a revisionist court be-
cause they are two 1971 opinions by a unanimous Supreme Court,
with the opinions being written by Chief Justice Burger in a very
conservative thrust.
  One of the cases is Swann versus the school districts, and I ask
you about this case because you had written on the subject in the
Boaz edition of "Assessing the Reagan Years." And you complained
about "Brown not only ended segregation but required school inte-
gration."
  My first question to you is: If you end segregation, doesn't it nec-
essarily mean that you are requiring school integration?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I guess semantically the reference, my own
reference to those different terms would have been that desegrega-
tion would be the ability to simply not be barred from certain ac-
                                         489

tivity and integration would be more positive; that is, you are re-
quired to have a certain percentage or certain number.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, does your criticism of the
Swann case signify another one of the illustrations of your advoca-
cy from the executive branch, or is this something you reallyHhink
should be changed and something you would try to change if con-
firmed for the Supreme Court?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the answer to the second portion of your
question is the same as I have said in other areas. I have no
agenda to change existing case law. That is not my predisposition,
and it is not the way that I approach my job.

  The concern that a number of us raise with respect to just as in-
dividuals in this society, as individuals who have watched the
changes in our country, was simply that if we could demonstrate
that the educational opportunities were improving for minorities,
then whether it is busing or any other technique, then use it, but
make sure that we are helping these young kids. That was totally
out of the legal context. That just simply would have been a prefer-
ence that I expressed as a citizen.

  I have not reviewed, gone back and looked at Swann or the other
cases and made any determination that would undermine my abili-
ty to look at those cases impartially. And I certainly don't have a
predisposition that precludes me in any way from looking at those
cases in an objective manner.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, let me pick up the second unan-
imous opinion, again written by Chief Justice Burger in 1971,
which I know you have reviewed, and that is Griggs, which has
been an enormous source of controversy. It has occupied a tremen-
dous amount of time by the Members of Congress, by the President.
It has occupied almost as much time for Senator Danforth as your
confirmation hearings have occupied.

  This is a case which I have commented on when we have consid-
ered legislation to change the Ward's Cove decision because I think
it is a very serious matter when you have a statute enacted, as the
Civil Rights Act was in 1964, and you have a 1971 unanimous Su-
preme Court decision written by the Chief Justice, handling many
issues, two of which are the definition of business necessity and the
second of which is the burden of proof. And then 18 years later, by
a 5-to-4 decision, as I read Ward's Cove, that law has changed. Not
interpreted but changed. And four of the five Justices who voted in
Ward's Cove to change the law put their hands on their Bible in
the confirmation hearings in the course of the past decade and
swore not to change the law but to interpret the law. And I think if
there is any principle which is rock-bed we all agree to among the
14 of us here and the 100 in the Senate, it is that the Supreme
Court ought to interpret the law and not make law.

  The Court in Griggs said that the touchstone is business necessi-
ty, and in Ward's Cove,the Court said that there is "no require-
ment that the challenged practice be 'essential' or 'indispensible.' "

  Now, this is shortcutting a very extensive amount of complicated
discussion, but the essence of a defense was business necessity in
Griggs and in Ward's Cover they say it need not be essential, which
is about as direct as you can have on a change in language.
                                         490

  When you testified before the Judiciary Committee on your con-
firmation for the District of Columbia, I had asked you about a
series of cases, and you had said, in part, "There is a definite
change in the burdens under Ward's Cove."

  Is there any doubt, Judge Thomas, that Ward's Cove overruled
the Griggs case?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that if the Court had intended to
overrule it, I would hope that it would have done so explicitly.
When I was Chairman of EEOC and, as you indicate, when I ap-
peared before this committee the last time, you asked me about
this case. Our response at EEOC, when we were initially involved
in this, was that we should have simply--the Supreme Court case
should only have involved whether or not there was a prima facie
case. That was EEOC's official response.

  Our reaction to the ruling--and I was at EEOC only a short time
after the ruling--was that there was a change in the business ne-
cessity test. That was our reaction. I was not there long enough to
determine precisely the extent to which there was this change, but
that was our reaction at the time. And I have not since I have been
a judge, of course, revisited those questions.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, that is one of the two questions that I
told you in our brief meeting on August 1, that I would ask you,
only two, the questions about Korea and the question about Ward's
Covereversing the Griggs case. And I would agree with you that it
would be preferable in the sense if it is explicit, but I think the
way this case has come down, it is a very plain conclusion.

  My question to you is: Do you think that it is appropriate for the
Supreme Court, given the underlying premise that the Court is to
interpret law rather than make law, where the Congress has
passed a law like the Civil Rights Act in 1964, and a unanimous
Supreme Court interprets it in Griggs, and Congress leaves that
law unchanged, and in Ward's Cove the law is changed? Is that ap-
propriate?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, as I indicated, Senator, my concern would
be that in those instances in which there is an interpretation on
the books or in case law and Congress has not seen fit to readdress
that in a statutory change or statutory amendment, then it seems
as though that there should be less of an inclination to want to re-
visit those issues, as compared, of course, or contrasted with consti-
tutional issues.

  I can't say--and I don't think it is appropriate for me to place a
normative judgment on whether or not it is appropriate or not. I
would be, as a judge, concerned about changing, as I have said in
my discussions of stare decisis, existing interpretation that has
been long standing, that has been

  Senator SPECTER. What do you mean by "normative," Judge
Thomas?

  Judge THOMAS. Appropriate or putting a value judgment of some
sort on it.

  My concern would be that in making those kinds of changes that
we are not paying sufficient heed to the principle of stare decisis.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I think that this is one of the central
issues which has been raised in your confirmation hearings. I
accept your statement about your previous comments as to the lack
                                         491

of wisdom in the Congress, but your commitment to interpret the
law and not make new law. And it seems to me that this is a classi-
cal illustration of the Court changing the law and making law, as
opposed to its function to interpret the law.

  I was pleased to hear your comment about the dissenting opinion
by Justice Marshall in the Payne case, which involved the decision
last term which overturned two very recent U.S. Supreme Court
decisions when, as I heard you say, Justice Marshall's decision was
a "stern admonishment." Were those the words you used?

  Judge THOMAS. I think "stern admonition."
  Senator SPECTER. "Stern admonition." Do you agree with Justice
Marshall's dissent?
  Judge THOMAS. I would like to--I think it would be inappropriate
for me, Senator, to agree or disagree with it.
  Senator SPECTER. Why?
  Judge THOMAS. I was certainly affected by it. I agree with his
statements concerning stare decisis to the extent that I suggested
here. I think that judges should be very concerned that their per-
sonal opinions are not the basis or their clout is not the basis for
making decisions.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, do you agree with Justice Marshall's as-
sertion that "Power, not reason, is the new currency of this Court's
decisionmaking," his opening statement in Payne?
  Judge THOMAS. I would, Senator, refrain from agreeing or dis-
agreeing with that. I agree that we should be concerned and be
aware of the principle of stare decisis and that we should guard
against making decisions as judges based on the number of votes
we have.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I won't press you further on it then. But
let me ask you if you agree that property and contract rights have
no higher status than personal liberties because the majority opin-
ion put property rights, contract rights on a higher level, saying
that stare decisis should be followed--that is, a precedent should be
followed, and more attention should be changed to not make the
modification if there were property rights or contract rights con-
trasted with personal liberties. Would you at least put personal lib-
erties on the same level with property and contract rights in fol-
lowing precedents?
  Judge THOMAS. The answer to your question, Senator, is yes. I
don't understand the quote. It makes no--the statement in, I think,
Justice Rehnquist's opinion? It makes no sense to me. But I
would--my answer to your question would be yes.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you.
  Let me move, and very briefly because there is not a great deal
of time, to a very complicated subject and just ask one question
about it. That is the subject of federalism, and it is this: Does our
modern Constitution, as it has been interpreted, place any restric-
tion on Federal power vis-a-vis the States? Or is the political
answer by Congress now the measure of the constitutional power
issue?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't know whether we know what the
limits are. I think we realize that there is much more involvement
on the part of the National Government in our day-to-day affairs,
                                         492

certainly through the 14th amendment and through the commerce
clause.

  I think that that issue and similar issues come into focus in cases
such as the Garcia case, and I think that that is something that
will continue to be explored and debated in the judicial arena, as
well as, I am sure, in this body and at State government level.

  Senator SPECTER. SO, you think the commerce clause might not
have the full sweep of enabling the Congress to do what it chooses
in the field of commerce and regulatory and legislative power?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't question the current development of the
commerce clause, Senator. As I have noted earlier, my point is that
I don't think that any of us know precisely what the limits are
now, with the advances in communications, with the increased role
of the Federal Government, with the increased involvement of the
Federal Government in our day-to-day lives. I think that is some-
thing that certainly was at least to some extent a concern in the
Garcia case.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, there were two major cases de-
cided relatively recently on the equal protection clause, Metro v.
Federal Communications Commission, which was congressional
action, and Richmond y. Crawson which was a city council action.
My question to you is, in applying the equal protection clause, does
it make any difference whether the legislative enactment comes
from the Congress, as opposed to a city council?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that Metro Broadcasting, of
course, used the equal protection analysis, but it was a fifth amend-
ment case. The Court has made a distinction in Crawson, as well as
in Metro, that when the race- or gender-based policy, I think race-
based policy in these cases, were as a result of Congress' effort, the
level of scrutiny is lower than it is if it is on a policy that is devel-
oped by a State or local government.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, the fifth amendment due process clause,
of course, picks up the equal protection clause of the 14th amend-
ment

  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. So the analysis would be the same
as the equal protection.
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator SPECTER. SO, you would accord greater strength or lati-
tude to a congressional enactment, as opposed to a city council en-
actment?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right, that is under existing case law,
that's the approach.
  Senator SPECTER. Let me cut through quite a lot of discussion
with, again, a very direct question, without getting into the under-
girdings of the opinion in Metro Broadcasting, would you agree
with this succinct statement from Justice Stevens' concurring opin-
ion, at the very start, in Metro: "Today, the Court squarely rejects
the proposition that a government decision that rests on a racial
classification is never permissible, except as a remedy for a past
wrong."
  Judge THOMAS. That's the state of the law.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU agree with that state of the law?
  Judge THOMAS. I have no reason to disagree with it.
                                         493

  Senator SPECTER. All right. That is a very important point and I
am glad to hear you say that, because this really goes right to a
core of a good bit of your writing.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, it doesn't, as I mean that as a judge, Sena-
tor. I have had no basis as a judge to disagree with it.

  Senator SPECTER. NO, no, I am referring to the writings prior to
the time you became a judge.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, that is a policymaking function, and I
  Senator SPECTER. SO, that was a different lifetime than all of
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I have to adjudicate these as a judge and I
know that is a distinction that some seem to think is troublesome,
but it is a very, very important distinction for me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Will the Senator yield on that point?
  Senator SPECTER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Not the case law, but the point about a judge.
Judge, you are going to be the judge, you are going to be a judge
who is not bound by stare decisis, has nothing at all that would
bind you other than your conscience. And so I am a little bit edgy
when you give an answer and you say, well, that's the policy, as if
you are still going to be a circuit court of appeals judge, which
means you have to follow that policy.
  You are going to take a philosophy to the Court with you, as
well, and you are not limited, as I understand it, in any way, in-
cluding the methodology you have indicated you would apply to
great questions of the day, from reaching a conclusion different
than that which the Court has reached thus far. So I don't know
why you can't tell us with a little more certainty in the case the
Senator just laid out as the state of the law, because it is a big
deal, whether you agree with it or not.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I understand that, Mr. Chairman, but what
I have attempted to do is to not agree or disagree with existing
cases.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are doing very well at that.
  Judge THOMAS. The point that I am making or I have tried to
make is that I do not approach these cases with any desire to
change them, and I have tried to indicate that, to the extent that
individuals feel, well, I am foreclosed from a
  The CHAIRMAN. If you had a desire to change it, would you tell
us?
  Judge THOMAS. I don't think so. That would be [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. That is what worries me, Judge.
  Judge THOMAS. But the
  Senator SPECTER. Was that an "I don't think so"?
  Judge THOMAS. I think the point that I am trying to make, Mr.
Chairman and Senator Specter, is that when I say I don't have an
agenda, I mean I don't have an agenda. I operate that way as a
court of appeals judge and that's the way I will function if I am
fortunate enough to be confirmed as a member of the Supreme
Court.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Senator Biden, let me amplify Judge Thomas'
answer for you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would appreciate it.
                                         494

  Senator SPECTER. He is testifying that he is not going to make
policy as a Supreme Court Justice, if confirmed. He has written ex-
tensively that the courts have been thrust into a policymaking po-
sition and that the courts have made policy. He has disagreed with
the policy and has stated that he would change a lot of law from
an advocate's position on policy, saying, for example, in Johnson v.
Santa Clara, that the dissent by Justice Scalia was preferable and
saying, in another context, although not totally approving it, that
one quick fix is to appoint new Justices to change the approach.

  He is saying in these hearings, as I understand it, that all of that
policy consideration that you were commenting about in those
many speeches is a thing of the past, and you talked about that
solely as an advocate.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, you understand what concerns me. If I
were a judge

  Senator SPECTER. Let me finish for him, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. I leave those usually for Senator Hatch.
  Senator SPECTER. I object. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. If he were employing me as a judge, in good
faith, to change the position of the law, because he felt in good
faith it was in my power to do so as a judge, and then he became a
judge and didn't follow his own advice as to what he in good faith
was giving me that was within my power to do, I would wonder
about that. But that is my confusion and I will have to resolve
that, but I would be delighted to hear more of your explanation, if
you would like to give it.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, to finish my question for you, Judge
Thomas, which is really an understanding of mine as to what you
are saying here, you are saying you are going to do your level best
not to make policy. You are making a commitment not to make
policy, you don't think that is a judge's function, and it is an about-
face from a lot of what you have written.
  Senator Metzenbaum earlier made a comment that he is dis-
turbed by the position you have taken in disavowing much of what
you have spoken about in your tenure as Chairman of EEOC, con-
trasted with your background and your roots, and I think that is
something that this committee has to consider and the Senate has
to consider. I am not so sure but what your roots are not more im-
portant in trying to predict what you will do, if confirmed, than
your writings. Your writings and your answers are at loggerheads,
they are inconsistent with what has been said.
  You had written earlier in your career that you thought flexible
goals and timetables were appropriate, and you changed that.
Judge Thomas, isn't it entirely possible you could change your
mind again and find that timetable and goals are the preferable
course?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, what I have attempted to do here is to
demonstrate that, in any number of areas, certainly the transition
from policymaker to judge is an important transition. In specific
areas, I have attempted to demonstrate, even when I have in the
policymaking area strongly held views, that I have always looked
to expand and to grow and to understand the counterarguments,
not to simply reinforce my own.
                                         495

  There is always a possibility that someone who is open to argu-
ment, who thinks about issues, who is receptive to different points
of views, there is not only a possibility, but a hope that person
would grow and develop, and I hope that, in a positive way, that I
would continue as a person to grow and develop.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, we have seen lots of changes of
positions in the course of the hearings in the 10 or 11 years that I
have been here, and I don't know any way to stop the Supreme
Court of the United States from functioning as a superlegislature,
regardless of what is said here, so we have to make an assessment
of the whole man. But I understand what your statement is, that
you agree with a very critical aspect as to what Justice Stevens de-
fines on the Metro case. It is a very core issue and you don't have
any intent at the moment to change it. More than that, what can
be said.

  Let me pick up with one other aspect of what Senator Metz-
enbaum had questioned you about. He had referred to a speech you
made in San Bernardino, on April 25, 1988, and picked out--and
this is illustrative of much of what you have written, and when I
say picked out, I don't mean extracted out of context--"Increasing-
ly, they are being used by demagogues who hope to harness the
anger of the so-called underclass for the purpose of utilizing it as a
weapon in their political agenda."

  I had made an abbreviated comment last week about your status
as a role model and the fact that politics is involved at many levels
of the confirmation proceeding, and at most of those levels I think
it is appropriate. And one of the items which concerns me that I
raise in a positive sense when I was talking about Professor Carter,
is that you would be serving as a role model. You will be serving as
a role model for young African-Americans who would look to the
success you have achieved in terms of doing it entirely on your
own, and that might not be something that many of the traditional
African-American leaders want to hear.

  Your speeches are full of comments about their being pro-Gov-
ernment and wanting the Government to have a larger role. But I
think it is a very healthy thing, whether you are right or whether
you are wrong, to have that other ideas put into the marketplace.

  I had commented, and somebody didn't understand what I was
saying when I had called you, after I read a speech you made after
the 1984 election, that African-Americans were not as active in the
Republican Party as they should be, entirely appropriate at that
time. You weren't a judge. We sat down and talked about it, and I
think it would be a very healthy thing for my State, for the city of
Philadelphia, to have a two-party system, and to the extent there is
a role model here and you have said that, given a chance, blacks
would come to the conservative cause. That is not the element for
my decision, I repeat, but that is a lurking undercurrent which I
think is worthwhile to put squarely on top of the green-felt table
here today.

  A final roundup, Judge Thomas, as my time is almost up and I
know your answers to these questions, because we have discussed
them at your confirmation hearing on the court of appeals, but I
think they are very important, and that is rockbed on Marbury v.
                                         496

Madison, that the Supreme Court has the last word, no doubt in
your mind about that.

  Judge THOMAS. NO doubt, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU are not going to revisit that question.
  The other one which I consider to be very important is the issue
of court stripping. During my tenure in the U.S. Senate, there have
been efforts to take away the jurisdiction of the Federal court on
constitutional issues, and I just want to be sure that, if confirmed,
you would not countenance that kind of a major change in our con-
stitutional government.
  Judge THOMAS. I think we discussed that the last time, and I
think that my position is the same, that I would not.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Thomas. I think
about these hearings and the kinds of questioning, I think about
the old case of Ashcraft v. Tennessee, which ruled unconstitutional
relay questioning. You certainly had to do a lot of that here today,
and I commend you for your stamina and I thank you for your an-
swers.
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Does anyone on this side of the aisle have any
further questions at all for the judge?
  [No response.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sure the judge appreciates that.
  I yield to my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge, I just want to ask you one question.
There has been a lot of talk here about making policy. Under the
Constitution, the Congress makes the law. The executive branch,
headed by the President, administers the law, and executes the
law. The judicial branch interprets the law. This should not be a
question of courts making laws. Courts have done that, but they
should not have done it. This should not be a question of making
policy. A judge's job is to construe and to interpret the law. Judge
Thomas, is that the way you see your responsibility?
  Judge THOMAS. That is the way I see it, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. That is a good answer, and that is the cor-
rect answer. [Laughter.]
  Now, Judge, we are about through here. We are going to wind
up.
  Mr. Chairman, yesterday the Washington Post ran an editorial
which I ask unanimous consent be placed in the record. Briefly, I
would like to quote from it. It states: "[Judge Thomas] will have a
clearer sense of discrimination and its remedies that any other
member of the Court * * * on the strength of the hearings so far,
we think he should be confirmed."
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.

  Senator THURMOND. Briefly I would like to just quote two sen-
tences. Here it is speaking of Judge Thomas. It states Judge
Thomas "will have a clearer sense of discrimination and its reme-
dies than any other member of the Court." In another place in the
editorial, in the last sentence, "On the strength of the hearings so
far, we think he should be confirmed."

  I just wanted to put that editorial in the record. That is coming
from the Washington Post, Mr. Chairman. [Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. I say to my colleague, I am certain the Post is
delighted that you are praising them.

  Senator THURMOND. It isn't so often I agree with them. I want to
give them credit when they deserve it.

the Washington Post of July 17, 1991, "Talking with Thomas for 10
Years," by Constance Berry Newman.

  I ask unanimous consent these appear in the record.

Talking With Thomas forj.0 Years

   In nominating Judge Clarence
Thomas to serve as associate justice
of the U.S. Supreme Court, President
Bush has chosen an individual who
has both the intellect and the intellec-
tual honesty for the job. He nominat-
ed a person who will be fair and sen-
sitive to the struggles of all
Americans--black, brown, white, red
and yellow.

  Judge Thomas would not let peo-
ple's religion or station in life affect
the way they thought about their
rights. He has a special understand-
ing of those poor striving for political
and economic empowerment

   And he is willing to listen to others
with whom he is not supposed to
agree. 1 know. I am one of those peo-
ple. For almost a decade Judge
Thomas and I have discussed many
issues, but most often our discussions
were about inequities in this nation
and approaches to ensuring equal op-
portunity for all. We agreed, we dis-
agreed, and we have both changed

  Senator THURMOND. NOW, Mr. Chairman, I am not going to take
time to give all these groups here a chance to just--several law en-
forcement organizations recently met with me to express their
strong support of Judge Thomas' nomination, several groups such
as the National Sheriffs Association, International Association of
Chiefs of Police, Federal Investigative Association, National Law
Enforcement Council, National Society of Former Agents of the
FBI, National District Attorneys Association, and Citizens for Law
and Order, a victims rights group. They all endorse Judge Thomas
for a position on the Nation's High Court. I ask unanimous consent
that certain documents of support from these organizations be
placed in the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.

Washington, DC 20500

Dear Mr. President:

On August 14, 1991 during our recent National Fraternal Order of
Police Conference, we were honored to have you address our
delegates attending the conference regarding several legislative
matters and other issues of concern to law enforcement. At that
time, you asked for our support for Judge Clarence Thomas, your
nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. As a result of your request,
our delegates passed a resolution instructing me to investigate

Endorsing the nomination of judge Clarence Thomas for Associate

Whereas, President George Bush has chosen to nominate Judge
Clarence Thomas for Associate Justice of the United States Supreme
Court, it is the sense of this assembled body to extend our most
stringent support of that nomination, and...

Whereas, the National Troopers Coalition recognizes that the office
of Associate Justice demands integrity, intellectual skills, and
dedication to the principal of equal justice, and...

Whereas, the office also requires unbending dedication to
principal, basic fairness, human decency, and justice under law,
and...

Whereas, the record of Judge Thomas impressively demonstrated these
qualities from his days as Assistant Attorney general in the state
of Missouri to his term as chairman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, to his latest office as a member of the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and...

Whereas, the National Troopers Coalition firmly believes there must
be a fair and equitable Balancing of protecting the right of
society to enforce its laws on the one hand; and the constitutional
rights of the accused on the other, a n d --

Whereas, be it resolved that this assembly body of Troopers, which
represents over 43,000 Troopers and protects more than 200 million
Americans, seize upon this great opportunity to most stringently
support the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to Associate
Justice of the united States Supreme Court.

Now be it further resolved, that a copy of this resolution be sent
to the honorable members of the United states senate/

IACP ENDORSES THOMAS NOMINATION
                FOR qUPBEMff gfflURT

                          N. VA -- Che International Association of Chiefs o£
Polica today announced its endorsement of President Sush's
nomination o£ Judge Clarence Thonas to the United States Suprene
Court.

          lACP's governing body aade the decision after carefully
reviewing the uacxground and professional racord of Judge Thomas
E* one of its regular meetings on August 10 in New XorJc. It was
determined that Judge Thomas is a well-qualified, tough, anti-
criae judge who has recognized the problems that Law enforcement
officers face in combatting crise.

          -he U.S. Senate has already confirmed Judge Thomas four
separate tiaesi as A«*iitant Secretary for Civil Sights at the
Departaent o£ Sdueaticn in 1981. twice as Chairaan of the SECC in
1982 ana 1986, and most recently as U.S. Court of Appeals Judge for
the District Coluabia in 1990. He graduated fron ^oly Cross
College with honors in 1971 and Vale Law School in 1974.

         Judge Thomas has resitted efforts to impose unreasonably

burdensome requirements on the police and prosecutors or to
overturn criminal convictions on technicalities not required by the
Constitution. while guarding against infringements of the
fundasental rights e£ criminal defendants.

        Among his noteworthy decisions! ''
         -- In United states v. Lono. Judge Thosa* rejected arguments
that a trial judge erred in admitting police testimony during a
search of a defendant's apartment, which tended to show that the
defendant wa« dealing in narcotics. Siailarly, in United States
v. aooers. he upheld the adalsaion at trial of evidence of a
defendant's prior drug-dealing activity.
        -- Judge Thoaaa ruled against a defendant who argued that, at
his trial, the judge had improperly instructed the jury as to his
entrapment defense. In so noidlng. Judge Thomas observed that "the
government (had] introduced overwhelming evidence of [defendant's]
eagerness to sell craeK, enougn. we are certain, for the government
to have carried the burden of proof it needed to defeat
[defendant's] entrapment defense." (United States v. Whole)

Dear Senator Thurmond:

The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) wishes to go on record
urging a favorable recommendation by the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding
the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court.

After careful review of the personal and professional background ofJudge Thomas,
the governing body of the IACP has determined that Judge Thomas will prove
himself to be a worthy Supreme Court Justice. His judicial temperament, breadth
of perspective and professional experience indicate he will serve the country
well on the Supreme Court.

Specifically, his record asa judge leads the IACP to believe that he will serve
the cause of law enforcement well. The views of Judge Thomas in United States
v. Long, United States v. Rogers and United States v. Whoie are indicative of
efforts on behalf of law enforcement concerns.

The IACP strongly supports quick action by the Judiciary Committee and the Senate
to confirm Judge The

Sincerely,

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, a bipartisan group of ap-
proximately 35 black attorneys, business people, and community
and religious leaders from South Carolina traveled to Washington
in August and met with me to discuss Judge Thomas. That was in
August when we were in recess. Most of you were at home, but I
was here. They indicated their overwhelming support for Judge
Thomas.

  Mr. Larkin Campbell, an attorney from Columbia, who is a
member of the NAACP, endorsed Judge Thomas' nomination and
stated, "Clarence Thomas is a man who would bring integrity,
wisdom, and foresight to the Supreme Court."

  Mr. Fletcher Smith, a Democrat, an attorney, member of the
Greenville County Council, and a member of the NAACP, present-
ed me with a resolution passed by the Greenville, SC, County Coun-
cil in support of Judge Thomas.

  Several other individuals spoke to me about their strong support
for Judge Thomas. To name just two or three, Ms. Jean Burkins, a
very prominent woman in Columbia, an attorney, and a member of
the NAACP; Rev. Norman Pearson, vice president of Fuller Enter-
prises, also a member of the NAACP; and Mr. James Moore, a civil
rights activist and founder of the Committee for the Betterment of
Poor People. All these people endorsed Judge Thomas.

  I ask unanimous consent that appear in the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection. I hope there wasn't a reason
you weren't able to go home in August. You were welcome, I
assume.
  You are not paying attention. [Laughter.]
  Senator THURMOND. What do you think?
  [The information of Senator Thurmond follows:]

  Mr. Chairman, a bi-partisan group of approximately 35 Black attorneys, business
people and community and religious leaders from South Carolina traveled to Wash-
ington in August and met with me to discuss Judge Thomas. They indicated their
overwhelming support for Judge Thomas.

  Mr. Larkin Campbell, an attorney from Columbia who is a member of the
NAACP, endorsed Judge Thomas' nomination and stated, "Clarence Thomas is a
man who would bring integrity, wisdom and foresight to the Supreme Court". Mr.
Fletcher Smith, a Democrat, attorney, member of the Greenville County, and a
member of the NAACP, presented me with a resolution passed by the Greenville,
South Carolina, County Council in support of Judge Thomas. Several other individ-
uals spoke to me about their strong support for Judge Thomas; to name a few: Ms.
Jean Burkins, an attorney in Columbia who is member of the NAACP; Reverend
Norman Pearson, vice-president of Fuller Enterprises, also a member of the
NAACP; and Mr. James Moore, a civil rights activist and founder of the Committee
for the Betterment of Poor People.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Thomas, we are just about through. I
just want to make two or three remarks to wind up here.

  First, I want to commend you for the outstanding job you have
done during your 5 days of testimony. There have been efforts to
try to get you to express yourself about decisions and about what
position you would take on the Supreme Court maybe. You have
had the courage and the resolution and the good judgment not to
fall for that.

  You have answered many difficult questions with clear, thought-
ful answers. You have shown that you have the intellectual capac-
ity to sit on the Supreme Court. You made a good record at Holy
                                          520

Cross where you graduated and also at Yale Law School, and that
stood you well today.

  The many difficult circumstances you have overcome in your life
have given you common sense to go along with your formal educa-
tion. As Chairman of the EEOC, you showed that you had the prac-
tical experience to handle a difficult position in an exemplary fash-
ion. You did a fine job there in spite of some criticism that was un-
justified. You did a good job, too, at the Civil Rights Education De-
partment.

  Your testimony has also shown that you have the appropriate ju-
dicial temperament and the sensitivity to do well on the Supreme
Court. I believe you will be fair and open-minded and will under-
stand the vast impact your judicial decisions will have on the
people affected by them.

  While you have discussed natural law, you have made it clear
that you will exercise judicial restraint, following the Constitution
and relevant statutory intent. Your record on the D.C. Circuit I
think shows that you have done just that.

  Regarding crime, you have made it clear that you will be sensi-
tive to the rights of victims who must have a say in our criminal
justice system, and that is important, and that you will also be fair
to defendants in hearing their cases.

  In my opening statement, I stated certain characteristics I look
for in a Supreme Court nominee. In my 37 years in the Senate
here, I have had the pleasure of acting on hundreds and hundreds
of judges. And these are the qualities that I think we have to con-
sider: Integrity, courage, compassion, competence, judicial tempera-
ment, and an understanding of the majesty of our system of gov-
ernment, which a lot of people don't seem to understand.

  Judge Thomas, I believe you have exhibited these qualities
throughout your life and during your testimony this week. I am
confident that you will make an excellent member of the Supreme
Court of the United States, and I commend you for the fine job
that you have done for this committee. Good luck and God bless
you.

  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Judge I have some additional questions on expressive conduct,
but observing the expressive conduct of the people behind you,
what I will do is I will submit those to you in writing in the inter-
est of time and to accommodate the witnesses we have to come
after. They will not take a great deal of your time. We will not be
finished with the public witnesses until the end of this week, so
there is plenty of time to answer the questions. There are only
about three or four of them, and I do want to talk about the Barnes
case and a few others that involve expressive conduct. I would ap-
preciate your answering them for me.
  Judge, I appreciate very much your willingness to accept the
President's nomination, and I hope that as imperfect as the process
is--and there is none that I know that is perfect--that you appreci-
ate our responsibility. I thank you for the courtesy you have shown
to this committee, and we will hear from public witnesses who are
both for you, against you, and some who just want to come and ex-
press their concern.
                                         521

  It has been the history of this committee, at least of late, of the
last several decades, to allow groups and individuals of standing to
do just that, and we will finish this hearing, God willing and the
creek not rising, sometime before this week is out. I have no inten-
tion of carrying it over into next week with the public witnesses.

  Then within the next couple of weeks, we will as a committee act
on your nomination, and it will then be sent to the floor of the
Senate for the Senate as a whole to act on the nomination.

  So I appreciate, again, your cooperation during this process. I
thank Senator Danforth and I thank the White House, with whom
you have been working for cooperating in the process. And I most
importantly want to thank your wife, who has sat through all of
this, and your sister, but even more importantly, Mom. It has been
a long, long time to sit there, and this is--a lot of what we talked
about, Mom, is boring, I know. But I appreciate your graciousness
to the committee, and it is obvious your loyalty and devotion to
your son is deep and is real. So I want to thank all of you.

  Judge do you have any closing comment you wish to make to the
committee or to the public or to anyone?

  Judge THOMAS. Just a word or two, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, I would like to thank you for
the courtesy and the fairness that you have shown me through this
process. I am one of those who believes that this process is critical,
and the longer I am a judge, the more important I think this proc-
ess is.
  I would like to thank my family for being so patient and so sup-
portive, and Senator Danforth who said when I was nominated that
we would spend a lot of time together and who has been so wonder-
ful to me. And, of course, I would like to thank the President for
nominating me.
  I have been honored to participate in this process. It has been
one of the high points--indeed, it is the high point from a lifetime
of work, a lifetime of effort on behalf of so many people. This is the
high point.
  Whatever your determination is, I would like to reiterate that I
have been treated fairly, that I have been honored, deeply honored
to participate here. And I am reminded of my reaction in Kenne-
bunkport when the President nominated me to the highest court in
the land. It always gives me goose bumps to say "the highest court
in the land." Only in America could this have been possible. Thank
you all so much for your courtesy.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, let me close your participation by suggest-
ing to you, some have asked why we have not asked certain ques-
tions. Any question that I have failed to ask is only because I be-
lieved it was not relevant to whether or not you could or should sit
on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. And so I
have asked you all that I think is relevant. And you have answered
some, you have not answered some, and you have made your judg-
ments about what you should answer. Again, I thank you for your
cooperation.
  What we will do now, because I know as soon as we break we are
not going to have much order in this room for a moment, so if you
will sit with me so I can announce who comes next so that every-
one will know, we will move from here immediately upon a little
                                         522

bit of order being restored to the caucus room, when it occurs that
you leave, to the American Bar Association which has been tradi-
tional under Democratic and Republican leadership in the Senate.
They are the first public witnesses we hear from.

  Then we will hear from a panel of legal scholars who support
your nomination, and we will see how far along we are this
evening. But, again, it is my intention to finish the public wit-
nesses by Friday. So I want everyone to know that.

  Again, thank you all. Thank you and your family for your coop-
eration. We will recess for 5 minutes.

  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will resume.
  Our first panel is a panel of distinguished members of the Ameri-
can Bar Association, and I would like to welcome them all: Mr.
Ronald Olson, Mr. Best, and Mr. Watkins, all of whom are here to
do as the ABA has done in the past, I don't know for how many
years, give us their best judgment as to the qualification of the
nominee, as they have with all nominees, to the Supreme Court.
  Mr. Olson, I understand you are speaking for the committee, and
I would ask you to keep your statement to 10 minutes or less, and
then the panel of Senators will have questions for you all.
  Again, welcome and thank you for being here.

STATEMENT OF RONALD L. OLSON, CHAIR, STANDING COMMIT-
  TEE ON THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIA-
  TION, ACCOMPANIED BY JUDAH BEST, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
  CIRCUIT REPRESENTATIVE, AND ROBERT P. WATKINS, FEDER-
  AL CIRCUIT REPRESENTATIVE

  Mr. OLSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, hon-
orable members of the Judiciary Committee; I will meet that 10
minutes.

  I would first like to elaborate a little bit on our introduction. My
name is Ron Olson. I am a practicing lawyer in Los Angeles, CA,
and since August of this year, I have been the chairman of the
ABA's standing committee on the Federal judiciary.

  I am accompanied today by two of my colleagues: Mr. Judah Best
on my left, and Mr. Robert Watkins on my right. Both are practic-
ing lawyers here in Washington, DC. Because of their location,
they were the primary investigators on behalf of the committee in-
sofar as the investigation of the Honorable Clarence Thomas is con-
cerned.

  The three of us are here in a representative capacity on behalf of
the American Bar Association committee, and further our commit-
tee on behalf of the legal profession as a whole. I would like to say,
Senator, at the outset that it is a high honor to be here and be able
to participate in this proceeding, and we would like to express our
appreciation for the work of this committee, not only with regard
to this very important nomination, but every nomination to every
Federal court in the land.

  Second, I would like to say that it has been a distinct privilege
for all of us on this committee to revisit the professional creden-
tials of the Honorable Clarence Thomas. With regard to our inves-
tigation, we were requested by the Attorney General of the United
                                         523

States to commence an investigation of Judge Thomas' integrity,
temperament, and professional competence. We did that, beginning
July 3, and we carried it through until August 19.

  That investigation consisted of over 1,000 interviews. We talked
to some 400 different judges, over 300 practicing lawyers, and over
150 academics.

  Our investigation included careful examination of colleagues
with whom Judge Thomas associated at each stage of his career,
from the attorney general's office in Missouri right up to his
present position. We especially concentrated on the work that he
has performed as a U.S. Court of Appeals judge for the District of
Columbia. We spoke with his judicial colleagues. We spoke with
lawyers who appeared before him. We spoke with academicians
who reviewed his opinions.

  The three reading committees that we have identified in our sub-
mission to this committee were especially helpful to us, and I want
to pay particular respect to their work and express appreciation on
behalf of the committee.

  At all turns, Mr. Chairman, we focused on three criteria: Integri-
ty, temperament, and professional competence. In conclusion, a
substantial majority of the committee is of the view that Judge
Thomas is qualified for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The substantial majority concluded that Judge Thomas' integrity is
above reproach, his temperament outstanding, and that he has
demonstrated professional competence sufficient to meet the com-
mittee's qualified standard.

  A minority of two on our committee concluded that Judge
Thomas does not have the depth or the breadth of professional ex-
perience and competence necessary for appointment to the Su-
preme Court. There was one recusal.

  Our rationale, Mr. Chairman, is set forth in a written statement
that we have submitted to the committee. I would respectfully re-
quest at this time that that written statement be received by the
committee as part of the written record of this proceeding.

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be placed in the record without objection.
  Mr. OLSON. Thank you very much.

75 state and over 300 federal judges, 28 federal magistrate
judges, and 29 federal bankruptcy judges. The interviews
included present and former members of the Supreme Court of
the United States, members of federal courts of appeals,
members of the federal district courts, members of state
courts, including those before whom Judge Thomas appeared as
a practicing lawyer, and, in particular, Judge Thomas'
colleagues from the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit.

         Committee members questioned approximately 300 practic-
ing lawyers throughout the United States with special
emphasis on those who had occasion to appear before Judge
Thomas and those who worked with Judge Thomas during his
tenure in the Office of the Attorney General of the State of
Missouri, his employment in the Office of General Counsel of
Monsanto and the office of United States Senator John
Danforth, and his service as Assistant Secretary of
Education, and later as Chair of the Equal Employment
Opportunities Commission.

         Committee members additionally inquired of over 150
deans and faculty members of law schools throughout the
United States, including some 12 professors at the law
school which Judge Thomas attended, as well as
constitutional and Supreme Court scholars.

         At the request of this committee, all of Judge Thomas'
opinions were reviewed by:

         1. A Reading Committee chaired by Rex E. Lee, former
Solicitor General of the United States and presently
President of Brigham Young University;

         2. A Reading Committee chaired by Professor Ronald
Allen of the Northwestern School of Law in Chicago; and

         3. A Reading Committee composed of professors from
Duke University School of Law.1

1. Members of these three Reading Committees who
         participated are listed in Exhibit A to this letter.

Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.

         The results of the reviews of the Reading Committees
were independently analyzed and evaluated by each member of
the Committee. In addition, each member of the Committee
independently selected and read opinions of Judge Thomas.
This Committee also had the benefit of a thorough and recent
investigation of Judge Thomas for appointment to the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The
present Supreme Court investigation, while built on the base
of the earlier work, was substantially expanded and included
further review of Judge Thomas' professional qualifications,
including an analysis of his performance while a sitting
appellate judge.

         While the same factors considered with respect to the
lower Federal courts are relevant to an appointment to the
Supreme Court of the United States, this Committee's
Supreme Court investigations are based upon the premise
that the Supreme Court requires a person with exceptional
professional qualifications. The significance, range and
complexity of the issues considered by the Supreme Court
require a person of outstanding ability. Such exceptional
ability is further demanded by the Supreme Court's extra-
ordinarily heavy docket.

         Because of the foregoing, the ratings employed by the
Committee for Supreme Court nominees have higher thresholds.
The evaluation of "Qualified" for one of the lower federal
courts means that the prospective nominee meets very high
standards with respect to integrity, judicial temperament
and professional competence and that the Committee believes
that the nominee will be able to perform satisfactorily. To
meet the committee's "Qualified" rating for the Supreme
Court is more demanding. The nominee must have outstanding
legal ability and wide experience and meet the highest
standards of integrity, judicial temperament and
professional competence.

         Finally, consistent with the Committee's long-
standing policy, the Committee did not undertake any
examination or consideration of Judge Thomas' political
ideology or his views on any issues that might come before
the Supreme Court.

EVALUATION

Integrity

         Virtually all comments on Judge Thomas' integrity,
character and general reputation were highly favorable.
Many people who know Judge Thomas remarked, as did one
United States Court of Appeals judge, that he is a "good,
caring human being." Those who have observed Judge Thomas
characterize his integrity in extremely positive terms: He
is viewed as an "honest and straight-forward person, always
putting his cards on the table". One litigator, not known
for effusiveness, put it this way: "Judge Thomas has great
personal integrity. He is at ease with himself and others.
He has great self discipline and a strong personal value
system. He is a very good person. I have implicit trust in
him. He would not do anything he did not think was right."
Several judges who have sat with him and have had the
opportunity for close observation regard Judge Thomas "as a
man of the utmost integrity" who has "moral courage."
Indeed, several appellate judges, when addressing the
subject of Judge Thomas' qualifications advised the
Committee they could only "speak in terms of superlatives."
Descriptive terms such as "honest" and "totally open-minded"
appear during the interviews.

         While no one questioned Judge Thomas' personal
integrity, a few interviewees expressed disagreement with
Judge Thomas' interpretation of equal employment laws at
the EEOC and his adherence to existing court orders,
suggesting that those differences raised doubts as to his
professional integrity. The Committee investigated these
concerns and is satisfied that the disagreement over the
interpretation of the law reflects an honest and reasonable
difference of opinion. Those who have worked with Judge
Thomas stated emphatically to the Committee that he "wanted
to do what the law required him to do" and that "[w]hen he
thought goals and timetables were required by the law he
stood up to those who opposed them."

         The Committee, therefore, concludes that Judge Thomas
possesses integrity, character and general reputation of
the highest order.

Judicial Temperament

         While serving the Court of Appeals, Judge Thomas has
consistently been fair and open-minded in his dealings with
his fellow judges and with attorneys appearing before him.
He has been patient in his questioning of counsel and his
questions are focused and to the point. Judge Thomas has
been described as deliberate, thoughtful, "business-like,
judicious and quiet." Some of his colleagues on the United
States Court of Appeals note that he "listens as well as
talks" and "has displayed remarkable equanimity in handling
his oral arguments." He has also evidenced the capacity to
reach a decision efficiently and to defend that decision
politely but firmly. A Reading Committee characterized one
of Judge Thomas' dissents as one of his "strongest opinions
where with civility and deftness of reasoning," he took
issue with the majority's position. He is described as an
"excellent colleague" who is extraordinarily conscientious
and works long hours. The Committee became aware of certain
charges concerning Judge Thomas' management as EEOC Chair
in which his conduct was characterized as being allegedly
"retaliatory." The Committee's investigation revealed these
allegations arose from disputed facts and perceptions and
involved matters that were in the realm of management dis-
cretion. The Committee is satisfied that existing evidence
of Clarence Thomas' appropriate conduct and suitable
temperament as a judge is much more relevant and persuasive
than these few allegations of intemperate conduct. The
Committee concludes that Judge Thomas possesses a highly
suitable temperament for judicial service.

Professional Competence

         To make an assessment of Judge Thomas' professional
competence, the Committee sought to measure his intellec-
tual strength, the breadth and depth of his legal
knowledge, his analytical skill and his ability to
communicate clearly and rationally. The assessment of
these considerations produced the only significant
differences within the Committee.

        Judge Thomas' professional experience to date has not
been as extensive or as consistently challenging as that of
others who might have been available for appointment to the
Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the substantial majority of
the Committee concluded that Judge Thomas meets the
Committee's "Qualified" standard.

        Particularly persuasive to the substantial majority
has been Judge Thomas' performance on the Court of Appeals.
There, he has demonstrated intellect, analytical ability and
writing skills that are well within the zone of competence
for those rated "Qualified" for the Court.

        The Reading Committees support the majority of this
Committee in their evaluation of Judge Thomas' legal
opinions. Thus, as noted by the one of the Reading
Committees:

                "His writing is direct, clear and
                carries the hallmarks of competent
                appellate craftsmanship. His opinions,
                as another member of the committee has
                noted, 'reveal that he is certainly
                intelligent, as well as diligent and
                thorough in his approach to deciding
                cases.' His work evidences broad
                analytical skill and open-mindedness.
                Several of Judge Thomas' opinions
                 (discussed above) contain clear
                indications that he will perform
                competently when given further opportu-
                nities to consider cases of real
                complexity and import."

        Another Committee stated that:

                "A consensus * * * emerged, but we were
                somewhat diffident in expressing it
                confidently because * * * [ejighteen
                opinions over a little more than a year
                is not enough to give one * * * certain
                insight * * * [ · ] In brief, Judge

                  Thomas' writings reflect a highly intel-
                   ligent man, well versed in the technical
                   skills of the law. His opinions are
                   carefully and systematically reasoned,
                   clearly articulated, respectful of the
                   record (so far as we can tell) , fair in
                   consideration of opposing arguments,
                   extensively supported by citations to
                   authority, and demonstrate no obvious
                  bias in decision. * * *

                        In sum, we were collectively quite
                   impressed with Judge Thomas' opinions.
                  We found only one opinion to criticize,
                  and many to praise."

         The last Reading Committee's comments were equally
supportive:

                        "In conclusion, our review committee
                   found that Clarence Thomas has performed
                  capably as a judge on the U.S. Court of
                  Appeals. He has shown no evidence of
                   judicial bias. His opinions have been,
                  by and large if not without exception,
                  well reasoned and well written. He
                  cannot speculate on the basis of the
                  materials we have reviewed how Judge
                  Thomas, if confirmed, would function
                  under the different demands placed upon
                  a Supreme Court justice. Our review of
                  his work to date suggests that his
                   analytic and communicative capabilities
                  would be adequate to that job."

         Additionally, during oral argument and deliberation,
Judge Thomas has been well prepared, attentive, and focused
on the issues necessary for decision while being sensitive
to broader policy considerations, and has challenged
attorneys and fellow judges with questions that were
thoughtful and useful. The Committee finds his opinions to
be clear, direct and thorough. The results have been fair
and understandable to litigants. Further buttressing these
                            531

Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
September 14, 1991
Page 8

favorable conclusions is a wide set of life and professional
experiences. These experiences suggest a special capacity
for personal growth and professional wisdom.

         On the other hand, Judge Thomas' background as a trial
and appellate lawyer has been limited to relatively brief
experience gained immediately upon his entry into the pro-
fession, and very little of his experience as a practitioner
was in the federal court system. His several articles in
legal journals have little analysis, are not particularly
well formed, and, in part, rely upon an undefined reference
to "natural law." Reading Committee representatives and
others found these articles to be "disappointing" in
presentation, content and scholarship. Our Committee noted,
however, that in an interview with Committee members, Judge
Thomas rejected "natural law" as a basis for judicial
decision making.

         The substantial majority of the Committee believes
that these limitations are overcome and outweighed by Judge
Thomas' brief but highly satisfactory performance on the
Court of Appeals. The Committee minority of two, on the
other hand, is of the view that Judge Thomas is "Not
Qualified" for the Supreme Court. They conclude that Judge
Thomas does not have the depth or breadth of professional
experience sufficient to place him at the top of the legal
profession, as is required by the Committee's criteria for
appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States. This
minority believes that Judge Thomas' track record in the
profession does not demonstrate exceptional or outstanding
ability. They further believe that the hope or expectation
that such ability will be demonstrated in the future is
insufficient in the absence of a prior and extended history
of exceptional work in the profession.

CONCLUSION

         Based on all of the information available to it, the
substantial majority of the Committee is of the view that
Judge Thomas is "Qualified" for appointment to the Supreme
Court of the United States. A minority of two rated Judge
Thomas "Not Qualified". There was one recusal.

  The CHAIRMAN. I have no questions. I yield to my colleague from
South Carolina.

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Olson, I want to congratulate you on the fine job you are
doing as chairman of the standing committee on the Federal judici-
ary. You have a very outstanding reputation as a distinguished
lawyer, and I am glad you have two of Washington's finest lawyers
sitting here with you--Mr. Best and Mr. Watkins too--to help you.
  Now, I had a number of questions here, but to save time I am
just going to ask one question. Mr. Olson, does the ABA qualified
rating mean that the nominee has the outstanding legal ability and
wide experience and meets the highest standards of integrity, pro-
fessional competence, and judicial temperament? Isn't that how the
ABA defines a qualified rating? And isn't that exactly what you
are saying about Judge Thomas and that he is an outstanding
nominee?
  Mr. OLSON. That is exactly right, Senator, with respect to the
substantial majority of our committee.
  Senator THURMOND. I have no further questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  This is basically a two-part question. That is, what would have
been necessary for Mr. Thomas to be well qualified in terms of the
American Bar Association's findings?
  Mr. OLSON. The distinction between qualified and well qualified
is admittedly, in our general definitions, less than clear. To reach
the well-qualified standard, one has to be among the very most
prominent members of our profession. Not simply at the highest
grouping, but among the single most prominent members of the
legal profession. And it is that very important distinction that we
made. We made it on the basis of an analysis of Judge Thomas'
performance to date, and I would be happy to elaborate on that if
the Senator cares for it.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, anything you want to add to make the
answer complete.
  Mr. OLSON. I think it is important for the committee to recognize
that we made the finding exactly as Senator Thurmond has sum-
marized it on behalf of the substantial majority. But it is also im-
portant to recognize that while he has distinguished himself in
each one of those three criteria that we have recognized, there
were limitations in his work that precluded the committee from
finding him well qualified. His opinions on the court of appeals
have been very well written, very well documented, very well ex-
plained. He deals with precedent carefully, honestly, and open-min-
dedly. He has been without bias.
  On the other hand, his opinions have been limited in number. He
has not been tested in many of the fundamental issues that the
U.S. Supreme Court will face. He has not had the opportunity to
face questions of first impression. He has not had the opportunity
to deal with important constitutional concepts such as federalism,
separation of powers, first amendment--many others. He has not
been faced with those experiences yet, and therefore has not had
the opportunity to demonstrate them.
                                         537

  That does not mean that he is incapable of doing so. It simply
means that he is untested. But being untested left us with a sense
that he was less than our well-qualified rating would indicate.

  Senator KENNEDY. Finally, what was the basis of the minority
holding?

  Mr. OLSON. The minority view, Senator, focused on the criteria of
professional competence. The minority of two did not reach any
resolution of the other two issues, but they determined that with
regard to professional competence, Judge Thomas did not measure
up with respect to his track record. He had not had the breadth of
experience or the depth of experience to demonstrate in their mind
that he is at the top of the profession.

  They particularly, I believe I am fair in saying, focused on the
mixed writing that we have seen from Judge Thomas. As I have
noted earlier, the opinions that he has crafted on the court of ap-
peals have been highly praised. On the other hand, the writings
that he has done off the court particularly those published in legal
journals, have been generally criticized by a wide range of individ-
uals.

  I think it is that unevenness which was of particular concern to
the minority of two.

  Senator KENNEDY. Just in clarification, the criticism, was that
based upon philosophical differences of opinion or based upon some
other reason?

  Mr. OLSON. It was not based upon philosophy or politics. That is,
as far as we are concerned, outside the parameters of our investiga-
tion, Senator. With regard to the criticisms, I think they can be
summarized very simply. The criticisms of his law journal writing
are simply that they were shallow. They were without--the posi-
tions he took were not well documented and supported, and he
failed to confront and deal with strong arguments on the opposite
side of the issue. They simply did not evidence the kind of scholar-
ship that one would like to see on a regular basis, and they did not
demonstrate the kind of scholarship that he has shown as a judge
on the U.S. court of appeals.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  No further questions, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I will pass for this round.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. I will pass, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a question or
two.
  When you refer to scholarship and you talk about the issue of
wide experience, how much do you look toward a familiarity with
the specific work of the Court as to whether the nominee would be
able to move right in, understand the kinds of issues the Supreme
Court has, to be able to deal with it as an initial matter?
  Mr. OLSON. Let me respond and relate my answer particularly
through our examination of Judge Thomas. Judge Thomas has had,
as the Senator has indicated, a very wide set of life experiences.
We took note of that. We believe that it demonstrates a tremen-
                                         538

dous potential for personal growth and a background for profes-
sional wisdom.

  The experience that he has had on the U.S. court of appeals has
demonstrated his capacity to craft good judicial opinions where he
has dealt with established precedent and applied that in a careful
way to the cases before him. He has been very disciplined in his
approach to decisionmaking, disciplined in terms of the kinds of
issues that he addresses, generally no more than necessary to
answer the case before him, and disciplined in the way in which he
expresses himself, focusing very carefully on the particular statute
or rule at issue.

  What this record that we have reviewed does not have in it is the
very area that the Senator has raised. We have seen very little of
his writing that grapples with the kind of issues that are typically
dealt with on the Supreme Court. There have been very few cases
on the court of appeals that have raised those fundamental issues.
Most of them have been dictated by the precedents already estab-
lished.

  On the U.S. Supreme Court, as the Senator well knows, there are
a lot of issues that come around for the first time. He has had very
little practice dealing with cases of first impression, at least as far
as the written record is concerned. He has had very little practice
dealing with the fundamental constitutional principles that govern
wide areas of conduct. He has had very little practice reaching out
and defining over-arching principles that go across the spectrum of
our Constitution.

  Those are the kinds of things that I think limited our ability--let
me say that differently. Those were the kinds of areas that limited
the rating that was given to Judge Thomas. If he had had 10 or 12
years and 200 opinions on the U.S. court of appeals, I suspect he
would have had a lot more opportunity to practice in that very
basic constitutional area.

  Senator SPECTER. I had some other questions in mind, but that
answer was so complete that you have already covered them.

  Mr. OLSON. Thank you.
  Senator SPECTER. Let me turn to one other aspect of the issue,
and that is on a comparison to the Court. A nominee for the Su-
preme Court attracts a lot of attention, obviously. I have had a
question about a comparison of the current Court, say the Court
with Holmes and Brandeis, are there evaluations made by the
scholars in the field--there is a phase of writings I don't know--
evaluating the current Court? I ask this in the context of Judge
Thomas is going to join a court and his ability to perform may well
turn on the balance of the Court. Has there been any distinguished
writing comparing this Court to other Supreme Courts like the
Holmes-Brandeis court?
  Mr. OLSON. There certainly is and it is ongoing on a regular
basis, and I am going to turn to my colleague Mr. Best in a
moment, but I will refer briefly to one article that was published
recently in the Minnesota Law Review, trying to identify the char-
acteristics of the great Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, trying
to identify the characteristics of individuals, and then see if there
were central characteristics that carried through.
                                         539

  The one that I remember being above all was character, the indi-
vidual character of a Justice was more important than any other
single factor in identifying greatness on the Court.

  I should also say that I think it was Justice Frankfurter who said
that the ability to define greatness for a judge is a very uncertain
art, and I would agree with that.

  Mr. Best I believe may have some further answer to your ques-
tion.

  Mr. BEST. If I may, Senator, I think the same law review article
demonstrated an attempt statistically to determine what was the
best background for a Supreme Court Justice, demonstrated that
there are no hard and fast rules. The character was extremely im-
portant, and the only other factor that came out in the analysis
and discussion was, of course, the question of background, and to
the extent that would be helpful to this committee, it seems that
the analysis of those candidates for the Supreme Court who had
come up, as it were, the hard way, who had scratched and crawled
their way and had made their career for themselves were probably
the greatest of the Supreme Court Justices.

  So, to the extent that that sort of meager sociological informa-
tion is helpful, I offer it to you.

  Senator SPECTER. Any other references on that subject besides
the single Minnesota Law Review article?

  Mr. OLSON. Well, I suppose we could go back to Socrates, he had
a quote or two, and certainly wrote about what it

  Senator SPECTER. I mean about an evaluation of this Supreme
Court.

  Mr. OLSON. I don't have any specifically to suggest at this time.
We would be happy to supplement the record, if the Senator would
like.

  I would make one other statement that I think too often tends to
get overlooked with respect to our Federal judiciary, and that is
the single criteria of integrity. It seems to me it is very easy to
take that criteria for granted, and if you look around at this Feder-
al judiciary that we have had for so many years and, in particular,
the Supreme Court, there has been very, very few breaths of scan-
dal. It is that integrity that I think in my mind speaks directly to
the majesty of the law that Senator Thurmond referred to about
half an hour ago, and I think it is something that this committee
that you represent and, hopefully, our committee and our work
have something to do with, and it strikes me that that has distin-
guished our judiciary here in the United States from virtually
every other judiciary in the world, and it is one that I am very
proud of, and I think when you talk about greatness on the courts
and consistency, that to me is a criteria that is very, very impor-
tant.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. HOW many members are there on the commit-
tee?
  Mr. OLSON. Fifteen members on our committee.

         56-270 O--93 18
                                         540

  Senator HEFLIN. On the issue of reading his opinions, was there a
committee of the 15, or did the full 15 read all of them?

  Mr. OLSON. All of the members of the committee read opinions of
Judge Thomas. In addition, Senator Heflin, we used the services of
three separate reading committees. Two of those committees were
based at distinguished law schools, one at Duke Law School and
one at Northwestern Law School.

  A third group was comprised of practicing lawyers around the
country, and that group was headed by Rex Lee, a former Solicitor
General and currently president of Brigham Young University.
The membership on that committee was comprised of practitioners
who have had active practices before the Supreme Court and had
themselves presented I think somewhat over 100 cases to the Su-
preme Court. They read each one of the writings of Judge Thomas
and reported to us.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU said writings. Was it a different group or
the same group that read his articles?

  Mr. OLSON. The same group.
  Senator HEFLIN. The same group read his articles. Now, were
they articles that were limited to articles that had been published
in law journals?
  Mr. OLSON. Generally speaking, yes. The ones that are found, six
or eight of them, in law journals, Stetson, Howards, and so on.
  Senator HEFLIN. Could you provide us a list of the--I am not
talking about his opinions, because we have all of that--could you
provide us a list of the articles in law journals that were read by
this committee, and if any other writings or speeches or articles
that were published in nonjudicial publications, if you could fur-
nish--in other words, furnish a full list of the articles that were
read. I don't want his cases, but the articles.
  Mr. OLSON. I would be happy to do that, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. That is all.
  The CHAIRMAN. Any other questions before the committee?
  [No response.]
  There being none, thank you, gentlemen, very much for your
effort. I thank the committee as a whole.
  Mr. OLSON. Thank you very much for allowing us to appear.
  Senator THURMOND. I thank you gentlemen for appearing.
  Mr. OLSON. Thank you.
  Mr. BEST. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I indicated that we had two more panels. I
have gotten the order reversed. The next panel of witnesses is a
panel of academic scholars who have expressed either concern or
opposition to the judge, and then we will follow with a panel of
four very distinguished witnesses who wish to testify for the judge.
  The first panel we will call up is Thomas Grey, from Stanford
Law School, who has written extensively about using historical
sources to interpret the Constitution, and also about the fifth
amendment and property rights. Professor Grey was a law clerk to
Justice Marshall from 1969 to 1970, and I believe he is also the
same Thomas Grey that is quoted somewhat extensively by Mr. Ep-
stein in his book. I believe Mr. Grey is here to express concern--I
am not sure, I will let him tell you what he is going to express.
                                         541

  Also, Sylvia Law, a professor at New York University School of
Law, who specializes in constitutional law in the area of personal
and family privacy rights, and I understand she is going to testify
in opposition to Judge Thomas.

  And Prof. Frank Michelman, a professor at Harvard University,
has written extensively on methods of constitutional interpretation
and, in particular, the use of the fifth amendment's takings clause.

  I welcome you all. I would appreciate it if you would be willing
to limit your comments to 10 minutes, as unfair as that is, in the
interest of time. We will be delighted and anxious to have placed in
the record as if read in full your entire statements, if they are long.

  Why don't I begin, unless you have all decided on an order--you
have, well, why don't you tell me what order you have decided on.

  Ms. LAW. I will begin.
  The CHAIRMAN. Professor Law, why don't you begin.

STATEMENT OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF SYLVIA LAW, NEW
  YORK UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL; FRANK I. MICHELMAN, HAR-
  VARD LAW SCHOOL; AND THOMAS C. GREY, STANFORD LAW
  SCHOOL

  Ms. LAW. I am Sylvia Law. For 18 years I have been professor at
NYU Law School and codirector of the Arthur Garfield Hays Civil
Liberties Program. I am also the president-elect of a national orga-
nization called the Society of American Law Teachers.

  Prior to his nomination to the Supreme Court, Judge Thomas ex-
pressed strong views opposing the fundamental right to choose
abortion. Most dramatic was his assertion four years ago that
Lewis Lehrman's analysis of "the meaning of the right to life is a
splendid example of applying natural law." That endorsement of
the assertion that the fetus is a human being, entitled to full con-
stitutional protection, and that Roe v. Wade led to a "holocaust," is
a more extreme position on abortion than has ever been taken by
any Supreme Court Justice in our history, or by any nominee, in-
cluding Robert Bork.

  Judge Thomas' praise of the view that natural law requires an
interpretation of the Constitution that would criminalize abortion
under virtually all circumstances is not an isolated example. Two
years ago, in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, he
characterized Roe v. Wade as "the current case provoking most
people," from conservatives, like himself. Judge Thomas then advo-
cated the use of natural law in interpreting the Constitution, as an
alternative to judicial activism and the recognition of unenumerat-
ed rights.

   These comments were not made in an off-the-cuff political
speech. They were published in an academic/legal journal of Har-
vard University. Those of us who publish in these journals can
attest that the editors scrutinize each idea, word, and comma, to
assure that the author has expressed ideas with precision.

   Judge Thomas' prior statements on reproductive freedom, hence,
distinguish him from Justices Souter and Kennedy. He staked out
a position on these issues that is extremist, that is far outside the
mainstream of conservative American political and judicial
thought. His prior statements demand explanation.
                                         542

  During these hearings, many of you questioned Judge Thomas on
reproductive freedom. You gave him the opportunity to assure us
that he is not, in the words Senator Heflin used in rejecting Robert
Bork, "an extremist who would use his position on the Court to ad-
vance a far-right, radical, judicial agenda." After a week of hear-
ings, we do not know anything new about how Judge Thomas ap-
proaches the core question of women's right to control their bodies,
free from State interference. Indeed, Judge Thomas' answers were
deeply disturbing and raised new problems, including concerns
about his sense of judicial responsibility and his credibility.

  Judge Thomas sought to justify his refusal to answer your ques-
tions about his views on reproductive freedom, saying that "to take
a position would undermine my ability to be impartial."

  By contrast, however, on many issues he expressed concrete sub-
stantive views. He offered detailed analysis of the constitutional
law of exclusionary rules and warrants. He endorsed the Court's
current standards of establishment clause jurisprudence, even
though a case challenging that standards is now pending before the
Court.

  He addressed the wisdom and constitutionality of mandatory sen-
tencing guidelines. I could go on and on. You know he addressed
many subjects in lots of concrete detail. Each of these positions is
controversial. Each involves issues that are or will be before the
Court. On each, he was nonetheless able to offer concrete detailed
views.

  Judge Thomas sought to distance himself from his prior extreme
statements about reproductive freedom by denying knowledge of
them. He said he had only skimmed the Lehrman article before
pronouncing it a splendid example of natural law protecting fetal
life.

  Since his nomination, his endorsement of the Lehrman article
has been a centerpiece of public debate and concern. But Judge
Thomas testified that he did not even reread it in his 10 weeks of
preparation for the confirmation hearings. He testified that he
never read the 1985 report of the Working Group on the Family,
calling for the overruling of Roe v. Wade, even though he had
signed that report.

  Perhaps most astonishingly, despite frequent criticisms of Roe v.
Wade, Judge Thomas insisted that he had no personal memory of
ever having discussed the case, he had no personal opinion about
the Court's ruling in Roe. He said, "Senator, your question to me
was did I debate the contents of Roe, the outcome of Roe, do I have
this day an opinion, a personal opinion on the outcome of Roe, and
my answer to you is that I do not."

  These statements, if credited, reflect serious irresponsibility and
insensitivity. Integrity--consistent truth-telling even when it is un-
comfortable--is an essential quality in a judge. Everyone recog-
nizes that. There is no question that integrity is an appropriate
litmus test for a Supreme Court Justice.

  But if we believe what Judge Thomas has told us during these
hearings, then we must question whether he is sufficiently respon-
sible to serve on the High Court. Why should we assume that he
will bother to read the briefs of the parties or prior precedent, if he
does not even reexamine his own words when they generate enor-
                                         543

mous protest and concern? How can he criticize a landmark deci-
sion guaranteeing women their most basic rights, without having
formulated an approach to the issue that it raises?

  Judicial impartiality did not prevent Judge Thomas from assert-
ing views on many important controversial issues. It did prevent
him from repudiating or even discussing his recent assertions that
natural law gives the fetus rights superior to any woman's right to
make decisions about her own body and life.

  We asked how, as a judge, he would address the question wheth-
er the fetus was entitled to full constitutional protection, he assert-
ed that he would look to precedent, but that he knew no cases that
addressed the issue. It was as though Roe v. Wade did not exist.
Judge Thomas' selective responsiveness and selective memory has
to be disturbing to women and has to be, I submit, disturbing to
this committee.

  Judge Thomas did recognize that the Constitution protects some
forms of unenumerated privacies and personal liberties, particular-
ly marital privacy in relation to contraception. In response to per-
sistent questioning, skilled questioning by Senator Biden, Judge
Thomas reluctantly approved Eisenstadt's holding that unmarried
people have a right to access to contraception. But he repeatedly
returned to characterizing Eisenstadt as an equal protection deci-
sion, and to the right to martial privacy. Clearly, this provides no
reassurance that he would recognize a fundamental right of a
woman to choose abortion. Indeed, Judge Thomas steadfastly re-
fused to acknowledge that the constitutional protection of liberty
or privacy gives any right to a woman seeking abortion. This is a
position that is more radical than that of Justice Rehnquist or Jus-
tice O'Connor, who have recognized some form of liberty or privacy
interest for women seeking abortions.

  No one is asking Judge Thomas to indicate how he would decide
particular cases. Last Thursday Senator Hatch asserted that once
one recognized that a woman possessed a fundamental right, "you
are on the way to deciding most of the cases" involving reproduc-
tive freedom. With respect, I don't believe that is true. The devel-
opment of a standard requires an evaluation of the interest assert-
ed by the woman, the weight to be given to countervailing interests
asserted by the State, and a definition of a constitutional criteria
for balancing these conflicting claims. Even people who agree on
the standard often disagree on its application to particular facts.
And thought about the standard evolves over time. We don't ask
him to pass on particular cases. Rather, we ask whether he repudi-
ates his prior statements, suggesting he would give no weight to
women's claims of reproductive liberty and privacy, or whether he
would attach an absolute value to the protection of the fetus. We
ask that he answer the same types of questions concerning the fun-
damental right to choose as he had no difficulty in answering con-
cerning other constitutional issues.

  On the constitutional issues that matter most to women, repro-
ductive freedom, he stonewalled you and the American people. A
week ago, his prior statements and writings created a presumption
that he was an extremist, an ideologue. He had a burden to over-
come on reproductive freedom, and he failed to do it.
                                         544

  On a practical level, let me just address the argument that con-
firmation of Clarence Thomas would not matter to reproductive
choice because we already have five Justices on the Court willing
to overrule Roe v. Wade. Assuming that is true--and it may well
be--many difficult issues remain. Can States ban abortions when
the woman will die as a consequence? Can they ban abortion adver-
tising or abortion counseling? Can they prohibit women from trav-
eling to States where abortion remains legal? Will statutes enacted
by this Congress be interpreted in a way that is hostile to women's
reproductive freedom?

  The lack of a majority opinion in Webster suggests that a tension
exists amongst the Justices of the Court, a give and take. Adding a
Justice with an extreme antichoice view will influence that balance
and will move the Court even further to the extreme ideological
right.

  The Constitution assigns you the solemn responsibility to advise
and consent. That responsibility is at the core of the Constitution's
separation of powers amongst the branches of Government.

  Over the years, this committee has developed an ability to ques-
tion nominees. Last week some of you made comparisons amongst
the nominees--Bork, Kennedy, Souter. To allow practical politics
to justify approval of a nominee who does not meet your standards
of integrity, responsibility, and commitment to core values of liber-
ty and equality would disregard your constitutional duty.

  Reproductive choice is a basic, fundamental right that is of sin-
gular importance to women. It is entirely appropriate for the
Senate to insist that a nominee offer a reasoned framework for ad-
dressing this fundamental right and to return to confirm nominees
who are not forthright in discussing this core issue.

  Thank you very much.

reexamine his own words when they generate enormous protest and
concern? How can he criticize a landmark decision guaranteeing
women their most basic rights without having formulated an
approach to the issue?

"Judicial impartiality" did not prevent Judge Thomas from
asserting views on many important and controversial issues. But
it did prevent him from repudiating, or even discussing, his
recent assertions that natural law gives the fetus rights
superior to any woman's right to make decisions about her own
body and life. When asked how, as a judge, he would address the
question whether the fetus was entitled to full constitutional
protection, he asserted that he would look to precedent but that
he "knew no cases addressing that specific question." It was as
though Roe v. Wade, which did address that issue, did not exist.
Judge Thomas's selective responsiveness and memory has to be
disturbing to women and to this Committee.

Judge Thomas did recognize that the Constitution protects some
forms of unenumerated privacies and personal liberties,
particularly "marital privacy" in relation to contraception. In
response to persistent questioning by Senator Biden, Judge Thomas
reluctantly approved Eisenstadt's holding that unmarried people
have a right to access to contraception. But he repeatedly
returned to characterizing Eisenstadt as an equal protection
decision, and to the right to "marital privacy." Clearly, this

                                                          6
provides no reassurance that he would recognize a fundamental

                                                                             j

right of a woman to choose abortion. Indeed, Judge Thomas
steadfastly refused to acknowledge that the Constitution's
protection of liberty or privacy gives any right to women seeking
abortions. This is a position more radical than that of Chief
Justice Rehnquist or Justices O'Connor, who have recognized some
form of liberty or privacy interest for women seeking abortions.

No one is asking Judge Thomas to indicate how he would decide a
particular case. Last Thursday Senator Hatch asserted that once
one recognized that women possess a fundamental right, "you are
on the way to deciding most of the cases" involving reproductive
choice. With respect, this is not true. The development of a
standard requires evaluation of the interest asserted by the
woman, the countervailing state interests, and definition of a
constitutional criteria for balancing these conflicting claims.
Even people who agree upon a standard, often disagree on its
application to particular facts and cases. And thought about the
standard evolves over time. Rather we ask whether he repudiates
prior statements suggesting that he would give no. weight to
women's claims of reproductive liberty and privacy, or would
attach an absolute value to the protection of the fetus. We ask
that he answer the same types of questions concerning the
fundamental right to choose that he had no difficulty answering
concerning other constitutional issues.

On the constitutional issues that matter most to women --
reproductive freedom -- he stonewalled you, and the American
people. A week ago his prior statements and writings created a
presumption that he was an extremist -- an ideologue. He had a
burden to overcome on reproductive freedom. He failed to do so.

On a practical level let me address the argument that
confirmation of Clarence Thomas would not matter to reproductive
choice because there are already five Justices on the Court
willing to overrule Roe v. Wade. This may be true. But many
difficult issues remain. Can states ban abortions when the
woman's life is in danger? Can they ban abortion advertising?
Can they prohibit women from traveling to states where abortion
remains legal? Will statutes enacted by Congress be interpreted
in a way that is hostile to women's reproductive freedom? The
lack of a majority opinion in the Webster case demonstrates
tension -- give and take -- among the current Justices. Adding a
Justice with an extreme anti-choice view will influence that
balance and move the Court even further to the extreme
ideological right.

The Constitution assigns you the solemn responsibility to "advise
and consent." That responsibility is at the core of the
Constitution's separation of powers among the three branches of
government.

Over the years this Committee has developed a "common law" of
confirmation. Last week some of you made comparisons among this
nominee, Judge Bork, and Justices Kennedy and Souter. To allow
practical politics to justify approval of a nominee who does not
meet your developing standards of integrity, responsibility and
commitment to core values of liberty and equality, would
disregard your constitutional duty.

Reproductive choice is a basic, fundamental right that is of
singular importance to women. It is entirely appropriate for the
Senate to insist that a nominee offer a reasoned framework for
addressing this fundamental right, and to refuse to confirm a
nominee who is not forthright in discussing this core issue.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Let me point out that you
did exactly what I asked; you limited your comments to 10 min-
utes. I made a mistake, as has been pointed out by my staff and by
the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, in that we had al-
legedly told every witness that they would be limited to 5 minutes
because we have somewhere near 90 witnesses. And my physical
constitution--that is one of the reasons why I would never want to
be a judge.

  Now, having said that, because we gave the first two panels 10
minutes, we will let the next panel as well go 10 minutes. But ev-
eryone else should be on notice from this point on that they are
limited to 5 minutes. That little light will go off in 5 minutes.

  Now, we will not be offended, Professor Michelman, if you get
closer to 5 minutes than 10. But I will not cut you off, and I will
not cut the next panel off either if they are under 10 minutes. But
I would appreciate it if you would make it as short as possible.

  The Senator from South Carolina keeps telling me to tell you
what I have already told you, but I will tell you again. Your full
statements will be placed in the record.

                  STATEMENT OF FRANK I. MICHELMAN
  Mr. MICHELMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I think I
get your message, and I will aspire to comply.
  My name is Frank Michelman. I have been a member of the
Harvard Law School faculty since 1963. That is 28 years there, and
I am proud to say that I have survived.
  What I would like to talk about is the one-issue issue; that is, the
question that has been raised so many times about whether it is
right or sensible for you to give a central place in your delibera-
tions to the nominee's record on the question of abortion rights and
your colloquies with him about that question.
  Let me say first that we have to distinguish between the ideal
and the actual. As an ideal matter, I would agree that there are
strong reasons for striving to keep the process of nominating and
confirming Justices from being used for purposes of packing the
Court with friendly ideologues or with people who you think are
going to decide one or another issue as you would prefer.
  The independence of the judiciary may be in some ways an una-
chievable ideal. It is, nevertheless, a central tenet of our constitu-
tional system. It aims at noble ends. It is an idea well worth rein-
forcing. And it does seem clear that this ideal may be compromised
and eroded by deliberate, sustained attempts at court-packing
through the process of selecting judges. And if that is true, then
that concern certainly applies to your part of the process--that is,
advising and consenting.
  That is the ideal. What about the actual? Well, we all know that
responsibility begins at home, and in this case it seems to me that
home means 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Presidents Reagan and
Bush both ran and were elected on platforms openly avowing a
purpose to pack the Supreme Court with a view to overturning Roe
v. Wade. Many Americans think they have good reason to believe
that Presidents Reagan and Bush have had that plank in mind
when choosing judicial nominees; maybe not in each and every
                                          554

case, but at least as a general policy. Moreover, Clarence Thomas'
particular record of speeches and publications surely gives Ameri-
cans reason to think the plank had a bearing in his selection at
this time, and that impression, I have to say, is not dispelled by the
President's assurance that he simply chose the best qualified
person.

  The trouble with that assurance is that it simply doesn't seem to
be true that Judge Thomas is, by the traditional standards, a
truly--outstandingly a truly exceptionally well-qualified nominee.
By the traditional understandings of qualifications for the Supreme
Court, that would be rich and broad and tested experience as a con-
stitutional lawyer or judge, notable accomplishment, admired mas-
tery of the materials and methods of constitutional law, Clarence
Thomas does not stand out as exceptionally well qualified for the
Supreme Court. And I note that not one member of the ABA panel
has said that he does through the obvious means of awarding
Judge Thomas the highest rating.

  Now, I want to say here that I am one who believes that it is
very proper and desirable to consider in this process the Supreme
Court's representativeness of the American people, and that does
not change my assessment that Judge Thomas cannot reasonably
be called the best qualified person for this job.

  So the question for Senators doesn't arise in the abstract, but in
the actual situation I have described, and I asked myself this ques-
tion: Suppose a Senator comes conscientiously to the conclusion
that this particular nomination really is very hard to explain or
justify by the traditional standards. And the selection, therefore,
seems to have been influenced by the nominee's record of prior dec-
larations regarding a particular issue or set of issues.

  Suppose that a Senator believes that for a President to nominate
on such a basis is no less wrong than for the Senate to grant or
withhold consent on such a basis. How does that Senator in this
situation act effectively and in accordance with that judgment and
that conviction? The only way I can see would be to refuse to lend
his vote for the support of the nomination.

  I have some additional thoughts about the one-issue question--
am I close to the 5 minutes?--that I would like to offer. The ques-
tion often is asked in such a way as to imply that abortion rights
are just one neatly isolable issue among countless similarly isolable
issues that come before the Court, important in its own right cer-
tainly, but still just one bone of contention among many others.

  But that way of thinking involves a serious misunderstanding of
how constitutional law works. Issues of constitutional interpreta-
tion don't come in separate packages like items on a store shelf,
among which we arbitrarily, as fancy moves us, pick and choose. It
is one Constitution that the Justices expound, and interpretations
regarding one topic inevitably, and often unpredictably, intercon-
nect with interpretations regarding others.

  Your colloquies here make clear your understanding of how the
issue of a woman's procreational freedom is inseparable from issues
about contraception, about the privacy of marital intimacies, about
the intimacies of unmarried persons of whatever sex, about family
privacy and self-determination. Rust v. Sullivan unfortunately il-
lustrates how issues of procreational freedom spill over into ex-
                                         555

tremely momentous questions of freedom of expression and uncon-
stitutional conditions.

  What a judge thinks about Roe and how a judge thinks about
Roe is inseparable from how that judge thinks about the whole
tissue of constitutional law. It is inseparable from how that judge
thinks about constitutional liberty, how he thinks about freedom of
conscience, how he thinks about the status and place of women in
our society, and what the Constitution has to say about that, how
he thinks about natural law.

  In our times and circumstances, we cannot fully know how a
judge thinks about those matters if he refuses to engage us in ear-
nest on the subject of constitutional protection for a woman's pro-
creational freedom.

  Finally, let us understand that apart from everything else I have
said, the practical question of abortion rights is very far from being
just one practically important legal issue among many. For many,
many Americans, it is the issue of their lives--and I mean that lit-
erally in the sense of life and death, for the many whose lives or
health would be sacrificed to their pregnancies by some of the ex-
tremely restrictive abortion laws we are seeing, and for many
others whose life circumstances would force them to the back alley
or to self-mutilation as the alternative to Government dictation.

  For many, many more, the procreational choice is the issue of
their lives in the sense in which life means running your own life,
choosing responsibly for yourself who you will be and what you
will do in life, rather than having the Government assign you a
role.

  Mindful of the Chair's request, I think I will leave it at that
point and let others proceed.

            STATEMENT OF FRANK I. MICHELMAN CONCERNING
                   THE NOMINATION OF CLARENCE THOMAS

             AS ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT*

    I am Frank Michelman. I am a Professor at the Harvard Law School.

    I wish to direct some remarks to the litmus-test question. I mean the
question of whether it is right or sensible for Senators to give a central place in
their deliberations to the question of the nominee's stance regarding a particular
issue such as abortion rights.

    As an ideal matter, there is a strong argument against trying to use the
process of nominating and confirming Justices for purposes of packing the Court
with friendly ideologues or with people you think will decide particular matters
in the way you prefer. The independence of the judiciary may be in some ways
an unacheivable ideal. It is nevertheless a central tenet of our constitutional
system. It aims at noble ends. It is an ideal well worth reinforcing. And it does
seem likely that this ideal will be compromised and eroded by deliberate,
sustained attempts at court-packing through the process of selecting judges. The
argument certainly applies to your part of the process in the Senate. That is the
ideal. But it is necessary sometimes to distinguish between the ideal and the
actual.

    * On Monday, September 16,1 testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee
as part of a panel on privacy rights and natural law, composed of law professors
described as "opposed to" or "leaning against" the nomination. I prepared this
statement for that occasion. Through the first paragraph on p. 4, this text is a
close approximation of my opening remarks to the Committee. Time
constraints prevented my saying the rest, although I worked some of it into
responses to Senators' questions. I have submitted the full text for inclusion in
the printed Hearings.
                                      557

   Responsibility begins at home, and in this case it seems to me that home is
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Presidents Reagan and Bush both ran on platforms
openly avowing a purpose to pack the Supreme Court with a view to overturning
Roe v. Wade. Many Americans think they have good reason to believe that
Presidents Reagan and Bush have had that plank in mind when choosing judicial
nominees, maybe not in each and every case, but certainly as a general policy.
Clarence Thomas's public record gives Americans particular reason to think
that the plank has had a bearing on his selection at this time.

    That impression is not dispelled by the President's assurances that he simply
chose the best qualified person. The trouble with that assurance is that it does
not seem to be true that Judge Thomas is, by the customary standards, an
outstandingly well qualified nominee. By the customary understanding of
qualifications for this office -- one thinks of rich and broad experience as lawyer
or judge, and of tested, accomplished mastery of the materials and methods of
constitutional law ~ Clarence Thomas does not stand out as exceptionally well
qualified for the Supreme Court. Let me say here that I am one who believes
that it is very proper and desirable to consider in this process the Supreme
Court's representativeness of the American people, and the diversity of the
Justices' experiences and outlooks. That does not change the assessment:
Clarence Thomas cannot reasonably be regarded as in the running for best
qualified person for the job.

    I ask myself, then, this question: Suppose a Senator comes conscientiously to
the conclusion that this particular nomination is very hard to explain or justify in
terms of qualifications, and that the selection seems to have been influenced by
the nominee's record of prior declarations regarding a given issue or set of
issues. Suppose our Senator believes that for a President to nominate on such a
basis is no less wrong than for the Senate to grant or withhold consent on such a
                                         558

basis. How does our Senator give effect to his conscientious judgments? The
only way I can see is by voting against the nomination.

    The "litmus-test" question is often asked in such a way as to imply that the
issue of abortion rights is just one, neatly isolable issue among countless
similarly isolable issues that come before the Court; important in its own right,
certainly, but still just one bone of contention among many others. That way of
thinking, however, involves a serious misunderstanding of how constitutional
law works. Issues of constitutional interpretation do not come in separate
packages, like items on a store shelf among which we pick and choose as the
spirit moves. It is one Constitution that the Justices expound, and
interpretations regarding one topic inevitably and often unpredictably
interconnect with interpretations regarding others. Your colloquies here make
clear your understanding of how the issue of a woman's procreational freedom
is inseparable from issues about contraception, about the privacy of marital
intimacies, about intimacies of unmarried persons of whatever sex, about family
privacy and self-determination. Rust v. Sullivan unfortunately illustrates how
issues of procreational freedom spill over into extremely momentous questions
of freedom of expression and unconstitutional conditions.

    What a judge thinks about Roe, how a judge thinks about Roe, is inseparable
from how that judge thinks about the whole tissue of constitutional law. It is
inseparable from how he thinks about constitutional liberty, how he thinks about
freedom of conscience, how he thinks about the status and place of women in
our society and what the Constitution has to say about that, how he thinks about
natural law. In our times and circumstances, we cannot fully know how a judge
thinks about those matters if he refuses to engage us in earnest on the subject of
constitutional protection for a woman's procreational freedom.

                                                  -3-
                                      559

    Let us understand, too, that, practically speaking, the question of abortion
rights is very far from being just one important legal issue among many. For
many, many Americans, it is the issue of their lives. I mean that literally, in the
sense of life and death, for those whose lives or health would be sacrificed to
their pregnancies by some of the more restrictive abortion laws we are seeing,
and those whose life circumstances would force them to the back alley or self-
mutilation as the alternative to government dictation. Moreover, that the
question of abortion rights is the question of their lives is true for countless
women in the sense in which life means running your own life, choosing for
yourself who you will be and what you will do in life rather than having the
government assign you a role.

    In light of all I have said, it is entirely legitimate for Americans concerned
about freedoms they hold dear to demand close examination of this nominee's
views about constitutional protection for abortion rights, including frank
discussion by the nominee himself. To ask this much is not to demand a
commitment. There really is such a thing as open-mindedness, and many if not
all of those for whom abortion rights are a chief concern would settle for that.
We do not, in fact, know that Judge Thomas' mind is not fully open on this
matter. The question, however, is whether, on the record before us, it is
reasonable to ask concerned Americans to take it on faith that he has. I do not
see how the record to date can warrant such a conclusion.

    That record starts with Judge Thomas's prior declarations about abortion
and natural law. It indelibly includes his robust commendation, in a prepared
address to a presumably anti-Roeaudience, of an extraordinarily vehement and

                                                  -4-
                                         560

dogmatic attack on that decision as morally and legally outrageous. 1 Judge
Thomas insists now that he conveyed no endorsement of that view. Yet anyone
can see that he plainly did. Had Judge Thomas frankly faced up to this simple
fact, you might have examined with him just how his mind has come to change
since then, and conceivably a fair basis might have been laid for confidence in
his ability now to judge the issues open-mindedly. However, his testimony
denied you that opportunity. Certainly a man is not bound forever by a view he
once embraced, but that is not the question here. The question here is what
inference, if any, to draw from a man's failure to face candidly the plain fact that
he once embraced a certain view, when we are trying to get a sense of how much
of that view clings to his heart and fibre and mind.

    Examined in light of that question, the transcript of Judge Thomas's
testimony to the Judiciary Committee contains disturbing signs. The transcript
shows Judge Thomas refusing to engage with the Committee on the legal issues
surrounding abortion rights anything like as freely as he did on several other live
and controversial matters of constitutional law. The transcript shows Judge
Thomas repeatedly exercising what looks like care to preserve for himself a
doctrinal path to overruling Roe, should it come to be his determination to do
so. The transcript even shows Judge Thomas refusing to grant to Roe v. Wade
the ordinary respect of stare decisis. (For example, in colloquy with Senator
Leahy, Judge Thomas treated as uncontrolled by any precedent the question of

    1. This was not, as been suggested, an isolated statement having no
resonance with anything else Judge Thomas has ever said or suggested. What,
after all, do we make of a published article that first cites Roe to exemplify what
"makes conservatives nervous" about "the expression of unenumerated rights
today," and directly goes on to offer these conservatives a "higher law" theory
designed to counter "the worst type of judicial activism" and "the wilfulness of...
run-amok judges?" (Thomas, The Higher Law Background, 12 Harv. J. Law &
Pub. Policy 63-64 (1989).)
                                     561

a fetus' "constitutional status as a person." The fact is that Roe squarely decided
that question, in the negative, in the specific context of abortion rights.) In a
vacuum of other information, these signs might not carry great significance. We
do, however, have other information. Considered in its light, these signs tend to
augment rather than dispel the indications already conveyed by Judge Thomas's
Heritage Foundation speech, and by his perfunctory dismissal of its significance,
of a predisposition against Roe.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, professor. I do appreciate
it. I realize this is very difficult. You all have so much to offer, and
you made such a trip to get here, and then we say, "5 minutes." I
apologize to you and all the witnesses to come for the limitation,
but I don't know quite else how to do it.

  Professor Grey, welcome.

                     STATEMENT OF THOMAS C. GREY

  Mr. GREY. Thank you, Senator.
  There is statement here which the three of us have signed, along
with a number of other law professors, which really expresses our
views in writing, and I hope the Senators will read it.
  The CHAIRMAN. It will be placed in the record.
  Mr. GREY. I will be short, even shorter.
  Frank Michelman said something of what I wanted to say about
the role of the Senate, and so I will shorten what I had to say
about that.
  I just want to point out the Washington Post editorial that Sena-
tor Thurmond entered in the record, in which they basically en-
dorsed Judge Thomas' confirmation. There is something said there
that I think is wrong. The editorial says,

  It is still pretty widely accepted that a President has a right to choose Justices
who reflect his own philosophical predisposition, and that if the nominee is to be
rejected, it should be on some other grounds, grounds of moral, mental, or profes-
sional disqualification.

  Now, I think that is not the understanding of the Constitution
that most scholars who have studied the nomination and confirma-
tion process have. It is not the one verified by our history, it is not
the one backed up by the original intent, as best that can be ascer-
tained, and it has not consistently been the practice of the Senate.

  The process is a political one. It does not mean that adjudication
is a political process, it means that there is a screen, a political
screen placed before the judges become judges and stop being politi-
cians, in which two kinds of politicians, the President on the one
hand and the Senate on the other exercise their political judgment
as to whether this person should be a Federal judge and, most dra-
matically, of course, a Supreme Court Justice in the case of ap-
pointments to this Court.

  As people have pointed out, these judges and this Justice, if con-
firmed, will serve for a whole generation, the law of the United
States for a whole generation is at stake. It seems to me this body
has a responsibility equal to that of the President in exercising its
independent judgment on whether this person is appropriate for
this job.

  It does not mean that the Senators necessarily should vote not to
confirm any judge they would not have appointed, for that would
be an unworkable system. But it does mean, it seems to me, that
judges should apply the same criteria as the President applies, and
I ask you to consider for yourself what criteria this President has
applied in this and other cases.

   Then, simply as an analogy, I would suggest that Senators might
take essentially the same attitude toward the confirmation vote as
they think the President might appropriately take for the question
                                         563

of whether to veto or approve legislation. The President does not
veto every law that he would rather not have passed. On the other
hand, he considers, in deciding whether to veto, the same criteria
that the Congress has consulted in deciding whether to pass the
legislation in question. I believe that is historically attested and, in
terms of the theory of our institutions, appropriate role for this
body, the Senate, in exercising its checking function against the
President in the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice.

  Now, I am going to move along at that point to the question of
natural law, which Senator Leahy said a lot of people were asking
him in Vermont over the weekend about natural law, and a lot of
people have been asking me, as a law professor, what is this natu-
ral law stuff that they are talking about in the Thomas hearings.

  I do not think the concept is quite as arcane as some have tried
to make it seem. In the simple sense, natural law is simply doing
justice, and there is nothing wrong with the idea that judges are
there to do justice while they apply law. If that is what it means, it
is an idea I think most Senators would endorse, and I would cer-
tainly endorse it.

  It means, in that broad sense, simply the application, the practi-
cal application of human reason to difficult questions of right and
wrong, the application, I would add, in all humility, given what we
know about the limitations of human reason.

  But I think it has frightened some Americans, the idea that
Judge Thomas will be a Justice who applies natural law in adjudi-
cating constitutional cases, and I will come in a moment to his
statement that he will not do so. But the fear that he might do so
is the sense that there is another version of natural law which
lurks there, not necessarily a bad thing, when applied to personal
decisions of individuals about what they think is right and wrong
in politics or law, but not the right attitude for a judge.

  This is the attitude that we see in Judge Thomas' continued ref-
erences to self-evident truths. Now, the Declaration of Independ-
ence does declare these truths to be self-evident, of course, and in
some broad sense, indeed, the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness are perhaps self-evident truths. But I think it is fair to
say that no lawsuit that ever comes before the Supreme Court or
perhaps any other court involves questions the answers to which
are self-evident or which can be deduced simply and dogmatically
from clear, simple, self-evident premises.

  So, the attitude that natural law is something simple and self-
evident is the attitude that I think shows up in some of Judge
Thomas' prejudicial announcements, his speeches and writings. It
is God's law, it is, as he puts it in a number of places, but I will
quote from the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, he says,
at the very end of that article, "Can this Nation possibly go for-
ward, without a science of the rights of man?"

  A science of the rights of man--now, I do not know what that
science is. I do not have access to that science. I believe most Amer-
icans think they do not have access to any science of the rights of
man. They may believe there are rights of man, they may believe
they know what they are, but I think they believe they are matters
of commitment, personal belief, in that general area, not things to
be proved like scientific truths.
                                          564

  The point about this is that belief in that kind of natural law
gives great confidence to the person holding the views that he or
she thinks comes under the natural law. Liberty, there is a natural
right to liberty, the Declaration of Independence tells us so. Liberty
means this, it is clear to me that liberty means this: Liberty means
X, it is written in the sky, it is God's truth, it is the higher law, it
is the brooding omnipresence in the sky.

  It is this attitude brought to the judiciary that, it seems to me, is
inappropriate and is frightening, when joined to the actual views
on public issues, constitutional issues, no less, that Judge Thomas
has already expressed in his writings before coming before this
committee.

  Now, Judge Thomas has said before this committee that, in fact,
he will not apply natural law in constitutional adjudication, or so it
is sometimes thought. But if you go back and look at what he said
on the question, you will find that he does not say quite that. He
does not say simply that natural law is a matter of mere philosoph-
ic musing or political theory. He has said several times that he will
not directly apply natural law, that he will view natural law at the
background for his decisions on questions of what is life, liberty
and property.

  As he put it in the same article, the Harvard article, in discuss-
ing Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, Justice Harlan's
reliance on political principles was implicit, rather than explicit, as
is generally appropriate for Supreme Court opinions. This is what
he said before, and I think this is a version of what he said here,
when he said he does not believe in appealing directly to natural
law. He means that he does not think natural law can overrule the
clear meaning of the Constitution.

  However, it seems clear that he does believe that his convictions
about natural law will inform his views of what the broad majestic
phrases of the Constitution guaranteeing liberty, equal protection,
protecting the privileges and immunities of citizens and the like do
mean, and among those views we know what they are, and my
predecessors on this panel have spoken about them.

  The Lehrman speech is the most striking example. Remember
what Judge Thomas said about that speech, that the right to life,
that the speech was as splendid example of applying natural law to
constitutional question. The article in question said that, from a
right to life sprang the fetus' right to life form the moment of con-
ception. Translating this into constitutional adjudication, into con-
stitutional doctrine means something more radical than any nomi-
nee for the Supreme Court has heretofore proposed, something
more radical than Judge Bork proposed, and he was rejected by the
Senate.

  Basically, implicit, indirect or background use of natural law is
all you need, if you hold the kinds of firm, simple, dogmatic convic-
tions about the content and method of natural law reasoning that
seem to be held by Judge Thomas. It is all you need, if you want to
translate your most deeply-held personal convictions into the law
of the land. Those personal convictions in his case include the
agenda of the relatively far right portion of the American political
spectrum, and I think it would be a great mistake, it would be a
tragedy if the Senate confirmed someone with those views who has
                                         565

implied his intention to implement those views on the Supreme
Court as a Justice of the Supreme Court.

  Thank you, Senator.

 As teachers and scholars of constitutional law committed to the
 protection of constitutional liberty, we submit this report to
 convey our grave concerns regarding the nomination of Judge
 Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the United States
 Supreme Court. Careful examination of Judge Thomas' writings and
 speeches strongly suggests that his views of the Constitution,
 and in particular his use of natural law to constrict individual
 liberty, depart from the mainstream of American constitutional
 thought and endanger Americans' most fundamental constitutional
 rights, including the right to privacy.

Among the most alarming aspects of his record, and the primary
 focus of this report, are the numerous instances in which Judge
Thomas has indicated that he would deny the fundamental right to
 privacy, including the right of all Americans, married or single,
 to use contraception and the right of a woman to choose to- have
 an abortion. Judge Thomas has criticized the Supreme Court's
decisions in the landmark privacy cases protecting the
 fundamental right to use contraception. He has endorsed an
 approach to overruling Roe v. Wade1 that is so extreme it would
create a constitutional requirement that abortion be outlawed in
all states throughout the Nation, regardless of the will of the
people and their elected representatives. Recent Supreme Court

             410 U.S. 113 (1973)
                                      567

 decisions in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services2 and Rust
 v. Sullivan3 have seriously diminished protection for the right
 to choose. Replacing Justice Thurgood Marshall with Judge
 Clarence Thomas would likely result in far more devastating
 encroachments of women's rights, perhaps providing the fifth vote
 to uphold statutes criminalizing virtually all abortions. Such
 laws have recently been adopted in Louisiana, Guam and Utah and
 challenges to them are now pending in the federal courts.

 We submit this report prior to Judge Thomas' testimony before the
 Judiciary Committee in the hope that it will assist the
 Committee, and the Nation, in formulating questions to discern
 Judge Thomas' views on fundamental rights to individual privacy
 and liberty. We urge the Committee to question Judge Thomas on
 these matters and to decline to confirm his nomination unless he
 clearly refutes the strong evidence that he is a nominee whose
 special concept of the Constitution "calls for the reversal of
 decisions dealing with human rights and individual liberties."4

 I. THE SENATE'S ROLE IN THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS

 A basic element of our constitutional system of checks and
 balances is the joint responsibility the Constitution confers
 upon the President and the Senate for the selection of Supreme
 Court Justices. In the words of Senator Patrick Leahy:

         When the Framers of the Constitution met in
         Philadelphia two centuries ago, they decided that the
         appointment of the leaders of the judicial branch of
         government was too important to leave to the unchecked
         discretion of either of the other two branches. They
         decided that the President and the Senate must be equal
         partners in this decision, playing roles of equal
         importance. The 100 members of the United States
         Senate, like the Chief Executive, are elected by all
         the people.5

The Senate's equal role in selecting Supreme Court Justices is

          3 111 S.Ct. 1759 (1991).

widely accepted by Senators of both parties. For example,
Senator Arlen Specter has stated that the "Constitutional
separation of powers is at its apex when the President nominates
and the Senate consents or not for Supreme Court appointees who
have the final word. The Constitution mandates that a senator's
judgment be separate and independent."6

Although the precise wording has varied, a majority of the
members of the Senate Judiciary Committee have indicated that to
be confirmed a nominee must, at a minimum, demonstrate a
commitment to protect individual rights that have been
established as fundamental under the U.S. Constitution. For
example, Senator Patrick Leahy described the standard as follows:

        The Senate should confirm [a nominee] only if we are
        persuaded that the nominee has both the commitment and
        the capacity to protect freedoms the American people
        have fought hard to win and to preserve over the last
        200 years. . . . I cannot vote for [a nominee] unless I
        can tell the people of Vermont that I am confident that
        if he were to become [a Justice], he would be an
        effective guardian of their fundamental rights.7

Senators have often identified the right to privacy as among the
fundamental rights that a nominee must recognize to meet the
standard for confirmation. As Chairman Joseph Biden stated:

        A nominee who criticizes the notion of unenumerated
        rights, or the right to privacy, would be unacceptable
        in my view. A nominee whose view of the Fourteenth
        Amendment's Equal Protection Clause has led him or her
        to have a cramped vision of the court's role in
        creating a more just society would be unacceptable in
        my view. And a nominee whose vision of the First
        Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and
        religion would constrain those provisions' historic
        scope would be unacceptable in my view.8

Senator Herbert Kohl similarly stated:

         [A] Supreme Court Justice must, at a minimum, be
         dedicated to equality for all Americans, determined to
         preserve the right to privacy, the right to be left'
         alone by the Government, committed to civil rights and
         civil liberties, devoted to ensuring the separation of
         Church and State, willing to defend the Bill of Rights
         and its applications to the States against all efforts
         to weaken it, and able to read the Constitution as a
         living, breathing document.9

Although Senator Howell Heflin indicated that he "would favor a
conservative appointment on the Court," for him the question was
"whether this nominee would be a conservative justice who would
safeguard the living Constitution and prevent judicial activism
or whether, on the other hand, he would be an extremist who would
use his position on the Court to advance a far-right, radical,
judicial agenda."10 As Senator Heflin noted, if a nominee's
"concept of the Constitution calls for the reversal of decisions
dealing with human rights and individual liberties, then people's
rights will be threatened."11

Judge Thomas' writings, speeches and professional activities do
not statisfy this standard. They strongly suggest that, if
confirmed, he would interpret the Constitution in a manner that
would dangerously restrict constitutional protection for civil
rights and civil liberties.

The threat Judge Thomas poses to our basic constitutional
freedoms is well exemplified by his views regarding the
fundamental right to privacy and the protection it affords
reproductive rights, including the right to use contraception and
the right to choose to have an abortion. The remainder of this
report focuses on these alarming aspects of Judge Thomas' record.

II. THOMAS ENDORSES A NATURAL LAW "RIGHT TO LIFE" FROM
CONCEPTION

At the core of Thomas· claims to constitutional authority and a
dominant theme throughout his writings and speeches is a belief

that the Constitution should be interpreted in light of "natural
law" or "higher law." "[N]atural rights and higher law arguments
are the best defense of liberty and of limited government."12
"Natural law" is a slippery concept. It has been invoked in
noble causes, for example, in opposition to slavery, gen<5cide and
torture. But it has also been used in invidious ways, for
example, to defend slavery and to deny women the right to vote or
participate in public life. The key questions that must be
posed to a proponent of natural law are: What principles are
dictated by natural justice? How do we know that these answers
are correct?

Despite the central role natural law plays in his professional
writings, Judge Thomas has said surprisingly little about the
specific content of his natural law philosophy. His discussions
of natural law, though numerous, tend to be abstract and
repetitive, often confusing, and sometimes contradictory. Thomas
routinely cites the Declaration of Independence as the primary
source of the natural law values that should be promoted through
constitutional interpretation, and he freciuently refers to a
religious basis for those values.13 Beyond these general
references, he has been remarkably vague about the content of
those values.

One striking exception to Judge Thomas' general failure to
provide specific examples of how natural law should be applied is
his frequent criticism of the right to privacy. One specific
application of Thomas' view of natural law is his enthusiastic
endorsement of the assertion that the fetus enjoys a
constitutionally protected right to life from the moment of
conception. In a 1987 speech to the Heritage Foundation, he
stated:

        We must start by articulating principles of government
         and standards of goodness. I suggest that we begin the
         search for standards and principles with the self-
         evident truths of the Declaration of Independence. . .

              Lewis Lehrman's recent essay in The American
         Spectator on the Declaration of Independence and the
        meaning of the right to life is a splendid example of

          12 Thomas, The Higher Law Background of the Privileges and
 Immunities Clause. 12 Harv. J.L. Pub. Pol'y 63, 64 (1989).

          13 See, e.g.. Thomas, Why Black Americans Should Look to

         applying natural law.
The Lehrman article that Judge Thomas invokes as exemplary of his
approach to natural law argues but one point: interpreting the
Constitution, in light of natural law, as derived from the
Declaration of Independence, requires that the fetus be protected
as a full human being from the moment of conception. Lehrman
states that the privacy right protected by the Court in Roe was
"a spurious right born exclusively of judicial supremacy with not
a single trace of lawful authority," and that even if such a
right existed, it would be overridden by the natural, inalienable
right-to-life of the fetus from the moment of conception.15

This view is far more extreme than that of any current Supreme
Court Justice. The Declaration of Independence says nothing
about abortion or the fetus. Abortion was then legal. An
overturning of Roe premised on the supposed natural right of the
fetus not only would strip women of constitutional protection for
their reproductive autonomy, it would prohibit individual states
or the Congress from allowing legal abortion as an option even in
extreme cases. It would require that abortion be defined as
murder. It would prohibit states from allowing abortion even
where pregnancy resulted from rape or incest or posed grave risk
to a woman's health. It would deny to women as responsible
individuals the ability to exercise their own religious and moral
beliefs concerning abortion.

The Lehrman article does little more than assert that it is a
"self-evident" truth that the fetus possesses an "inalienable
right to life."16 We fear that Judge Thomas' strong praise of
this application of natural law endorses this radical view on the
critical issue of abortion on the basis of an approach to natural
law that relies on fixed and unquestionable moral "truth" rather
than reasoned debate over the application of American
constitutional principles to the circumstances of our times.

Natural law protection of the right to life from the moment of
conception has been cited in recent years by opponents of legal
abortion, such as members of the group "Operation Rescue," in
defense of their actions in violation of laws against trespass,
destruction of property and assault and battery while attempting
to obstruct women's access to reproductive health care

facilities.17 Natural law has further provided a basis for .
opposition not only to abortion, but to contraception by any
means viewed as an interference with "natural" human
reproduction.

III. THOMAS REJECTS UNENUMERATED RIGHTS AS ARTICULATED IN
         GRISWOLD. EISENSTADT AND ROE

The specific content of Judge Thomas' view of natural law can be
seen, not only in the applications he praises, such as the "God-
given" and "inalienable right to life" of a fetus, but also
in the rights and values he rejects. Although Thomas advocates
constitutional protection for natural rights not specifically
enumerated in the Constitution, he repeatedly attacks the
recognition of unenumerated rights under the Ninth Amendment and
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by what he
dismisses as "liberal activist"19 and "run-amok"20 judges.
Most prominent among the judicial opinions that Thomas has thus
criticized are those in which the Supreme Court has protected the
fundamental right to privacy.

For example, in a law review article he published in 1989, Thomas
again selected decisions protecting the right to privacy to
illustrate "the willfulness of both run-amok majorities and run-
amok judges."21 Thomas writes that the judicial decisions that
"make conservatives nervous" are Roe v. Wade and Griswold v.
Connecticut.22 After describing Roe as "the current case
provoking the most protest from conservatives," Thomas affirms

          17 See, e.g. Senftle, The Necessity Defense in Abortion
 Clinic Trespass Cases. 32 St. Louis U.L.J. 523, 546 (1987); City

his "misgivings about activist judicial use of the Ninth
Amendment."23 But, he asserts, his proposed concept of "higher
law" would restrain both legislative majorities and judges, and
should hence appeal to those he calls "my conservative allies."

Thomas has described the protection afforded the right to privacy
under the Ninth Amendment as an "invention" in an opinion in
Griswold v. Connecticut, authored by Justice Arthur Goldberg and
joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William Brennan.
Thomas further criticizes Justice Goldberg's opinion and rejects
"the Ninth Amendment as a source of constitutional protection for
rights that are unenumerated in the Constitution, stating:

          A major question remains: Does the Ninth Amendment, as
          Justice Goldberg contended, give to the Supreme Court
          certain powers to strike down legislation? That would
          seem to be a blank check. . . . Unbounded by notions
          of obligation and justice, the desire to protect rights
          simply plays into the hands of those who advocate a
          total state. . . . Far from being a protection, the
          Ninth Amendment will likely become an additional weapon
          for the enemies of freedom.24

Judge Thomas offers no real explanation in these writings of how
protecting the rights of individuals promotes a "total state" or
how defining unenumerated rights by reference to "natural law" is
either more determinate or less a."blank check" to judges than
more traditional means of constitutional interpretation.

Elsewhere, Thomas described the views on the right to privacy of
Judge Bork and other proponents of original intent as follows:
"restricting birth control devices or information, and allowing,
restricting, or (as Senator Kennedy put it) requiring abortions
are all matters for a legislature to decide; judges should
refrain from 'imposing their values' on public policy."25
Thomas then criticized this view as leading to an "indifference
toward or even contempt of 'values.' Far from being an
alternative to leftist activism, it readily complements it, as
long as a majority approves."26

Although Thomas' discussion of this point is confusing, there is
reason to fear it may be another endorsement of the view set out

in the article by Lewis Lehzman in support of a natural right tc
life for the fetus. Thomas1 discussion of the right to privacy
in the context of arguing that the Constitution must be
interpreted consistent with a particular moral view, and his
expression that this moral view must be employed to constrain
majorities that might otherwise engage in "leftist activism," may
be a further indication that under Thomas' theory of natural law,
the Constitution would not permit states to allow citizens to
have access to abortion or use contraception if these activities
are deemed to violate the natural order of things.

In 1986, Thomas participated as a member of a White House Working
Group on the Family that produced a report on the family that
severely criticized landmark constitutional decisions protecting
the right to privacy. The report went so far as to excoriate a
decision protecting a grandmother's freedom to open her home to
her orphaned grandchildren, without government restriction.27
It particularly targeted cases in the area of reproductive
freedom, and called for them to be overruled.28

In addition to Roe v. Wade. the working group singled out as
wrongly decided the Supreme Court's decision in Planned
Parenthood v. Danforth. in which the Court struck down a Missouri
law that required a woman to obtain the consent of her husband
before she could obtain an abortion and a minor to obtain the
consent of a parent. The report also criticized the Court's
reasoning in Eisenstadt v. Baird. which protects the right of
unmarried individuals to use contraception, and in particular the
Court's statement that "the marital couple is not an independent
entity with a mind and heart of its own."29 The working group
described these, and other cases protecting the fundamental right
to privacy, as a "fatally flawed line of court decisions" and
indicated that they "can be corrected, directly or indirectly,
through . . . the appointment of new judges and their
confirmation by the Senate . . . and . . . amendment of the
Constitution itself."30

IV. THOHAS1 NATURAL LAW THEORY

As we have noted above, Thomas' approach to constitutional
interpretation is highly unusual in its invocation of a body of
natural law.31 Appeals to natural law in constitutional
interpretation do not necessarily portend decisions that would
restrict.the rights of individuals and overturn core
constitutional values. Depending on how its methodology and
content are specifically understood, natural law might point in
various directions. But Thomas' approach to natural law is
disturbing, both as a matter of methodology and as a matter of
content.

As a matter of constitutional method, natural law is disturbing
when invoked to allow supposedly self-evident moral "truth" to
substitute for the hard work of developing principles drawn from
the American constitutional text and precedent. As we have
noted, Judge Thomas has not sought to explain the social and
historical reasons supporting the conclusions to which "natural
law" leads him. The more traditional common law and
constitutional method of open-ended, case-by-case development is
a core strength of the American judicial approach to justice for
a diverse and ever-evolving country. Natural law norms are not
necessarily antithetical to a reasoned, case-by-case approach.
But Judge Thomas seems to invoke "higher law" as a substitute for
explanation. His concept of natural law appears to mean strict
adherence to a perceived set of fixed and undoubtable normative
truths. As such, it does not accommodate the principle and
precedent exemplified in the work of conservative Justices such
as John Harlan and Lewis Powell.

 of innocent human life." Thomas listed the Republican Party's
 position on abortion as the first in a list of conservative
 positions that he believed should attract African Americans to
 the Republican Party. Thomas, "How Republican can Win Blacks,"
 Chicago Defender, February 21, 1987.

          31 For at least the last fifty years, constitutional
 interpretation on the basis of natural law has been conspicuously
 absent from American legal philosophy and judicial opinions.
 Professor Laurence Tribe commented that Clarence Thomas "is the

 law should be readily consulted in constitutional
 interpretation." Tribe, "Natural Law" and the Nominee. N.Y.
 Times, July 15, 1991. As Professor John Hart Ely noted, "[t]he
 concept of [natural law] has . . . all but disappeared in
American discourse." J.H. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 52 (1980).

When natural law was last in vogue some eighty years ago, it-was
employed by the Supreme Court to strike down state laws providing
basic health and safety protection to working people. The Court
asserted a natural law right of employers to be free of minimum
wage laws and health and safety regulations.32 Natural law has
been particularly disabling for women. In 1873, the Court upheld
the exclusion of women from the practice of law.33 Justice
Bradley wrote that the "civil law, as well as nature herself, has
always recognized a wide difference in the respective spheres and
destinies of man and woman . . . . The paramount destiny and
mission of woman are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of
wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator." 4

The impact that the application of natural law would have on core
constitutional principles thus depends on the particular
proponent's personal views of the content and source of the
natural law principles to be applied. It is therefore imperative
that the Senate Judiciary Committee determine with specificity
which fixed principles Judge Thomas has in mind when he advocates
the use of natural law in constitutional interpretation and how
they will affect the Court's role as guardian of American's
fundamental rights. As the preceding analysis indicates, Thomas'
record contains compelling evidence that the substantive content
of his natural law theory is incompatible with continued
protection for the fundamental right of privacy, including the
right to choose.35

V. CONCLUSION

Particularly given the critical moment in the history of the
Supreme Court at which this nomination has occurred, the Senate
should reject any nominee who is not committed to protecting
fundamental individual liberties. We urge the Senate to shoulder
its responsibility to determine whether the nominee "has both the

commitment and the capacity to protect freedoms the American,
people have fought hard to win and to preserve over the last 200
years."36 Our analysis of Judge Thomas' writings and speeches
raises serious questions about whether he meets this standard.
We exhort the Committee to probe these questions and to approve
the nomination only if satisfied that Judge Thomas has the
commitment and ability to contribute to the wise elaboration of
our Constitution.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Let me begin, Professor Grey, with you, if I may. If Judge
Thomas had not spoken about the application of natural law with
reference to the Lehrman article, his views on natural law as
stated would not be particularly out of the mainstream. Would
they at all be out of the mainstream, assuming he had not spoken,
as you characterized, in a dogmatic way?
  Mr. GREY. NO, I think not, Senator. I think a lot of Americans
would affirm their belief
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, not just Americans. There are an awful lot
of Justices who believe that natural law does inform the Constitu-
tion. And there are a lot of people, a lot of Justices who served on
the Court, who share the view that I share, that, at a minimum,
natural law is a basis for a limited government, that our rights
spring not from a document, but spring from other sources, and
that the document represents a document of limited government.
  Correct me if I misstate your concern, but what has you con-
cerned is that you believe or at least have a strong concern that
Judge Thomas thinks there are natural laws writ large in the sky
that are bright lines that should be applied in the area where the
Constitution is not clear on the meaning of some of the majestic
phrases and words like liberty and property and due process, is
that correct?
  Mr. GREY. That is my view quite well, Senator. I think the appli-
cation of natural law has been common in the Supreme Court.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I think the record should show, since Judge
Bork's name has been mentioned, Judge Bork is the absolute an-
tithesis of your concern of what you think Judge Thomas might be.
Judge Bork's entire judicial construct for a way to deal with those
phrases was to go the other route, to suggest that there is only
positive law and there were, consequently, no unenumerated rights
in the Constitution, because they were not positively stated and the
judge could not roam.
  Ironically, in fairness to Judge Bork, he was worried about the
same thing you all are worried about. He was worried about Jus-
tices roaming the landscape and applying their own subjective
judgments to phrases like liberty. I see Professor Michelman is
shaking his head no, and I would defer to him for a whole range of
reasons. I would be curious as to why that is not correct.
  Mr. MICHELMAN. What my head shaking was about--Senator,
you notice that my friend, Tom Grey, a moment ago paid you a
great compliment.
  The CHAIRMAN. He called me a judge. I paid him a bigger compli-
ment when I called him Senator earlier. So we just exchanged com-
pliments. [Laughter.]
  Mr. MICHELMAN. He didn't call you doctor, but he called you
judge.
  Here is what my head shake was about. I think that a part of
what we are concerned about here--and Professor Grey referred to
this---isn't not just a question of judges roaming about and picking
and choosing among their own values as to what they will read
into the Constitution. There is a difference in style and spirit of
constitutional reasoning that I might try to characterize as the dif-
ference between a dogmatic style and a more pragmatic style.
                                         579

  The pragmatic style is the style that sees--tends to see most con-
stitutional cases as difficult, as involving more than one of the
great values that animate the Constitution, as, for example, the
question of abortion rights involves values of life, of control over
one's own life and destiny and one's own physical being, of freedom
of conscience, of the status of women in American society and so
forth. And the pragmatist sees the task of the constitutional adjudi-
cator as figuring out, on the basis of reasoned deliberation and ar-
gument, how best to make all those values effective in the particu-
lar context, and in the example I chose the wrenching context of
abortion. And the more pragmatically inclined constitutional rea-
soner doesn't think you can deduce your way to a conclusion,
doesn't think that you can get the conclusion for certain, just
thinks that after all the arguments are in you have to make a
choice and a judgment and hope that you have done it right, and
keep listening.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, that is what he said to do.
  Mr. MICHELMAN. Well, that certainly is what Judge Thomas' tes-
timony here sounds like. But let me point out--let me first just say
a word about the dogmatic style by contrast.
  The dogmatic style, by contrast, is the style that tends to see con-
stitutional law cases as simple, that tends to look for and find kind
of one master principle whose imminent truth and whose applica-
tion to the case at hand are both self-evident and all you have to do
is go ahead and do it.
  Now, if one was looking for a splendid example of the dogmatic
style of natural law reasoning, one might go to Lewis Lehrman's
article.
  The CHAIRMAN. I get the point.
  Mr. MICHELMAN. If one were looking for another splendid exam-
ple of a dogmatic style, one might go to Justice Scalia's dissenting
opinion in Morrison v. Olson. And what we know on the record is
that Judge Thomas very strongly praised and commended those
two splendid examples of the dogmatic style of natural law reason-
ing
  The CHAIRMAN. And one might look to the writings of your col-
league.
  Mr. MICHELMAN. I am sorry?
  The CHAIRMAN. Or one might look to the writings of your col-
league at Harvard, not at the law school, but--I know you don't
want to mention that.
  Mr. MICHELMAN. But he--the thing that we can't help noticing is
that in the writings and speeches we find Judge Thomas putting
forward such examples, as in my judgment unambiguously putting
them forward as good models for constitutional adjudication.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand your point. I think it is a point well
taken and one that I know I have to wrestle with.
  Ms. LAW. Can I just follow that
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask you a specific question, if I may, pro-
fessor, before my time is up, and then you can answer, including
what you wanted to mention.
  I questioned the judge extensively on Eisenstadt. I will get the
record and make sure you have a copy of it. I don't have it in front
of me at the moment. Although he started off giving me the equal
                                         580

protection answer, I was dogged in my pursuit of whether or not he
agreed with Brennan's reference to a liberty---a fundamental right
found in the liberty clause, the fundamental right of privacy for an
individual. And he said on the record under oath that he did agree
with Justice Brennan's assertion as being what the Constitution
would dictate and require, and that is that an individual had a fun-
damental right to privacy which resided in the liberty clause of the
14th amendment, in addition to giving me the equal protection
answer.

  How did that sit with you? Did you just not believe him or
  Ms. LAW. It was not tremendously reassuring. I mean, his testi-
mony was exactly the same testimony that Justice Souter gave
before this committee. But--·--
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, that is not true. Justice Souter did not
  Ms. LAW. Well, to begin with.
  The CHAIRMAN. TO begin with.
  Ms. LAW. TO begin with. But you, having learned your lesson
with Justice Souter, pressed on and pressed on and pressed on. I
think it was either on the second or third round of questioning that
you finally got him to concede that there was a liberty protection
for single people's rights to use contraception.
  But it was a brief moment there, and then in subsequent discus-
sions he returns again and again to the right of marital privacy as
that is the characterization of the right to privacy. And even in
that brief moment when he is conceding a liberty protection for Ei-
senstadt, it tells us nothing--it tells us absolutely nothing about
whether women have any right in relationship to
  The CHAIRMAN. I wasn't suggesting. I was just responding specifi-
cally to your concern. There is no question about that, that it
doesn't tell us when, for example, one concluded there was a com-
peting life and being and so on. I understand that.
  Ms. LAW. It tells us absolutely nothing, and
  TMhse. LCAHWAIR[McoAnNti.nIuiwnga]s. jTuhstomspaesakisinngotofStohuetesrpeincifitcheissseuneseof-that
Thomas has staked out a position on abortion and has indicated
that he has thought about abortion and needs to address that issue.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I think--well, I understand your position.
  Now, let me ask one last question. The yellow light is on here,
the amber light is on, and I want to go to this question of qualifica-
tion, Professor Michelman. Your assertion that it is clear on its
face that he is not the most qualified person out there in terms of
the traditional methods by which the legal profession, legal schol-
ars, and observers would conclude who would be the most qualified,
the creme de la creme.
  Now, were any of the previous Justices in that position? Would
you put Justice Kennedy in that position?

   Mr. MICHELMAN. NO.

  The CHAIRMAN. Would you have put Justice O'Connor in that po-
sition?

  Mr. MICHELMAN. I can't really answer about Justice O'Connor. I
am not familiar enough with

  The CHAIRMAN. Would you have put Justice Souter in that posi-
tion?

  Mr. MICHELMAN. Probably not.
                                         581

  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate your frankness because one of the
things that has--well, my time is up. I do appreciate your candor
on the part of all three of you.

  Let me yield to my colleague from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I was late. I will forgo any
questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let me just ask the panel generally, given
what--I think you probably answered in these early exchanges, but
given what Mr. Thomas, Judge Thomas has stated about his posi-
tion on the right to privacy prior to the time of the confirmation
hearing, and then also his response to the various different ques-
tions. Do you find that there is a consistency here? How do you
react to those exchanges? Are there consistencies, inconsistencies,
given the wide range of both articles, writings, and his response in
various degrees to the different members here on the right to pri-
vacy?
  Mr. GREY. Just briefly, Senator, I had trouble with his testimony
here that he had not thought about Roe v. Wadeor had not spoken
to other people about Roe v. Wadeor expressed his opinion on that.
It seemed hard to believe.
  Then as far as consistency goes, you know, I think he has equivo-
cally moved toward accepting something that he hasn't accepted
before, as far as we know, which is the right of single people to
have privacy, constitutional privacy rights under Eisenstadt That
question has been discussed already.
  Ms. LAW. On abortion, this was not a confirmation conversion.
There was a substantial difference between his prenomination
statements, which were very critical of Roe v. Wade,and his state-
ments here where he runs away from the issues. There is a way in
which we could feel more comfortable with a confirmation conver-
sion because you might try to evaluate whether it was sincere or
not. But he did not affirm a concern with the core issues of
women's capacity to control reproductive choice in the abortion
context period, no matter what the circumstances. So there is that
consistency, but there is a real inconsistency in terms of his will-
ingness to go to be aggressive in attacking Roe v. Wade.
  Mr. MICHELMAN. A quite obvious inconsistency is that between
Judge Thomas' testimony here that he has an open mind about the
abortion rights question and his prior declarations about that topic,
which we all know about and are in the record and include the
Heritage speech.
  I don't have any problem with a man's changing his mind. I
don't have any problem with a man's saying, I once thought and
said because I thought it was true that Lehrman's article is a
splendid example of constitutional argument with which I agree,
and I have come to understand that it is not and let me explain to
you what was wrong with my prior judgment.
  What to me is troubling--and I want to say this committee invit-
ed, offered to Judge Thomas every opportunity to engage with it in
that kind of colloquy, in serious open discussion about the issues
involved in the abortion rights controversy and about how his prior
views on that topic relate to his present views. And what is baffling
                            582

to me and disappointing and worrisome is that he did not take you
up on it.
And what is especially baffling and troublesome to me is that he
didn't do what I would have hoped he would have done, which
would have been to start it off by frankly facing up to the obvious
meaning and the obvious significance of the Heritage speech and
other things that he had said. That he did not do.

Instead, he said that that speech and those other writings simply
do not mean what to my mind they plainly and incontrovertibly do
mean. That to me is a distressing and worrisome factor about these
hearings.
Senator KENNEDY. DO you think everyone at the Heritage Foun-
dation understood what he was talking about?
Mr. MICHELMAN. I certainly do.
Senator KENNEDY. This is just speculation. Given both what he
has written and what he has stated in response to questions here,
what  would be your prediction of      vw.hWatahdee1w? ould  do  in  a  similar
kind  of factual situation of the Roe
  Mr. GREY. YOU can never be sure, Senator, but with this judge I
would say I would be more confident than usual in predicting his
vote, that he would vote to overrule it and would extend that over-
ruling very far. It is important to see that it is not simply the issue
of overruling Roe v. Wade as such. It is how far you press beyond
that and how you resolve the many difficult issues that would still
remain if Roe v. Wadewere overruled.

  Mr. MICHELMAN. In all candor, there is some real uncertainty
here, but if the question is that I have to stake a bet one way or
the other and my life depends on it, there is no doubt that I am
going to bet that he will vote to overrule Roe v. Wade.
Senator KENNEDY. Professor Law.
Ms. LAW. I would certainly concur with that, and that would be
one vote. I don't think that he is going to get other Justices to join
the position that he staked out prior to his nomination. But as Pro-
fessor Michelman indicated earlier, it all comes up in complex
packages, and it comes up in terms of your right to speak about
abortion or your right to travel for purposes of getting abortions.
And I suspect that in all of those contexts, we would see him as a
voice for a more extremely conservative position than we have yet
seen on the Supreme Court.

Senator KENNEDY. OK. Senator Grassley.
Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I notice that this paper that you have submitted to us was writ-
ten on September 5. I think there are some really inflammatory
statements in here I would like to ask you about.
On page 4: If confirmed, he would interpret the Constitution in a
manner that would dangerously restrict constitutional protections
for civil rights and civil liberties. Then you say this report focuses
upon these alarming aspects of Judge Thomas' record.
Well, I don't know whether you are talking about his record as a
judge or whether you are talking about his record as a policymaker
in Government. But either way, you know, what you say about
Judge Thomas here doesn't appear to me to be the judge that I
have looked at face to face for the last 5 days.
                                         583

  Did you have a chance--well, I shouldn't say did you have a
chance. Did you review the legal opinions written by Judge
Thomas and the 122 other opinions that he joined in? Did these
play a part in your analysis?

  Mr. GREY. NO, not my analysis, Senator.
  Senator GRASSLEY. HOW about you, Mr. Michelman.

   Mr. MICHELMAN. NO.

  Ms. LAW. I looked at some of those, but it focused--the purpose
of this document was primarily to raise questions for the commit-
tee. And I don't have the text in front of me, but when we say
things were alarming, what we are saying is that his prior record
contains a lot of alarming statements that--at that point we are
not condemning him. We are just urging you to question him close-
ly, which you have done. And on many issues, the answers have
been explanatory, and on other issues they haven't been. On other
issues, they have been more disturbing than the prior record.

  Senator GRASSLEY. When a person has served 18 months on the
second highest court in the land and he is going to highest Court in
the land, and he has written 18 to 20 opinions and he has been in-
volved in 120-some, I don't see how if you are going to judge his
competence for being on the Supreme Court or what he might do
there, if there is any fear in his being there, that you could ignore
that.

  Mr. GREY. First off, Senator, it wasn't about his competence. His
competence in the basic sense hasn't really been called into ques-
tion. I accepted the representations made from all sides, both
Judge Thomas' supporters and his detractors, that the decisions he
had been involved with on the court of appeals had not raised fun-
damental issues one way or the other, so that he did not provide a
sound basis for making a judgment about how he would decide the
kind of issues that come before the U.S. Supreme Court which we
are particularly concerned with here.

  Mr. MICHELMAN. It really is relatively rare--it is not that it
never happens, but it is relatively rare for a judge serving on a
court of appeal to face the kind of responsibility for constitutional
interpretation that might be seriously revisory of prior interpreta-
tions or that might be operating in a field in which there really is
no prior precedent, in a way such that a judge's underlying philoso-
phies and values and outlooks could enter seriously into the deci-
sionmaking. A judge on the court of appeals in constitutional cases
in the overwhelming preponderance of cases will find what appear
to be binding precedents from which a judgment can be reasoned.

  That is not true of a Supreme Court Justice. The judicial offices
we are talking about here are two quite different offices. And given
what Professor Grey has said about the representations coming
from all sides, that unsurprisingly in Judge Thomas' 18 months on
the court he hasn't come across a case that really would have put
him to the test in terms of the kind of concerns we raised. We felt
it appropriate to say what we had to say.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, we were concerned at his confirmation
hearing for the court of appeals about his views on natural law,
and he was asked an awful lot about them. We are concerned
about it now. But you were concerned because that is part of--that
is the basis for the paper here. And not once has he touched on or

         56-270 0--93 20
                                         584

used natural law as a part of the rationale for these decisions he
has written. It seemed to me like that would be significant.

  Mr. GREY. Senator, that is my point that I tried to make in my
opening statement; that he has said that he thinks the appropriate
role for natural law in constitutional adjudication is implicit and
pointed to Justice Harlan's dissent in the Plessy case as his exam-
ple. That I believe is what he is likely to do on the Supreme Court,
not say the Constitution says this or the statute says this but natu-
ral law says this and that wins, but rather in interpreting the lib-
erty clause or the equal protection clause or the privileges and im-
munities clause bring to bear his prior stated version of natural
law in interpreting those clauses. And that is what alarms me, and
that is what I fear we will see.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, there hasn't been anything you have
heard from him in the last 5 days that relieves some of that suspi-
cion you have, that concern you had?

  Mr. GREY. Well, in my case, no. He certainly sounds different--
he sounded different here in tone. He sounded very measured, very
different in tone from the speeches. His explanation for that was
that he was speaking as a policymaker then and as a judge now.

  The thing is that he was speaking as a policymaker then about
constitutional questions, about questions of constitutional law, and
to a certain degree a Supreme Court Justice, once confirmed, is
more like a policymaker in terms of the lack of constraint than he
is like a sitting judge who is before a Senate committee scrutinizing
him. So in some ways, the statements as a policymaker or an inde-
pendent political speaker are more revelatory of what someone is
likely to do on the Supreme Court, where there is no recall and
there is no recourse.

  I am not saying I don't believe what he was saying. I am sure he
believed what he was saying. But I think you all must understand
how tempting it is to say what--to come to believe what one
wants--what one knows is expected in a situation like this. It is a
high pressure situation, and I would place more credence on the
long-term record.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Professor Law, you almost suggested a litmus
test on the abortion issue. If he had been right on the abortion
issue, would he otherwise be qualified to be on the Supreme Court,
in your judgment?

  Ms. LAW. That is a hard hypothetical. It is not, I don't think, a
litmus test on any particular issue, certainly not that a person to
be confirmed has to take a particular view in a particular factual
context. But I think it is the case that there are some basic princi-
ples--like, for example, the principles articulated in Brown v.
Board of Education or the principles articulated in Griswold v.
Connecticut--that at this point in our history it is fair to ask Su-
preme Court Justice nominees if they agree with those basic princi-
ples.

  I believe that Roe v. Wade should be added to that list. It is a
precedent that we have had for 17 years. And I am not saying that
a Justice has to take this view or that view or that view. But I do
think it is essential at this point that a nominee be willing to talk
about in the way Professor Grey suggested is the mainstream of
our constitutional adjudication and history, talk about the values
                                         585

and the principles that they would bring to that process of decision-
making.

  I don't, with respect, think that Judge Thomas was willing to do
that on that issue in particular.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, I am done questioning, but from a prac-
tical standpoint, if every Senator with a pet project or pet political
issue or pet constitutional issue we have would expect a litmus
test-type approach from everybody who came before us, we would
never confirm anybody to the Supreme Court.

  Ms. LAW. Senator Grassley, with respect, I don't think basic com-
mitment to racial equality, to gender equality, to core notions of
privacy and autonomy are pet projects. You know, they are--the
Constitution has

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, I think
  Ms. LAW [continuing]. Free speech would be another. The Consti-
tution has a substantive value because it has been given content by
Justices over the last 200 years. And it is legitimate to be con-
cerned about that content.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, with the exception of one or two of the
issues you just mentioned, he has already spoken to those before
this hearing, in support of his view, and would agree in the same
general approach you did of those being very basic and I would too.
But I am still saying--whether it is a 200-year history or some-
thing as recent as 10 years--if every Senator took that view, we
would never confirm anybody.
  I am done.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Just very briefly, and I want to thank all three
witnesses. I will just comment on a point that Professor Grey made
that I think is extremely important.
  In connection with the Washington Post editorial, and the idea
that we should not consider ideology or philosophy, whoever wrote
that editorial was a major in journalism and not history. It is inter-
esting. It is used by both sides. When you have a liberal President,
the liberals say, oh, you can't look at ideology. When you have a
conservative President, it goes the other way.
  But historically, from George Washington's first term on his
nominee for Chief Justice, from that point forward it has always
been a consideration. It was assumed by the Constitutional Conven-
tion that it would be a consideration. Up until the next to the last
day of the Constitutional Convention, the Senate was naming the
Supreme Court, not the President of the United States. We go
through this phrase "advice and consent." We have forgotten total-
ly about the "advice" part of it. And some people want us simply to
rubber stamp the nominee. That should not be what we do. I think
your point is well taken, and I appreciate the testimony of all three
witnesses.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Grey, you refer to the documents which have been sub-
mitted on September 5 signed by a number of professors, including
                                         586

you, and I note there is a comment on page 4, the heading of sec-
tion No. 2, "Judge Thomas endorses a natural law right to life
from conception." My question is: Where does the reference come
from that he views that from conception?

  Mr. GREY. That is what is implicit in his endorsement of the
Lehrman article, his picking up the Lehrman article and saying it
was a splendid application of natural law.

  Senator SPECTER. SO it comes from what Lewis Lehrman said
  Mr. GREY. That is right.
  Senator SPECTER. IS there anything more that you know about to
your contention about Judge Thomas endorsing the Lehrman arti-
cle besides that one line in his speech?
  Mr. GREY. NO, but I think that is a very significant line, Senator.
I think he said--he did not say Lewis Lehrman is a great benefac-
tor of the conservative cause. He said--Lewis Lehrman is a nice
man. We all respect him. He said, "This is a splendid example of
applying natural law theory," and he referred to it in his article
about the right to life, his argument about the right to life. So he
wasn't referring to the abstract fact that he endorsed natural law,
but to the fact that he had applied natural law to the right to life.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, that sentence says, "But Heritage trustee
Lewis Lehrman's recent essay in The American Spectator on 'The
Declaration of Independence and the Meaning of the Right to Life'
is a splendid example of applying natural law."
  Mr. GREY. Right.
  Senator SPECTER. That is the sole basis for the contention that
Judge Thomas endorses life beginning at conception?
  Mr. GREY. Yes, it is. It is the only clear statement that he has
made on that. He has had some other hints, but that was the only
clear statement, I thought.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU say there are other hints?

   Mr. GREY. Yes. His

  Senator SPECTER. What hints?
  Mr. GREY. Well, the reference in the Harvard article on the
privileges and immunities clause to Roe v. Wade as the decision
that conservatives are most concerned with. Now, that doesn't go
nearly this far. That simply suggests
  Senator SPECTER. That doesn't say anything about
  Mr. GREY. From the moment of conception
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. Conception or about natural law.
  Mr. GREY. Oh, yes, it does, because the whole thrust of the article
thereafter is to say that if we apply natural law in constitutional
reasoning we can get past these problems.
  Senator SPECTER. He has written quite a lot on natural law, but
it has been largely in the context of the Declaration of Independ-
ence as a source for eliminating slavery or as a source for the deci-
sion in Brown v. Board of Education. There is a reference to natu-
ral law as it relates to economics. But is there any reference any-
where--Professor Law, you also in your statement refer extensive-
ly, in criticism of Judge Thomas, to the right--to the abortion
issue. Is there anything else in any of his other writings which sup-
ports your conclusion that he would rely on natural law to deal
with the abortion question?
                                         587

  Ms. LAW. I think it is basically a matter of putting together the
fact that he has, in the Harvard article and in other places, criti-
cized Roe v. Wadewith the fact that he--and you are quite correct
that normally when he talks about natural law, he uses the exam-
ple of slavery, which is a relatively less controversial example
today. But it is basically, apart from Lehrman, putting together the
fact that he is critical of Roe v. Wadewith the fact that he is very
enthusiastic and recommends to conservative audiences that we
adopt a natural law approach to judicial decisionmaking in order to
develop a way of approaching problems that conservatives will find
attractive.

  Now, I don't know what that means. Abolishing slavery is not an
issue that is going to bring conservatives--or black people into the
conservative fold or that is going to be attractive to conservatives
particularly. So in terms of a concrete agenda, the place where nat-
ural law has been used in recent years has been primarily in rela-
tionship to the abortion debate, a debate about which he is very
conservative.

  Senator SPECTER. But what you have is the reference that Roe v.
Wadeis the subject of criticism by conservatives, and you have that
single line referring to the Lehrman article, and that is all.

  Ms. LAW. Senator Specter, that is why that letter a couple weeks
ago didn't conclude by urging you to reject the nominee. The whole
purpose of that letter was to say ask good questions because here
are things that we find alarming. And you did ask good questions,
but I don't think you got answers to suit your questions.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, let me ask the question of you again, Pro-
fessor Law. That is all there is. The one statement about being crit-
ical of Roe v. Wade, conservatives being critical, and the single line
about a reference to Lehrman's article. That is the sole basis for
your contention as to Judge Thomas' stand on abortion and natural
law relating to abortion.

  Ms. LAW. Actually, I think the major evidence now is the re-
sponse he gave to you in these hearings. The fact that he was so
forthcoming on so many subjects and so concrete and so detailed
and so utterly unwilling to discuss abortion in response to good
questioning on this committee.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I am familiar with what he said here. I
am just trying to find the basis which is a long statement by you,
Professor Law, and a fairly long statement by a number of people
which is focusing virtually exclusively on the privacy issue, and I
am just wondering if you have anything more to base it on other
than those two statements. And I think I understand your position.

  Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Before I yield to Senator Leahy, I am going to
explain what is about to happen in terms of a vote. Momentarily,
there will be a vote. As a matter of fact, I can hear it coming now
with the beepers, so there will be a vote and it is on an amendment
that as the chairman of the European Affairs Subcommittee, I
have jurisdiction over, and I am going to be required to spend a
little time on the floor after the vote.
  Senator Simon has been gracious enough to agree to chair the
hearing, or Senator Leahy if he is going to stay, whomever, and we
will go to the next panel after this panel is completed, so we will
                                         588

have one more panel tonight. I will try to come back before that
panel is completed. This will be the only time I will have absented
myself from these hearings, but I must be over on the floor for a
moment.

  Now, with that, let me suggest that we go to Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. I will take just 1 minute.
  The CHAIRMAN. Please go right ahead. Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Law, I was not going to really ask any ques-
tions here at all, but I heard reference saying almost in a flippant
way we would just be concerned about why you are concerned
about remarks regarding the Lehrman article on the part of Judge
Thomas, but that was a pretty substantial remark you made,
saying wholeheartedly applauded it.
  I read the Lehrman article. If one were to follow specifically the
arguments made in the Lehrman article, it would make all abor-
tion unconstitutional, am I correct in that?
  Ms. LAW. Absolutely correct, it would constitutionally require
that abortion be treated as murder, whatever the circumstances of
the woman or the desires of the individual State.
  Senator LEAHY. Whether there be rape, incest, whatever it might
be?
  Ms. LAW. That is absolutely correct. I think if you think about a
nominee who cited an article advocating slavery and describing it
as a superb example of the application of natural law to protect
historic rights of property ownership, we would have no trouble in
seeing that as a serious problem.
  My complaint is that I feel that women's reproductive rights,
however they are defined, are being treated as something less than
fully serious.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I might point out, Professor Law, there is prob-
ably no issue since slavery that has divided a nation as much as
this issue has.
  Let me yield now to my colleague from Colorado.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Law, I want to go back to the judge's record on the cir-
cuit court of appeals. My understanding is that he is now joined in
approximately 120 opinions. Can you help us in looking at those
opinions, of those 120 how many would you disagree with the con-
clusion he has reached?
  Ms. LAW. I cannot really help you on that, because, as he indicat-
ed in his testimony here earlier this week or last week, many of
the cases that he was involved in were regulatory technical opin-
ions on which I could not form an opinion, because I am not suffi-
ciently sophisticated in the areas in which--and as Professor Grey
indicated, people studied those opinions with some care and did not
seem to think they were a major source of concern, so I have not
done that detailed analysis myself.
  Senator BROWN. Well, are there any of them which you would
cite as ones which you would be in disagreement with the conclu-
sion?
  Ms. LAW. I cannot think of one, no.
                                         589

  Senator BROWN. Professor Grey, my understanding is that you,
along with Professor Tribe of Harvard, are two of the most preemi-
nent scholars in America, at least in terms of the writing that you
have done on natural law. For me, it is hard to imagine that Stan-
ford would not have the claim on preeminence over Harvard, but
perhaps there is disagreement in the academic community about
that.

  The CHAIRMAN. But not at Stanford, there is no disagreement at
Stanford, is there?

  Mr. GREY. I am speechless. [Laughter.]
  Senator BROWN. YOU mentioned at least a reference to two kinds
of natural law, or at least I suspect there may even be more, but at
least two general approaches to natural law. You described one as
a lurking kind, which I assume would be one that we might deal
with alarm. Could you help us with how you would differentiate
the one that is benign and the one that may be thought of as of
concern?
  Mr. GREY. My colleague Frank Michelman, I agree with what he
said and I will paraphrase it. Basically, there is an approach which
I think has been very widely followed by the great Justices of our
Supreme Court, which is the attempt to develop through reasoned
elaboration a structure of doctrine based on the text, based on the
history and based on the fundamental values, trying to draw these
together in a coherent way, and treating individual cases as tough
problems to be wrestled with in the light of that set of materials,
which includes fundamental values which might be called natural
law.
  Then there is another approach, which treats legal and political
and moral problems like problems in Euclidean geometry, where
there are certain axioms, fundamental truths which are self-evi-
dent, which dictate answers, and that is not--I definitely detect
that tendency in Judge Thomas. It is not unique to him, though it
is relatively rare among lawyers today. I think it was somewhat
common in the 17th and 18th centuries for lawyers to believe or at
least aspire to some kind of deductive geometric kind of legal sci-
ence which could answer all tough questions.
  Senator BROWN. YOU have a concern over someone who views it
as a simplistic answer to legal problems?
  Mr. GREY. That is right.
  Senator BROWN. My few years of exposure to law professors
taught me that nothing is simplistic. I assume, then, that you, in
reviewing his statement that he would not use natural law as a
means of interpretation of the Constitution, that that has not al-
layed your fears or concerns in this regard?
  Mr. GREY. NO. Actually, I found Judge Thomas more consistent
than other people did on this, as I read very carefully what he said
in his writings on the subject before the hearing, which did not--he
said, for instance, the quote that I gave from the Harvard Journal
article, Justice Harlan, who he took as a model, the first Justice
Harlan, his reliance on political principles was implicit, rather
than explicit, as is generally appropriate for Supreme Court opin-
ions, and he went on to say that he would do that, too, that he
would regard him as background or make indirect, rather than
                                      590

direct reference or see natural law as incorporated, because the
Framers believed in it in text of guarantees like the liberty clause.

  My concern was just that once you get it in indirectly, if you
have the kind of approach Judge Thomas displays in his prejudicial
speeches, indirect is enough and implicit is enough to march very
confidently to these very firm conclusions that he tends to reach
about economic rights, about privacy rights, and so on, about color
blindness as the proper approach to racial equality questions,
march very confidently and swiftly to those conclusions, and that is
what disturbs me.

  Senator BROWN. In his 120 or so opinions on the circuit court of
appeals, are there any of them in which you see signs of the use of
this simplistic natural law?

  Mr. GREY. AS I said, Senator, I have not read a one of his opin-
ions. I passed on them, relying on the fact that both his proponents
and his detractors had said that there was no guidance there to be
gained on his constitutional philosophy.

  Senator BROWN. The Bar Association has found, I guess to quote
their standard--and you appreciate that my guess is standards I
suspect are not chiseled in stone, but perhaps may be more flexible
than they appear from paper, but what they say is the nominee
must have outstanding legal ability, wide experience, to meet the
highest standards of integrity, judicial temperament, and profes-
sional competence.

  They indicated, after talking with roughly 1,000 people in inter-
views, 150 deans and faculty members of law schools and 300 prac-
titioners, I suspect that those are cumulative figures, that the 1,000
includes everyone and the others are breakout, in reviewing the
judge's record, do you come to the same conclusion the Bar Associa-
tion does? Do you conclude that he has outstanding legal ability,
wide experience, and the highest standards of integrity, tempera-
ment, and professional competence?

  Mr. GREY. Again, Senator, I have not read the opinions, which
were a big source of their evaluation. I have read his speeches and
I have read his published law review articles, and I thought the
scholarship there was not particularly strong, but he does not put
himself forward as a professional legal scholar, so as far as his
competence goes, I have no strong views.

  I certainly do not see him as a standout nominee, but as a
number of Senators have pointed out, not everybody who goes on
the Supreme Court is a standout nominee, and indeed some people
who have had less than stellar backgrounds have turned out to be
great Justices, so really that part is not something to which I can
really speak.

  Senator BROWN. Am I correct in assuming that the other mem-
bers of the panel do not agree with the Bar Association evaluation,
either?

  Mr. MICHELMAN. I certainly would not try to judge Clarence
Thomas' qualifications on the basis of his scholarship. He was not
primarily a scholar. I think that it is fair to look in his scholarship
and his speeches for indications of the bent of his mind, the tenden-
cy of his thinking, his habits of thought, but I would not look there
to try to appraise that material on some standard of scholarship, to
ask whether he is qualified for the Supreme Court.
                                         591

  I think that in order to gauge this man's abilities, you would
have to look to the walks of life in which he primarily invested his
energies. You have to look to the testimony of those who appraise
his work at EEOC, and in the positions that he held professionally
prior to EEOC.

  If I were to judge on the basis of the testimony here, I would say
that Judge Thomas is a man of considerable ability. I have never
raised a question about that and I would not now. My testimony
was that it is not reasonable to think of him as being in the class
about which one might plausibly say he is the best qualified
person.

  Senator BROWN. Were any of you among the 150 professors that
were consulted by the Bar Association?

   Mr. MICHELMAN. I was not, sir.
   Mr. GREY. Nor was I.

  Senator BROWN. I see that we have got a vote on, and let me just
conclude very quickly with one question. Professor Grey, you had
referred to the standard to be used in selecting or approving or
confirming a nominee for the Court. One of our distinguished mem-
bers is quoted in the Thurgood Marshall confirmation of indicating
that the basis should be on qualifications and not on philosophy. I
take it your feeling is that philosophy should be a part of the con-
firmation process.

  Mr. GREY. Yes, Senator.
  Senator BROWN. I must say I agree. I think philosophy is an ap-
propriate venue, but I wonder, would you think the standard for
the philosophy used should be the standard of the President
making the nomination?
  Mr. GREY. NO, Senator, I think the Senate should exercise
  Senator BROWN. I did not mean to imply that you did.
  Mr. GREY. I am sorry, then I misunderstood the question.
  Senator BROWN. I am saying what standards should we look to,
in terms of philosophy.
  Mr. GREY. It seems to me Senators have to make independent in-
dividual judgment about what they think will be good for the coun-
try, just as I believe the President does, using his political views,
when he decides what nominee should go forward. So, Senator can
be expected to disagree, because they have different views of what
is the proper future direction for the Supreme Court.
  Senator BROWN. Just a couple of quick observations, Mr. Chair-
man, and I will yield back the balance of my time.
  It strikes me, if we have a President who has as different philoso-
phy than the majority of the Senate, we find ourselves in an un-
usual circumstance that is not easily resolved, and perhaps there is
some explanation here.
  It also occurred to me, as I thought about the testimony we have
received, that when Clarence Thomas had clearly indicated he be-
lieves in a constitutionally based right of privacy; two, that my
recollection is that he indicated that he had not agreed with Mr.
Lehrman's conclusions in response to questions brought by this
panel; third, in his discussion of natural law, he specifically indi-
cated that he would not use it to adjudicate the Constitution; and,
fourth, we had as many questions as I can imagine on his attitude
of Roe v. Wade.
                                      592

  I confess that the panel has made some interesting points, but I
do not know how you would forecast this, except to say that the
judge has said very clearly he had not made up his mind.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator SIMON [presiding]. Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much.
  I am going to ask a couple of questions. I think you can answer
them in one word, unless you especially want to explain them. I
have to go and vote in just about 3 minutes.
  First, we will start with you on this end, Professor Grey. Isn't it
true that the theory of natural law does not require that a judge
reject the Constitution, statutory intent or relevant, law?
  Mr. GREY. That is right, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. Professor Michelman?
  Mr. MICHELMAN. The same question, yes, the same answer.
  Senator THURMOND. Professor Law?
  Ms. LAW. That sounds right.
  Senator THURMOND. The second question: Isn't it true that a
judge is bound by the Constitution and statutory law, even if he be-
lieves in natural law?
  Mr. GREY. Right, though he may think natural law is part of
that Constitution.
  Mr. MICHELMAN. The same answer.
  Ms. LAW. And it depends, I mean it will influence his interpreta-
tion.
  Senator THURMOND. He is bound by those, regardless of what he
believes in, isn't it?
  Ms. LAW. Of course he is bound.
  Senator THURMOND. The Constitution and statutory law?
  Ms. LAW. Yes.
  Senator THURMOND. YOU have all answered them favorably.
Thank you very much, and good night.
  Senator SIMON. We thank you very much for being here and for
your testimony.
  Senator SIMON. Our next panel has four distinguished witnesses.
The first is the Honorable Roy Allen, State senator from Savan-
nah, GA; the second is one of the most distinguished Americans,
the Honorable Griffin Bell, former Attorney General of the United
States, now practicing law in Atlanta; the third member of the
panel is Judge Jack Tanner, senior Federal district court judge for
the western district of Washington, in Seattle, Judge Tanner is one
of the founders of the National Conference of Black Lawyers; and
the final member of this panel is Margaret Bush Wilson, former
chair of the board of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
  We are very happy to have all of you here. I am particularly
pleased to welcome Judge Bell, who is an old friend, a long-time
friend, and, as I indicated earlier, one of the most distinguished
Americans. We are honored to have you here any time, Judge Bell.
  Judge BELL. Thank you very much.
  Senator SIMON. Senator Allen, we will be pleased to hear from
you first.
                                             593

STATEMENT OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF HON. ROY ALLEN,
  STATE SENATOR, STATE OF GEORGIA; HON. GRIFFIN BELL,
  FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES; HON.
  JACK TANNER, FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT JUDGE, WESTERN
  DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON; AND MARGARET B. WILSON,
  FORMER CHAIR OF THE BOARD, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR
  THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE

  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman of this committee, 20 years ago, when
I left Howard University and Catholic University, I always felt
that I would return to this lovely city and Capitol Hill. In all
candor, however, I never thought that I would be in this capacity
as a witness in support of a Supreme Court nominee, and even less
for a fellow school mate and altar boy.

  As I sit here in this hallowed room named for one of your former
monumental leaders and my fellow Georgian, I feel the spirit and
presence of such luminaries as the late President Kennedy and
President Johnson, Carl Vinson and Javits and Dirksen and Long
and Bayh and so many others too numerous to mention.

  As I look around this room and see the faces of Senators I have
seen throughout these hearings of men that I have met on the cam-
paign trail who have come to south Georgia, and many of those
faces who belong to legendary families, I must say that at this
moment I must push aside this awe and put in unequivocal
thoughts and words of my support for my friend Judge Clarence
Thomas.

  Since July 1 of this year, many of us who consider ourselves as
friends and associates and/or acquaintances of Clarence, I have
had to read many descriptions of "boy" or Cousy, as we know him,
and I have had to stop and wonder whether the many adjectives
and characterizations of the man we know, we knew, and we still
know are one and the same, and the answer is a resounding no.

  I come here today as the great-grandson of slaves, as a guy who
comes from the soil of south Georgia, a product of the 1950's and
1960's of the segregated South, a lad who watched his daddy teach
school by the day and swept floors and cleaned bathrooms by night.
I could not understand why I had to drink from a colored fountain,
nor could I understand why my dad, with a near A average, could
not go to medical school in Georgia and become a doctor. I could
not understand why mom and dad had to pull over on the side of
the road to relieve themselves, when we passed so many rest
rooms.

   I was bewildered as to why mom and dad referred to some people
as Mr. or Mrs., and those same people called them Roy or Maggie,
but the words of a song still ring true in my ears, and "God moves
in mysterious ways, as one is to perform, He plants his foot out on
the sea and he rides every storm; God is his own interpreter, and
He will make it plain."

  In hearing those who do not know Clarence to try and describe
him, I am reminded of a verse in the New Testament. In Matthew,
when he asked the disciples whom do men say that I am the son of
man am? In response to this inquiry or dialog, they have called
him Elias, Jeremiah, and John the Baptist. But only upon further
                                         594

inquisition, did Simon Peter give the correct answer of who he
really is.

  The boy Clarence Thomas was an intense and serious student, a
voracious reader, a faster than average runner, a basketball player
with such moves that, on the playground of St. Benedict the Moore
Catholic Church, that he was nicknamed Cousy, after the famous
Celtic star.

  Further descriptions of this fiercely competitive guy would reveal
a student and an athlete who just plain hated to lose. Be it at a
basketball game or a spelling bee, Clarence Thomas was a winner
then, and certainly is a winner now, and I am firmly convinced
that the words of Winston Churchill still ring incessantly in his
ears, never give up, never give up, never, never, never give up.

  A notion or a thought that Clarence has forgotten from whence
he has come is ludicrous at worse and speechless at best. How does
one forget drinking from a colored fountain or going to a colored
beach? How does one forget walking by and being unable to use a
first-class park, only because of the hue of one's skin? I can only
imagine that my friend the judge feels the anguish and exaspera-
tion that another great Georgian felt, Dr. King, on April 16, 1965,
when Christian and Jewish clergymen criticized his nonviolent ac-
tivities, while he sat in a Birmingham jail. The very famous letter
that he penned is still a literary work of art.

  Nowhere am I recommending throughout this history or these
proceedings that Judge Thomas should be canonized or recom-
mended for sainthood. Sister Mary Catherine, may God bless her,
would still be surprised to learn that not all of our trips were to
the bathroom in the basement, but jumping the fence to go to Miss
Nora's to buy snowballs and candy.

  The many sisters, Sister Mary Catherine, Sister Mary Chrisus-
tum, Sister Mary Aquinas and so many other Franciscan Sisters of
Newton, MA, were happy that he was faithful as an altar boy in
serving mass, he was faithful in his homework, and he was faithful
as a patrol boy, and he was faithful as a model student.

  Yes, our lives had similar paths and seemingly different results.
Clarence a Republican, me a Democrat, Clarence a Supreme Court
nominee, myself a Georgia State senator.

  Mr. Chairman and other members, his character, his integrity
and his honesty, his intellectual ability and sense of purpose are
unquestioned. The foundations of his childhood place him in the
unique position to one day rank along side such names as John Jay
of the Original Court of 1790, to rank along side Oliver Wendell
Holmes, who brought a deep and abiding faith in America at the
turn of the century, to social reformer Louis Brandeis in 1916, to
Benjamin Cardozo, to William Douglas and to the man he hopes to
replace, Thurgood Marshall.

  Yes, Mr. Chairman, many of us know this man and his potential
for true greatness on this Court, and we will not sit back and let
his good name be criticized. We will never forget the words in the
conversation of Orthello in act III, scene 3, "Who seals my purse
steals trash to something, 'tis nothing, 'tis mine, 'tis his, and has
been slave to thousands, but he who filters from me my good name,
robs me of that which does not enrich him, but makes me poor
indeed."
                                         595

  Second, Mr. Chairman, I focus on Clarence Thomas as an anoma-
ly, or is he a representative voice? I like to focus on those critics,
particularly in the black community who contends that Clarence
Thomas is out of step with mainstream black thought. A number of
these groups came out early on, even before they had a chance to
know this nominee personally.

  Since July 1, the terms "affirmative action, conservative and lib-
eral" have been bandied about, with no true definition of terms.
The Congressional Black Caucus and other so-called black leader-
ship groups have operated like true kneejeck reactionaries, because
they have not come to box in Judge Thomas or to fit him in a par-
ticular mold. Had some of these groups or persons had an opportu-
nity to know some basic historical research, they might have
learned that their seemingly strange views were espoused by such
notable black figures as Frederick Douglas, Marcus Garvey, and
Booker T. Washington.

  They may have been pleasantly surprised that the famed Mal-
colm X was as true disciple of self-help and political and economic
independence. The fact of the matter is, Mr. Chairman, that many
of these standard bearers are still heavily dependent on corporate
largess and they have no true solutions for the plight of these
people and are slow to ingenious and creative thought, regardless
of the political party.

  Many of the leaders conveniently overlook the first major poll by
USA Today, showing that the majority of black Americans are sup-
porting Judge Thomas, not to mention the most recent poll con-
ducted by our own Atlanta Constitution, where black southerners
are supporting this man 2-to-l.

  To you members, I doubt seriously if our Forefathers were
whipped, chained, or murdered, so that all blacks could think alike,
walk alike, talk alike, and act alike. No single individual or organi-
zation has an exclusive lock or insight into the black experience.

  While Judge Thomas has left no clear definitive trail on the
issue of choice or pro-life issues, just a few years ago, many so-
called black leaders were arguing that those who were favorable to
the issue of choice were promoting black genocide. Again, I raise
the question, did the masses change, or just the leaders?

  In the final analysis, a true historical perspective will reveal that
there has never been a monolith of thought of leadership in the
black community. There was Garvey and DuBois, there was King
and Malcolm X, and a newly emerging dichotomy between Gov.
Douglas Wilder and Jesse Jackson. But a lack of monolithic leader-
ship is as healthy now as it has been throughout history. Black
people, like any other ethnic group, can see through shams, spuri-
ous and insincere leaders and programs or the lack thereof.

  In closing, Mr. Chairman, I submit that Clarence Thomas repre-
sents the true American spirit, the true American ethic and ethos,
and should be judged accordingly. The standards by which he is
judged should be no different than the standards used for Justice
Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, and the many others who have preceded
him.

  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for this opportunity to come before
you and to speak of one, not that I heard of, not one that I heard
about, but one that I know, and in no way would I try to denigrate

the work of many organizations who have criticized him, but nei-
ther could we sit back and acquiesce to their false definition of this
man.

   Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I thank you for
this opportunity.

   Senator SIMON. Thank you, Senator.
   Judge Bell, good to have you back here with us again.

                   STATEMENT OF HON. GRIFFIN BELL

   Mr. BELL. Thank you, Senator. I want to thank Chairman Biden
for accommodating my schedule. He is very nice to do it.

   I want to thank you for the opportunity to appear here today in
support of my fellow Georgian, the Honorable Clarence Thomas. I
came to Judge Thomas before he became a judge, when it came
about as a result of his long-time friendship with one of my law
partners, Larry Thompson, who was formerly the U.S. attorney for
the northern district of Georgia. Larry will himself be here as a
witness during these proceedings. Judge Thomas and Larry Thomp-
son practiced law together at Monsanto in St. Louis. That is how
they became acquainted.

   As one who served on the Federal court of appeals for 14V2 years,
I was interested in seeing the evidence of the stewardship and
scholarship of Judge Thomas as a member of the District of Colum-
bia Court of Appeals. I have now read a number of his opinions. I
found these balanced, moderate, scholarly, well written, reasoned,
and careful. In sum, his opinions evidence the highest standards of
judicial excellence.

   I have also heard a substantial portion of the testimony in this
hearing. In my judgment, Judge Thomas has done remarkably
well. Only one who has been interrogated endlessly in such a hear-
ing by a large group of Senators--I speak of myself--some of whom
were even hostile, can fully appreciate the tremendous pressure
and wear that one undergoes in such an ordeal. Surviving such a
ritual with one's character, reputation, good humor, and dignity
intact is a victory within itself.

   Judge Thomas has clearly survived. His character, reputation,
and particularly his dignity is intact.

   I have heard no reason not to vote to confirm President Bush's
choice of Judge Thomas as his nominee to the Supreme Court. He
appears to be a man of balance, unquestioned integrity and inde-
pendence, and generally good character, intelligence, compassion,
and patriotism. I believe that he will uphold our Constitution. I
would trust him with my fundamental rights.

   No one can really know what the sum total of the experiences of
Judge Thomas have been during his lifetime. His experiences have
surely been different from those of us who were fortunate enough
to be born into a favored group. It has occurred to me that his
early life in a segregated, often hostile society has perhaps given
him the patience and courtesy and dignity to withstand the wither-
ing and almost brutal cross-examination to which he has been sub-
jected on occasion in this hearing. I do not see how any objective
viewer or listener could conclude that such a long-suffering and
                                         597

sensitive person would lack compassion toward others similarly sit-
uated or would not favor and advance civil rights.

  I heard Judge Thomas testify in response to a question of why he
wanted to serve on the Supreme Court. He said that he wanted to
give something back for all that has been given to him. He plainly
has all of the objective qualifications and the appropriate personal
qualities. His motive for service is in the highest tradition of our
country.

  I hope that you will vote to confirm Judge Clarence Thomas.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Judge Bell.
  Judge Tanner.

                  STATEMENT OF JUDGE JACK TANNER

  Judge TANNER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I can recall in February 1978 that I appeared before this commit-
tee. Senator Thurmond is familiar to me. I was very unfortunate
before that hearing. As I appeared, Senator DeConcini informed me
that they had just filed disbarment proceedings against me in the
State of Washington. So I am here because of the most intense, un-
precedented, and harsh opposition in the history of this country to
a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States. The attacks
have now also shifted to Members of the Senate. There is no logic
or reason for the attacks, whether it is on the right or the left.
They are emotional attacks based solely upon passion and preju-
dice, neither of which has any relevance to the qualification of fit-
ness of the nominee.

  I am most concerned with the concept of fairness and justice
which are the very foundation of our system of jurisprudence.
These remarks that I am making are my own and do not purport
to represent the view of any other person or organization.

  I am also concerned because I too appeared before this commit-
tee under somewhat similar circumstances. I was the first black
person west of Chicago and north of San Francisco ever nominated
an article 3 judge. I was nominated by Senator Warren G. Magnu-
son, then the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
He formerly was, as several of you will recall, chairman of the
Commerce Committee, the committee where the civil rights legisla-
tion in the 1960's originated.

  My nomination was immediately opposed by certain factions in
the State of Washington. The opposition was led by a local newspa-
per. Senator Henry Jackson, concerned about the nature of the
attack against my nomination, appeared at a news conference in
Seattle and denounced the attack. Senator Jackson said that the
attacks against me "was only because he is black, that if Tanner
was white there would be no opposition to his nomination."

  I think that I should say here and now that not one Member of
the Senate of the United States voted against my nomination at
that time.

  The opponents of Judge Thomas' nomination are concerned that
he might do this or he might do that or that his confirmation will
lead to some ideological shift in the Supreme Court, or that he is
somehow outside the mainstream of legal thinking, yes, and politi-
                                          598

cal thinking in this country, just because they do not agree with
his sense of values of judicial philosophy, whatever it is that might
be. Judge Thomas has sat as a member of the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the District of Columbia for some 19 months now, and his
judicial philosophy is still uncertain and unknown. Yet about 96
percent of the cases decided by that court are final decisions.

  What is certain and known about Judge Thomas is that he is in-
dependent and can't be put into a category. He is just where he
should be. Speculation and hysteria as to what the nominee might
do should not disqualify him from the Supreme Court. After all, no
other nominee has ever been disqualified for such reasons. Judge
Thomas understands very well the rule of law.

  I realize, of course, that there is one obvious difference between
Judge Thomas and the previous nominees to the Supreme Court of
the United States other than Thurgood Marshall. In my opinion,
these groups are saying--and I include all of those groups opposing
Thomas' nomination--that we just do not trust Judge Thomas be-
cause he is a black man. Support for this position comes from the
prevalent view in America, and it is caused by the ravages and
comes from the vestiges of slavery and the infamous black codes
which followed that coloreds or Negroes, blacks or African-Ameri-
cans, if you will, could not be trusted with responsibilities and obli-
gations that affected the Armed Forces, the judicial, political,
social, and educational institutions of America. They could not be
trusted to fight in the many wars of this country, although they
did so and with courage and valor. And so it stood to reason they
could not be trusted with the life, liberty, and property of white
Americans.

  In 1949, President Harry Truman appointed for the first time in
the history of the United States the first article 3 black judge. He
appointed William Hastings to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
In 1955, the Supreme Court of the United States handed down the
opinion of Brown v. Board of Education, perhaps the greatest deci-
sion ever handed down by the Supreme Court of the United States
at any time in our history. Thurgood Marshall was rewarded for
his great victory in that case when President Lyndon Johnson
nominated him to the Supreme Court of the United States. Once
again it had been recognized by the country that the black man
could be trusted.

  In 1991, the United States went to war in the Middle East. The
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces of the
United States was one Colin Powell, then a four-star general and a
black man as well. President Bush, as Commander in Chief of the
Armed Forces, trusted the integrity, loyalty, training, and experi-
ence of General Powell. He was, in fact, entrusting the security of
the United States to a black man. History will show that trust was
well placed. It is my judgment that history will repeat itself and
one day show that President Bush, the first Republican President
to ever do so, was right in entrusting to a black man the job of
safeguarding the life, liberty, and property of all Americans by
nominating Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the
United States.

  Judge Thomas is just as well qualified to become an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court as were the 103 white males, 1 black
                                             599

male, and 1 white woman who have heretofore come before this
body for advise and consent. In fact, because he had the black expe-
rience in his life, he is perhaps the better qualified than all but two
members of the Supreme Court.

  This committee can believe the President of the United States
when he says that Judge Thomas is the best man for the job. Just
because he happens to be a black man does not disqualify him, nor
should it by any test or criteria. It has only happened twice in our
history that a black man has been nominated. It is highly doubtful
that any of us in this room will see it happen again.

  It is my judgment that there are a great number of Americans
out there, and, yes, there are people throughout the world, who are
watching this great drama unfold. It is also my judgment that the
great majority of those Americans, white, black, brown, yellow, and
red and of all religions and faith, want to see Judge Thomas sitting
as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.
They want to see fair play and justice done to this man. They want
to be able to point to this man and say to their children that they
too can aspire to the highest Court in the land, that they too can
expect fairness and justice, and they too can put their hopes and
dreams in America where the rule of law and not of man reigns
supreme.

  In conclusion, let me say to the members of the committee, no
President of the United States, whether he is Republican or Demo-
crat, has ever or will ever appoint a black man or a black woman
to the highest Court of the United States unless that person is well,
well qualified. Despite the vicious, unwarranted, and unprecedent-
ed attacks upon the nominee, he still stands tall. He has exhibited
more than just plain character while under fire. This black man
has exhibited sheer guts and will power above and beyond the call
of duty to his country. He has displayed courage and valor in the
face of the bitter criticism and abuse heaped upon him. Such valor
and courage in the time of war is rewarded in the armed services
of the United States by award of the Congressional Medal of
Honor. What could be a greater test of character than that dis-
played by the nominee before this committee?

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Senator SIMON. Thank you, Judge Tanner.
   Margaret Bush Wilson, whom I have known back from the days
when she was considered a radical. Happy to have you here, Mrs.
Wilson.

               STATEMENT OF MARGARET BUSH WILSON

   Ms. WILSON. Thank you, Senator. I have to apologize for this
voice. I have had some thyroid surgery, and it has affected my
vocal cords. Some of my colleagues say it is a good idea that I can't
talk. [Laughter.]

   I have prepared a written statement which I trust that all mem-
bers of the committee will receive, if they have not already. I pro-
pose not to

   Senator SIMON. We will put the statement in the record, and I
assume someone has it. I do not have a copy of it right here.
                                         600

  Ms. WILSON. I would hope that it would be in the record and
therefore I can just speak briefly from it.

  I think it is most appropriate that your questions probe, as many
of you have done, the fundamental character of the man, Clarence
Thomas, and how he thinks about and analyzes issues. It seems to
me that that, more than anything else, is the critical thing that
this committee must address, rather than his specific views on spe-
cific issues, because how he thinks about and analyzes issues will
determine what kind of Justice he will be in the first third of the
20th century, what kind of Justice he will be as he deals with the
problems, the like of which none of us in this room can even imag-
ine, much less frame questions about.

  With that in mind, maybe I can help the committee in a small
way to understand who Clarence Thomas is. I make this offer in
part because, at least to some degree, the Judge Thomas I have
been reading and hearing about is not the Judge Thomas I know.

  I would like you to go back with me to the spring of 1974.One
afternoon I was seated next to the then attorney general of the
State of Missouri, who is now my distinguished senior Senator from
Missouri, John Danforth. We were at a luncheon at some public
event, and he said to me during the table conversation, "I have a
bright young man whom I would like you to get to know. I am in-
viting him out to be on my staff. He is a graduate of Yale, and he
will be coming out to the State to be on my staff."

  I said, "Well, that is fine." And then he added, "And he is
black." And I said, "Well, that is great." Then he said to me, "Do
you happen to know a place where he can live? I don't think Jeffer-
son City is the most exciting place in the world to spend the
summer." It just so happened that my own son, who was in law
school, had just told me a few weeks before that he wasn't coming
home for the summer, and so almost on impulse, I said to Senator
Danforth, "Yes, I do." He said, "Well, where is that?" I said, "In
my own home."

  And so some 2 months later, one sunny afternoon I think toward
the end of May or the first of June, my doorbell rang, and at the
door was a striking young man. And he said to me, "My name is
Clarence Thomas," and I replied, "Yes, I know. I have been expect-
ing you."

  Then for 2 months, Clarence Thomas lived in my home as my
guest. And I think members of the committee and members of the
panel and everybody in this room knows, if somebody stays in your
home longer than a week, you get to know a lot about them as a
person. You know something about their values, something about
their character. And so I have this unique insight at a time in
young Clarence's life when the least thing he expected was to be a
nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.

  I want to tell you several things about him that I observed: One,
that he was a very disciplined person. I can't recall a young person
who seemed to have clearly in mind what he wanted to do and
then proceeded to do it. He was up every morning doing his exer-
cises with my son's weights. He did have one fault, though. He
started out with the weights up in my bedroom, and I had to stop
that and bring them downstairs.
                                         601

  After that, he went off to study, and he spent the day with the
books. I made only one requirement: Be home in time for dinner.
And he kept his promise. He would come home for dinner.

  That is when I got to know something about Clarence Thomas,
because these meals were the give and take of a family of folks
who like to talk about what was going on in the day-to-day life of
this country. And I must say we had some lively discussions with
Clarence Thomas, because he then was very, very stubborn about
his views and not willing to accept anything on face value.

  We didn't always agree, but I was impressed with this young
man's ability to analyze, his insights, and his own sense that he
had to think things through for himself.

  So I can tell you that Clarence Thomas is a man of good moral
character. He is disciplined. He has a very keen mind. He is, con-
trary to what I have been hearing today, in my judgment a scholar.
And I think he will be a scholar on this Court.

  He has been busy at different levels of Government where the
scholarship and the ability to do that has been limited. I think the
Supreme Court experience will open for this young man vistas that
he has not yet displayed because he does have the fundamental
keen intellect which I think is so essential for this Court.

  The day he left he asked me how much he owed me. I said to
him, "Clarence, you don't owe me a thing. But I do want you to
make a promise. I want you to promise as you move through your
career that if you are ever in a position to reach out and help
somebody, like I have helped you, that you will do that." And he
made that promise, and I am convinced that he has been keeping
his word ever since.

  Now, across the years I have been keeping in touch with him. I
respect his integrity, his legal mind, and his determination. I have
found him to be sensitive and compassionate, doing what he be-
lieves is right and working to make the world a better place in
which to live.

  Mr. Chairman, I want to speak to a comment and to the ques-
tions which were directed by Senator Kennedy--and I am sorry he
is not here. But I want to provide an insight, in view of Senator
Kennedy's probing and important comments and questions this
morning.

  Clarence Thomas I suspect was as impatient as I am now with
the progress in addressing some of the fundamental problems of
people who are deprived in this Nation, and particularly the prob-
lems that confronted one-third of our American citizens who are of
African descent and who are still poor. Some of us have mastered
the art of disagreeing without trashing anyone or any institution.
Perhaps in the past in his younger days, Judge Thomas was impoli-
tic in some of the things he said. But I think you and I will agree
that Judge Thomas has now mastered the art of disagreeing with-
out being disagreeable, that he has demonstrated this especially
well in these hearings.

  I trust that organizations which have expressed opposition to
Judge Thomas have watched his comments and his demeanor in
these sessions and are willing to temper their views. Some of them
have urged that you reject his nomination. I hope that they will
reconsider. Some of his critics have said that despite Judge
                                               602

Thomas' chairmanship of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission for 8 years, he does not champion the cause of civil
rights. But they obviously don't know him or the real facts about
his tenure on the EEOC. And I have been particularly pleased that
some members of this committee have placed in the record docu-
mentation

  Senator SIMON. If you can conclude your remarks, Mrs. Wilson.
  Ms. WILSON. Yes. I think I can conclude them by saying, Mr.
Chairman, that I strongly support Clarence Thomas. I think he has
the temperament, the background, and I appreciate this opportuni-
ty to share my views with you.

                                               September 1991

Mr. Chairman, and members of the Committee, thank you for providing this opportunity
to comment on Judge Clarence Thomas as you consider whether to "consent" to his
nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States.

Yours is an important constitutional duty. Particularly important because if Judge
Thomas serves until the age of his predecessor he will be on the Court until the year
2030.

                                  [Pause for Chairman's Reply]

It is appropriate that you take a long, hard look at Judge Thomas before deciding
whether to consent

It is appropriate that your questions probe, as many of them already have, the
fundamental character of the man and how he thinks about and analyzes tough issues.

That, more than anything, and certainly more than his specific views on specific issues
will determine what kind of a justice he will be in the first third of the twenty-first
century ... what kind of a justice he will be as he deals with problems the likes of which
none of us can even imagine, much less frame questions about to probe his specific
views.

Maybe I can help you in a small way, to understand who this man is. I make this offer in
part because, at least to some degree, the Judge Thomas I have been reading about is
not the Judge Thomas I know.

I first heard of Judge Thomas from Senator Jack Danforth, who has already eloquently
described the Judge. The Senator told me of a bright, young, 26 year old Yale Law
School graduate he had just hired who needed a place to stay during the summer while
studying for the Missouri bar.

I volunteered the room which belonged to my son, Robert, who was a law student and
planning to work in Washington for that summer.
                                        605

Mr. Chairman, I have never seen a young man as disciplined as Clarence Thomas was
that summer. Every single day he exercised with my son's weights and then applied
himself to his studies on a strict schedule and in a disciplined fashion.

I only asked of him one thing.

I would prepare dinner and he would show up -- on time. We ate together every night,
often with friends or relatives, and we talked about any and aJl of the problems of the
day. Clarence had vigorous views even then, and we did not always agree.

However, what impressed me was the quality of his thinking. He did not let personal
feelings interfere with adopting a principled position based on sound analysis and logical
thinking.

Frankly, his arguments both legal and logical often forced me to rethink some of my own
views.

I suspect that sometimes our discussion helped him to see things differently too, because
he knew how to listen as well as talk.

However, if Clarence did change his view, it was not because I said it, it was because he
thought it through and it made sense to him.

Across the years I have kept in touch with Judge Thomas, and to this day, I respect his
integrity, his legal mind and his determination.

I have always found him to be sensitive and compassionate, doing what he believes is
right and working to make the world a better place.

You have already heard from many organizations (some of which I belong to) whose
goals and principles I share and whose positions I usually support

They have urged you to reject his nomination.

.1 am sure that many members of these organizations have tempered their opposition to
Judge Thomas after seeing him and hearing him this past week. I only hope that the
leaders of those organizations see fit to soften their opposition when they testify this
week, as well.

Some of his critics have said that despite Judge Thomas' chairmanship o f the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission for eight years he does not champion civil rights.
They obviously don't know him or the real facts about his tenure at EEOC

For example the Washington Post has reported that he turned EEOC from an
independent agency into one subject to Presidential control, when the historical record
reveals that this occurred in the Carter administration.
                                        606

You have beard a lot about his background so I won't repeat it, but what is important to
tell you is that I knew very little about that background until he was nominated, for he
was not one to dwell on the past

His eyes were on the future and he directed his efforts towards it with diligence,
enthusiasm and discipline.

Some say he gives no credit to the heroes of the civil rights movement You have heard
his praise for Thurgood Marshall, Martin Luther King, and others during these
proceedings. I first heard such sentiments over seventeen years ago.

Throughout the history of the Supreme Court, I do not believe any other nominee can
claim to have come so far. We need people of Judge Thomas' unique perspective not
only on the Supreme Court, but also in state legislatures, the workplace, city hall, on
campus and everywhere else ~ including, Mr. Chairman, the United States Senate.

No one can deny that Judge Thomas would differ from Justice Marshall on some issues.
I haven't always agreed with the good Justice myself.

But I do believe that both men show a fundamental belief in the inherent worth and right
of the individual.

At one of his previous hearings Judge Thomas indicated he became a lawyer because he
wanted "to make sure that minorities [and other] individuals who did not have access to
the society gained access."

He said that while he might differ with others on how to do it, his objective "has always
been to include those who have been excluded."

Let's get more specific for a minute, Mr. Chairman.

I have told you that Clarence Thomas and I have our disagreements.

I have told you that Judge Thomas might disagree with Justice Marshall.

I also know that Judge Thomas has the strength of character to stand up for what he
believes and to disagree with the other justices when necessary.

Let me give you a recent specific example that supports that conclusion.

The Judicial Conference asks all judges to file a report with race gender statistics on
their law clerks.
                              607

I have here an article from the Legal Times of August 5, 1991 which reports that five
Reagan judges on the D.C Court of Appeals have refused to file the data, but that
Judge Qarence Thomas was one of the judges who did file his report He has the
courage and independence to disagree with anyone.

One of the most disagreeable charges leveled at Judge Thomas is that he has changed his

stated views to gain confirmation. Those who make this unfair charge do not know the

man. Judge Qarence Thomas would not violate his principles for any purpose - and

certainly not xo gain a seat on the Supreme Court                                    4

I will close by recalling what Judge Thomas himself told you in his original statement
concerning the day he left my home and went to Jefferson City to practice law in
Attorney General Jack Danforth's office.

When he asked what he owed, I told him nothing, but I did ask him to promise that if he
were ever in a position to help others, as I had helped him, he would do so, and he made
that promise with enthusiasm.

I think he has been keeping his word ever since and will do so at the Supreme Court

"-                                                 -                                    -

I am confident he will make a great Justice and will continue to defend and protect the

rights of the needy, the powerless and those who have suffered from discrimination.

He will not permit anyone to think for him.

He will not be pigeon-holed.

He will be intellectually honest and when the year 2030 rolls around and history reviews
his record compared with what has been said in opposition to him, I am confident that
those of you lucky enough still to be here will know that a vote for confirmation was a
special gift to our country.

I truly believe that Qarence Thomas can become one of the great justices in our history,
and I take pride in recommending him to you Mr. Chairman and to the distinguished
members of this Committee. May I respectfully urge that you exercise your constitutional
powers of advice and consent to the nomination of Qarence Thomas to be an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

  Senator SIMON. Thank you very, very much.
  Senator Allen, I understand you have an 8 o'clock plane to catch.
  Mr. ALLEN. Senator, the statement, "Delta is ready when you
are," I don't believe that statement anymore. Also the judge is on
the same plane.
  Senator SIMON. YOU are all on the same plane?
  Mr. ALLEN. We are all from Georgia, Senator.
  Senator SIMON. One of the questions I have is--one of you men-
tioned Thurgood Marshall. When you looked at Thurgood Mar-
shall's record, you knew where he was going. He was very, very
clear. As I look at Judge Thomas' record and I look at Judge
Thomas as a student at Holy Cross, it is--and I don't know that
much about him at Yale Law School, but at Holy Cross he was that
champion of the less fortunate, very, very vigorously.
  Then I look at Judge Thomas' record in the Department of Edu-
cation and with EEOC and I read his speeches--and I have read
some 800 pages of his speeches--I see someone who comes out on
almost the opposite side of Thurgood Marshall on just about every-
thing. And I am trying to find which is the real Judge Thomas.
  Mr. ALLEN. Senator, I think they jibe.
  Senator SIMON. Pardon?
  Mr. ALLEN. I think they do jibe. I think you have a young man--
understand something. We would have to put Justice Marshall in a
framework of 1967 and his life before then, but we have here a 43-
year-old young man who has seen many of the policies that we
were taught and believed to have "freed us and helped us and
brought us out of our predicament," and I think here is a young
man who is so concerned about the plight of the downtrodden that
he saw many of the old ways not working. And I think he sat back
and analyzed and said let's look at another way, let's try another
way. So I see no real contradiction in the so-called two Clarence
Thomases that others might see.
  Senator SIMON. I think there are many people on this committee,
including some who are going to vote for him, who find a real dif-
ference between his testimony and his record at this point.
  Let me, if I may, Senator, because you used two names, toss this
out--and then I would be interested in the answer to my first ques-
tion from all of you.
  You used Booker T. Washington and Frederick Douglass. They
took two very, very different courses.
  Mr. ALLEN. NO, sir. W.E. DuBois and Marcus Garvey would be
the same timeframe, Garvey and DuBois.
  Senator SIMON. Yes. But if I may just take the two, Booker T.
Washington lifted himself up by his bootstraps--had a very excit-
ing personal story. But in a speech in Atlanta, as a matter of fact,
he said he was the accommodator. He said about Frederick Doug-
lass' demands for voting and these other things, let's lift ourselves
up, let's not push for these things. And the white majority seized
on Booker T. Washington's statements, and I think history has
judged--those statements unfortunately did great damage to the
cause that was an important cause. Frederick Douglass was the ad-
vocate, the strong promoter of the rights for the less fortunate.
  As you look at Judge Thomas, is he more the Booker T. Washing-
ton or the Frederick Douglass?
                                         609

  Mr. ALLEN. Senator, he is an advocate of all those personalities.
The speech that you made reference to historically was one where
Booker T. said that, in all matters, we can be separate as fingers,
but be as mutual as the hand, and he talked about us working to-
gether. I think he understood that everyone was not meant to
study Plato and Socrates, and while there are some people who
have the arts in mind and literature, as DuBois mentioned, as a
talented tent theory, he also mentioned that Garvey and Washing-
ton believed everyone was not equipped to be the scientist, the con-
noisseur of literature, and there was a place for that person, too, so
I see Clarence as a conglomerate of all those philosophies to what
can make things work for the downtrodden, because there was no
exclusive way.

  Senator SIMON. If I may, on the first question, direct it to all
three of you

  Mr. BELL. If I might speak to the first question, I am testifying
for Judge Thomas, because I think he is his own man. I did not
come here to testify because I thought he was like Justice Thur-
good Marshall. They are different. Each one as an American citi-
zen has a right to stand on their own feet.

  I do not know anything about Judge Thomas that would cause
him to be tested by the standard of Thurgood Marshall. That has
been a problem ever since he was nominated. People said, oh, we
don't want him, because he is not the same as Thurgood Marshall.
Well, that is not the test in this country. He has a right to be con-
sidered on his own merit, and on that merit I support him.

  Senator SIMON. Judge Tanner.
  Judge TANNER. I agree with Judge Bell that it is very difficult to
compare Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas. It is like com-
paring Joe Louis or Jack Dempsey with Mohammed Ali or Jackie
Robinson with all the other black ballplayers that came along after
him. It is a very difficult thing.
  But I, Senator, happen to be at the time, I was on the board of
directors of the NAACP, I happened to be there when Thurgood
Marshall was the general counsel of the NAACP, I happened to be
there when he was director of the ink fund. I do not think at any
time did I ever agree with Thurgood Marshall, except on Brown v.
Board of Education, so there are differences of opinion among
black lawyers, among black judges, among black people in the
United States, so I think it is unfair to say it, but you must remem-
ber, the Yale graduate, and I assume Yale Law School is one of
those recognized law schools, even though people from other law
schools might disagree, has a much better education than Thur-
good Marshall and myself, because he comes along at a time in our
history that everything has changed. It was not like it was before
Brown v. Board of Education.
  Senator SIMON. MS. Wilson.
  Ms. WILSON. I thought we had resolved the dichotomy between
DuBois and Booker T. Washington. We need them both.
  But I think what I really want to emphasize here is that the ca-
reers of these two men are quite different. Thurgood Marshall's
entire life was devoted to the civil rights movement on the advoca-
cy side and the framework of the NAACP. Clarence Thomas has
chosen the harder route, to move into the system and work within
                                         610

the system to make it change, and I think it is a much more diffi-
cult job. And I think the fact that he has reached this point is kind
of a star in his crown, because it is not easy, when you are inside
the system, to change it.

  Senator SIMON. Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  First, I want to welcome you all here today. I want to thank you
for coming. This is a very distinguished panel and I doubt if we
have any panel that will excel this one, a distinguished State sena-
tor of Georgia, the State of the nominee, a distinguished circuit
judge, Griffin Bell, who made such a fine record as Attorney Gen-
eral, a distinguished retired Federal judge here, and an outstand-
ing lady distinguished in her own right, Ms. Wilson. We are just
delighted to have all of you here.
  I just have two questions you can answer in one word. I will start
with you, senator. Is it your opinion that Judge Thomas is highly
qualified and possesses the necessary integrity, professional compe-
tence, and judicial temperament to be an Associate Justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court?
  Mr. ALLEN. Yes, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Bell?

   Mr. BELL. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Tanner?
  Judge TANNER. Senator Thurmond, I am not a retired judge, I
am a senior U.S. district court judge on active duty. The answer to
your question is amen.
  Senator THURMOND. I correct myself in saying you were retired. I
had understood you were retired. I thought you looked pretty
young. [Laughter.]
  Ms. Wilson.
  Ms. WILSON. Senator Thurmond, yes, with great enthusiasm.
  Senator THURMOND. The second question: Do you know of any
reason why he should not be made a member of the Supreme
Court, Senator Allen?
  Mr. ALLEN. NO, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Bell?
  Mr. BELL. Absolutely no.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Tanner?
  Judge TANNER. NO, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. MS. Wilson?
  Ms. WILSON. Absolutely not.
  Senator THURMOND. That is all. As far as I am concerned, you
can go home, and if you rush, you might catch that plane.
  Senator SIMON. We had better let Senator Specter get a question
in here now. Senator Specter.
   Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, very briefly, because I know you
have a plane to catch. I join my colleagues in thanking you for
staying so late.
  Judge Bell, would you classify Judge Thomas as well qualified for
the Supreme Court, after having heard the ABA's recommendation
of qualified?
   Mr. BELL. I would classify him as well qualified, yes.
   Senator SPECTER. Senator Allen, you are a member of the bar
yourself, I understand?
                                      611

   Mr. ALLEN. Yes, sir.

  Senator SPECTER. And you, of course, know Judge Thomas very
well, you described your activities with him since boyhood. Do you
have great confidence in his intellectual capability, based on your
own personal knowledge?

  Mr. ALLEN. Yes, Senator, and I wish that particular characteris-
tic of his intellectual ability was stressed more throughout these
hearings.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Tanner, I heard your comments on the
radio coming over, and I thought I understood you to say that those
who were opposed to Judge Thomas opposed him because he is Af-
rican-American. Did I understand you correctly?

  Judge TANNER. In listening to the hearings and reading the com-
ments of the media, it appears to me that that is one of the issues,
can a black man be trusted with the life, liberty, and property of
the United States. I think all the questions that refer to natural
law, implication or inference, are involved in that issue.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Tanner, I hope no one opposes him
on that basis, but how would you explain the opposition of the
NAACP and some of the religious organizations which are African-
American?

  Judge TANNER. Well, look at the history of those organizations. I
also, as Margaret Bush Wilson at one time, I was not the chair-
man, I was on the board of directors, I was a branch president, I
helped form the National Conference of Black Lawyers. We, too,
disagree, for different reasons. I was at one time a member of the
Young Turks in the NAACP. We disagreed with Thurgood Mar-
shall on the direction of the NAACP at that time. I am talking
about the late 1950's and the early 1960's. We thought that the
NAACP should put the resources, which were meager and perhaps
still are, in the cities such as Chicago, New York, Detroit, and the
large cities where the ghettos were being formed.

  We also thought that then was the time to go back to the Su-
preme Court on Brown v. Board of Education and find out just
what forthwith meant in the desegregation in the schools of Amer-
ica.

  We ran into absolute bitter opposition on those issues, so we do
disagree. We are not monolithic. We do not all agree. You see, Sen-
ator Specter, in my opinion and judgment, Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation, for all intents and purposes, eradicated the legal impedi-
ments to people who had been descendants of slaves to get their
fair share of America, but it did not tell us, Brown v. Board of
Education, how to do that.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Tanner, I can understand how you would
disagree with Justice Marshall and other African-Americans, but I
do not yet understand why you would say that one African-Ameri-
can or a group like the NAACP would oppose Judge Thomas be-
cause he is black or an African-American.

  Judge TANNER. Senator, I think history will show that it is not
unusual or unknown for black people to oppose black people, just
because they are black, for some reason. I am sure that there are
many black lawyers and judges in the United States who are disap-
pointed that President Bush did not call them to be the nominee to
the Supreme Court of the United States.
                                      612
  But just because they are opposing him, and I firmly believe
much of it comes, because you see that they are in these coalitions
and some of them have called them special interest groups, as to
how they think black America and women and other minorities
should get their fair share of America. If you do not agree with
them, then they think you are wrong.
  Senator SPECTER. MS. Wilson, do you agree with Judge Thomas
on affirmative action?
  Ms. WILSON. I think, Senator, you have to be clear, to let me sure
I understand that you understand what Judge Thomas thinks
about affirmative action. I have a view about it.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Thomas has testified extensively
about it and essentially he is opposed to affirmative action. That
may be an oversimplification, but he is not in favor, for example, of
having employment opportunities only of--on the basis of those
who have actually been discriminated against, but not in favor of a
group, to put them where they would have been, except for historic
discrimination.
  Have I stated that accurately, Senator Allen?
  Mr. ALLEN. Sir, as we say in Georgia, somewhat muddy though.
  Senator SPECTER. Somewhat what?
  Mr. ALLEN. Somewhat muddy. I think I understand the judge's
position to be that he has gone on record consistently in the area of
quotas. Unfortunately, because in this whole process there has
been no definition of terms, we have almost hitched up the phrase
quota with affirmative action and they are not one and the same
thing.
  Senator SPECTER. Of course not. Senator Allen, you understand
Judge Thomas' position on affirmative action?
  Mr. ALLEN. The position as I have read, according to statements
he has made, is that while he is opposed to quotas on the issue of
affirmative action, I have understood his position to be that any fa-
vorite status for one that causes discrimination to another group
he would, in fact, be opposed to, and that is probably the view of
most Americans, particularly black Americans.
  Senator SPECTER. DO you agree with him on that?
  Mr. ALLEN. On that point, yes, sir.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much. I do not want to keep
you any longer. You have a slim chance of making the 8 o'clock
plane.
  Senator THURMOND. I have called my car to come down and pick
you all up and take you to the airport.
  Mr. ALLEN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. I think you can make it, if you rush.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you.
  The committee stands adjourned until 10 o'clock tomorrow morn-
ing.

at 10 a.m., on Tuesday, September 17, 1991.]
