  I would like to welcome a very distinguished panel this morning.
The Judiciary Committee undertakes a very serious constitutional
duty when it considers the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice.
The expertise each of you brings to this process will, I am sure,
make your views of significant interest to the committee.
  Each of you has made an important contribution in an area of
great concern in these hearings: Civil rights and the role of the Su-
preme Court in protecting individual liberties.
  Professor Days, would you be good enough to come up? He is
from Yale Law School, has an extensive background in the area of
civil rights, served as President Carter's Assistant Attorney Gener-
al for Civil Rights, and before his tenure at the Justice Department
as an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
  Professor Edley of Harvard Law School has advanced degrees in
both law and public policy. During the Carter administration, he
served as an assistant to the President, and as the Assistant Direc-
tor of the White House Domestic Policy Staff, and as a Special As-
sistant Secretary in the Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare.
  Professor Lawrence of Stanford Law School brings to these hear-
ings an expertise not only in the law but also in education. He was
an assistant professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education
and an attorney with the Harvard Center for Law and Education
and the director of the Federation of Boston Community Schools.
He has focused in both his writings and his teachings on issues of
race and the Constitution.
  We are delighted to have all of you here this morning. I think, as
we heard from Chairman Biden, we have a very full day of wit-

                                          CD
nesses. We appreciate very much your effort in being here, but we
hope that you will be able to respond to what questions we have--
limit your presentation to 5 minutes and then respond to questions.
All of the statements will be included in their entirety in the
record.

  According to our committee, I guess we have to swear you in. Do
you swear the testimony you will give is the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God.

   Mr. EDLEY. I do.
   Mr. LAWRENCE. I do.
   Mr. DAYS. I do.

  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Days, welcome. I had the good opportuni-
ty to work with, I think all of you, on a number of different public
policy issues, and we know of your continuing interest in all of
these matters on the Constitution. So we are very fortunate to have
you.

  Professor Days.

TESTIMONY OF DREW S. DAYS, PROFESSOR, YALE LAW SCHOOL;
  CHRISTOPHER EDLEY, JR., PROFESSOR, HARVARD LAW
  SCHOOL; AND CHARLES LAWRENCE, PROFESSOR, STANFORD
  LAW SCHOOL, ON BEHALF OF THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN
  LAW TEACHERS

  Mr. DAYS. Senator Kennedy, thank you for allowing me to testify
this morning before this committee during what we all recognize is
a very important proceeding. I can assure you that I respect the
solemn responsibility that the Senate must discharge in its consti-
tutional advise-and-consent role, and that I offer my testimony in
that spirit.

  I think it has been very difficult, Senator Kennedy and Senator
Thurmond, for many people to come to grips with how they would
respond to the nomination of Clarence Thomas. And I certainly in-
clude myself in that category. It has not been easy coming to a de-
termination.

  But one of the things that I was concerned about--and I think
that thinking was very much affected by the opening statements
that many of you made at the beginning of these proceedings about
the role of a Justice of the Supreme Court, about the role of the
Supreme Court as a guardian of the individual. I think Senator
Heflin talked about the Supreme Court being the people's court,
dealing with real issues and real people. Senator Thurmond, you
talked about its responsibility to administer justice, to be con-
cerned about that standard.

  What I tried to do was place Clarence Thomas in that context, as
a guardian of individual rights, as a member of a people's court.
And the more I did that, the more difficult I found it to envision
Clarence Thomas as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court.

  My conclusion was very much affected by two things: First, read-
ing his writings and reviewing some of the speeches that he has
given on issues of concern to me, and issues that I have dealt with
for most of my professional life, what strikes me about his articles
and his speeches is their detachment from history; his treatment of
these issues as though they arose only yesterday or, indeed, in
some cases the day before he began to speak about the issues,
rather than as a consequence of very long, difficult, and hard and
painful efforts by a number of people, including civil rights groups,
to deal with problems of discrimination and exclusion.

  For example, on the issue of goals and timetables, he rejects
goals and timetables as a technique for dealing with discrimination
in employment. But as we both know, although Judge Thomas does
not seem to recognize this in many of his public positions prior to
becoming a judge on the court of appeals, goals and timetables
were a response to years of recalcitrance and resistance by employ-
ers and unions to efforts by civil rights groups and individuals to
get employment opportunities on a fair basis.

  He talks about school desegregation and criticizes Greenv. New
Kent County, a very important case in 1968, as though it were a
concoction of the Supreme Court and not a response to years of
massive resistance by school districts all across the country. In fact,
I found it somewhat interesting, when Judge Thomas talks about
his experiences, that there is no reference to the fact that in his
home town--Savannah, GA--for many years people were fighting
just to get one black child into a desegregated school.

  In fact, in Savannah, for some years until the courts intervened,
black children were being given IQ tests and all kinds of psycholog-
ical batteries to determine whether they were suitable to sit next
to white children in schools that had been segregated in the past.

  He also talks about questions of discrimination in other areas,
voting rights particularly. And, once again, as you know, Senator
Kennedy, for many years the Justice Department and other private
individuals tried to deal with voting discrimination, without suc-
cess. It was required for the Congress to come in and pass the
Voting Rights Act of 1965. And when Congress extended the
Voting Rights Act in 1970, and 1975, and most recently in 1982, it
was responsive to real, not imagined, problems of discrimination in
that area.

  The second concern that I have about Judge Thomas is his role
as a civil rights enforcement official in both the Reagan and Bush
administrations. Judge Thomas has attempted to compartmentalize
his life into what he was before he became a judge and the fact
that he is a judge now. But the truth is he was occupying a position
as a bureaucrat that was set up by Congress because of its view
that people needed special protection. There needed to be an Office
for Civil Rights in the Department of Education. There needed to
be an EEOC to make certain that people who were systematic vic-
tims of discrimination could get some relief.

  And I think the way he occupied those two positions--for exam-
ple, in the title IX area in the Department of Education, not seeing
the necessity for extending title IX to discrimination against
women in education, and his treatment of his responsibilities in the
EEOC--did not reflect the type of sensitivity to that special respon-
sibility and role that he had in the Federal Government.

  Thank you very much.

                       STATEMENT
                              OF

       PROFESSOR DREW S. DAYS, III
                  YALE LAW SCHOOL
                          Before
                            the

        SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
             ON THE NOMINATION OF

CLARENCE THOMAS TO THE SUPREME COURT

               SEPTEMBER 17, 1991
        Mr. Chairman, my name is Drew s. Days, III. I am a
Professor of Law at Yale University. I want to thank you and the
other members of the Committee for affording me an opportunity to
appear before you this morning during your consideration ofvthe
nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to become the next Associate
Justice of the United States Supreme Court. I can assure you
that I respect the solemn responsibility that the Senate must
discharge in its constitutional "advise and consent" role and
that I offer my testimony in that spirit.

         I was struck and, I must say moved, by the common theme of
many of your eloquent opening remarks when these hearings got
underway a week ago about your visions of the place of the
Supreme Court in our system of government. You spoke of the
Court's duty "to administer justice,"1 of the need for its
members to be "able guardians of rights,"2 of its function as "a
people's court" dealing "with real people, their rights, duties,
 property, and most importantly their liberty."3 You expressed
 your concern that it be "the champion of the less fortunate,"*
                                                   2

standing "against any ill winds that blow as [a] haven[] of
refuge" for the "weak or helpless or outnumbered."5

        There have been Supreme Courts during my lifetime that have
lived up to the visions you painted. But we have lost in trie
last two years from the Court Justices Brennan and Marshall, two
true guardians of our rights, two justices who understood their
responsibility to be part of a "people's court", part of a haven
of refuge for the weak and helpless and outnumbered. It will be
some time before we are able to assess fully their invaluable
contributions to the Court, our society, and to the lives of all
of us. Of course, their majority opinions helped define and
reinforce many of the rights we as Americans cherish today. But,
even in dissent, their voices appealed to our very best
instincts. And I have no doubt they were often successful,
through the formal and informal workings of the Court, in opening
the eyes of less perceptive and sensitive justices to- the
 realities of life for the least fortunate among us.

         With the departure of Justices Brennan and Marshall, the
                                                         3
Court and the Country deserve a- new Associate Justice capable of
serving as a staunch defender of rights secured by the
Constitution and laws of the United States. Political realities

                                                                                                                                                                         4

being what they are, however, I am not so naive as to expect that
the next member of the Court will have views identical to those
of those two recently-retired justices or be inclined to vote as
they might on every issue. But I do think that the American
people are entitled to have a man or woman appointed to fill the
vacancy left by Justice Marshall who shares the vision of the
Supreme Court's role that several of you expressed at the opening
 session and that most of our fellow citizens embrace.

         The Administration would like to persuade us that Judge
 Clarence Thomas is that person. But I, for one, have seem little
 in Judge Thomas' government service, writings and speeches, or,
 indeed, in his testimony during the past week before this
 Committee to convince me that he would be a champion 'for those
 who turn to the Court for protection or that he has the capacity
 or inclination to make it a kinder and gentler institution than
it is today.
        To perform those tasks, a justice has to be have a sense of

history. Judge Thomas has urged this committee and the American
People to disregard his writings and speeches as philosophical
ramblings or forays into political theory and to focus on who and
what he is today.6 I find that very hard to do, however, since
I have had almost no personal contact with Judge Thomas.
Moreover, I have been unable to glean very much from his opinions
on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
since they address largely routine administrative and criminal
law issues.

         What one finds in Judge Thomas1 writings, among other
things, is a glaring lack of any historical perspective. He and
other "Black Conservatives" have gained some public sympathy in
recent years by contending that they have been ostracized by
liberal blacks and the "civil rights establishment" Because they
had the courage to speaX out, to challenge the prevail orthodoxy.

         I, for one, welcome challenges to orthodoxy, in civil rights
                                                         5
or elsewhere. But what I have difficulty accepting challenges
from people who demonstrate a woeful ignorance of history* Judge
Thomas1 articles and speeches fall into that category* They
certainly have attracted widespread attention in recent years
akin to that enjoyed by the perennial "man bites dog" stories.
But when Judge Thomas attacks affirmative action, or school
desegregation or efforts to ensure minorities a meaningful role
in the political process, it is evident that he lacks a basic
understanding of the civil rights struggle in America.

         One would not gather from reading his articles or speeches,
 for example, that administrative agencies and courts adopted
 affirmative action "goals and timetables" as a response to what,
 in many instances, were years of resistance by employers or
unions to the opening up of employment opportunities to
 minorities and women7. My point is not to argue here the
 wisdom of goals and timetables but rather to make the point that
 it is difficult to take seriously proposals for change from a
 person like Judge Thomas who treats a highly complex subject
                                  10

                                                  6

rhetorically and superficially for want of any sense of
historical context.

         In several of his articles Judge Thomas offers his own
rewriting of the Supreme Court's 1954 opinion in Brown v. Board
of Education 8 striking down state-imposed segregation in public
educations. He then goes on to argue that had the Court
approached the issue of school desegregation his way, the country
might not still be engaged in a debate over how to eradicate the
vestiges of previously dual systems. His recitation and analysis
seem devoid of any sense of the difficult legal campaign waged to
overturn the "separate but equal" doctrine9 And it does not
show an awareness of the degree to which school desegregation
doctrine after Brown was an understandable response to organized,
often massive, resistance to even minimal changes in all-white,
all-black assignment patterns for over a quarter century.10 I
make these observations not to suggest that further debate over
what we do about segregated education in America in the 1990s is
unwarranted or that the old approaches may not need to yield to
                                     11

                                                         7
new ones. But I seriously doubt that it can be a constructive
one on Judge Thomas1 terms.

         Judge Thomas has also found fault with Congress1 and the
Supreme Court's efforts to ensure minority voting rights.11 Yet
his criticisms sit unembarrassed on the page by any apparent
comprehension of the lives and the limbs that courageous citizens
offered up to vicious racists so that the promises of the
Fifteenth Amendment might be realized.12 One searches the pages
of his articles for any recognition of how Southern registrars
effectively frustrated the Justice Department voting rights
enforcement litigation program in the early 1960s.13 They make
 no mention of these and other stories of resistance to effective
minority exercise of the franchise that caused the Congress to
 pass the Voting Right of 1965 and to extend its operation by
 large margins in 1970, 1975 and, most recently, in 1982.u
 Meaningful conversations have been going on for several years
 among informed blacks, Hispanics, and whites about whether well-
 established approaches to voting rights issues are any longer in
                                     12

                                                         8
the best interest of racial minorities or of the society at
large.15 That Judge Thomas was not invited to join can be
explained rather simply: he had nothing to bring to the table.

         It might be argued that Judge Thomas really is aware of the
history I have described but simply decided to avoid any
reference to it in his articles for reasons known only to
himself. Even if that is true, I am left, nevertheless, with the
question of why someone like Judge Thomas would address such
important legal and political without giving them the due
considerations they clearly deserved.

                                                     II.
         Judge Thomas has suggested during his testimony over the
past week that the speeches and articles to which I refer were
examples of what he did as a member of the Executive Branch, as a
 political operative, but do not offer any real insights into what
 he is like as a judge.16 Strictly speaking, he was ttfat.
 However, I think that his self-characterization in this respect
 is revealing. For it lacks a sense of the special role he was
                                      13

                                                  9

expected to play in the Executive Branch both as an Assistant
Secretary for Civil Rights in the Department of Education and as
Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions E.E.O.C.
As the members of this committee are all well-aware, Congress
created the posts Judge Thomas occupied because it felt that
issues of discrimination in eduction and employment deserved the
attention of a senior-level official and that protecting the
interests of those likely to suffer unfair treatment in those
respects should be a full-time rather than part-time endeavor.

         Yet Judge Thomas, as Assistant Secretary at the Education
Department, argued, for example, against extending the protection
of Title IX, which prohibits sex discrimination by educational
 institutions receiving federal funds to cover employment
discrimination against women teachers.17 His position was
 rejected by the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights and
 the Solicitor General in the Department of Justice and,
 ultimately, by a unanimous Supreme Court.18

         As Chairman of the E.E.O.C, Judge Thomas set his sights on
                                     14

                                                        10
abolishing the agency's reliance on statistical evidence of
employment discrimination, despite the Supreme Court's approval
of such proof, because he questioned what he understood to be the
basic premise involved. He believed that this evidentiary
technique relied on the conviction that workforces should
reflect, in the absence of discrimination, the proportion of
racial minorities and women in the population at large. He
thought that this was absurd and he was right.

         His only problem was that the case law he criticized claimed
no such thing. It did acknowledge that statistical disparities
between groups reasonably alike in overall qualifications for the
jobs in question would be some evidence of discrimination. But
it also clearly left employers free to introduce evidence
supporting a non-discriminatory explanation for such
disparities.19

         Given his misunderstanding of this doctrine, however, Judge
Thomas felt unconstrained in praising a book critical of
 statistical, claims about sex discrimination as "a much needed
                                  15
                                  n

antidote for cliches about women's earnings and professional
status."20 He stated elsewhere on this same point:

                  It could be . . . that blacks and women are generally
                  unprepared to do certain kinds of work by their own
                  choice. It could be that blacks choose not to study
                  chemical engineering and the women choose to have
                  babies instead of going on to medical school.21
         In sum, Judge Thomas was of the view that minority and
female plaintiffs, despite the well-established fact of race and
sex discrimination, should bear the burden of negating every
other explanation for employment disparities in order to prevail.
         Moreover, Judge Thomas' frequent expressions of disagreement
with Supreme Court decisions in the employment and affirmative
action fields undoubtedly had a destabilizing impact upon the
 E.E.O.C.'s enforcement program. He even went so far as to
 commend publicly the dissent in an affirmative action case as
 "guidance for lower courts and a possible majority in future
 decisions."22 Of course, government employees like Judge
                                  16

                                                  12
Thomas do not forsake their First Amendment rights to speak out
on important issues of the day. However, his commentaries on
Supreme Court doctrine, one day expressing E.E.O.C. policy, the
next his own personal views, must have been difficult for the
agency's several thousand employees spread across the country to
comprehend readily.

         Overall, Judge Thomas1 record as a civil rights enforcer in
the Reagan and Bush administrations seems more the subject of
lengthy explanations and apologies, as in the case of the
thousands of lapsed age discrimination claims, rather than the
object of general praise for jobs well done. And, for all his
talk23 about the need for stronger sanctions in employment
discrimination cases, there is no evidence that he took
systematic steps to persuade Congress to provide them.2* The
strong picture that emerges suggests that Judge Thomas had his
opportunity to guard the rights of people who looked' to his
agencies to help them and he did not measure up to the task.

                                                      III.
                                     17

                                                        13
       Judge Thomas' and the Administration's response to these
disquieting features of his world view and civil rights
enforcement record is that his humble beginnings are an assurance
that he will be quick to rise to the defense of those looking to
the Supreme Court to vindicate their rights. In my estimation,
Judge Thomas' impressive story of his journey from poverty to
prominence is not assurance enough.

              TESTIMONY OF CHRISTOPHER EDLEY, JR.
  Mr. EDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  In summary, my central point is this: The Constitution forces the
executive and legislative branches to share responsibility for pick-
ing Justices, and thereby share influence over the course of consti-
tutional history.
  In taking the measure of the nominee, you should look to the
whole record and recognize that good character and unimpeached
integrity did not prevent Dred Scott or PlessyorLochner.
  In the final analysis, it is not the character of this man that
must be at issue, but the character of his record. Yet the heart of
the administration's affirmative case is Judge Thomas' personal
story and character, in hopes, perhaps, that this strategy will un-
dergird his credibility and present an image strikingly more attrac-
tive than the piles of speeches and abstractions.
  But that voluminous record raises many grave concerns to which
the nominee offers one of three responses:
  First, "Although what I said may sound extreme, I was really
trying to make a far less controversial point." But repeated so
often, this seems to me to lack credibility.
  Second, "That was the position I took as a policy official in the
executive branch; as a judge, I do not make policy." This argument
is wrong. It misconceives the role of the Supreme Court and the
process of judging.
  Third, "I have an open mind on that subject." When applied to
fundamental matters, however, this is almost disqualifying. A well-
qualified nominee should at least be able to suggest, however tenta-
tively, the framework for his or her analysis. How else can you dis-
cern someone's constitutional vision, which is the key question
before you?
  You have his documents to analyze, and you have his credibility
to assess. But here is what I believe you are left with in two of the
more critical dimensions: Civil rights and separation of powers.
  First, in civil rights, the close questioning--particularly by Sena-
tor Specter--did not demonstrate that the nominee's views fall
within the broad bipartisan consensus. If Judge Thomas joins the
Court--this Court that gutted Griggs in a fit of activism--what
grounds are there for confidence that he will dissent from further
judicial activism of the same sort--judicial activism to reverse
those statutory and constitutional holdings he attacked so forceful-
ly for so many years?
  The second critical dimension is broader. Judge Thomas on his
record--on his record--is certainly an unlikely congressional pick
for referee or partner in the separation of powers structure.
  Why so? Well, the pattern of intemperate remarks--Senator
Metzenbaum replayed some of them yesterday--the repeated clash-
es with oversight committees, the cramped and even distorted read-
ing of title VII and of judicial precedents--Senators Specter and
Kennedy explored these--the pattern, it seems to me, is compel-
ling.
                                      21

  The fair prediction, I believe, is that Justice Thomas would tilt
strongly toward the executive, defer to narrow agency interpreta-
tions of statutes, lean against generous interpretations of regula-
tory laws, including civil rights measures, and probably be unchari-
table in appraising the rationality of statutes within the frame-
work of due process or section 5.

  The Court's referee role, however, is more critical now than ever.
We seem ever more ambitious as a people about what we want to
accomplish collectively, through one or another level of govern-
ment. And divided government--that is to say, the White House
and Congress led by different political parties--spawns conflicts
which courts must often resolve. These separation of powers ten-
sions are implicit almost everywhere, but statutory interpretation,
with an agency arguably hostile to congressional will, is the most
common setting.

  Let me be plain. When you choose to confirm or reject a nomi-
nee, you influence the Supreme Court's jurisprudential view of
statutory interpretation and the role of the executive. You influ-
ence, perhaps profoundly, the balance of power.

  Rust v. Sullivan, the abortion gag-rule case, shows the danger of
a world where, even if Congress has passed the law, executive
agencies can distort it, the Supreme Court can misinterpret it, and
when Congress tries to clarify its own intent, the President can
veto it.

  The design of the Framers seeks to balance factions and ensure
that no branch has ideological domination over the others. With
that in mind, Mr. Chairman, the lax and deferential standard for
confirmation proposed by some makes little sense. Can it be now
that the greatest danger to the separation of powers is not the
abuse of executive power or an overreaching judiciary, but the un-
willingness of Congress--in this instance, the Senate--to wield its
power?

  If there is a new Thomas standard, it will be by your choice. You
will be choosing evasion over candor, conversion over consistency,
political scripts over constitutional debate. But I believe you will
choose well.

  I hope this has been helpful.

                can you discern someone's constitutional vision--the key question before you?
        You have his documents to analyze, and you have his credibility to assess. But here is what

divided government--White House and Congress led by different political parties-spawns con-
flicts, which the courts often must resolve. These separation of powers tensions are implicit
almost everywhere, but statutory interpretation, with an agency arguably hostile to congressional
will, is the most common setting.

        Let me be plain. When you choose to confirm or reject a nominee you influence the
Supreme Court's jurisprudential view of statutory interpretation and the role of the executive.
You influence, perhaps profoundly, the balance of power.

        You must guess whether the man who sat before you has the same philosophy of gov-
ernance as the man who served two presidents, who was insensed about oversight, who praised
Colonel North's performance, and who attacked the Chief Justice's opinion in Morrison v. Olson.

        If the philosophy of governance that prevails in these halls differs from that prevailing on
the High Court, then you in the Congress must prepare for a protracted guerrilla war over inter-
pretation of your legislation~a war you are ill-suited to fight.

        Rust v. Sullivan, the abortion gag-rule case, shows the danger of a world where, even if Con-
gress has passed the law, executive agencies can distort it, the Supreme Court can misinterpret it,
and when Congress tries to clarify it's own intent, the President can veto it.

        We have seen the same thing in civil rights, again and again.

        How many more examples will there be, Mr. Chairman? You are not powerless in this.
The opportunity and powerto shape our Constitutional history are not the President's alone.

        The design of the Framers seeks to balance factions and ensure that no branch has
ideological domination over the others. With that in mind, the lax and deferential standard for
confirmation proposed by some makes little sense. Can it be that the greatest danger to the
Separation of Powers is not the abuse of executive power, or an overreaching judiciary, but the
unwillingness of the Congress~in this instance the Senate-to wield its power?

        And your power includes this confirmation process. It is not for the nominee or the White
House to design. Mr. Chairman, this Committeewill decide whether there is to be, as you put it, a
"Thomas standard." You will choose whether to reward a process that favors evasion over candor,

                                                                                                               p.3

and selective memory over substantive command.

        I believe you will choose well. I hope this has been helpful.

   Senator KENNEDY. Professor Lawrence.

                   TESTIMONY OF CHARLES LAWRENCE

   Mr. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, Senators, it is with considerable
anguish that I come before this committee to oppose the confirma-
tion of Judge Clarence Thomas. No one who has himself experi-
enced the headwinds of American racism can easily oppose an indi-
vidual who has traveled the same buffeted road. No one who has
been participant and witness to the courageous struggles that have
opened doors so long closed to us is anxious to say that one of our
own should not pass through those doors. But after a long and
careful consideration of Judge Thomas' record as a public official,
after listening to his testimony before this committee, I find that I
must oppose him.

   When Judge Thomas made his opening statement before this
committee, he invoked the legacy of Justice Thurgood Marshall. He
said, "Justice Marshall, whose seat I have been nominated to fill, is
one of those who had the courage, the intellect * * * to knock
down barriers that seemed so insurmountable." When I heard that
invocation, I wished with all my heart that this was a man capable
of fulfilling that legacy. I wanted to believe that he knew what it
meant to stand on the shoulders of this great champion of racial
justice, that he was an individual with the acuity of intellect, the
integrity and the strength of character to carry on the monumen-
tal vocation that was Justice Marshall's. I knew that millions of
black Americans shared this longing with me.

  Justice Marshall was our first and only voice on the Nation's
highest Court. In the judicial conference room, on the pages of the
Supreme Court reports, and in the public discourse, we counted on
him to make our story heard. On a Court increasingly insensitive
to the plight of those denied the full fruits of citizenship, he was
also a voice for women, for gays and lesbians, for the poor, and for
other minorities. This is Justice Marshall's legacy. And those of us
who believe in the Court's special role as guardian of those without
voice, must do more than hope and trust in Judge Thomas' invoca-
tion of that legacy.

  Judge Thomas has told us of his humble beginnings, of his own
experience with the humiliation of segregation and racial denigra-
tion. He has assured us that he will not forget those beginnings,
those experiences of shame. I am certain that he will not. But we
must ask another question: What has Clarence Thomas done with
this experience?

   By what path has he come from those humble beginnings to the
threshold of the Supreme Court? What does the record of his life,
and particularly his record as a public servant, tell us about his
values and character, about whether he can be counted on to be a
voice for those who have not been so fortunate as he?

   Thurgood Marshall chose the path of leadership within his own
community, of legal advocacy on behalf of those who were least
powerful, of constant challenge to the institutions and politicians
who exploited race and poverty. His way was to speak truth to
power.

   Judge Thomas has come to this crossroad by a very different
route. His choice was to serve those who are most powerful in this
society, and he has served them well.
                                          27

  The President has nominated Judge Thomas to the Supreme
Court precisely because he has proven his willingness to advance
the ideology of his patrons, without dissent. He has demonstrated
his loyalty as an administration footsoldier. He has been an eager
spokesperson for the agenda of the radical right.

  One cannot help but wonder what this history of accommodation
has done to Clarence Thomas' character. In always striving to
please those who have been his benefactors, has he lost himself? It
is somehow not surprising in the course of these hearings that we
have heard him disavow so much of what he has said before.

  This is a political nomination, let there be no mistake about that.
The Framers anticipated this inevitability and gave to the Senate
the job of checking the President's power to make a Supreme Court
in his own image. This President is determined to do just that, to
push the Court even more solidly to the ideological right than it
already is. When this is so, it is the especially important role of the
Senate not to shirk its responsibilities in this process. It is your
duty to insure that there remains on the Court some meaningful
diversity of judicial philosophy and political orientation, that there
remains some voice for those who too often go unheard.

  It is your duty to reject this nomination and reject each nomina-
tion that follows, until you are assured that this new Justice will
stand against the current Court's assault on Roe v. Wade, Brown v.
Board of Education, and Griggs v. Duke Power. It is not enough to
guess, to hope, or even to pray, as I have, that, if confirmed, Judge
Thomas will grow and change. It is your responsibility to insure
the American public that the legacy of Justice Marshall will live
on.

  Thank you, Senator.

Mr Chairman, Senators:

It is with a considerable anguish that I come before this committee to oppose the
confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas. No one who has himself experienced the

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  We will follow a 10-minute rule for the questions. Some people
argue that, despite Judge Thomas' record of hostility on civil
rights, we should trust that if he is confirmed to the Supreme
Court, he will be sensitive on civil rights. Given both his past
record, statements, position, actions, and statements before the
committee, what kind of weight should we give that kind of advice
or guidance, Professor Days?
  Mr. DAYS. The concerns that I expressed, Senator Kennedy, the
administration and Judge Thomas have suggested that his humble
beginnings will cause him to rise to the defense of those who are
most in need of protection, but it seems to me that, given his world
view and the examples that I just described, his impressive story of
his journey from poverty to prominence is not assurance enough.
  What strikes me about his discussion of the world is that there
seem to be two periods in his life, his early experiences in Savan-
nah and today, and there seems to be very little recognition of
what had gone on between that. And when he talks about discrimi-
nation, he talks about his own experience. He rarely talks about
the little people out in the street who are struggling to get jobs,
trying to get their children into decent schools, trying to get an ef-
fective way to participate in the pollical process.
  So, I do not think the record causes us any assurance that, when
he gets into the Supreme Court, if he gets into the Supreme Court,
he will do what is required of him.
  One of the things that I think is important about the role, as
Professor Lawrence indicated, about Justice Marshall and Justice
Brennan, was that they represented those who are at the margins
of the society not only in their opinions and not only in their dis-
sents, but I am confident that in conferences, in the formal and in-
formal discussions within the Court, they helped educate some of
their colleagues to what was going on on the streets, what was hap-
pening down below the level that they perhaps had ever experi-
enced in their own lives, and I do not have any confidence, given
what I have read of Judge Thomas' writings and what I have heard
him say in these hearings, that he can play that role or is willing
to play that role.
  I am sure that the other Justices will know about his life in Pin
Point, GA, but whether they know about the lives of those kids in
Savannah who were struggling to get a decent education is as big
question.
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Edley, Mr. Lawrence.
  Mr. EDLEY. The only thing I would add, Senator, is that it seems
to me it is just simply too romantic. I would like to believe in the
possibility of redemption, but I would like some evidence. It seems
to me it is too much to play Russian roulette with our rights or
with the role of the Congress, the critical issues that I think are at
stake here.
  The background determinism that is suggested by the fact that
he came from Pin Point and, therefore, will act in a special way on
the Court seems to be counter-factual. That is not what the record
demonstrates. What the record demonstrates is that, despite the di-
versity suggested by his experience, what has he made of that expe-
rience? And what he has made of that experience, it seems to me,
                                          32
is harshly judgmental, and that is not the kind of representation
certainly that I believe the Supreme Court needs.

  Mr. LAWRENCE. I would only add, Senator Kennedy, that, to my
mind, we must hold him responsible for the choices that he makes
in his adult life, as I indicated, what he has done with this experi-
ence, and it seems to me quite clear from his record that those
choices have been choices that would not lead us to believe that he
would be sensitive to these very things that might have been so im-
portant an influence on him.

  I think the other thing that I would be concerned about is that
he has been so unforthcoming in these hearings, in his discussion
of the particulars of his judicial philosophy and what that philoso-
phy might be, that if this committee has any uncertainty as to
whether his record or his beginnings really influence his life, in
order to assure us of his direction, that we must require that he be
considerably more forthcoming on the particulars of his judicial
philosophy than he has been willing to be.

  Senator KENNEDY. Let me ask also the panel, as we obviously
have got limited time, about what our country would have looked
like, if Judge Thomas' view had been the prevailing view in the Su-
preme Court, say, for the last 20 years.

  Perhaps, Mr. Days, because, unfortunately, I know that light is
going to go on, if you can also perhaps in your response try and
help me to understand the distinction which Judge Thomas placed
upon diversity for women, the Santa Clara case, diversity for
women in the workplace, versus diversity at the university, which
you are currently associated with at Yale, what that distinction is
that he mentioned and how important, serious is it.

  Finally, on the voting rights cases, you are familiar with his gen-
eral criticisms of voting rights cases, this has been an area of par-
ticular interest, I know, to you and to the panel. I have difficulty in
understanding the nature of the criticism, given both the Supreme
Court holdings and the legislative action.

  I think I have probably given you an awful on that, but, first of
all, what the country would have looked like, if his view had been
the prevailing view, generally, and then specifically, if you would
address those two subquestions.

  Mr. DAYS. Senator Kennedy, it gets back to my initial point.
Over the last 20 years, the Supreme Court has demonstrated its
greatness, it seems to me, when it understood the realities outside
of the marble walls of the Supreme Court, when it understood that
real people were going to be affected by its decisions and did not let
labels, as such, blind them to the fact that there needed to be prag-
matic and effective remedies to discrimination and exclusion.

  I think that if Judge Thomas' approach had been the prevailing
one during this period, we would have been left with slogans and
with very superficial catch lines and buzz words to describe very
complex situations.

  For example, in school desegregation, the Supreme Court was not
responding to an abstraction, when it voted in Green v. New Kent
County, to require school boards to do more than just sit on their
hands, when they had been involved in years, decades of intention-
al segregation. That was as pragmatic response, it was responsive
to the realities.
                                               33

  Now, with respect to Judge Thomas' distinctions, I have to
admit, Senator, that I have tried very hard to understand those dis-
tinctions and they continue to elude me, as well.

  Yale Law School has had an affirmative action program for a
number of years, and the idea is, given the fact that in this country
there has been a systematic exclusion of minorities and women
from legal education and other types of higher education, it was
necessary for institutions to reach out and find qualified individ-
uals and bring them in, because doing it by the numbers, putting
them through a computer would not produce that result.

  I think the situation is the same, when we talk about Santa
Clara County and the Johnson case. Over 250 men were employed
in that agency, and no woman had ever had a supervisor job. For
us to think only in terms of the individual and not see that institu-
tional context, it seems to me is to miss the reality that the law
ought to respond to.

  I think that Justice O'Connor was correct, when she talked about
Justice Scalia's appearing to write on a clean slate in dealing with
these issues. I think that is Judge Thomas' inclination, to write on
clean slates, with no history, with no background, with no reality
to guide his responses.

  Now, with respect to the Voting Rights Act, he apparently agrees
with all of the decisions that have been mentioned to him in these
hearings, although he made a categorical statement of opposition
to what was happening in the voting rights area.

  He did say he was opposed to the effects test. I do not know ex-
actly what he means by that, but you know, Senator Kennedy, that
the Congress struggled with that issue and arrived at the position
that, given the continuation of very deeply imbedded evidence of
discrimination and vestiges of discrimination, it was necessary to
provide some trigger to identify where minorities probably would
continue to be excluded from the political process, and that was
necessary in 1982, and I would expect that the Congress will look
again to determine whether new responses are necessary to re-
spond to new problems. I do not see Judge Thomas doing that.

  Mr. LAWRENCE. I would add to this, Senator Kennedy, in re-
sponse to the first part of your question, what would this look like,
I recall being here in Washington for the argument of the Bakke
case, that Professor Cox began his oral argument by pointing out
that if the Supreme Court were to decide that voluntary affirma-
tive action were improper on behalf of universities, that we would
return to a time when our campuses were lily white, and I think
that one of the changes might have been that Clarence Thomas
would not have been at the Yale Law School, were his policies im-
plemented by the Supreme Court at an earlier time.

  The other thing that I want to point out that troubles me about
the distinction between the education cases and the employment
cases is that those of us who have litigated employment cases on
the front line know that these cases, that even the voluntary pro-
grams are in response to deeply imbedded discriminatory practices
and attitudes, that are not attitudes that people state purposely,
but are, nonetheless, deeply imbedded in the attitudes in the insti-
tutions.
                                                34

  It seems to me that, if anything, as important as it is to integrate
our educational institutions, that it is the working people, that it is
the kind of people that Senator Specter and Senator Heflin and
other people have questioned how--what is it about this young
man who drops out of school or the young woman who drops out of
school in the 10th grade, that is the person who needs to be inte-
grated into our workforce.

  To my mind, if anything, it is more important to apply these
principles in the employment cases, at the entry level of employ-
ment and promotion and employment, than it is, even as important
as it is in education.

  Mr. EDLEY. May I make two very brief points, Mr. Chairman?
The two points are this: In these areas that we have just been talk-
ing about, I believe that Judge Thomas stands quite some distance
from the mainstream on civil rights. And the second point is that I
believe he stands quite some distance specifically from Congress
and a willingness to embrace congressional intent.

  For example, I combed the transcripts as best I could, particular-
ly the colloquies with Senator Specter, and I could not find any re-
assurance on the question on his interpretation of title VII. As far
as I can tell, he believes that title VII requires race neutrality. He
believed that that ought to be the law, while recognizing that the
courts have held otherwise.

  But there is nothing to suggest from the transcripts that I have
been able to find that he doesn't still believe that title VII ought to
be interpreted so as to require race neutrality, certainly in the vol-
untary context and perhaps at least in substantial areas of the re-
medial context.

  He has the same attitude, as far as I can tell, with respect to the
14th amendment. A constitutional ruling from a Justice Thomas
could not be reversed, no matter how many times you passed a
civil rights restoration act.

  So it seems to me that in terms of his distance from the main-
stream and his continuing and repeated resistance to the most rea-
sonable interpretation of congressional will, Judge Thomas simply
doesn't deserve confirmation.

  Senator KENNEDY. Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I understood from Senator
Biden we were going to limit the witnesses to 5 minutes. Now, I
don't want to complain, but these witnesses have all gone over 5
minutes. And I understood further from Senator Biden you are
going to cut the committee members from 10 to 5 minutes. Is that
your understanding?
  Senator KENNEDY. The witnesses for 5 minutes and the question-
ing for 10.
  Senator THURMOND. Senator Biden didn't change the 10 to 5?
  Senator KENNEDY. That is my understanding, and I want to say
that they have been responsive to questions. No one is interested in
delaying this hearing. And if there is some, then I will be glad to
take another round.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, I understand we have about 85 wit-
nesses to hear. Now, is it going to be the intent just to carry this
hearing on and on, or bring it to a conclusion?
                                          35
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think Senator Biden has responded to
that. He indicated he--we went late into the evening last evening,
as you remember, Senator. Do you remember how late we went?
We went late into the evening. And I am sure that the committee
will go and have a full day.
  I want to thank these witnesses for very responsive answers, and
we have every intention of moving the hearing along.
  Do you have any questions?
  Senator THURMOND. Well, I just want to say, if you are going to
say 5 minutes, make it 5 minutes. If you are going to make it 7
minutes, make it 7 minutes. You went over and they went over,
too.
  I thank you for your presence. I have no questions.
  Senator KENNEDY. Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Yes. I want to thank the witnesses for their testi-
mony.
  One of my Senate colleagues said it is not clear where Judge
Thomas will go, but up to this point, he has had to basically follow
the Reagan administration line; now he is going to be a free
person; I think because of his background he will be doing the
right thing.
  How would you respond to my colleague?
  Mr. EDLEY. The problem that I have with the question, Senator,
is that it contains an assumption with respect to the burden of
proof and the burden of persuasion--the burden of production and
the burden of persuasion here.
  It seems to me the administration and the nominee have the re-
sponsibility of persuading you that the nominee ought to be con-
firmed. It is not, it seems to me, for you to guess as to whether or
not the nominee has an acceptably mainstream constitutional
vision. It is the purpose of the confirmation process, it seems to me,
to detect what that constitutional vision is.
  Now, background and character are not a substitute for constitu-
tional vision. As I said in my remarks, the character, integrity did
not prevent Dred Scott or Plessy or Lochner.
  In the discussion yesterday, for example, that Senator Specter
began over various national security matters--war powers, Korea,
and so forth--I was looking for the constitutional vision. Not that
the question can be simply answered, but some sense of what are
the principles that will inform a Justice Thomas as he struggles
with the imponderable issues that are put before a Supreme Court.
  I saw no indication that he has a framework for approaching
constitutional issues. I saw artful ways of largely evading the ques-
tion. Eventually, after a belabored discussion, he reached out for
the political question doctrine, but I don't understand why the po-
litical question doctrine ought to apply or how it would be evaluat-
ed. There is simply nothing there, and character cannot fill in the
blanks.
  Mr. DAYS. Let me add, Senator Simon, that in my earlier com-
ments I pointed to his role as a civil rights enforcement officer in
the Government. He was not just any bureaucrat. And I think that
it is some indication of his values and the standards and his world
view that he took such a harsh position in opposition to existing
                                              36

law, as I indicated, solutions that the courts and administrative
agencies had developed in response to real problems.

   Now, there are debatable points in the voting rights area, in the
school desegregation areas, and in the employment area. But I join
Professor Edley in thinking that there is nothing that has come out
of his writings and in his statements that suggests the framework
that he would use for going about deciding some of these issues.
There tends to be a very superficial and sloganistic approach that
he demonstrates to these very complex and profound issues. And
given this background, I have no reason to think, in light of that
world view, that if he were to get on to the Court that that process
would not continue. It has very little to do with the fact that he
was one of the President's men. It has to do with how he views the
world and what values and what mode of analysis he uses. And I
think that mode of analysis is terribly flawed.

  Mr. LAWRENCE. I would add, Senator Simon, that I think another
thing to look at, when one says, well, after all, he was a member of
the administration, he had to take the administration line, that I
look to more than that. Certainly in his responsibilities as a
member of the administration there are certain areas in which one
might do this.

  On the other hand, most of his writings, most of his speeches
were outside of the context of his role as a member of that adminis-
tration.

  If we look at other individuals who have served in these roles, if
we look, for instance, at William Coleman, who was a member of
the Cabinet, and look at the difference between his life outside of
his position as a Cabinet member, the positions that he took, they
are vastly different in terms of his concern for the very kinds of
issues that would touch those people at the beginning of Judge
Thomas' life than Judge Thomas' activities have been. And I am
concerned about those persons and those groups and those ideas
that he chose to foster, even outside of the scope of his responsibil-
ities in the administration.

  Senator SIMON. Since we have three academicians here, let me
pose a question because this really is part of a bigger package in
terms of the administration. Several of us on this committee serve
on another committee dealing with the whole education field, and
the chairman of that committee is here.

  We have seen in recent months the administration using the
civil rights laws to question the legality of minority scholarships.
We have the Department of Education using their legal authority
in accrediting agencies--which we gave to them so that some of
these fly-by-night schools could be eliminated from getting any Fed-
eral assistance--all of a sudden saying to one of the major accredit-
ing agencies in this Nation, "For you to require diversity on college
campuses is beyond your prerogative." In both cases, I don't think
anyone in Congress ever dreamed of anything like this.

  My question to you is: Do you believe that your universities le-
gitimately should be asking for diversity and pushing for it? And,
No. 2, is there a legitimate reason for accrediting agencies to be
pushing for diversity on campuses?

  Mr. LAWRENCE. I think, Senator, that the answer to both of those
questions for me is yes. It is important to remember--and I think
                                         37

too many people have forgotten--that we are not so far away from
Brown v. Board of Education, that we have not reached a place
where these institutions are meaningfully integrated, certainly not
at the levels of faculty and administration and not even at the
levels of our students. As I have pointed out, without this push, as
you indicated, to make our campuses more reflective of the larger
society, those campuses would once again be lily white to a large
extent.

  And I think that it is both important as a moral consideration,
as a policy consideration, for universities to continue to advance
programs that ensure the diversity of those student bodies and
their faculties, and that it is extremely important for the Con-
gress--and the administration should support the Congress in that
effort--to take whatever steps are necessary to support that effort
by funding and by the use of the sanction of denying funds to those
universities who do not make those kinds of efforts in the correct
way.

  Mr. DAYS. I agree with Professor Lawrence. I would just add that
it is important, in my estimation, for efforts in the diversity area
and in the minority scholarship area to be thoughtful and tailored
to various situations. Of course, Congress has to legislate for the
entire Nation, but it seems to me that institutions that are trying
to reach out to minorities and women and bring them in and make
certain that minority children get real opportunity, should be sen-
sitive to the realities of their communities, the needs of their insti-
tutions and so forth.

  In other words, I am not in favor of boilerplate responses by in-
stitutions to some of these problems, but I think again we have to
recognize that these responses--minority scholarships and the push
for diversity--those responses are against a backdrop of years and
years of exclusion. And as I indicated earlier, if we are going to
change the situation, there has to be this extra effort. There has to
be a reaching out. It can't be done, as some people have suggested,
by looking at poverty, for example, because in raw numbers there
are more poor nonminorities than minorities. So that is not the
answer to the problem of how do we change the traditional exclu-
sive and exclusionary nature of many of our institutions.

  Senator SIMON. Professor Edley.
  Mr. EDLEY. I would just underscore that the impulse to press for
diversity in these institutions and through these various mecha-
nisms is a very good one, is a very noble one. And the impulse can
be implemented well or not so well. So I hope the committee under-
stands that for all three of us, as we speak in favor of these diversi-
ty measures, that is not to say that all ways of going about the
search for diversity would make sense.
  I would not be for rigid quotas in the education context any more
than I am for them in the context of Supreme Court nominees.
  Senator SIMON. And no one is suggesting that.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Lawrence, beginning with you, you have identified
Judge Thomas' nomination as political, which I think is true, but I
think it is not surprising that the President would seek an African-
                                               38

American who is conservative and an African-American who is
black. One of the difficulties is that there ought to be more people
with the kind of credentials which you men and Judge Thomas
have as part of the Government, part of the pool for selection for
the Supreme Court, and I say this in a context that struck me right
after I graduated from law school and joined a big law firm in
Philadelphia. I saw the commitment of all the brains and talent to
the profession, where there was money and there was prestige and
there was an unwillingness to be a committee man or to be an as-
sistant district attorney and to work up in the political ranks.

  So, this is not a bad place to say that Government needs the kind
of talent which Judge Thomas and you men bring, but into the po-
litical arena, because that is where appointments are made.

  Professor Lawrence, now for the question after the comment:
You criticized Judge Thomas for being on the radical right, and he
opposes class preferences, because--and this appears in a Yale
Review--he says they are bad for the beneficiaries, class prefer-
ences, because it tells them that they are in need of handouts, it
tells them they are disabled and it is an affront to their dignity,
and it is bad for individuals displaced, because they are displaced
by a preference which is not based on merit and it increases racial
divisiveness and is bad for the country.

  Now, aside from whether you agree with that--and I think those
are pretty strong arguments--can you say, Professor Lawrence,
that they do not have at least sufficient merit for a reasonable man
like Judge Thomas to hold them?

  Mr. LAWRENCE. I think that the arguments that you have made
in your quote, that you noted that Judge Thomas has made, are
reasonable arguments, that they have merit. I think that if you
were to give me time, I would have responses to each of those argu-
ments which also have a great deal of merit, which I might think
have more merit, but I think that those are not the kinds of things
I was referring to when I said that Judge Thomas, among this
group of African-Americans who have come to the Government,
even African-Americans who are Republicans, that I think Judge
Thomas in many of his other statements has been considerably fur-
ther from the mainstream than many of these other individuals.

  I think that the particular quote that you give to me is a quote
which reasonable persons have indicated and believe in. I would
differ with their interpretation of where to put the weight on those
things about where the divisiveness really comes from, whether it
comes from the programs themselves or the way those programs
are used by certain people to divide people, about whether one nec-
essarily feels that one is inferior because one is given support that
other people are not given. Certainly, I do not find the officers of
the savings and loans feeling inferior, because Congress has sup-
ported their activities.

  I think I could respond to those, but the activities I was referring
to were the activities and the ideas with respect to natural law,
were the condemnation of mainstream Supreme Court opinions,
such as Griggs and Swan, were the support of dissenting opinions
by Justice Scalia. I think these are indications of an adherence to a
judicial philosophy, to a political philosophy that is considerably to
                                              39

the right of even African-Americans, other African-Americans who
have done their yeoman's work within the Republican Party.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I am going to take that as a qualified yes.
A reasonable man could hold the views which he articulated, and I
am not saying that there are not arguments on the other side.

  It has been a regret of mine in these hearings that so much time
has been spent on repeating the same questions and talking about
natural law, which was a fraction, a tiny part of what he had to
say, really only on the Declaration of Independence as an answer
to slavery, and a little bit on economics. The area where he had so
much to contribute was on affirmative action, and we touched on it
almost not at all.

  But I have cited his statements and I think that they are very
reasonable, and I think it is very healthy to put these forward in
our society. Speaking for myself, and I am not making a commit-
ment here, I do not put them in the radical right.

  Professor Edley, let me take up a question with you, and then I
have one question for Professor Days. You say, Professor Edley,
that he does not have a background and character with a sufficient
constitutional vision, and you say that it is not the character of the
man, but it is the character of the record.

  I would respectfully--I will not say I disagree, let us just discuss
it for a minute.

  Mr. EDLEY. YOU don't have to ask me a question, Senator, if you
do not

  Senator SPECTER. I know I don't have to. I have a right to remain
silent, and so forth, but I have a very serious question to ask. I
hope all of my questions are serious.

  We have had a nominee who has come forward here who per-
haps, as a hypothesis, has campaigned for the Supreme Court. Pro-
fessor Kurland came forward in one of our confirmation hearings, I
forget which one it was, and said that the nominee had gone from
podium to podium campaigning for the Supreme Court, and I asked
him if there was anything wrong with that. Some of the people on
this side of the table do that all the time.

  You have a man who put in his writings, Judge Thomas has, in
order to be within the Republican Party, a litmus test was to be
against affirmative action and against welfare, a lot of questions
we did not have a chance to ask him. I would suggest to you that
his character is shown more by his roots than by these writings,
and even in these writings, in 1983 he favored flexible goals and
timetables, and in 1988 he opposed them.

  Why not rely upon the character, which I think came through
very positively for Clarence Thomas here? I do not think his writ-
ings did, his writings were inconsistent with what he said, problem-
some, but his character was undeniably strong and laudable. Why
not rely on the character, which had been with Judge Thomas a lot
longer than those writings?

  Mr. EDLEY. At the risk of repeating myself, and I hope this will
be responsive, character is not irrelevant, by any means. What I
am urging, however, is that character, the determination that the
nominee has good character, high integrity, is not a substitute for
discerning the nominee's constitutional vision.
                                              40

   I am quite confident that your predecessors in the Senate, when
they confirmed Justices in the past, believed them, by and large, to
be men and woman of high character, and yet we have had some
very serious constitutional missteps in this country, and character
did not prevent Plessy v. Ferguson.

  So, while not excluding the importance of character and, indeed,
the importance of diversity, it seems to me your fundamental task,
respectfully, is to discern that constitutional vision, and it seems to
me we look and we look and it is simply not to be found.

  I disagree somewhat with your assertion, Senator, that his views
with respect to affirmative action in racial issues, preferences and
so forth, are reasonable. This reminds me very much of Professor
Michelman's distinction last night between dogmatic and pragmat-
ic.

  In most of his writings and speeches, Judge Thomas only talks
about the costs, and I agree with Professor and Lawrence and with
you, that the costs identified by Judge Thomas are serious ones,
but a pragmatic approach would also look at the benefits and
would undertake willingly the difficult task of balance in particu-
lar circumstances how the costs and benefits compare.

  A dogmatist, which Judge Thomas has shown himself to be in
this area, would only focus on one side of the equation and would
use that dogmatism, it seems to me, to interpret statutes and,
indeed, interpret the Constitution in a way that is outside the
mainstream. Character, acknowledging that he has a great charac-
ter, it seems to me does not undo that difficulty for me.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Professor.
  Mr. Chairman, I have a question for Professor Days, but I will
wait for when my turn comes around, because the red light is on.
  Senator KENNEDY. Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. I do not have any questions.
  Senator KENNEDY. I just have one, but we will come back to Sen-
ator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. DO you want to ask yours first?
  Senator KENNEDY. I recognize Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I would like to welcome you all here again.
Mr. Days, it is nice to see you again.
  Mr. DAYS. It is good to see you.
  Senator HATCH. I appreciated it when you served here and I have
great respect for you, as you know, and for each of you.
  I would like to ask the witnesses about affirmative action and
the differences on this issue between Judge Thomas and others
who might be called the traditional civil rights leadership.
  Now, my purpose, in this limited timeframe in which we have so
many more witnesses to follow, is not to argue the merits of the
difference, but to try to identify the difference clearly. Now, would
you all agree with me that Judge Thomas has supported that form
of affirmative action aimed at increasing the numbers of minorities
and women recruited into an employer's applicant pool, steps like
advertising in the media that primarily reach minorities and
women, recruiting at schools and colleges with primarily minority
and women enrollment, and other similar steps? Would any of you
disagree that he has at least done that?
                                              41

  Mr. DAYS. I followed his testimony and I know something about
his practices, and certainly he has said here that he is in favor of
those techniques, and I do not doubt that response.

  Senator HATCH. In the EEOC, under his jurisdiction, they have
been forcing business that have not been doing right to use those
techniques.

  Mr. DAYS. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. DO you disagree with that, Professor Edley?
  Mr. EDLEY. NO, I do not disagree, I just do not understand his
position. I do not understand how he distinguishes his support for
that form of affirmative action from his opposition to stronger
forms of affirmative action.
  Senator HATCH. YOU mean quotas
  Mr. EDLEY. I do not understand it, but I agree with your state-
ment.
  Senator HATCH. YOU means quotas and preferences?
  Mr. EDLEY. NO, I mean--no, I don't mean quotas and preferences.
I mean more affirmative steps, I mean goals, flexible goals.
  Senator HATCH. When I discussed it with him last week, he cov-
ered everything except quotas and preferences.
  Let me go to you, Professor Lawrence. Do you agree that he basi-
cally has been for those type of approaches?
  Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, as far as I am able to determine from his
testimony and earlier writings, that the limited approaches he
  Senator HATCH. I presume, from your testimony here today, you
have examined his service at the EEOC?

   Mr. LAWRENCE. Yes, I did.

  Senator HATCH. And certainly, if it stands for anything, it stands
for that, plus many, many other things. But under this form of af-
firmative action, once these steps are taken to widen the applicant
pool, and then the actual decision to hire or promote is to be made
without regard to race or gender on a nondiscriminatory basis, that
has been his position.

  I might add that another form of affirmative action goes beyond
this, and tell me, if you will, if this is a fair summary: This form of
affirmative action takes race and gender into account in the actual
selections for training, hiring and promotion. Here the persons pre-
ferred for these selections would not have obtained them, but for
their race or gender.

  Now, this kind of affirmative action is sometimes justified as a
voluntary effort to reach some level of racial and gender parity in
a job, including, but not limited to jobs where there are few or no
minorities or women. Now, here in these cases there is no finding
of discrimination against the employer.

  The other justification for this form of affirmative action is as a
remedy, after a finding that the employer engaged in egregious,
persistent, intentional discrimination. Now, the persons who lose
out may have greater seniority, as in the Weber case, or are regard-
ed as better qualified, even if only slightly so.

  Now, Judge Thomas, it is clear from his testimony here and his
speeches and efforts in the past, he has criticized this form of af-
firmative action, and I take it that many in the traditional civil
rights leadership favor that type of affirmative action.
                                                 42

  Now, is this difference the heart of the affirmative action dis-
agreement with Judge Thomas by the traditional civil rights lead-
ership in the country?

  Would you say that, Drew?
  Mr. DAYS. Senator Hatch, it is a pleasure to see you again.
  Senator HATCH. Nice to see you.
  Mr. DAYS. YOU asked a very complex question. I will try to re-
spond as briefly as I can.
  There are, if we want to do it roughly, two types of affirmative
action. One is voluntary affirmative action and the other is remedi-
al affirmative action.
  Senator HATCH. And he seems to be totally for the voluntary
type, except for this preference.
  Mr. DAYS. Well, I don't want to speak for Professor Edley, but I
think as a legal and constitutional matter, if for recruitment pur-
poses one uses race or sex as a criterion, it really is, as a theoreti-
cal matter, just like a quota. Because you are using race to extend
benefits to one group that you wouldn't extend to another.
  Senator HATCH. SO that you are leaving the decision as to hiring
the person best qualified for the job to the individual employer, the
promotion and other type decisions?
  Mr. DAYS. I understand those practical considerations, but I just
wanted to point out that at every point in the spectrum of affirma-
tive action, from the softest recruitment affirmative action to what
we call quotas--and I don't use that term pejoratively. I think in
some instances, as the Supreme Court has said, quotas are the only
way to go, and I am talking about the hiring of qualified people.
  Senator HATCH. If I can interrupt you for just one second
  Senator KENNEDY. Can he finish?
  Senator HATCH. He can finish. We are having a dialog.
  Senator KENNEDY. Yes, but let me--I would like to hear it. That
was a very interesting question. I would like Mr. Days' response to
all of it.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I would, too. I just wondered if at that par-
ticular point--do you mind if I interrupt you?
  Mr. DAYS. NO. That is quite all right.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I mind if he interrupts, but that doesn't
seem to make much difference here.
  Senator HATCH. I don't care if you mind. [Laughter.] It makes no
difference if you mind, as far as I am concerned.
  The point I am making is, yes, that may be true, but there is a
difference. In the other kind, the kind that we are talking about, it
extends it to where there may be innocent persons who are dis-
criminated against in what is called reverse discrimination.
  Mr. DAYS. Right.
  Senator HATCH. Where in the other situation, that isn't necessar-
ily so. But go ahead.
  Mr. DAYS. Well, I won't debate that point with you, Senator. I
could, but I--I think that in the voluntary area, we face a situation
where the Congress has effectively said for a number of years that
we would like to encourage voluntary solutions to problems of dis-
crimination in this society. So we don't want to incapacitate em-
ployers from reaching out and in some instances, given the nature
of their situation--for example, if an employer looks at his or her
                                             43

work force and sees that there are no blacks and there are no
women in a community where there appear to be quite qualified
pools of blacks and women, then I think Congress has indicated
and the Supreme Court has indicated that that employer should
reach out.

  Now, the employer may use race or sex as part of the process,
but I think that is consistent with title VII. If Judge Thomas dis-
agrees with that--and I believe he does under those circum-
stances

  Senator HATCH. He does.
  Mr. DAYS [continuing]. I think he is wrong and he is uninformed
about the reality out there that Congress certainly understood
when it enacted title VII.
  Now, getting to the question of hiring and training and promo-
tion, it seems to me that in remedying--and this gets back to some-
thing that Professor Edley said. In remedying discrimination, there
may be instances where so-called innocent people will be harmed.
But that is not something unusual in our society. We have, for ex-
ample, veteran's preferences, and no one says when the veteran
comes back, Look, you can't get your job back because someone
who didn't go to fight has it now. We say, Sorry, you have that job,
you who stayed around, you did a good job, but we have a higher
societal value that we want to achieve, that we want to reach. And
it seems to me that remedying discrimination in employment and
in our society generally is something that has to have a higher
value in this society than just ordinary considerations.
  In fact, it seems to me that Judge Thomas at the EEOC really
recognized this problem and responded to it, but has not admitted
in his writings and has not admitted to this committee that he has
done so. When he switched from so-called class action suits to indi-
vidual suits, what he said through the EEOC was: If we find a
person who has been discriminated against, we are going to do the
best job we can to put that person in the job that he or she was
entitled to.
  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Mr. DAYS. Without regard for who is in the position. And so we
might have a male or a woman in that position, and as I read the
EEOC statement, that person might be displaced. Not necessarily,
but in doing that, Judge Thomas surprisingly was acting in con-
formity with what other administrative agencies have done and
what the courts have done.
   I don't think we have a situation where courts willy-nilly bump
incumbent employees in order to remedy acts of discrimination.
There are all kinds of techniques that are used.
  My last comment, Senator, really picks up on something that
Senator Specter asked, and that is the reasonableness of Judge
Thomas' position. And I want to say that it is reasonable and one
can discuss these, but what is surprising, and I think disappointing,
about Judge Thomas' record is that he is asking questions that
people who are totally uninformed ask. They are not wrong ques-
tions to ask, but he has been there. He has been working in the
EEOC. He has seen these cases. And yet he comes up with the
same questions that someone who is naive in this area would ask,
and the answers that he gives are answers that have been already
                                                 44

thought of, they have been tried, and in some instances they just
have not worked. And yet he continued as Chairman of the EEOC
to promote these so-called alternatives.

  For example, criminal penalties in employment cases. I don't
think that is a very good idea, but I think the test is that he never
once, to my knowledge, proposed to Congress through his own ad-
ministration that efforts be made to amend title VII to provide
that remedy.

  Senator HATCH. Well, my time is about up, so let me just make
these comments. The distinguishing feature, it seems to me, is that
you did make the comment that in those cases where there has
been discrimination, he has been bringing individual cases, and I
think rightly so. But we are talking--the real distinction between
Clarence Thomas and, say, traditional civil rights leadership, in-
cluding yourself and the other two professors here, is that he
doesn't believe anybody should be discriminated against through
reverse discrimination if we have other means to resolve these
problems. And he suggests that those means are that if we have a
situation where there has been intentional discrimination, then we
ought to have fines or we ought to have jail terms for that type of
activity--which I think would get to the bottom of this a lot
quicker than, say, allowing discrimination against a totally inno-
cent third party, be that party of any particular race of gender.

  So I think we both will admit there is a legitimate argument on
both sides of this issue. It is very complex. It is very difficult. And I
think he, along with you, choosing different paths, are trying to get
to the problem of discrimination in our society in the very best way
that he thinks possible. You disagree with him; he disagrees with
you.

  I happen to believe there is no justification to discriminate
against anybody where you do not have intentional discrimination.

  Mr. DAYS. Well, Senator, I don't think anybody in what I suppose
Judge Thomas would call the orthodox camp in this regard wants
to latch on to affirmative action remedies when there are other al-
ternatives that would do the job. That has not been the inclination
of civil rights organizations or people who are bringing these cases.
I also think that there is room for debate in these areas.

  But I think it is incumbent upon people who enter the debate to
come to that debate informed, and certainly in some many respects
Judge Thomas, even if he knows what is going on, has not revealed
that publicly and he has not revealed it here in these hearings.
And that is what makes me very uncomfortable.

  Senator HATCH. I think those are good comments, except for one
thing: I think everything he did at the EEOC does--I am going to
challenge my good friend from Massachusetts. It may be that the
way around this reverse discrimination approach, this discrimina-
tion against purely innocent people just because we have a desire
to resolve some of the racial conflicts in America--and we all have
that desire--that instead of discriminating against solely innocent
people or completely innocent people who really have not partici-
pated in the discrimination and causing them reverse discrimina-
tion, maybe what Clarence Thomas has done for us here in these
hearings is very valid. And maybe what Senator Kennedy and I
and others need to do is to provide a change in title VII whereby if
                                                 45

employers are going to discriminate or are not going to do the
things that are right for society, that we do have fines in extreme
cases where it is highly justified, perhaps even criminal sanctions.

  So I am going to look at that, and--look at him. He is already
starting to gear up. You can just see it.

  Senator KENNEDY. That was already in our civil rights bill, Sena-
tor, for intentional discrimination

  Senator HATCH. For intentional discrimination.
  Senator KENNEDY. Particularly against women and also disabil-
ity.
  Senator HATCH. Yes, but we opposed the anti
  Senator KENNEDY. It is also in Senator Danforth's bill. So we will
welcome you taking a good look at
  Senator HATCH. Well, as you know, I did.
  Senator KENNEDY. I am not going to tell Senator Thurmond that
you are over either.
  Senator HATCH. All right. As you know
  Senator KENNEDY. I promise not to tell him because
  [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. AS you know, I did
  Senator THURMOND. I think you ought to call the time on every-
body who goes over so we can get through the hearings.
  Senator KENNEDY. Look over on your right there
  Senator HATCH. And just remember
  Senator THURMOND. When you are the chairman, you control it.
  Senator KENNEDY. I did not with
  Senator HATCH. If I could just add one last thing.
  Senator KENNEDY. I guess you will.
  Senator HATCH. In the civil rights bill--it is only fair.
  In the civil rights bill, I did oppose the preferential aspects, al-
though I tried to resolve it myself and miserably failed. And I com-
mend Senator Danforth for his efforts, and thus far it is still not
quite there. But hopefully we will get that resolved. Maybe this is
something we can put in that will resolve it, because it is not in
there in the form that I think it should be in.
  But I appreciated the discussion, and I appreciate having you
here.
  Senator KENNEDY. I just have one brief question, and then I will
recognize Senator Specter and anyone else. Just one clarification
and then a question.
  As I understand it, Professor Days, you felt so strongly about
Judge Thomas' nomination that you withdrew from participation
as a reader for the ABA Committee that testified yesterday. Is that
correct?
  Mr. DAYS. That is correct.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let me just ask this question and then a brief
comment from all the panelists. Some people argue that it is im-
portant that a black American sit on the Supreme Court, and that
if Judge Thomas is not confirmed, it is highly unlikely that Presi-
dent Bush will nominate another black American.
  What weight do you give that in terms of the support for Justice
Thomas? Professor Lawrence, maybe we will go the other way this
time.
                                             46

   Mr. LAWRENCE. I think that I certainly would feel that it would
be a tragedy if President Bush, because we found his first African-
American nominee wanted, would not choose from among a wealth
of other African-American nominees who we would find to be quite
ready to support, even from his own party. So I think that would
be a tragedy if this were used in this way.

  At the same time, I also feel that, as retired Justice Thurgood
Marshall admonished us upon his retirement, the important issue
here is not the color of the nominee's skin in terms of a voice for
our community, but the nature of that voice. So that, for me, I
think that certainly I would hope that the President would find an-
other nominee from within the African-American community, and
there are many, many who I feel are extensively more experienced,
extensively more qualified than Judge Thomas.

  At the same time, I feel that if I am given the choice of a person
who shares with me only the color of my skin and a person who
will speak for the interest of my community, I will choose the
latter.

  Mr. EDLEY. I would paraphrase some responses to this that were
given in a report issued by the Congressional Black Caucus Foun-
dation recently. Diversity is important, and we do value the goal of
having an African-American on the Court; but we do not value it
above all else, and we don't value it above some of the principles
that we have been discussing on this panel.

  It seems to me that the choice is not properly understood as take
this conservative black or a white conservative. It seems to me the
choice is between taking this very conservative black now or wait-
ing for another African-American or other minority of more main-
stream views, if not appointed by Mr. Bush then appointed by the
next President.

  I think on the scale of decades in which the Supreme Court oper-
ates, we are willing to be patient still.

  Senator KENNEDY. Dr. Days.
  Mr. DAYS. Senator Kennedy, as I indicated at the outset, this has
been a very difficult situation for, I think, most African-Americans
and most people of good will in this country, because it would give
me great pride to see another African-American sit on the Su-
preme Court; but to follow my colleagues on this panel, I want to
see something below the skin, beneath the skin that convinces me
that that person will be a voice and a vote for the people who are
voiceless and voteless on the Supreme Court, particularly during
this time on issues that are of critical importance to all of us and
issues that will affect us for as long as certainly the people on this
panel will be alive.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  Senator Specter, I see we have been joined by Senator Simpson. I
would be glad to recognize Senator Simpson, and then I think Sen-
ator Specter had a short
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. I think I will defer
to Senator Specter. He was here prior to my entrance, and I thank
you for your courtesy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                              47

  Professor Days, you said that Judge Thomas had asked naive
questions. Were you referring to his pushing the penalties and the
jail sentences on that?

  Mr. DAYS. Yes. Among other things. I am not talking about that
specifically, but certainly I could tell you why I think that has not
been effective.

   Senator SPECTER. Well, you had mentioned that in the context of
the naive questions, and it seems to me that the penalties and jail
sentences are a good idea. And when you say he hadn't suggested
them to Congress, I don't know about that. We did know about
them. He had written about them, and he testified that in the
Local 28 Union case he had asked the solicitor to ask for contempt
penalties in that case, so that he had moved forward in that direc-
tion.

   Before you said that, I had planned on the first round to ask you
a question which ties in with what you have just said. He has been
known to rely upon prestigious authority for his positions against
affirmative action because he quoted you. And that was what I
had

   Mr. DAYS. Out of context, Senator.
   Senator SPECTER. Excuse me?
   Mr. DAYS. Out of context.
   Senator SPECTER. Well, let's see about that. You don't know
which quote I am going to pick. I have got two here. I could go
either way.
   Well, he quotes you in a quote, so let's see if it is out of context.
One of the additional reasons--and when I talked to Professor
Lawrence, I didn't by any means cite them all as to his reasons on
affirmative action. And, again, I repeat, I think it is a great shame
we didn't spend some real time on this question because that is his
real area of expertise. And I think that is the real cutting edge of
this issue in American civil rights on giving people a chance to get
a job. If there is one question which deals with all of the problems
in the African-American community, drugs, crime, and housing
and advancement, it is jobs. And we have neglected it, and neglect-
ed it badly.
   But this is one of the additional reasons that he advanced on the
subject of his opposition to affirmative action. In the Yale Law and
Policy Review, he says, "Moreover, the approval of goals and time-
tables allows yet-undetected discriminators to create a numerical
smokescreen for their past or present violations." Then he quotes
in a footnote, "Professor Drew Days III, Assistant U.S. Attorney for
Civil Rights during the Carter administration, believes that the af-
firmative action plan in United Steelworkers v. Weber was adopted
by Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp., at least in part to"--and
then he quotes you--purports to quote you--"divert attention from
the fact that it had long been engaged in discriminatory employ-
ment practices that violated Federal law." He cites a Yale Law
Journal article of yours.
   My first question to you--well, let's deal with the substance of it.
Do you think that that is a valid argument that discriminators do
divert attention away from their prior bad conduct by adopting af-
firmative action plans, which is the argument Judge Thomas
makes?
                                              48

   Mr. DAYS. I don't think that that is a common situation. I was
talking about a specific case, the Weber case, where I felt--indeed,
argued as part of the Carter administration in that case that there
was evidence of intentional discrimination and we should be care-
ful not to let employers put forward affirmative action plans to
hide more deep-seated discrimination and come up with remedies
for that discrimination. So it wasn't either/or. My whole article is
about tailored responses to situations of discrimination. And there
may be some situations where it is necessary to have very hard
numbers as a remedy; in others it may be recruitment, it may be
spreading the word.

  So I really think that that quotation was taken out of context,
and that is why I said what I said. I don't think that it is a wide-
spread practice of employers to use affirmative action plans to hide
their intentional discrimination. I think what they are doing, with
the encouragement of this Congress and, in the past, administra-
tive agencies, is trying to deal with their own discrimination before
the sheriff knocks on the door. And I think that is a commendable
thing. But I think that they should respond to their history of dis-
crimination and exclusion in a way that is tailored to their particu-
lar circumstances.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, he doesn't say that you said it was a
widespread practice. What he says you said was that it diverts at-
tention from the fact that they had been long engaged in discrimi-
natory employment practices that violated Federal law.

  Mr. DAYS. Let me give you one example of how that is dealt with,
Senator. There is something called the four-fifths rule that you are
probably familiar with in employment discrimination. It suggests
that if an employer has, let's say, minority or female employment
that is 80 percent of what it should be in that particular work
force, then Federal enforcement agencies may not go after that
particular employer. But it is made very clear in the uniform
guidelines that apparently Judge Thomas didn't like very well that
the law does not protect employers who simply go by the numbers;
that an individual who is excluded as a result of this approach has
a right to go into court and get a remedy. And in other administra-
tions, the Government has supported that type of effort.

  So I think that to the extent that employers do what is described,
there are remedies. That was not the issue I was dealing with in
my article, and Judge Thomas plucked that out to make a point
that apparently he was intent upon making.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, OK. Even if he plucked it out, didn't you,
in fact, say that it did divert attention from employers who had en-
gaged in discriminatory practices to then adopt affirmative action
plans?

  Mr. DAYS. I did say that, and I think there may be situations
that one has to be vigilant about, where an employer comes up and
says "I have an affirmative action plan. I can't be a discriminator."
And I think law enforcement officials and individuals and courts
have to look beyond that.

  Mr. LAWRENCE. Senator Specter
  Senator SPECTER. I won't pursue it further, but it seems to me a
fair reading of this is that he did not quote you out of context. But
I may be missing something.
                                              49

  Professor Lawrence.
  Mr. LAWRENCE. I just wanted to add something because I think
that this dialog, for me, gives us an opportunity to look at some-
thing that I think went unnoted in the discussion with Senator
Hatch.
  Senator SPECTER. Professor Lawrence, could I come back to you
for that? I just want to finish up with Professor Days on one point.
I would like to come back to you, if I may. Just one final question
for Professor Days and then we will come back to you, Professor
Lawrence.
  Professor Days, do you think that Judge Thomas is intellectually
and educationally qualified? And I ask you that because you are a
professor at the Yale Law School, and we are about to have the
dean of the Yale Law School testify in support of Professor
Thomas. And we haven't given very much attention to that in the
hearing, and I would be very interested in your evaluation as to
whether he is intellectually and educationally qualified for the Su-
preme Court.
  Mr. DAYS. My answer is, based upon the record as I have seen it,
that he is qualified. Certainly having gone to Yale Law School, I
could hardly be in a position to quarrel with that.
  Senator SPECTER. Good.
  Mr. DAYS. What I am interested in is how he used that educa-
tion.
  Senator SPECTER. On behalf of all the Yale Law School gradu-
ates.
  Mr. DAYS. Indeed.
  Senator SPECTER. Excuse me, Professor Lawrence. You had an
addendum?
  Mr. LAWRENCE. Right. The addendum I had, Senator Specter,
was that I think that rather simplistic dichotomy that Judge
Thomas and Senator Hatch have drawn between voluntary affirm-
ative action and affirmative action in response to identified dis-
crimination is troublesome for me and I think misleading. And I
think it ties in with the comment that Professor Days made in this
footnote, because I think that, as Professor Days noted, the Con-
gress in these cases like Weber has identified systemwide, systemat-
ic discrimination in certain industries, and sees that, as a pragmat-
ic matter, this discrimination cannot be ended. We do not have the
resources to bring case after case, particularly individual case after
case. And when we can encourage employers to identify their own
past discrimination and enter into voluntary programs, that these
voluntary programs are, indeed, remedial. They are remedial of
and identify past discrimination by the employer who imposes it
upon oneself.
  Now, certainly there will be individual cases where the employer
may try to hide behind that, and it is up to the Government en-
forcement agencies to identify those. But I think it very important
to understand that voluntary affirmative action does not mean that
there has not been past discrimination.
   Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Professor Lawrence.
  Just one comment in concluding, Mr. Chairman. The yellow light
is on. I think it is important for people to focus--and it ought to be
said explicitly--that when help is given for those who are discrimi-
                                                 50

nated against, it is not only for justice for them, but it has very
broad societal benefit. It goes beyond the discriminated class. It
goes beyond African-Americans. It helps society as a whole. But
when you help African-Americans who are discriminated against
and bring them into a part of the share of the American livelihood,
and women, it helps us all. It tackles basic problems in the core
society. And too many people think of us against them. And when
you help the minorities, it is more than justice for them; it is a
benefit for all of us, what we are looking for.

  Thank you very much.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I welcome this panel. I see Drew Days, and I remember some
very delightful visits with him when I was a freshman U.S. Sena-
tor. This is a very impressive man, and he was very helpful to me
in my beginnings here. And I think he served with real distinction.
It is nice to see you again.
  Mr. DAYS. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. The other gentlemen, I know of your reputa-
tions and your interest, and you present things very crisply for us.
It is our job to do this advise and consent, and I know that you
have certainly been in the forefront of these things and these kinds
of hearings in the past.
  It is for us to do this process, and all of you have testified as to
the fact that he has this extraordinary early life experience, and
yet it doesn't seem to have done what should be done, or at least
given a result that you would like to see with regard to his writ-
ings and his commentaries and so on; that he has simply been a
good soldier in the Reagan-Bush administration, has not been too
forthcoming, has done little to help out those on the fringes of soci-
ety; and, of course, trying, as so many have, to put the test to him
on, you know, what would you decide with Roe v. Wade, what
would you do and go back and look at his commentaries on Brown
and many other cases.
  You all speak eloquently in support of affirmative action, and
you state your clear views on title VIII, and you talk about the
issue of economics versus these other things that are more person-
al. But one of the witnesses yesterday spoke of a study of what
characteristics a good Justice would have in common with some of
our fine Justices in the past, and the word "character" continued
to be used a great deal. Character Strength of character, if you
will, the most common attribute of our best Justices. And those
that perhaps came through the crucible of a life described as we
know it now of Justice Thomas, might be one who would have the
firmest and strongest character.
  Do you agree with that statement about character alone, not
about cases and the things to come and philosophies, but just plain
old character?
  Mr. DAYS. Senator, I think character is very important, but I am
at a loss as to how to accurately and predictably measure character
or the impact that character will have on the decisions and func-
tioning of the Supreme Court Justice.
                                          51

  What I have to rely upon is what a person has done and what a
person has said, and I might have some hopes harbored deep down
in me that that person will grow, that person may change, that
person may broaden his or her outlook, but that is pure speculation
on my part and I do not know whether that is a satisfactory basis
for making the decision to confirm somebody to the Supreme
Court.

  Mr. EDLEY. Senator, I would put it more strongly than Professor
Days. I think that good character and integrity are necessary, but
not sufficient. The good character will not predict whether or not a
Justice appointed in 1885 will work to usher in the Lochner era,
will vote in the majority in Plessyv. Ferguson. Character alone will
not be a good predictor of the constitutional vision that that Jus-
tice brings to the Court.

  So, while I certainly would urge the committee to satisfy itself
with respect to the nominee's character, I would also urge you to
discern his constitutional vision. It seems to me you have a respon-
sibility, in partnership with the President, to determine the course
of our constitutional history, to determine what vision will be rep-
resented on that Court, and if you focus exclusively on character, it
does not seem to me that you were discharging that shared respon-
sibility with the President.

  Senator SIMPSON. Professor Lawrence, do you have any thought
on that?

  Mr. LAWRENCE. I would only add, Senator Simpson, that, to my
mind, I have very little to go on in judging Judge Thomas' charac-
ter. I would certainly, as Professor Days has indicated and I indi-
cated in my opening statement, want to believe, very strongly want
to believe, as a fellow African-American, that this is a person of
the highest character.

  I think that it is true that when one, as you say, passes through
the crucible of American racism and poverty, that that can be a
character builder. I think that it can do other things, as well, that
we certainly have too much evidence in our community of people
whose character has been destroyed by that same experience. I am
not saying that is true of Judge Thomas. I believe that his charac-
ter is a good one, but I have very little evidence to know that,
except for the record, the public adult record. I cannot rely upon
just the fact that he has lived through this experience.

  Mr. DAYS. Senator, may I just add one brief footnote to my re-
marks

  Senator SIMPSON. Please.
  Mr. DAYS [continuing]. And that has to do with the function of a
Justice of the Supreme Court. When a new Justice gets into confer-
ence, I assume that his brothers and sisters will recognize that he
is a person of high character. The question is what kinds of argu-
ments is he going to make, what kinds of positions will he or she
take. Indeed, in opinions and dissents, how will that person express
himself or herself?
  We give character as the baseline, but it is how that Justice ex-
plains what is going on in the world and how the Constitution is
supposed to influence that. People will live or die, based upon not
his character, but how he views the law and how he thinks it ap-
plies to their situations.
                                          52
  Senator SIMPSON. I concur with that totally. I have been im-
pressed in my research and in the testimony of Judge Thomas that
the people that know him the very best are saying things about
him that I have never heard about anybody in my time here on
this panel, Democrat or Republican alike, under Jimmy Carter,
under Ronald Reagan, under George Bush.
  I have never heard those things said about a man by the people
who know him best, the people in the EEOC--and I went and vis-
ited with them, as I said before--people who worked with him, and
his degree of, an overworked word, sensitivity and compassion I
think is beyond commentary as to what he would do.
  He spoke eloquently of how the person facing abortion, what an
anguishing decision. He spoke eloquently of the criminals awaiting
justice in the system. To me, that is what it is all about. Is this a
man, when your case is being presented, who is going to listen, pay
attention, and then generate the motions of fairness and compas-
sion and sensitivity, love, caring, you know, the works, that is what
this is all about in my mind, not sterility, you know, of what he
might or might not do based upon this or that.
  Of course, you three have watched this confirmation process now
for years and know that we are slowly going to get to the point
where we will just not know anybody at all when they get here,
some big zip will be presented to us and we will mess around
trying to figure out who he or she is, and the more zip, the better
chance they will have--I mean zip in a zero, and not zip in spirit.
  Mr. DAYS. Senator, may I say one thing in that respect?
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes.
  Mr. DAYS. I have read all the transcripts of these proceedings
and seen some of them on television, and I was very affected, Sena-
tor, by your report of your visit to the EEOC. But I will tell you
something that sticks with me today and has troubled me through-
out these proceedings, and it has to do with--I know that you have
been crossing swords over the question of abortion, but I was
struck by the fact that Judge Thomas gave his speech in the Lew
Lehrman Auditorium to the Heritage Foundation, and he com-
mended the approach that Lewis Lehrman took, using natural
law--and, Senator Biden, I do not want to get into natural law, it
is another point.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is OK by me.
  Senator HATCH. It is OK by us, too. [Laughter.]
  Mr. DAYS. He was asked about this particular speech and wheth-
er he had read then or since Lewis Lehrman's speech, he said he
had not. Now, I put his comments about the importance of this
issue in our society and how it divides the society and how painful
it is for all of us to deal with, and some of us have had to deal with
the issue up close. For a person to talk about that issue, without
even having read the speech that asserted that a fetus was as
person, strikes me as not sensitive at all. It strikes me as the
height of insensitivity, given the tremendous emotion that is in-
vested in the issue of abortion in the society.
  Senator SIMPSON. I do hear that, but I think if you go look at his
testimony, you can see exactly what he explained as he was asked
about that speech, and it is funny to me how Lew Lehrman, you
know, somehow has been in his life and place on the scene has
                                          53
been distorted. He ran for the governorship in New York and
damn near beat Cuomo. I mean he is not some fellow that just, you
know, dropped down on the playing field and suddenly began to
babble conservative things. He presented himself in a way where I
believe that he got 49 percent of the vote in New York, or 48, in a
very spirited race with the present Governor.

  Anyway, I have much more and you are very good to respond,
and I thank you very much.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  I next recognize a fellow who 15 years ago probably never
thought that on his 58th birthday he would be sitting on a panel
about to ask questions of a nominee to the Supreme Court. Senator
Grassley, by the way, happy birthday.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you. I have no questions of this panel.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we should do this more often on his birth-
day. [Laughter.]
  I have been listening to the admonishments of the Senator from
South Carolina, who has been telling me--and he will tell me, I
assure you, throughout these hearings--that we should make them
move more rapidly. We are going to limit witnesses to 5 minutes,
and Senators to 10 minutes. It is important for Senators, like Sena-
tor Hatch, who have additional questions or comments to be able to
speak, notwithstanding the fact that we have a large witness list.
  So, I am going to recognize Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I have appreciated the testimony you brought here. We differ,
but that is what makes America great, too. One thing, though, I
did want to bring out is this issue of preferences. On the current
civil rights bill, there was an amendment, an anti-preference
amendment to do away with it. I voted for that. I have to say a
number of others voted against it and it was defeated.
  But Thomas' approach is that we should not have preferences on
a racial basis or on a gender basis or any other basis that discrimi-
nates against other people. And I am concerned about it, because
in this country today, almost everybody, one way or the other, has
faced that issue at one time or another in their lives, and it is cre-
ating difficulty and problems over America which I think, in a
sense, is creating even more unrest and distress.
  Mr. Days, as you know, I have a great deal of regard for you, and
I certainly respect both the others. I just do not know you as well
as I know Mr. Days. But I do not think that lumping veterans pref-
erences or welfare or food stamps or any number of other prefer-
ences that have given society into this particular discussion is cor-
rect, because, first of all, society does make preferences.
  We in many ways take care of the poor, the sick, the needy, per-
sons with disabilities, and those are preferences, but they are race
neutral preferences, and veterans preferences are race neutral
preferences. I think what Clarence Thomas is saying is, look, there
is no justification to ever have racial preferences based solely on
race or any kind of preferences based solely on what a person is or
is not in our society. That ultimately involves discrimination
against others.
                                          54

   Now, I think there are two interesting sides to this issue. If we
could solve it, you and I would be so happy, because it is one of the
real problems in our society today. I would like you, all three of
you, if you will--I have respect for your intellectual acumen, indi-
vidually--give some thought to how we might help everybody who
is disadvantaged, not just those who are African-Americans or His-
panic-Americans or Asian-Americans, or whatever, but everybody
who is disadvantaged, but at the same time really put some teeth
into stamping out discrimination by building upon maybe these
ideas that Clarence Thomas has, and others have, as well, to basi-
cally end discrimination through tougher penalties, rather than
discriminating against other people, through reverse discrimina-
tion.

  I think tougher penalties, either monetary sanctions or criminal
penalties, may be the real way to get to the bottom of discrimina-
tion, and I think you would avoid the problem of so many people
feel they are discriminated against, because we give racial prefer-
ences on the basis of race in any given situation.

  But I would like to have your thoughts on that. I would like you
to write to me and tell me how you think that might work and
what might be the better approach, and give me what you think
are the subtleties and the intricacies of how we would handle that
type of approach vis-a-vis the other.

  Now, I am not asking you to give up your ideas on the other, but
I would like you to give me some suggestions, all of us some sugges-
tions and ideas on how we might better really resolve these prob-
lems of discrimination in America.

  Mr. DAYS. May I just respond briefly, Senator?
  Senator HATCH. Surely.
  Mr. DAYS. The problem I have with tougher criminal penalties is
not that we find the evil actor, that person should not be penalized to
the ultimate of the law, it is that, in so many respects, we have gone
beyond that point in our society and we are dealing with employers
who are not evil actors--

  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Mr. DAYS, [continuing]. But they have run institutions that in the
past excluded minorities or women, and then the question becomes
one of, well, how do we get them. Well, the employer says I have a
test that I use to determine whom I am going to hire, and the laws
well, well, if that test has a discriminatory impact upon those groups,
then something has to be done about it.
  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Mr. DAYS. NOW, that is not the employer that you want to put
behind bars. Yet, what is the solution? The solution has been that
the Griggs test, the approach that has been developed based upon
Griggs, and even to this day is acknowledged, at last in part by the
Supreme Court, is an answer that we have to continue to use until
we have dealt with those institutional systemic problems of dis-
crimination.
  Senator HATCH. I am a hundred percent behind the Griggs test,
and I think most people in the Congress really are.
  Mr. DAYS. That makes me feel great, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. I know, but I am.
                                         55

  Mr. DAYS. The counting that I have done on the Supreme Court
makes me less comfortable.

  Senator HATCH. TO make a long story short, I really do believe
that--I am not just talking criminal sanctions. That would only be
used in the most extreme cases, but actual monetary penalties and
sanctions, which business people did pay attention to because that
is the bottom line to them. And I think that there may be some
way of utilizing that. That is why I am asking you to consider it.
There may be some way of utilizing that that gets us off of this
racial preference approach, that discriminates against others who
feel that sting of discrimination too, in our desire to get rid of past
discrimination and current discrimination really at the expense of
innocent people. And that is all I am asking, help us on this, be-
cause you people deal with this every day. I do in a sense, but not
nearly in the depths that you have to and that you have personal-
ly.

  So I am asking for help here, and sincerely doing so.
  Mr. EDLEY. Senator, I appreciate the invitation to write you and
will do that.
  Senator HATCH. Good.
  Mr. EDLEY. What I hope that the committee will focus on, howev-
er, is: In the context of this nomination, it seems to me that the
committee should be looking for two things in the nominee. One of
those is an ability to engage in precisely the kind of pragmatic,
conceptually rich exchange about issues of race relations that you
and Professor Days have been engaged in for the last couple of
minutes. But the other is to see whether or not the nominee is
someone who will not act as a superlegislator, someone who will be
respectful of the policy balances that are struck by you here in the
Congress.
  Now, on both of those two criteria, pragmatism, principled prag-
matism on the one hand and respect for the congressional role on
the other, it seems to me this nominee on the record--not on his
character but on his record--is woefully lacking. The manner in
which he has engaged in discussions of these race issues in the past
has not been along the terms that we have been engaged in for the
last several minutes. Instead it has been dogmatic, as I was discuss-
ing with Senator
  Senator HATCH. Well, I think those are interesting comments. I
didn't mean to cut you off.
  Mr. EDLEY. And with regard to the respect for the congressional
role, his repeated view, in my estimation, in my assessment, ex-
treme and outside the mainstream interpretation of title VII as it
now stands on the books and of judicial precedents indicate, it
seems to me, that he would not be a fair umpire in disputes be-
tween the branches, a fair umpire in interpreting congressional
will. Everything in the record suggests that as a Supreme Court
Justice he would seek to implement the policy preferences, the pre-
ferred interpretations of statute in the 14th amendment that he
has been speaking for the last 9 years, that he would overturn
Santa Clara, that he would overturn Weber,that he would over-
turn Fullilove. He hasn't said anything to the contrary.
  The work that the Congress has been doing in the last couple of
years on civil rights legislation, it seems to me, is quite at odds

       56-271 O--93 3
                                          56

with the positions that this nominee has taken historically. And a
close reading of the transcript does not dispel the concern that I
have that as a Justice he would be an activist in every bit the same
way that the current Supreme Court has been an activist, to the
collective dismay of the Congress, on civil rights issues.

  Senator HATCH. Well, what you seem to be saying is that if he is
a liberal activist that is fine, but if he is a conservative activist
that is not so good.

   Mr. EDLEY. NO, I

  Senator HATCH. Let me just say this: I have known Clarence
Thomas for 10 years, and I have to say that it is interesting how
two individuals can perceive a person so much differently.

  For instance, I have no doubt in my mind--well, you will prob-
ably notice that the only affirmative action questions came from
this side of the table. It started with Senator Specter, and I was the
only other one to even raise the issue. Nobody on the other side
raised the issue, to my recollection--although they may have. I
may have been temporarily absent on a couple of occasions. But it
was raised by us because we think it is an important issue.

  I have known him for 10 years, and I have to say, No. 1, on the
pragmatic issue, he understands this area very, very well. Probably
as well as any of you do. In fact, I would submit he does. He has
had wide experience, both in the private sector as a corporate
lawyer, in the State, in all three branches of the Federal Govern-
ment, and really almost 10 years in the EEOC which is one of the
most complex, difficult agencies to run.

  I think if anybody does understand these issues, it has got to be
Clarence Thomas. And part of the reason that I understand him is
we have had a dialog for 10 years. Now, part of it also because Mr.
Days and I have had dialog on these issues as well, and I consider
very few people his equal in this area.

  So, No. 1, I think he does understand it, and I think he takes a
position that is contrary to yours and I think which is supported by
the vast majority of the American people. No. 2, with regard to his
fairness, I want you to know that I know Clarence Thomas very
well, and over the last 10 years, if I was to pick a person who
would be super fair on race relations and equal rights and civil
rights, he would be one of the people that would be at the top of
the list, because I think he will be. And I do not think he will be
an activist for conservative principles. I think he will be an activist
in trying to make sure that individuals are granted rights and are
kept free and that they have civil rights and equality.

  So that has been my perception. Yours is different. And mine
comes from very practical experience of working with him as chair-
man of the Labor Committee and also as ranking member since
Senator Kennedy has become chairman on problems on a daily
basis involving these very problems.

  So I think we both share the same concerns. All four of us--the
three of you and myself--and I think Clarence Thomas would like
the same type of results. The question where we differ is what is
mainstream in America and what isn't. And I submit that the vast
majority of the American people would agree with Clarence
Thomas on the issue of preferences.
                                          57

  Well, thank you. I appreciate you, I appreciate listening to you,
and I will look forward to not only letters, but any time you are in
town, if you would like to try and stop in and chat with me about
these things, I would be more than happy to do so and get your
advice on some of these suggestions we have made.

  The CHAIRMAN. Good luck, gentlemen.
  Let me make one point, if I may, speaking of pragmatics. I recog-
nize there is a different constitutional test that is applied with
regard to types of preferences that are offered. From a pragmatic
standpoint, a preference is a preference is a preference to someone
who gets bumped out because of preference. I continue to find it
fascinating that we talk about preferences as they relate to affirm-
ative action when they affect blacks and women and minorities,
but we also talk about preferences when they relate to standing,
status, and tests, for example, when applying to school. Your law
school, Mr. Days, is one of the--probably the most difficult one to
get into. I am not suggesting that it is the best but because of its
small class size, it is the most competitive.
  I was told by several law deans--whom I will not name, but I
don't think anyone will dispute this--that the vast majority of the
people who apply to your law school are qualified to do the work
there. Most people who apply to your law school, Mr. Edley, are
qualified to do so. They don't apply to Harvard and Yale unless
they are already, in most cases, qualified.
  The question is: How do you pick among the qualified?
  Now, if, in fact, somebody's father and grandfather went to Yale
and they get in, even though their marks aren't quite as good as,
say, the son or daughter of someone who didn't go to Yale, that is a
preference. The end result is that somebody didn't get to go to Yale
because of a preference. The real impact is the same. But somehow
we don't talk about those things.
  Someone's father or mother contributes to a library to be con-
structed on campus, assuming they are already qualified, it does
impact on whether or not they get into school. That is a preference.
We do not call that a preference.
  Now, granted, I recognize the constitutional distinction, but the
impact is one that I hope we do not lose sight of when we are talk-
ing about preferences. A preference is a preference is a preference.
Somebody gets excluded, because of the existence of a preference,
and I find we get all upset and excited about preferences when
they relate to minorities, but hardly ever get exercised when they
are preferences as a consequence of social standing or any other
aspect of the way this society functions. I am not criticizing, I am
just pointing out.
  At any rate, let me ask one question of Mr. Edley. I apologize,
and I thank Senator Kennedy for chairing these hearings. I was
unable to be here this morning. I have this one question.
  If Justice Scalia's views in Morrison, the dissenting views were
the majority view, not whether or not Clarence Thomas holds those
views, not whether he subscribes to them, but this is an area of ex-
pertise you have, you possess, were Justice Scalia's views in Morri-
son to prevail on the Court, what would be the impact upon regula-
tory agencies that exist today in the Government?
                                          58

  Mr. EDLEY. It is an excellent question, Senator, and it certainly, I
think it quite obviously poses a serious challenge. It has certainly
been a basic tenet in administrative law, since at least the ICC,
that it is possible to create administrative agencies with some
measure of independence from direct presidential control.

  To assert now at this late hour that this administrative inven-
tion is an affront to individual liberties is not only wildly histori-
cal, but it really stands on its head many of our understandings
about the separation of powers.

  So, I think that if one is going to speak, if one is going to em-
brace the Scalia dissent in Morrison v. Olson, one must, certainly
as a constitutional lawyer, be prepared to explain where is the
stopping point in this line of analysis, if the President must have
control.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is my point. As I read the dissent--and I
have read it and reread it and read it and reread it, read the cri-
tiques of it, read the praise of it--it seems to me inescapable--and
please correct me if I am wrong--the conclusion seems inescapable
that every major regulatory agency, if you apply the reasoning he
applies in Morrison v. Olson, would fall on the grounds that his
strict application of separation of powers, as he defines it--al-
though it is not defined in the Constitution in that strict sense--
would render every one of those major agencies in Government
that do limit the ability of the President to fire without cause, to
begin this practice, just that one point.

  Mr. EDLEY. That is right, Senator. Now, I might also add that--
well, the key point, it seems to me, is that you could try to salvage
the principle that Scalia suggests by, for example, saying that this
kind of criminal prosecution and investigation is in some sense at
the core of the Executive power, and that

  The CHAIRMAN. SO, it is unique in that sense, and, therefore
  Mr. EDLEY. That is right, and that other matters of Executive ad-
ministration would not be treated the same way.
  The CHAIRMAN. But at a minimum, you would have to distin-
guish in ways that, on its face, do not seem obvious.
  Mr. EDLEY. And if I can drive the point home, Senator, at a mini-
mum, I would hope that a nominee to the Court would be able to
engage in a dialog with you about how the principle might be limit-
ed or what the implications of that principle would be.
  If we expect a constitutional vision from a member of the Court,
it seems to me you could expect no less than that in the confirma-
tion process.
  The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, I thank you very much. As you can
tell, I quite frankly assumed that by this time you would be long
gone. The fact that you are all here still testifying is evidence that
this panel has great respect for your judgment, or at least feels an
obligation to challenge your assertions, because of the respect given
you by the community at large, so it is a compliment to you all.
  I appreciate your taking the time, and making the effort to be
here. I know from experience that, for law professors of standing
and consequence to testify against a nominee to the Supreme Court
is not seen as a wise career move so I thank you very much for
having the strength of character to make your views known. As I
have said, I have known Mr. Days for a long time, and we have
                                         59

agreed and disagreed, but speaking of character, one could never
question his, nor that of the other gentleman.

  So, I thank you very much and appreciate your taking the time
to be with us this morning.

  Mr. EDLEY. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, we will move to the next panel. Our next
panel, Sister Mary Virgilius Reidy, former principal of a school at-
tended by Judge Thomas, St. Benedict's, in Savannah, GA; Father
John Brooks, president of Holy Cross College; Hon. John Gibbons,
former chief justice of the third circuit, and now professor of law at
Rutgers University; and Dr. Niara Sudarkasa, president of Lincoln
University.
  I appreciate you all being here. Dr. Sudarkasa does not know,
but she and I are almost neighbors. Lincoln University is sort of in
my backyard, or I am in their front yard.
  I want to thank you all. Let me acknowledge ahead of time,
Sister, when you are speaking, if I find myself involuntarily saying
"yester" or "noster," it is purely that, involuntary. Father Brooks,
if I say something to you that appears to be contentious, will you
give me anticipatory absolution, and if you could write a little note
to my brother-in-law, who is a graduate of your university, that I
treated you nicely, regardless of how it goes, I would appreciate it.
  With that, with all kidding aside, let me begin, I assume in the
order that we began. Sister, welcome. It is nice to formally have
you before us, and please begin with your testimony.

STATEMENT OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF SISTER MARY VIRGI-
  LIUS REIDY, FORMER PRINCIPAL, ST. BENEDICT'S, SAVANNAH,
  GA; FATHER JOHN BROOKS, PRESIDENT, HOLY CROSS COL-
  LEGE; HON. JOHN GIBBONS, PROFESSOR OF LAW, RUTGERS
  UNIVERSITY; AND NIARA SUDARKASA, PRESIDENT, LINCOLN
  UNIVERSITY

  Sister VIRGILIUS. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I
would like to introduce myself. I am Sister Mary Virgilius Reidy, a
member of the Institute of Missionary Franciscan Sisters.

  We, the Missionary Franciscan Sisters have a long history among
the black people of Georgia, a history of which we, the so-called
"nigger nuns," are justifiably proud. Our foundress, a few years
after establishing a first foundation in Minnesota in 1873, having
heard of the poverty and oppression of the recently freed Negro in
the South, moved courageously and quickly to open a training
school for girls in Augusta, and one later in Savannah. After the
turn of the century, we opened other schools in both cities and con-
tinued to educate black children at primary and high school levels,
until laws concerning integration caused their closure.

  From my lived experienced in Georgia for 13 years, during which
time I first met Clarence Thomas as a fifth grade student, I can
readily empathize with any youngster who grew up as a second-
class citizens in the hard days of segregation.

  Clarence Thomas was no stranger to the indignities suffered be-
cause of the Jim Crow laws. It was not easy to have to swim at a
beach for blacks only, to be served food through a hatch at the
back of a restaurant in the pouring rain, a restaurant only whites
                                          60

could enter, or to be required to pay for that food before it was
given, to ride always in the rear of the bus, and to see their par-
ents suffer like indignities. Such treatment could easily leave a
person embittered and scarred, but such is not the person we meet
in Clarence Thomas.

  Even in his early years, Clarence was an independent thinker,
one who challenged the status quo. Is it any wonder, then, that at
a young age, he questioned the daily recitation of the Pledge of Al-
legiance, which ensures liberty and justice for all, when neither lib-
erty nor justice was available to black children? Do we perhaps
begin to see here the early beginnings of a judicial mind, so ably
demonstrated at these hearings?

  I taught Clarence Thomas in the eighth grade. He was a regular
fun-loving boy. He was cooperative and studious, willing to give a
helping hand to those less able than himself. He was always grate-
ful to those who provided a home for him and to the Sisters who
taught him. He seemed to recognize and appreciate the sacrifices
others made for his betterment.

  Even in later years, after his appointment as Chairman of the
EEOC, Clarence Thomas showed his gratitude by making a special
visit to Boston to thank me and the other Sisters who had taught
him. I might add that the 1,000 or more young people, who over
several years graduated from my class, Clarence was one of the few
who came to say "thank you."

  His question on that occasion was a searching one: Why was it
that you Sisters could do for us black kids what nobody else could
or did do? My answer had to be that, as followers of our founders,
who, like St. Francis, loved God and his poor, we too would love
God in the person of these children put especially in our care.

  During these hearings, much has been said about certain speech-
es and writings of Judge Thomas. One speech with which I am fa-
miliar has not been referred to thus far. I am referring to a speech
delivered to the Franciscan Sisters in a fund raising appeal. It is
dated April 5, 1986, for your easy reference and reading, and I
highly recommend it.

  What has since become a national concern was then a grave con-
cern for Clarence Thomas. He said, and I quote:

  What we had yesterday is precisely what we need now, as a bare minimum, as an
indispensable starting point, that is, God, values, morality, and, of course, education.
The Sisters accepted our equality without a Civil Rights Act, they accepted equality
of education without a Supreme Court decision, they lived in the inner city with us
before we knew that it was the inner city.

  Judge Thomas has not forgotten his roots. He lived day by day
the cruel story of discrimination. He knows the results of being on
the wrong side of the law, not because of what one has done, but
because of the color of one's skin.

  I am most grateful for having this opportunity to testify in favor
of Judge Thomas' confirmation as a Justice of the Supreme Court.
The road from the unpaved streets of our part of Savannah to
these hallowed halls cannot have been an easy one to travel, but
Clarence Thomas has demonstrated that he has overcome obstacles
that might have defeated a lesser man.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Sister.

  Father Brooks.

               STATEMENT OF FATHER JOHN E. BROOKS

  Father BROOKS. Mr. Chairman, I am the Reverend John E.
Brooks of the Society of Jesus, president of the College of the Holy
Cross in Worcester, MA.

  It is both an honor and a pleasure for me to appear before you
on behalf of Judge Clarence Thomas and to participate in the proc-
ess which I hope will conclude with the seating of Judge Thomas as
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I have known Judge
Thomas for almost a quarter century, so I believe I can speak
about him with some authority.

  I first came to know Judge Thomas when he was a student at the
College of the Holy Cross from 1968 to 1971. When he entered the
college, I was vice president and academic dean. Appointed presi-
dent of the college in 1970, Judge Thomas' graduating class in 1971
was the first over which I presided as president.

  In preparation for this meeting today, I came across a memoran-
dum which I had written on April 21, 1970, to the Reverend Ray-
mond J. Swords of the Society of Jesus, my immediate predecessor
in the presidency of the college, in which memorandum I had rec-
ommended that he appoint Clarence Thomas to membership in
Alpha Sigma Nu, the national Jesuit College Honor Society. The
reasons I gave them may be of interest today. Allow me to quote
from that memo.

    May I recommend that you consider nominating Clarence Thomas, class of 1971,
to membership in Alpha Sigma Nu. Clarence has a cumulative quality point index
of 3.577 and ranks very high in his class. He is a member of the Purple Key, the
Black Student Union, and is genuinely respected by his fellow students.

  The good judgment, integrity, and serious concern for the college
which I had observed in Clarence Thomas as a student, and then
his educational record and experience which I had followed closely
during the years following his graduation from Holy Cross, led me
to seek his appointment to the board of trustees of the college in
1978. He served two 4-year terms from 1978 through 1986, and he
was reelected to the board in 1987, and continues to serve at the
present time.

  Judge Thomas is an active member of our board, concerned
about all those things board members ought to take seriously: Edu-
cational quality, finances, student and faculty productivity and the
like. However, I would like to limit my remarks to characteristics I
have observed in him which I suspect have some bearing upon his
fitness to serve on our highest Court. They are his energetic con-
cern for the education of all our young people, especially for those
of minority backgrounds, and his very practical approach to obtain-
ing it for them. Judge Thomas is a realist. He knows the essential
part which a good solid education has played in his own rise from
abject privation to prominence, and he knows that it is the key
which will unlock the same doors for others. Judge Thomas has
been an active recruiter of minority students for Holy Cross,
making the college known to them, assisting them in the applica-
tion process, and making sure that, once enrolled, they do not drop
out.
                                               62

  I find it difficult to recall a single meeting of the board of trust-
ees during which Judge Thomas did not question the administra-
tors of the college, including the president, about the status of mi-
nority recruitment--how many African-American students did we
enroll; how many had applied; from which high schools; with what
SAT scores; about the status of financial aid for minority students;
about the relative rank in class of minority students; about the
social climate for minority students; about the graduation record of
minority students. With a willing acknowledgment that minority
students might need and be given some special and supplementary
counseling, Judge Thomas insisted always that every student be
held to the same standards of excellence and that each one be
given the opportunity and effective encouragement to attain excel-
lence.

  As a trustee, Judge Thomas met frequently with African-Ameri-
can students at Holy Cross. On occasions of his visits to the college,
he scheduled meetings with our Black Student Union so that he
might have a firsthand, personal knowledge of those students with
a background like his own. Over the years, he became a kind of
role model for our African-American students, and in speaking
with them, he was never stingy with either advice, know-how, or
making the right connections for them. His message was never an
easy one, but it was real and it was practical: Work hard, make the
best of every opportunity, and know that we are there to help in
every way we can.

  Judge Thomas is a practical man. He is well aware that the
board, room, and tuition costs at a private, 4-year, liberal arts col-
lege like Holy Cross are far and beyond the financial resources of
almost all minority applicants. He has been constant in his support
for our Martin Luther King, Jr., scholarship program for African-
American students which makes possible for others the same brand
of opportunity which was made possible for him.

  Over the past few months, you have heard and read a great deal
about Judge Clarence Thomas. My personal knowledge of him con-
vinces me that he is a man of compassion, good judgment, and in-
telligence. His zeal for justice, freedom, and equal opportunity for
all Americans is well-known to us at Holy Cross. Our highest Court
will be greatly honored and enriched by his service.

  I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                                                     16 September 1991

MR. CHAIRMAN:

I AM THE REVEREND JOHN E. BROOKS, S.J., PRESIDENT OF THE
COLLEGE OF THE HOLY CROSS IN WORCESTER, MA.

IT IS BOTH AN HONOR AND A PLEASURE FOR ME TO APPEAR BEFORE
YOU IN BEHALF OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS AND TO PARTICIPATE IN
THE PROCESS WHICH I HOPE WILL CONCLUDE WITH THE SEATING OF
JUDGE THOMAS AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT.
I HAVE KNOWN JUDGE THOMAS FOR ALMOST A QUARTER CENTURY, SO I
BELIEVE I CAN SPEAK ABOUT HIM WITH SOME AUTHORITY.

I FIRST CAME TO KNOW JUDGE THOMAS WHEN HE WAS A STUDENT AT
THE COLLEGE OF THE HOLY CROSS FROM 1968 TO 1971. WHEN HE
ENTERED THE COLLEGE, I WAS VICE PRESIDENT AND ACADEMIC DEAN.
APPOINTED PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE IN 197 0, JUDGE THOMAS'
GRADUATING CLASS IN 1971 WAS THE FIRST OVER WHICH I PRESIDED
AS PRESIDENT.

IN PREPARATION FOR THIS MEETING TODAY, I CAME ACROSS A
MEMORANDUM WHICH I HAD WRITTEN ON APRIL 21, 1970 TO THE REV.
RAYMOND J. SWORDS, S.J., MY IMMEDIATE PREDECESSOR IN THE
PRESIDENCY OF THE COLLEGE, IN WHICH I HAD RECOMMENDED THAT
HE APPOINT CLARENCE THOMAS TO MEMBERSHIP IN ALPHA SIGMA NU,
THE JESUIT COLLEGE HONOR SOCIETY. THE REASONS I GAVE THEN
MAY BE OF INTEREST TODAY. LET ME QUOTE FROM THAT MEMO:
                                     64

  -2-
'' . . .MAY I RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONSIDER NOMINATING CLARENCE

  THOMAS, CLASS OF 1971 TO MEMBERSHIP IN ALPHA SIGMA NU.
  CLARENCE HAS A CUMULATIVE QPI (QUALITY POINT INDEX) OF 3.577
  AND RANKS VERY HIGH IN HIS CLASS. HE IS A MEMBER OF THE
  PURPLE KEY, THE BLACK STUDENT UNION AND IS GENUINELY
  RESPECTED BY HIS FELLOW STUDENTS."

  THE GOOD JUDGMENT, INTEGRITY, AND SERIOUS CONCERN FOR THE
  COLLEGE WHICH I HAD OBSERVED IN CLARENCE THOMAS AS A
  STUDENT, AND THEN HIS EDUCAIONAL RECORD AND EXPERIENCE WHICH
  I HAD FOLLOWED CLOSELY DURING THE YEARS FOLLOWING HIS
  GRADUATION FROM HOLY CROSS, LED ME TO SEEK HIS APPOINTMENT
  TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE COLLEGE IN 1978. HE SERVED
  TWO FOUR-YEAR TERMS FROM 1978 - 1986, WAS REAPPOINTED TO THE
  BOARD IN 1987 AND CONTINUES TO SERVE AT THE PRESENT TIME.

  JUDGE THOMAS IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF OUR BOARD, CONCERNED
  ABOUT ALL THOSE THINGS BOARD MEMBERS OUGHT TO TAKE
  SERIOUSLY; EDUCATIONAL QUALITY, FINANCES, STUDENT AND
  FACULTY PRODUCTIVITY AND THE LIKE. HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO
  LIMIT MY REMARKS TO CHARACTERISTICS I HAVE OBSERVED IN HIM
  WHICH I SUSPECT HAVE SOME BEARING UPON HIS FITNESS TO SERVE
  ON OUR HIGHEST COURT. THEY ARE HIS ENERGETIC CONCERN FOR
  THE EDUCATION OF ALL OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE
  OF MINORITY BACKGROUNDS, AND HIS VERY PRACTICAL APPROACH TO
  OBTAINING IT FOR THEM. JUDGE THOMAS IS A REALIST. HE KNOWS
  THE ESSENTIAL PART WHICH A GOOD SOLID EDUCATION HAS PLAYED
                                   65

-3-
IN HIS OWN RISE FROM ABJECT PRIVATION TO PROMINENCE, AND HE
KNOWS THAT IT IS THE KEY WHICH WILL UNLOCK THE SAME DOORS
FOR OTHERS. JUDGE THOMAS HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE RECRUITER OF
MINORITY STUDENTS FOR HOLY CROSS, MAKING THE COLLEGE KNOWN
TO THEM, ASSISTING THEM IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND
MAKING SURE THAT ONCE ENROLLED, THEY DO NOT DROP OUT.

I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO RECALL A SINGLE MEETING OF THE BOARD
OF TRUSTEES DURING WHICH JUDGE THOMAS DID NOT QUESTION THE
ADMINISTRATORS OF THE COLLEGE, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT,
ABOUT THE STATUS OF MINORITY RECRUITMENT -- HOW MANY
AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS DID WE ENROLL, HOW MANY HAD
APPLIED, FROM WHICH HIGH SCHOOLS, WITH WHAT SAT SCORES;
ABOUT THE STATUS OF FINANCIAL AID FOR MINORITY STUDENTS;
ABOUT THE RELATIVE RANK IN CLASS OF MINORITY STUDENTS; ABOUT
THE SOCIAL CLIMATE FOR MINORITY STUDENTS; ABOUT THE
GRADUATION RECORD OF MINORITY STUDENTS. WITH A WILLING
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT MINORITY STUDENTS MIGHT NEED AND BE
GIVEN SOME SPECIAL AND SUPPLEMENTARY COUNSELLING, JUDGE
THOMAS INSISTED ALWAYS THAT EVERY STUDENT BE HELD TO THE
SAME STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE, AND THAT EACH ONE BE GIVEN THE
OPPORTUNITY AND EFFECTIVE ENCOURAGEMENT TO ATTAIN
EXCELLENCE.

AS A TRUSTEE, JUDGE THOMAS MET FREQUENTLY WITH AFRICAN-
AMERICAN STUDENTS AT HOLY CROSS. ON OCCASIONS OF HIS VISITS
TO THE COLLEGE HE SCHEDULED MEETINGS WITH OUR BLACK STUDENT
                                    66

UNION SO THAT HE MIGHT HAVE A FIRST-HAND PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE
OF THOSE STUDENTS WITH A BACKGROUND LIKE HIS OWN. OVER THE
YEARS, HE BECAME A KIND OF ROLE MODEL FOR OUR AFRICAN-
AMERICAN STUDENTS AND IN SPEAKING WITH THEM, HE WAS NEVER
STINGY WITH EITHER ADVICE, KNOW-HOW, OR MAKING THE RIGHT
CONNECTIONS FOR THEM- HIS MESSAGE WAS NEVER AN EASY ONE--BUT
IT WAS REAL AND PRACTICAL: WORK HARD, MAKE THE MOST OF
EVERY OPPORTUNITY, AND KNOW THAT WE ARE THERE TO HELP IN
EVERY WAY WE CAN.

JUDGE THOMAS IS A PRACTICAL MAN. HE IS WELL AWARE THAT THE
BOARD, ROOM AND TUITION COSTS AT A PRIVATE, FOUR-YEAR,
LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE LIKE HOLY CROSS ARE FAR AND BEYOND THE
FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF ALMOST ALL MINORITY APPLICANTS. HE
HAS BEEN CONSTANT IN HIS SUPPORT FOR OUR MARTIN LUTHER KING,
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS WHICH
MAKES POSSIBLE FOR OTHERS THE SAME BRAND OF OPPORTUNITY
WHICH WAS MADE POSSIBLE FOR HIM.

OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, YOU HAVE HEARD AND READ A GREAT
DEAL ABOUT JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS. MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF
HIM CONVINCES ME THAT HE IS A MAN OF COMPASSION, GOOD
JUDGMENT AND INTELLIGENCE. HIS ZEAL FOR JUSTICE, FREEDOM
AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS IS WELL-KNOWN TO US
AT HOLY CROSS. OUR HIGHEST COURT WILL BE GREATLY ENRICHED
BY HIS SERVICE.
THANK YOU.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Father.
  Judge Gibbons, it is good to see you again. As I should note for
the record, everyone in the third circuit took and takes great pride
in you. You are one of the fine judges in this country, and it is a
pleasure to have you here. It really it. I am not being solicitous.

                   STATEMENT OF HON.JOHN GIBBONS
  Mr. GIBBONS. It is a pleasure to be here, Mr. Chairman.
  I am the Richard J. Hughes professor of constitutional law at
Seton Hall University.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did I say Rutgers?
  Mr. GIBBONS. YOU said Rutgers, and I have had the pleasure of
teaching there as well.
  The CHAIRMAN. I beg your pardon.
  Mr. GIBBONS. And as you mentioned, I was, until January 15,
1990, chief judge of the third circuit, and I served as a judge on the
court of appeals for 20 years.
  Until September 6 last, I was vice chairman of the board of trust-
ees of Holy Cross College, and it was in that capacity that I came
to know and to respect Clarence Thomas.
  In my dealings with him, I was left with the clear impression
that Judge Thomas is intellectually gifted, open-minded, not doctri-
naire, and receptive to persuasion. He is, I am convinced, anything
but the rigid, inflexible conservative that some have charged him
with being.
  The most puzzling charge against him is that Judge Thomas will
be unsympathetic to human rights claims. One experience that I
shared with him serves to illustrate the contrary. On September
14, 1985, I presided at a meeting of the Holy Cross Board of Trust-
ees which took up the issue of divestiture by the college of invest-
ments in companies doing business in South Africa. The choice was
between complete divestiture on the one hand, and on the other,
divestiture only of those companies which did not adhere to the so-
called Sullivan principles governing company treatment of employ-
ees and others. Strong, and on the whole quite reasonable, argu-
ments were put forth by board members in favor of the Sullivan
principles position. Some members even had connections with com-
panies which they were convinced were doing a great deal to im-
prove the lot of black South Africans.
  When Clarence Thomas' turn came to speak, he eloquently urged
the board to opt for total divestiture. His reasons are relevant, I
think, to this committee's inquiry. He insisted that every person
had a prepolitical right to be treated as of equal worth, and that
any regime which by law refused to recognize that right was so ille-
gitimate that it should be replaced.
  Largely because of Clarence Thomas' reasonable articulation of a
human rights position, the board was persuaded to opt for total di-
vestiture.
  This incident occurred long before Clarence Thomas was under
consideration for the Supreme Court, or even the court of appeals.
Thus, his philosophical position on the existence of prepolitical
human rights which governments should recognize was well
thought out long before the question of his judicial philosophy was
                                           68

ever an issue. It was no surprise to me, therefore, that in some
other forums he articulated a similar philosophical position.

  There is, of course, a difference between political philosophy and
jurisprudence. It is entirely conceivable that one may recognize the
injustice of inequality and at the same time insist, as legal positiv-
ists do, that judges may not resort to philosophical notions of jus-
tice to go beyond the text of a law enacted by others. Judge Bork,
for example, is an articulate spokesman for the legal positivist posi-
tion who unquestionably personally abhors many of the instances
of injustices about which, he thinks, judges are powerless.

  In his answer to Senator Biden's question on Tuesday last about
a constitutional right of privacy, Judge Thomas on the other hand
acknowledged the legitimacy of the Supreme Court's recognition of
that nontextual human right.

  The recognition by the Supreme Court, in interpreting the Con-
stitution, of nontextual prepolitical human rights poses for a de-
mocracy the majoritarian dilemma, no better articulated than by
the late Alexander Bickel. Bickel also articulated the most signifi-
cant restraint upon life-tenured Supreme Court Justices; namely,
their dedication to the Court's tradition of deciding great matters
of principle only after meticulous scholarship and adversarial de-
velopment of the competing arguments.

  One aspect--I see my light is on, Mr. Chairman, and I regularly
enforced it against lawyers. So I suppose I should stop or at least
ask for permission to continue.

  The CHAIRMAN. If you are almost finished, please continue,
Judge.

  Mr. GIBBONS. All right. One aspect of that tradition is the Court's
self-imposed limitation on its law-pronouncing function; its unwill-
ingness to answer legal questions except when necessary for the
pronouncement of judgments. Judge Thomas' refusal to state in ad-
vance how he would vote on any specific legal issue likely to come
before the Court is thus entirely consistent with the Court's tradi-
tions of craftsmanship and scholarship. It is, I suggest, unwise for
Senators to press prospective nominees for answers to such specific
questions, for they thereby seek to have the nominee violate the
best safeguard that we have against judicial activism.

  Many thoughtful students of the judicial process were alarmed
some time ago when rumors that Federal judicial nominees were at
one stage being screened by the Justice Department on the basis of
a litmus test on specific issues. It doesn't really matter whose
litmus test is being applied. Asking for a prior commitment on any
legal issue likely to come before the Court is wrong, and giving
such a commitment in order to obtain confirmation would be even
more wrong.

  I was going to comment, Senator Biden, about my review of his
written work as a judge, which is probably the best evidence, but I
know you are pressed for time.

  The CHAIRMAN. We will put the entire statement in the record,
and I have a question for you about that anyway. So you will have
an opportunity to do that.

  [The prepared statement of Mr. Gibbons follows:]

                            S T A T E M E N T OF J O H N J. GIBBONS

September 1, 1991

       I am here to urge favorable action on the nomination of
Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. Presently, I am the Richard J. Hughes Professor of
Constitutional Law at Seton Hall University Law School. I am
also Special Counsel at Crummy, Del Deo, Dolan, Griffinger &
Vecchione in Newark, New Jersey, supervising that firm's
Gibbons Fellowship Program in Public Interest and
Constitutional Law. Until January 15, 1990, I was Chief Judge
of the Third Circuit, and I served as a Judge of the United
States Court of Appeals for that Circuit for twenty years.
Until September 6 last, I was Vice-Chairman of the Board of
Trustees of Holy Cross College, and it was in that capacity
that I came to know and respect Clarence Thomas. As you know,
he still serves as a member of that Board.

       Because of our mutual interest in the law, we have on a
number of occasions informally discussed issues of
constitutional law. Such informal discussions among friends of
subjects of mutual interest are frequently more revealing of
underlying personal attitudes than are more formal
pronouncements in speeches or papers. From them, I was left
with the clear impression that Judge Thomas is intellectually
gifted, a rigorous thinker, but open-minded, non-doctrinaire
and receptive to persuasion. He is, I am convinced, anything
but the rigid, inflexible conservative that some have charged
him with being.
                                   70

       The most puzzling charge made against him is that Judge
Thomas will be unsympathetic to human rights claims. One
experience I shared with him serves to illustrate the
contrary. On September 14, 1985 I presided at a meeting of the
Holy Cross Board of Trustees which took up the issue of
divestiture by the College of investments in companies doing
business in South Africa. The choice was between complete
divesture on the one hand/ and on the other, divestiture only
of those companies which did not adhere to the so-called
Sullivan Principles governing company treatment of employees
and others. Strong, and on the whole quite reasonable,
arguments were put forth by Board members in favor of the
latter position. Some Board members had connections with
companies which, they were convinced, were doing a great deal
to improve the lot of black South Africans.

       When Clarence Thomas' turn came to speak, he eloquently,
but with reason more than passion, urged the Board to opt for
total divestiture. His reasons are relevant, I think, to this
Committee's inquiry. He insisted that every person had a
pre-political right to be treated as of equal worth, and that
any regime which by law refused to recognize that right was so
illegitimate that it should be replaced. He urged that while
the actions of private institutional investors might not bring
South Africa to its knees, those actions would put pressure on
the government of the United States to try to do so.

                                                 -2-
                                     71

       As I said, the choice between the Sullivan Principles and
total divestiture was in 1985, one over which reasonable people
could differ. Largely because of Clarence Thomas' reasoned
articulation of a human rights position, the Board was
persuaded to opt for total divestiture. As you know, many
other institutions opted for the Sullivan Principles, or for no
divestiture policy at all.

       This incident occurred long before Clarence Thomas was
under consideration for the Supreme Court, or even the Court of
Appeals. Thus, his philosophical position on the existence of
pre-political human rights which governments should recognize
was well thought out long before the question of his judicial
philosophy was an issue. It was no surprise to me, therefore,
that in other forums he articulated a similar philosophical
position.

       There is, of course, a difference between political
philosophy and jurisprudence. It is entirely conceivable that
one may recognize the injustice of inequality and at the same
time insist, as legal positivists do, that judges may not
resort to philosophical notions of justice to go beyond the
text of a law external to themselves. Judge Bork, for example,
is an articulate spokesman for the legal positivist position
who unquestionably personally abhors many instances of
injustice about which, he thinks, judges are powerless. In his
answer to Senator Biden's question on Tuesday last, about a

                                            -3-
                                     72

constitutional right of privacy, Judge Thomas, on the other
hand, acknowledged the legitimacy of the Supreme Court's
recognition of that non-textual human right.

       The recognition by the Supreme Court, in interpreting the
Constitution, of non-textual pre-political human rights, as you
in the political branch of government are so well aware, poses
for a democracy the majoritarian dilemma: when should the court
exercise the awesome power to set aside laws enacted by
popularly elected legislators? No one better articulated the
dilemma than the late Alexander Bickel. He also articulated
the most significant restraint upon life-tenured Supreme Court
Justices; namely, their dedication to the Court's scholarly
tradition of deciding great matters of principle only with
careful craftsmanship after meticulous scholarship and
adversarial development of the competing arguments. One aspect
of that scholarly tradition is the Court's self-imposed
limitation on its law-pronouncing function; its unwillingness
to answer legal questions except when necessary to the
pronouncement of judgments. Judge Thomas' refusal to state in
advance how he would vote on any specific legal issue likely to
come before the Court is entirely consistent with the Court's
traditions of craftsmanship and scholarship. It is, I suggest,
unwise for Senators to press prospective nominees for answers
to such specific questions, for they thereby seek to have the
nominees violate the best safeguard that we have against

                                                 -4-
                                    73

so-called judicial activism. Watching the proceedings of this
Committee, it occurred to me that had a Senator from
Mississippi, for example, interrogated Governor Warren about
how he intended to vote on the then-pending school desegration
appeals as vigorously as Judge Thomas has been interrogated on
the issue which currently preoccupies some Committee members, I
don't know how he would have responded. If, however, he had
answered such questions, no matter how he answered them, he
would have compounded the difficulties the Court faced in
resolving that then-controversial issue.

       Whatever else a Supreme Court nominee or any other judicial
nominee should bring to the bench, one essential commitment
must be that decisions on legal issues will be made only upon
careful reflection after completion of the adversarial
process. That is why many thoughtful students of the judicial
process were alarmed about rumors that federal judicial
nominees were at one stage several years ago being screened by
the Justice Department on the basis of a litmus test on
specific issues. It doesn't really matter whose litmus test is
being applied. Asking for a prior commitment on any legal
issue likely to come before the Court is wrong, and giving such
a commitment in order to obtain confirmation would be even more
wrong.

       Certainly, however, it is perfectly proper for the Senate
to inquire whether a nominee possesses those qualities of

                                            -5-
                                   74

intellect and temperament which suggest that he will be
dedicated in his career to the Court's traditions of
scholarship and craftsmanship. In this respect the best
evidence is the *****--* published opinions Judge Thomas has
written as a Judge of the Court of Appeals. I have read *44- of
them, and they are in this respect quite reassuring. They show
an appropriate reliance on precedent, a fine appreciation of
the deference the Courts owe to administrative agencies, a
reading of federal statutes which shows proper acknowledgment
of the primacy of the legislative process, and a respectful
treatment of the arguments advanced even by the losing
parties. One opinion that I particularly liked was pnited
States v. Long. 905 F.2d, 1572 (D.C.Cir. 1990), in which,
reversing a conviction for using a firearm during and in
relation to drug trafficking, Judge Thomas declined the
invitation of the Department of Justice to adopt an open-ended
interpretation of the statutory language which would have
facilitated convictions under Section 924(c)(l) of Title 18.
Certainly this is not the opinion of a "knee jerk" conservative
likely to be swayed by appeals to law and order, even here in
the District of Columbia. My guess is that with respect to the
rights of criminal defendants, his addition to the Court may
result in a net improvement of its jurisprudence. I wouldn't
ask him, however, and he shouldn't tell me.

                                   75

       Summarizing, I urge you to confirm Judge Thomas' nomination
because my personal experience with him and my critical
examination of his admittedly limited work as a judge convince
me that he has the intellect, the temperament, the flexibility,
the dedication to judicial craftsmanship, and the potential for
growth to make a distinguished contribution to the Court's work
over a long period of time.

                 STATEMENT OF MS. NIARA SUDARKASA

   Ms. SUDARKASA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of this
distinguished committee.

   First of all, I want to express my appreciation for your allowing
me to join this panel, in recognition of a prior commitment.

  My name is Niara Sudarkasa, and I am pleased to have the op-
portunity to appear before you today in my capacity as an individ-
ual scholar who supports the nomination of Judge Clarence
Thomas for the U.S. Supreme Court.

  In my view. Judge Thomas has the education and experience, as
well as the intelligence, integrity and high ideals necessary to
serve on the Nation's highest court. But much of the debate over
Judge Thomas' nomination has focused on his ideology, rather than
his qualifications.

  If I may, I would like to make a few comments in this regard.
  Many of those who oppose Judge Thomas and some who support
him seem to have assumed that his ideology could be pigeonholed,
and used to predict the positions he would take if he were on the
Supreme Court.
  From what I have read by and about Judge Thomas, and from
what I have heard this week, I believe, as others have said, that he
is an open-minded and independent thinker, not one with rigid pre-
packaged views. He has been characterized as insensitive to the
concerns of African-Americans. Permit me to submit that I think
because of his independence and his keen sense of justice and fair-
ness, Judge Thomas looks at all sides of issues, when others might
be content to examine only one.
  For example, Judge Thomas wrestles with the issue of individual
rights when considering group entitlements, because he knows that
fairness and justice are not one-sided concepts. He struggles with
the points of conflict between the principle of equality and the
practice of affirmative action. But because of his open-mindedness,
I believe Judge Thomas can be persuaded to see and, indeed, has
been persuaded to see that, in order to address past discrimination,
the concept of equity, rather than strict equality, has to be applied.
The Constitution speaks of equality, but it also speaks of justice,
and under various circumstances the principle of equity must be
applied, in order to insure that justice and fairness will be the end
result.
  Leaders must be understood in the context of the times that
spawn them. This is as true of Judge Thomas as it is of others. As
African-Americans, we have been fortunate in having a long line of
leaders who, in retrospect, seem right for their times. These leaders
did not always have the same ideology or agree on strategies, but
they all agreed that the goal was to secure freedom and justice for
our people, and thereby help to insure freedom and justice for all.
Who can say that we are not the better off for having had the ben-
efit of their separate and distinct voices?
  In the 1850's, there was Frederick Douglas fighting for the aboli-
tion of slavery, for voting rights for free blacks and for what we
now call integration. But there was also Martin Delaney, an equal-
ly strong abolitionist, who sought freedom and prosperity through
economic and political linkages with Africa, including the estab-
                                              77

lishment of African-American settlements on the African Conti-
nent. The legacy of Douglas is the fight for equal rights; that of De-
laney the struggle for economic empowerment for blacks and
others.

  At the turn of the 20th century, there was Booker T. Washington
speaking for vocational education for the masses, self-reliance in
the black community, and coexistence with segregation. At the
same time, W.E.B. DuBois advocated a liberal education for the
"talented tenth," economic interdependence and an end to segrega-
tion. Booker T. Washington, contrary to the opinions of some, left
us quite a legacy. He left Tuskegee University, a healthy respect
for black colleges and other black institutions, and an appreciation
of the value of self-help. On the other hand, Dubois' legacy is that
of the NAACP, admonition to "the talented tenth" to reach back
and help the less fortunate, and the demand that America help
those upon whose backs this country was built.

  In the decade of the 1920's, there was the rise and fall of Marcus
Garvey, the nationalist who preached "Africa for Africans" and
"back to Africa," while envisioning a black-owned economic net-
work spanning the Atlantic. In the same decade, there was A.
Philip Randolph, the Socialist, who emerged as the leading spokes-
man for jobs and justice here in America. Garvey left us a legacy of
racial pride and a commitment to cooperation among Africans at
home and abroad. And A. Philip Randolph, who disavowed social-
ism and became one of the country's greatest labor leaders, taught
us the effectiveness of direct action and planted the seeds for fair
employment practices legislation.

  In more recent times, there was Martin Luther King and Mal-
colm X, both committed to justice, equality and empowerment, but
while Dr. King chose the path of integration, Malcolm chose sepa-
ration, at least until near the end of his life. Both of them were
taken from us in a flash, leaving a legacy of work unfinished and a
job to be done.

  My point, Mr. Chairman, is that different leaders have brought
us thus far on our way, different voices have spearheaded the cru-
sade for freedom and justice.

  In the judicial arena itself, we see the great legacy of Thurgood
Marshall, the brilliant architect of legal desegregation and the un-
defeated champion of civil rights. Thurgood Marshall, a man of and
for his time.

  Today, as we anticipate the appointment of Clarence Thomas to
the Supreme Court, we see in him a leader with a different voice
for a different time. We who have put our faith and confidence in
him do not expect that he will abandon the quest for equal rights.
As a matter of fact, we come forth now to challenge him to choose
well the means by which he will carry on the quest for justice and
equality. We ask him to be ever mindful of the words of Robert
Hayden, the celebrated African-American poet, who suggested that
we must not read until "it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty,
needful to man as air, usable as earth."

  Senators I would say to you and to Judge Thomas, whose nomi-
nation I support, as a nation, we must not rest until Dr. King's
dream becomes a reality. We cannot rest as we as a people have
overcome.

  Thank you.

Mr. Chairman, Members of this Distinguished Committee of the U.S. Senate,
Judge Thomas, Ladies and Gentlemen:

My name is Niara Sudarkasa. and I am pleased to have the opportunity to
appear before you today in my capacity as an individual scholar who supports
the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas for the U.S. Supreme Court.
In my view. Judge Thomas has the education and experience, as well as the
intelligence, integrity and high ideals necessary to serve on the nation's highest
court. But much of the debate over Judge Thomas" nomination has focused on
his ideology, rather than his qualifications.
Many who oppose Judge Thomas and some who support him seem to assume
that his ideology can be pigeonholed, and used to predict the positions he will
take on cases that will come before the Supreme Court.
From what I have read by and about Judge Thomas, and from what I have heard
this week, I believe that he is an open-minded and independent thinker, not one
with rigid pre-packaged views. He has been characterized as insensitive to the
concerns of African Americans. But I think that because of his independence,
and his keen sense of justice and fairness, Judge Thomas looks at all sides of
issues when others might be content to examine only one.
For example, Judge Thomas wrestles with the issue of individual rights when
considering group entitlements because he knows that fairness and justice are
not one-sided concepts. He struggles with the points of conflict between the
principle of equality and the practice of affirmative action. But because of his
open-mindedness, I believe Judge Thomas can be persuaded to see that in order
to redress past discrimination, the concept of equity, rather than strict equality,
must be applied. The Constitution speaks of equality, but it also speaks of
justice, and under various circumstances, the principle of equity must be applied
to insure that justice and fairness will be the end result.
Leaders must be understood in the context of the times that spawn them. This
is as true of Judge Thomas as it is of others. As African Americans, we have
been fortunate in having a long line of leaders who, in retrospect, seem right for
their times. These leaders did not always have the same ideology or agree on
strategies, but they all agreed that the goal was to secure freedom and justice for
our people, and thereby help to insure freedom and justice for all. Who can say
that we are not the better off for having had the benefit of their separate and
distinct voices?
In the 1850s, there was Frederick Douglass fighting for the abolition of slavery,
for voting rights for free blacks and for what we now call integration. But, there
was also Martin Delaney, an equally strong abolitionist, who sought freedom and
prosperity through economic and political linkages with Africa, including the
establishment of African American settlements on the African continent. The
legacy of Douglass is the fight for equal rights; that of Delaney, the struggle for
economic empowerment for blacks in America and in Africa.

Sudarkasa Testimony on Thomas      Page 2

At the turn of the 20th century, there was Booker T. Washington speaking for
vocational education for the masses, self-reliance in the black community, and
co-existence with segregation. At the same time, W.E.B. DuBois advocated a
liberal education for the "talented tenth", economic interdependence and an end
to segregation. Booker T. Washington left us Tuskegee University, a healthy
respect for black colleges and other black institutions, and an appreciation of the
value of self-help. On the other hand, DuBois' legacy is that of the NAACP,
admonition to "the talented tenth" to reach back to help the less fortunate, and
the demand that America help those upon whose backs this country was built.
The decade of the 1920s saw the rise and fall of Marcus Garvey, the nationalist,
who preached "Africa for Africans" and "Back to Africa", while envisioning a black-
owned economic network spanning the Atlantic. In the same decade, A. Philip
Randolph, the socialist, emerged as the leading spokesman for jobs and justice
here in America. Both Randolph and Garvey were geniuses at mass mobilization
and mass organization. Garvey left us a legacy of racial pride, and a
commitment to cooperation among Africans "at home and abroad." A. Philip
Randolph, who disavowed socialism and became one of the country's greatest
labor leaders, taught us the effectiveness of direct action and planted the seeds
for fair employment practices legislation.
In more recent times, there was Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, both
committed to justice, equality and empowerment, but while Dr. King chose the
path of integration, Malcolm chose separation, at least until near the end of his
life. Both of them were taken from us in a flash, leaving a legacy of work
unfinished and a job to be done.
Different leaders have "brought us thus far on our way." Different voices have
spearheaded the crusade for freedom and justice.
Now, in the judicial arena itself, we see the great legacy of Thurgood Marshall,
the brilliant architect of legal desegregation and the undefeated champion of civil
rights. Thurgood Marshall-a man of and for his times.
Today, as we anticipate the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme
Court, we see in him a leader with a different voice, for a different time. We who
have put our faith and confidence in him, now come forth to challenge him to
choose well the means by which he will carry on the quest for justice and
equality. We ask him to be ever mindful of the words of Robert Hayden, the
celebrated African American poet, who suggested that we must not rest until "it is
finally ours, this freedom, this liberty...needful to man as air, useable as earth...".
Senators, Judge Thomas: As a nation we must not rest until Dr. King's dream
becomes a reality. We cannot rest until we as a people have overcome.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I have to leave for another appointment in just a minute. I first
want to take this opportunity to welcome all of the witnesses here
today. Sister Virgilius, Father John Brooks, Judge Gibbons, and
Dr. Sudarkasa, we are honored to have you here.
  Now, your statements carry great weight with me, because you
know Clarence Thomas, you have known him for years. You know
his character. You know his ability. You know his dedication. You
know his temperament. I want to thank you for coming here today.
  Now, I just have two questions I want to ask each one of you.
There is no use taking a lot of time, because this is the essence of
it, and I will start with you, Sister. Is it your opinion that Judge
Thomas is highly qualified and possesses the necessary integrity,
professional competence and judicial temperament to be an Associ-
ate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court?
  Sister VIRGILIUS. Most certainly.
  Senator THURMOND. Your answer is yes?
  Sister VIRGILIUS. Yes.
  Senator THURMOND. Father Brooks.
  Father BROOKS. The answer is yes.
  Senator THURMOND. The answer is yes. Judge Gibbons.
  Mr. GIBBONS. My answer is yes.
  Senator THURMOND. The answer is yes. Dr. Sudarkasa.

   Ms. SUDARKASA. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. The answer is yes.
  The second question is: Do you know of any reason why he
should not be made a member of the Supreme Court? Sister?
  Sister VIRGILIUS. NO.
  Senator THURMOND. The answer is no.

   Mr. BROOKS. NO.

  Senator THURMOND. The answer is no.

   Mr. GIBBONS. NO.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Gibbons, the answer is no.
  Dr. Sudarkasa.

   Ms. SUDARKASA. NO.

  Senator THURMOND. The answer is no.
  Thank you very much for your appearance. We appreciate you
coming.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Father, let me ask you a question: What policy does Holy Cross
have now for attracting blacks to Holy Cross?
  Father BROOKS. We operate administratively under a mandate
from the board of trustees to conduct an aggressive and vigorous
recruitment of African-American students, in fact all minority stu-
dents, so it is communicated, particularly to our admissions office
and to other administration of the school, that they are to go out
into the field, to exercise their judgment and to try to find as many
African-American students as we possibly can who would be at-
tracted to Holy Cross and about whom they make the judgment
that they are capable of competing successfully at the college.
                                          86
  The CHAIRMAN. Assuming they find African-Americans who are
capable of competing at Holy Cross College, does that mean they
will be admitted?
  Father BROOKS. If they meet the positive judgment of the admis-
sions boards, they are certainly admitted.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, assuming you find white Americans who
are qualified, does that mean they will be admitted?
  Father BROOKS. NO. Going back to what you were discussing ear-
lier, the lawyers panel, there are a number of students who are ap-
plicants Holy Cross, certainly well qualified, and are denied admis-
sion.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge Gibbons, are you still on the board of Holy
Cross?
  Mr. GIBBONS. I was until September 6 last.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you support that policy when you were on
the board, Judge?
  Mr. GIBBONS. Yes, very positively.
  Senator SIMON. Would you pull the microphone a little closer to
you?
  Mr. GIBBONS. Yes, I was a strong supporter of it.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS it fair
  Mr. GIBBONS. SO was Clarence Thomas.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS it fair to refer to that as affirmative action?
What would you call it, Judge, as a judge, knowing the law as you
do and unwilling to slide out from under the question?
  Mr. GIBBONS. It is affirmative action. We take affirmative steps
to increase the percentage of minority enrollment in the school.
  The CHAIRMAN. And it means that if there is a white student
and a black student, equally qualified, and one place left in class, it
goes to the black student, correct?
  Mr. GIBBONS. Very likely.
  The CHAIRMAN. I compliment you on the policy.
  Mr. GIBBONS. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I think it is a wise policy.
  Mr. GIBBONS. Of course, it is a private institution.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand it is a private institution. I might
say, my experience with Jesuit institutions is that this is uniformly
the case; I have a son who goes to a sister institution that I am not
allowed to mention here, but which happens to be in town.
  Now, let me ask you, Judge, I have never heard anyone refer to
Clarence Thomas as "a legal positivist."
  Mr. GIBBONS. NO, I referred to Robert Bork as a "legal positiv-
ist."
  The CHAIRMAN. I see. OK. I thought you said--that clears it up.
Thank you very much.
  Sister, if Judge Thomas had a view of the Constitution you did
not like, you would still be for him, wouldn't you?
  Sister VIRGILIUS. I sure would.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is right. God bless you. Thank God for loy-
alty. [Laughter.]
  I yield to my friend from Utah.
  Senator HATCH. I want to compliment each of you for what
really were collectively eloquent statements for and on behalf of
Clarence Thomas. I think he was very fortunate to have you, Sister
                                         87

Virgilius, as one of his early teachers, and he says so. He dearly
loves you.

  Father, I am well aware of Holy Cross and I think that you do a
terrific job up there. I have known Judge Gibbons for a long time
and he has been a great jurist in this country and I have great re-
spect for him.

  I have to say, Dr. Sudarkasa, that was as eloquent a statement as
I have ever heard for a judicial nominee, bar none, the Supreme
Court or otherwise. So, I was very impressed with everything that
you folks said.

  The only thing I would ask is do each of you agree with Dr. Su-
darkasa that this man will be an advocate for equal and civil
rights, while on the Court?

  Mr. GIBBONS. I have no doubt.
  Senator HATCH. YOU have no doubt about that.
  Mr. GIBBONS. None. In fact, from reading his opinions, I suspect
that, with respect to the rights of criminal defendants, his addition
to the Court may result in a net improvement of its jurisprudence.
  Senator HATCH. That is interesting, because I believe that he will
be very broadminded with regard to the rights of those who are ac-
cused, as well.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO not scare Senator Hatch off now, Judge.
[Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. Actually, Chairman Biden and I are not too far
apart on some of these issues. It scares him sometimes.
  I do not want to take any more time. I was just impressed with
all of your testimony. I think Judge Thomas is very fortunate to
have four people like yourselves testifying for and on his behalf.
Like Senator Thurmond, I give great weight to the testimony of
those who know him, not just those who posture what they think
he is.
  I know him, too, and my experience is very similar to the experi-
ence of all of you.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you very much. We thank the panel.
  First of all, Sister Virgilius, you mentioned that Judge Thomas
said "thank you" to teachers, that is one of the things that most of
us don't do. Once in a while I will speak to a Rotary Club or some
group, and they will ask: What can we do to raise the standard of
teachers and encourage more young people to go into teaching?
And I will say, "How many of you have ever thanked one of your
teachers?" Hardly ever is a hand raised. I appreciate that.
  One of the problems we have, those of us who are struggling
with this nomination, is to sense where he is going. Sister, you
have been sitting in on a lot of these hearings. Do you recall ever
discussing abortion or any of the other issues that have been dis-
cussed here with Judge Thomas?
  Sister VIRGILIUS. I think Judge Thomas is a man of his own con-
victions, and he will make up his mind according to what he thinks
and knows is best according to the Constitution. I spoke to him
during the summer, around the beginning of August, and I asked
him what he was going to do. And he said, "I am going to continue

        56-271 O--93 4
                                          88

to study constitutional law." And knowing Clarence Thomas, with
the mind he has, I think he has done that, and he will do it.

  Senator SIMON. But in terms of discussing any of these specific
issues that have arisen here, do you recall having any discussions
with him?

  Sister VIRGILIUS. Well, at one time we were discussing affirma-
tive action, and his reaction was--well, he did not--what he
wanted was a helping hand, not a handout. I think that is his idea.

  We have got to help ourselves. We cannot depend on anybody
else. It has got to be our own doing. Granted, we get help from
others, but we cannot wallow in our own misery and say, you
know, everybody else is against me. That is not the Clarence
Thomas I know.

  Senator SIMON. Father Brooks and Dr. Sudarkasa, let me just say
I hope we will be moving soon in reauthorization of the Higher
Education Act. That will be a significant lift to students and to the
country. I hope we do more than just tinker at the edges of the re-
authorization.

  But, Father Brooks, one of the things that concerns me is that I
see two Clarence Thomases: one the Sister is talking about, the one
at Holy Cross; and then I see the record as a Federal official where
he has sided too often, from my perspective, on the side of the priv-
ileged rather than the less fortunate.

  One of the questions that came up was the question of his posi-
tion on South Africa, and let me quote from an article by David
Corn, because Judge Thomas mentioned that while serving on the
Holy Cross board he had supported divestiture. And it says:

  The Reverend John Brooks, the school's president, said there was no significant
board opposition to Brooks' recommendation for divestment, and that he does not
recall Thomas or anyone else taking or needing to take a strong stand.

  First of all, I commend you for making the recommendation. Is
this an accurate portrayal here?

  Father BROOKS. NO, that is not an accurate portrayal. I believe
that is the same quotation I heard you speak of on television a few
days ago.

  Senator SIMON. That is correct.
  Father BROOKS. Therefore, the obvious question is where did you
get it from, and I had to conclude that it probably came from a re-
porter who had spoken with me just a day or two prior to that.
  The reporter's quest was to try to find out rather quickly in a
phone conversation, whether or not Clarence Thomas placed the
question of divestiture on the agenda of the board of trustees, and
then how he voted for it, what the discussion was like around the
board table, and what the vote was at the end of that. In an effort
to complete my phone conversation with the reporter, I tried to de-
scribe for him how the debate would go.
  First of all, I made it very, very clear that the item was placed
on the agenda by myself. I, working with an executive committee,
work out a final agenda for a board meeting. I did tell him that
Clarence participated in the discussion. I told him that we don't
take votes at the end and we don't end up 13 to 12 or whatever it
might be, but rather after a lengthy and a heated and a vigorous
                                          89

debate, there is generally a consensus reached and the board ceases
the discussion at that point, and the consensus is taken as decision.

  And that is precisely what happened at that meeting. The meet-
ing was a vigorous meeting. There were strong positions taken on
both sides. But eventually a consensus was reached, and at least
some of us were able to get what we wanted out of that particular
meeting.

  Senator SIMON. Judge Gibbons, you were on the board then, I
assume.

  Mr. GIBBONS. I presided at the meeting in the absence of the
chairman.

  Senator SIMON. And could you pull that mike a little forward
and give your recollection of the meeting?

  Mr. GIBBONS. Yes. I presided at the meeting in the absence of the
chairman, and my recollection of what transpired and Clarence
Thomas' role in it is exactly as I have stated here. The press report
that you read is not an accurate description of what took place at
the meeting.

  There was a vigorous debate over the difference between the Sul-
livan principles approach and the total divestiture approach, and
Clarence Thomas firmly and persuasively argued for total divesti-
ture.

  Senator SIMON. If I can ask either one of you, how do you mesh
that with his position in opposition to sanctions, serving 10 years
on the board of a publication that regularly ran articles taking the
position of the South African Government? And yet in his testimo-
ny there was no indication that he ever protested those articles--
may I just ask how either of you feel about that and how you can
mesh those positions, or, well, your thoughts on that.

  Father BROOKS. I think the position on the divestiture is based on
his understanding of the immoral nature of the Government of
South Africa at the time. I really can't--I just don't know. I don't
know what motivated him, and I don't know the circumstances
under which he wrote the articles, gave the talks, and so forth. I
really don't think I can be of much help to you on that.

  Senator SIMON. Judge?
  Mr. GIBBONS. Nor can I. I was never even aware of it, and he cer-
tainly never discussed it at the board meeting. But his position on
divestiture was quite clear.
  Senator SIMON. I thank you all very much.
  I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania.
  Senator SPECTER. I join my colleagues in welcoming you here and
thank you very much, Sister Virgilius, and you, Father Brooks, for
your personal insights and your knowledge of Judge Thomas.
  Dr. Sudarkasa, I note an article which you had written for News-
week, in August, on the issue of affirmative action. And you say
you were not a conservative, but you applaud Judge Thomas' ap-
proach on affirmative action. And you raise an interesting point on
those who got into college when you went without any affirmative
action, knowing that you had "made it on our own," and the con-
cern about students who got in on affirmative action resenting the
notion they did not make it to college on their own merit.
  Is your net conclusion that there ought not to be any preferences
on college admission?
                                          90

   Ms. SUDARKASA. I appreciate your asking the question because I
think my position really is not clearly understood.

   First of all, for 3 years at the University of Michigan, I had the
responsibility of advising the university on the implementation of
its policies that would give equitable admission to African-Ameri-
can and other minority students. I have not actually identified
myself with Judge Thomas' position on affirmative action. As a
matter of fact, in the statement I just gave, I said that I think that
he has to understand that while looking at the tension between the
practice of affirmative action and the principle of equality, that
there is also the issue of equity which has to prevail if one wants to
remedy past discrimination.

  What I tried to point out in the Newsweek article, however, is
that while I have a different position from Judge Thomas' on af-
firmative action, I understand how he and many of his generation
come to the positions they hold. Because when I was a professor of
anthropology and associate vice president at the University of
Michigan, many students came to me with brave concerns about
the way they were being treated by their peers, as well as by facul-
ty members, because of the perception that they came into the uni-
versity on something other than their own merit.

  And I make the point that--well, not in that particular article,
but in another. Affirmative action is a little more than two decades
old, let's say a quarter of a century old. There is nothing sacrosanct
as the only means by which we can attain equity and justice for
those who have been discriminated in this society. I believe firmly
that there must be a redress for past discrimination.

  However, I think that if we listen carefully to the critics of some
aspects of affirmative action practice, we may be able to improve
upon that particular means of access. It is not simply that one is
either for affirmative action or against it. One can be for affirma-
tive action and still seek out ways to improve it.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, in what you are articulating, you say
there should be a remedy for past discrimination, in your words, "a
redress for past discrimination," which is somewhat different from
Judge Thomas.

  Ms. SUDARKASA. Right.
  Senator SPECTER. But you believe that Judge Thomas' views are
well within the ambit of acceptability from the point of view of the
African-Americans. Would you advocate the same kind of equity,
equitable practices for employment as well as for educational prac-
tices?

   Ms. SUDARKASA. Yes, I do.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Gibbons, welcome here. You had a very
distinguished career on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
You spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania on the court, which had
jurisdiction over Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, and I
was very interested in your statement. And you come down to the
core issue in your statement when you refer to the dilemma of
when should the Court exercise the awesome power to set aside
laws enacted by popularly elected legislators.

  In the course of this hearing, I have gone into some detail on
Judge Thomas' stated conclusions as to Congress is not a delibera-
tive body and there is not wisdom here, and in taking up some
                                          91

major cases like Johnson v. Transportation Department of Santa
Clara County, saying that he hoped that Justice Scalia's dissent
would provide a majority view in the future, although he expressly
recognized the capacity of the Congress to change the law which
the Supreme Court upheld in the Johnson case and also in other
cases.

  Would you be confident that Judge Thomas will respect the legis-
lature's role and will not make law as a Supreme Court Justice but
only interpret law on that delicate dilemma which you articulate
in your statement?

  Mr. GIBBONS. I think you have asked two things. There are some
areas in which Supreme Court Justices do make law. They make
constitutional law. I think we have to acknowledge that, and an
effort to say that they merely find it is somewhat unrealistic.

  With respect to whether or not he will show due deference to the
legislative branch, I think the best reassurance you have is in the
20 published opinions he has written. They show an appropriate re-
liance on precedent and a fine appreciation of the deference the
courts owe both to Congress and to the administrative agencies,
and they show a reading of Federal statutes which properly ac-
knowledges the primacy of the legislative process.

  I am convinced he will show as a judge due deference to the leg-
islative policy judgments made by the Congress.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Chief Judge Gibbons, when you talk
about the Supreme Court making the law in the constitutional
sense, I wouldn't quarrel with you. But when you deal with some of
the cases that we have talked about here and you have title VII of
the Civil Rights Act, which is a legislative determination, and you
have the Supreme Court deciding one interpretation, as they did in
Johnson, or as they did in local 28, the union, and then Judge
Thomas specifically says that he knows that the Congress has de-
murred on not changing the law, but then criticizes it.

  I would be interested--I have read all of his opinions, too, and
the opinions of the panel when he wasn't writing them. I would be
interested to know if you saw any of those opinions--because, can-
didly, I did not--where he dealt with this issue about deferring to
legislative judgments even though he had a different personal view.

  Mr. GIBBONS. NO, none of them dealt with that issue specifically.
But his general approach to congressional enactment, it seems to
me, was consistent with an appropriate deference.

  Senator SPECTER. Did you see any of that in his opinions? Be-
cause in his writings--and I am not saying I weigh too heavily his
writings, but his writings were to the contrary. But did you see
some of that in his opinions?

  Mr. GIBBONS. Just his general approach. I have them all in the
briefcase, but I am sure you don't want me to pull them out and
start reading them.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you and I might do that together on an-
other occasion when we don't have so many other witnesses to
hear.

  One final question, Chief Judge Gibbons, and that is: You heard
the American Bar Association evaluate him as qualified as opposed
to well qualified. As you state your knowledge of this man over a
long period of time, having had dealings with him on the Holy
                                          92

Cross board, and I can personally attest to your capacity to evalu-
ate lawyers, judges, having known of your work in some detail,
would you rate him well qualified for the Supreme Court?

  Mr. GIBBONS. I personally would, and indeed, I said as much to
the representative of the American Bar Association who called me.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Chief Judge Gibbons.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

  I yield now to my colleague, Senator Brown.
  Senator BROWN. Mr. Chairman, I have long waited for you to
become chairman of this committee. I have a motion for the adop-
tion of constitutional amendments for the balanced budget and
line-item veto and term limitation. [Laughter.]
  Senator SPECTER. Without objection, agreed to.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  Senator SPECTER. And now, Senator Brown, with my departure,
you are the Chairman. [Laughter.]
  Senator BROWN. Judge Gibbons, we have heard from a number of
witnesses and some distinguished scholars today about how Judge
Thomas might rule on the Court. They made a number of observa-
tions, but several of them were very serious charges. These schol-
ars had not had an opportunity to read any of Judge Thomas'
cases. My understanding is that you have read all of his decisions
while he has been on the Circuit Court of Appeals. Would that be
correct?

   Mr. GIBBONS. Yes.

  Senator BROWN. In those decisions, do you find that he has relied
on natural law in any of those decisions?

   Mr. GIBBONS. NO.

  Senator BROWN. Some of these scholars
  Mr. GIBBONS. I might say that none of them presented any occa-
sion where that would be likely, since most of them dealt with stat-
utory issues.
  Senator BROWN. In reviewing the Judge's writings, they indicat-
ed they found and believed that he would follow a very simplistic
approach, see things and be unable to grasp the complexities of
issues that might come before the Court. Having read his cases,
and I assume some of his other writings, could you give us your
view of whether or not that would be his approach to constitutional
questions?
  Mr. GIBBONS. I do not think in adjudicating constitutional issues
it is possible for just to take simplicity issues. They are dealing
with cases that are intensely litigated and they are decided at the
end of the litigation process. The competing considerations are usu-
ally well developed and it is hard in a collegial body of nine Jus-
tices or even in the court of appeals, where the typical panel is
three, to take a simplistic approach. Your colleagues on the bench
will not let you, you have to engage in a rigorous intellectual effort
for which you have become fully prepared by studying the relevant
materials.
  I am fully confident that he will engage, as a member of the
Court, in the kind of internal debate that is necessary for the intel-
ligent moral resolution of complex constitutional issues, many of
which cannot be determined on the basis of facts.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
                                          93

  Father Brooks, how would you characterize Clarence Thomas as
a student?

  Father BROOKS. Clarence was an excellent student. He pursued
his academic life very, very seriously. He was very deliberative in
terms of selecting courses, selecting his major, and he was well
known throughout the college community as being very, very seri-
ous about his studies and was very successful at them, also.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you. We are advised that Holy Cross has
sought out through a recruitment program a diversity of ethnic
groups to join the student body. If Clarence Thomas was not black,
knowing him as you do, would he have been a student, would he
have been admitted to Holy Cross?

  Father BROOKS. I think he probably would have, for this reason:
He was really not the object of our recruitment effort. I was very
instrumental in the early days of Holy Cross' involvement in mi-
nority recruitment, and he was not among the students whom we
identified. In fact, he came to Holy Cross--I think perhaps Sister
knows more about it than I do--I think he came as a result of
advice he received quite likely from Sister or some other teacher
he had earlier in school. His academic record, the seminary he had
been attending the previous year was very, very good, and he
would have got in any under any set of circumstances, in terms of
his academic achievement.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  Sister, do you have anything you would like to add to that?
  Sister VIRGILIUS. Yes. When Clarence was in the seminary in Sa-
vannah, our Sister Mary Carman taught him chemistry and phys-
ics, I think, but she was the one who encouraged him to go to Holy
Cross, as well as Father Dwyer, and several of the high school chil-
dren are pupils of Savannah, are graduates of Savannah, like Wil-
liam Douglas and Carleton Stewart, who were also graduates of St.
Benedict's School, they have gone or were in Holy Cross or have
graduated from Holy Cross, so I think it was something like that
that attracted him to Holy Cross, where he would meet some more
of his former Savannahans.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  One last question that I would appreciate comments from each of
you, if you care to comment: Throughout this last week, the Judge
has received intensive questioning, which is obviously the duty of
this committee, but many of the observations that have come down
from folks who I think could be fairly described as somewhat skep-
tical of Clarence Thomas, and evolved to a charge that Clarence
Thomas simply is not being honest.
  I would appreciate knowing, as people how know Clarence
Thomas, have seen him in action, your assessments of his integrity
and his honesty.
  Sister VIRGILIUS. AS far as I am concerned, Senator, Clarence
Thomas is perfectly honest, and I have watched at home at the con-
vent in Tenafly before I came down here to Washington on
Monday, and I have watched and I think he stood up very well
under the interrogation, he was very articulate and I think he han-
dled himself very well, and I do not in one instant mistrust his
honesty. I think he is perfectly honest, knowing Clarence from a
child.
                                          94

  Father BROOKS. In more than 20 years, I do not think I have ex-
perienced a shred of evidence of any dishonesty or even lack of
candor in Clarence Thomas. I have always found him very forth-
right, very clear in what he is saying to me and very cooperative.
There is not a shred of dishonesty in him, I do not believe.

  Mr. GIBBONS. That is my reaction exactly. In less than 20 years,
more like 15 years of dealing with him, I have found him to be a
completely honorable person in all of his dealings with me an with
others. I think, Senator Brown, the suggestion to which you refer is
that he has undergone some kind of a conversion to obtain confir-
mation. I do not believe that for a moment. It is perfectly clear
that his lot here would have been a lot simpler, if he had simply
said, well, if I am confirmed, I will not vote to overrule Roe v.
Wade.

  The CHAIRMAN. I can assure you that would not be true. You
would find an eruption on this side of the table similar to the one
you found on that side of the table, and you know that not to be
the case, Judge.

  Mr. GIBBONS. But then he could count the votes. [Laughter.]
  Ms. SUDARKASA. Senator, may I just say that I, unlike my col-
leagues here, am not a longstanding acquaintance of Judge
Thomas. I joined this panel, because I was not able to stay for the
afternoon. But I am a person who came to my assessment of the
Judge, having read his speeches. I am not a lawyer, so I did not
read all of the cases that have been referred to, but I read almost
everything I could find about Judge Thomas, and I think that his
observation early in the hearing is the appropriate one, namely
that, before people knew who he was, they had made up their
minds that Judge Thomas fit into one mold or the other. And I
think that seeing the real person, who always came across to me as
someone groping for answers to very tough questions, seeing the
real Clarence Thomas simply put some people off-guard.
  I do not think that he was dishonest. I think that where he had
reservations about giving his opinions, he expressed those, despite
vigorous questioning, and where he felt it was appropriate to give
those views, whether they were ones that he held in 1974 or ones
that he had come to more recently, he gave them, so I thought that
he was very forthcoming.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you. I guess I have come to notice this,
because or a charge or at least a concern was raised that he had
undergone some change of heart with regard to the use of natural
law in that he did not now advocate it as a means of interpreting
the Constitution. But in reviewing the cases, it appears to me that
he has been totally consistent with that view in the cases that he
has written, and I think, surprisingly to some members of the com-
mittee, the fact is he said exactly the same thing about not using
natural law when he was up for confirmation for the Circuit Court
of Appeals, in terms of conversion.
  I do not know what kind of conversion this committee could
induce. I suspect it would be not an angelical conversion, it might
be one more akin to the Spanish Inquisition, but I doubt that, with
a benign charming chairman as we have, I suspect even that con-
version would not be available to this committee.
                                          95

  Mr. Chairman, we passed three constitutional amendments in
your absence. In addition to that, I would like unanimous consent
to have a brief statement put in the record that does not relate to
the legislation, but merely this hearing.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.
  [The statement referred to follows:]

                                                     LINCOLN REVIEW

  Mr. Chairman. In 1981, Judge Thomas was invited to join the Lincoln Review's
Editorial Advisory Board. He accepted. However, I don't believe he attended any
meetings or reviewed or edited any manuscripts. In 1990, he requested that his
name be removed from the Advisory Board. Mr. J. Parker recently wrote to Judge
Thomas confirming that his name had been removed from the Advisory Board. As
well, he said, and I quote, "authors alone are responsible for their articles. Views
expressed . . . are not necessarily those of (Lincoln Review)."

  Mr. Chairman, I believe that it would be very misleading to hold Judge Thomas
responsible for the views of authors who had materials published in the Linclon
Review that Judge Thomas neither reviewed or approved.

  The CHAIRMAN. I will note that neither Sister nor Father took
offense at the reference to the Spanish Inquisition. [Laughter.]

  Sister, you are going to get a lot of letters, I can tell you. Do you
know what the letters are going to say? Why did you all send Clar-
ence to the Cross, instead of Notre Dame or Georgetown? That is
what you will find. I just want you to know, be prepared.

  Is the nun who recommended Holy Cross alive and well?
   Sister VIRGILIUS. She is one of our Sisters. She is Sister Mary
Carman, and she works in pastoral ministry in Binghamton, NY.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU should not have done that. She is going to
get all the letters now, I will tell you.
  Sister VIRGILIUS. I know Carman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Again, I thank you all very, very much.
  Judge I would like very much sometime to discuss with you--I
will not take the time now--about Judge Thomas' writings on nat-
ural law, about which you know a good deal. I would like to discuss
the judicial application of the process and how there is no way to
distinguish between saying one is considering the Framers' view of
what they thought to be natural law and how natural law is ap-
plied in the first instance, since this is a subjective application.
Maybe, if we had more time, we could speak to the committee
about that in the future.
  I want to thank you all very, very much. Judge Thomas is indeed
fortunate to have you as friends and acquaintances.
  Thank you very much.
  Our next panel will be two extremely distinguished lawyers rep-
resenting the Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights Under Law.
Probably one of the most distinguished lawyers and law school
deans in this country today is Erwin Griswold, former Solicitor
General and former dean of Harvard Law School and currently a
senior partner at the firm of Jones, Days, Reavis and Pogue; and
William Brown, cochairman of the Lawyers Committee on Civil
Rights Under Law. I welcome both of you. It is a pleasure to have
you here.
  Dean, it is a pleasure to see you again. Mr. Brown, you are very
welcome to be here, and we are anxious to hear what you both
have to say.
                                           96

   I will leave it to you since, as I understand it, you are both repre-
senting the Lawyers Committee Under Law. Is that correct?

   Mr. BROWN. That is correct.
   The CHAIRMAN. YOU just tell the Chair how you wish to proceed
and in what order.
   Mr. BROWN. I believe I will make the initial statement on behalf
of the Lawyers Committee, followed by Dean Griswold.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. You go right ahead, Mr.
Brown.

STATEMENTS OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF WILLIAM H. BROWN,
  ON BEHALF OF THE LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS
  UNDER LAW AND ERWIN N. GRISWOLD, ON BEHALF OF THE
  LAWYERS COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW

  Mr. BROWN. Mr. Chairman and Senators, my name is, as has
been indicated, William H. Brown III, and I am cochairman of the
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

  Dean Erwin N. Griswold and I are here today on behalf of the
Lawyers Committee. Ninety members of our board of trustees and
66 directors and trustees of local lawyers committees have submit-
ted a statement urging the members of this committee to oppose
Judge Clarence Thomas' appointment as an Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court of the United States.

  We have also submitted the concurring statement of one board
member and three dissenting statements signed by a total of eight
board members.

  The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is a biparti-
san legal organization established in 1963 at the request of Presi-
dent John F. Kennedy to enlist the assistance of the private bar in
the enforcement of civil rights.

  Judge Thomas has rejected much of the decisional framework on
which our Nation's protection of civil rights is based. He has
argued for a limitation of the disparate impact principle enacted by
Congress in 1964, recognized by Chief Justice Burger for a unani-
mous Court in Griggs v. Duke Power Company, and reaffirmed by
Congress in enacting the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of
1972. He has disagreed with the legal theories and evidentiary
bases necessary to challenge systemic discrimination and has op-
posed the temporary race- and gender-conscious remedies the
courts have often held to be necessary in providing effective relief
for systemic discrimination. Regrettably, we have not found the
depth of analysis we must expect and the Nation should require of
any nominee for the Supreme Court, especially one who proposes a
rejection of the hard-won legal foundation for established protec-
tions for equality.

  In this regard, it is not enough that the nominee has repudiated
before this committee so much of the thought and conclusions to
which he laid claim prior to his nomination. This committee now
has nobody at work on which to base its judgment of the nominee's
own judgment. A critical point is that although Griggs and even
Wards Cove agree that an exclusionary practice should not simply
be assumed to be proper and that evidence to show its propriety is
necessary, Judge Thomas has criticized this requirement as assum-
                                          97

ing some inherent inferiority of blacks, Hispanics, and other mi-
norities and women by suggesting that they should not be held to
the same standard as other people.

  His reference to even this remaining common ground between
Griggsand the later decisions in Wards Coveas outside the plain
meaning of the term discrimination necessarily raises the question
whether he continues to accept this basic premise of Griggs or
whether he would even go further than Wards Cove and abolish
the disparate impact standard altogether. Judge Thomas' criticism
of Griggs, the guidelines, and the proper use of statistical proof rep-
resent a radical, unexplained departure from his early endorse-
ment of these tools for approving and remedying discrimination.

  On affirmative action, the bottom line with respect to Judge
Thomas' alternatives for affirmative action is that they are not al-
ternatives. They reach proven cases of intentional discrimination
against identified victims, but much of what is considered to be dis-
crimination today in this country under existing law cannot be
proved under that standard or does not constitute that type of dis-
crimination, including most disparate impact employment situa-
tions.

  There is much legitimate concern, and Judge Thomas expresses
such concern, over what are appropriate affirmative action reme-
dies in a particular case of proven discrimination, or in the settle-
ment of discrimination claims, or in legislation providing for mi-
nority set-asides. The tailoring of equitable relief in this area must
truly be equitable, and that is an enormously difficult task. Judge
Thomas' answer is to do away with the remedy entirely, and that
strikes at the very heart of established civil rights jurisprudence
long recognized by the Congress, successive administrations, and
the courts.

  Judge Thomas has criticized most of the judicial and statutory
building blocks for the protection of civil rights in this country, not
only admittedly controversial and difficult court decisions and gov-
ernmental policies, but also those widely accepted as fundamental
to the protection of civil rights for every American. Judge Thomas
has also attacked the Court and the Congress for their role in
laying down these building blocks, arguing instead for a limited
Government that would leave Americans with rights but uncertain
remedies or no remedies at all for violation of those rights.

  Moreover, we believe that Judge Thomas' changes of position
with respect to matters of fundamental importance do not demon-
strate the reflection before reaching important conclusions which is
essential in a Justice of the Supreme Court. We urge the Senate
not to confirm this nomination.

                           NOMINATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS
I. Introduction
                  My name is William H. Brown. I am a Co-chairman of the
Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Dean Erwin N.
Griswold and I are here today on behalf of the Lawyers' Commit-
tee. Ninety members of our Board of Trustees, and sixty-six
Directors* and Trustees of local Lawyers' Committees affiliated
with us have submitted a Statement urging the members of this
Committee to oppose Judge Clarence Thomas' appointment as an
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. We
have also submitted the concurring statement of one Board member,
and three dissenting statements signed by a total of eight Board
members. We have submitted an updated list of signers of these
statements to the Committee. In addition to our Statement, we
have submitted to this Committee our Memorandum on the Nomination
of Judge Clarence Thomas as an Associate Justice of the United
States Supreme Court.
                  The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is a
                                         99

LAWYERS' COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW

       bipartisan legal organization established in 1963, at the request
       of President John F. Kennedy, to enlist the assistance of the
       private bar in the enforcement of civil rights. The Board of
       Trustees of the Lawyers' Committee is a bipartisan group of
       prominent American lawyers who are committed to strengthening
       civil rights protections where necessary and opposing measures
       which would unjustifiably diminish or curtail equal protection
       under the law. We are a diverse group, which includes liberals
       and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, whites and minori-
       ties, men and women. We are bound together by our commitment to
       civil rights.

                        As a diverse group, 90 of us are united in our opposi-
       tion to Judge Thomas. Although we are firm in our opposition, we
       did not come to this conclusion lightly. We entered into this
       debate with open minds, and, in fact, looked favorably upon the
       President's selection of a minority nominee because we believe it
       imperative that there be a breadth of perspectives among the
       members of the Supreme Court. As with any nominee, however,
       Judge Thomas' qualifications must be evaluated by reviewing his
       writings and speeches, his conduct as a public official and his
       testimony before this Committee.

                        Our Statement and our Memorandum show the care and the
       fairness of our review of his opinions, legal writings and
       speeches, of the actions which he took and the statements which
       he made during his tenure in the federal government. Based on
       these documents and on our evaluation of the testimony which he

       gave during these hearings, we have concluded that Judge Thomas'
       appointment to the Supreme Court would be a serious threat to the
       civil rights of all Americans.

                        The evidence against Judge Thomas is compelling. We
       believe that there are three reasons why this nomination should
       be rejected.

                        First. Judge Thomas has rejected much of the decisional
       framework on which our nation's protection of civil rights is
       based. He has argued for a limitation of the disparate-impact
       principle enacted by Congress in 1964, recognized by Chief
       Justice Burger for a unanimous Court in Griaas v. Duke Power
       Co. .* and re-affirmed by Congress in enacting the Equal Employ-
       ment Opportunity Act of 1972.2 He has disagreed with the legal
       theories and evidentiary bases necessary to challenge systemic
       discrimination,3 and has opposed the temporary race- and gender-
       conscious remedies the courts have often held to be necessary in
       providing effective relief for systemic discrimination.4 Such
       relief is particularly necessary in the frequent situation in

               1 401 U.S. 424 (1971).
               2 Pub.L. 92-261, 86 Stat. 103. The significance of the
       Griaas decision, Judge Thomas' initial support for it, and his
       abrupt change of view on it after the 1984 election, are dis-
       cussed in detail in the Lawyers' Committee's Memorandum at 34-47.
               3 Judge Thomas' views on the use of statistical evidence in
       proving discrimination are discussed in detail in the Lawyers'
       Committee's Memorandum at 47-51.
               4 Judge Thomas' former and present views on affirmative
       action, and his rationale in support of his views, are discussed
       in detail in the Lawyers' Committee's Memorandum at 51-76.

LAWYERS' COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW

       which it is impossible to provide purely individual remedies
       because the nature of the employer's discrimination has made it
       impossible to identify which particular black, Hispanic, Asian or
       woman would have been selected in the absence of discrimination.
       Its rejection would leave the courts without effective power to
       provide relief for the most serious instances of discrimination,
       and would leave employers powerless to undo the harm caused by
       their own past actions and those of others.

                        Second. Judge Thomas' theory of constitutional inter-
       pretation, which disregards the application of the Equal Pro-
       tection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and rejects the
       concept of group violations, would make it impossible effectively
       to end systemic discrimination. For example, he has criticized
       the unanimous decision in Green v. County School Board of New
       Kent County.5 and subsequent Supreme Court school desegregation
       decisions enforcing Brown v. Board of Education that compelled
       the dismantling of state-created segregated school systems.6 He
       has thus disavowed a reading of the Constitution that would deny
       the Supreme Court, and the Congress, the authority to dismantle
       state-created segregated institutions. In the absence of a
       restructuring of long-segregated school systems and a view of the
       Constitution that insists that only individual liberties are

       protected, the black school children in Green would still have
       only an individual choice between a segregated white school and a
       black school. Judge Thomas' theory of constitutional interpreta-
       tion will be discussed by Dean Griswold.

                        Third. in evaluating any judicial nomination, we must
       consider whether the nominee's overall legal philosophy, if
       adopted generally by the courts, provides meaningful protection
       for the civil rights of minorities and women. We accept that a
       nominee may differ with us on particular issues. We attach great
       weight, however, to adherence to the principle of legally en-
       forceable equality of opportunity, and to the degree of thought
       and understanding the nominee brings to the resolution of these
       issues. Regrettably, we have not found the depth of analysis we
       must expect -- and the nation should require -- of any nominee
       for the Supreme Court, especially one who proposes the rejection
       of the hard-won legal foundation for established protections for
       equality.

                        In this regard, it is not enough that the nominee has
       repudiated before this Committee so much of the thought and
       conclusions to which he laid claim prior to his nomination. Even
       accepting the sincerity of his repudiation, the withdrawal of his
       life's work of analysis and reflection leaves a void no one can
       fill. This Committee now has no body of work on which to base
       its judgment of the nominee's own judgment. In the absence of
       such a body of work, there is no sufficient basis upon which this
       Committee can make the determination which should be made before

       recommending the confirmation of any nominee: that the quality,
       depth and breadth of the nominee's analysis would serve the Court
       and the country well in resolving the most important questions
       likely to come before the Court over the next generation.

                        Our concerns in each of these three areas, taken alone,
       would likely be enough to convince us that Judge Thomas should
       not sit on the Supreme Court. Taken together, these concerns
       present very strong evidence that Judge Thomas should not be
       confirmed.

       II. Judge Thomas' Disagreements with the Legal Theories
              and Evidentiary Bases Necessary to Challenge Systemic
              Discrimination
                        A nominee's awareness that there are still substantial

       problems of entrenched discrimination against blacks, Hispanics,
       other minorities, and women is likely to affect his or her under-
       standing of the cases which come to the attention of the Court.
       Between 1983 and 1987, Judge Thomas' view of the breadth of dis-
       crimination seems to have narrowed substantially. In 1983, Judge
       Thomas recognized that discrimination was more than an isolated
       phenomenon, and that it could not be eradicated solely through
       individual remedies.7 In a speech to personnel officials, he

               7 Judge Thomas' views of the breadth of discrimination are
       discussed in detail in the Lawyers' Committee's Memorandum at 22-
       30.

        stated:8

                           Our experience in administering fair employment laws
                           for over the past 18 years has provided greater knowl-
                           edge and understanding of the complex and pervasive
                           manner in which employment discrimination continues to
                           operate. Experience has taught us all that apparently
                           neutral employment systems can still produce highly
                           discriminatory effects. They can also perpetuate the
                           effects of past discrimination.

        In a 1987 law review article describing his disagreement with

        race- and gender-conscious relief, Judge Thomas argued that

        reliance on such relief was a natural outgrowth of an emphasis on

        broad challenges to employment discrimination, and stated that

        the EEOC was de-emphasizing such broad challenges.9 In describ-

        ing the EEOC's docket, he stated:10

                                     In addition, most of our cases involve discrimina-
                           tion by a particular manager or supervisor, rather than
                           a "policy" of discrimination. Many discriminating
                           employers first responded to Title VII by turning from
                           explicit policies against hiring minorities and women
                           to unstated ones. Now even such veiled policies are
                           uncommon; discrimination is left to individual bigots
                           in positions of authority. As a result, the discrimi-
                           nation that we find today more often has a narrow
                           impact, perhaps influencing only a few hiring deci-
                           sions, and does not warrant the use of a goal that will
                           affect a great number of subsequent hires or promo-
                           tions .

        ers during the four years from 1983 to 1987 which would justify
        the conclusion that broad patterns of discrimination had dimin-
        ished in importance, or that women and minorities faced a differ-
        ent kind of threat at the end of this period than they had faced
        at its beginning. As the 1990 and 1991 Urban Institute re-
        ports11 show, there are still broad patterns of disparate treat-
        ment affecting numerous persons at numerous employers.

                           Indeed, Judge Thomas may have come to his present
        emphasis on individual instances of discrimination even if he
        were convinced of the continuing nature of broad-scale, en-
        trenched discrimination. In his profile in The Atlantic Monthly.
        he seemed to agree with the author's conclusions:12

                                     If an employer over the years denies jobs to
                           hundreds of qualified women or blacks because he does
                           not want women or blacks working for him, Thomas is not
                           prepared to see a 'pattern and practice* of discrimina-
                           tion. He sees hundreds of local, individual acts of
                           discrimination. Thomas would require every woman or
                           black whom that employer had discriminated against to
                           come to the government and prove his or her allegation.
                           The burden is on the individual. The remedy is back
                           pay and a job. "Anyone asking the government to do
                           more is barking up the wrong tree," Thomas says.

        This is a philosophy incapable of redressing patterns of discrim-

         ination. Placing repetitive burdens on victim after victim

         ensures that some will falter, ensures that the EEOC's resources

        would be wasted in litigating the same question over and over
        against the same defendant, and ensures that much of the employ-
        er's discrimination will go unremedied.

                           In the pivotal Supreme Court decision of Griaas v. Duke
        Power Co.. the Supreme Court recognized the disparate-impact
        theory of discrimination which Congress had enacted in 1964 and
        upheld the EEOC Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.13
        The treatise on employment discrimination law most widely used by
        practitioners describes Griaas as "the most important court
        decision in employment discrimination law."14 Judge Thomas
        agrees that Griaas is one of the most important cases decided in
        the last twenty years.15 As a result of Griaas. the EEOC Guide-
        lines and the successor Uniform Guidelines, many employment
        practices were discarded because they had excluded minorities and
        women without good reason from jobs they could perform well. Any
        substantial weakening of Griaas carries with it the risk that
        employers will re-adopt needlessly exclusionary practices which
        will stratify the workforce along racial, ethnic, and gender
        lines.

bility to deal carefully and accurately with an issue so impor-

tant. As late as 1983, Judge Thomas issued public statements

which provided strong support for both the Supreme Court's
decision in Griqas and the Uniform Guidelines.16 In commenting

upon the value of the Uniform Guidelines, Judge Thomas noted that

they were developed as a result of "an exceedingly lengthy

process" and that any "future decision to reassess these impor-

tant provisions will be made with an eye to that kind of deliber-

                   The policies advanced by the EEOC Guidelines on Employ-
                   ee Selection Procedures ... have been given the force
                   of law; they have given rise to a measure of certainty,
                   stability in the employment arena; setting legal stan-
                   dards upon which both employers and employees can rely.
He cautioned against any weakening of the Guidelines:19

                   Whole classes of people in this country have come to
                   rely on the vital protection offered by measures such
                   as these.

                   Despite his earlier position, Judge Thomas' publicly

stated view of Griaas and the Uniform Guidelines changed abruptly

after President Reagan's landslide 1984 election, without any

public explanation for the shift or its timing. A few days after

the re-election, he stated that he had "a lot of concern" about

       the Uniform Guidelines, and that there was a good possibility

       that there will be "significant changes".20 Three weeks later,

       he began to question the validity of Griaas and the disparate

       impact doctrine.21 Complaining that Griaas had been "overex-

       tended and over-applied", he seemed to suggest that Griaas be

       limited to unskilled laboring positions.22 In February of 1985

       he criticized Griaas and the Uniform Guidelines in the strongest

       possible terms, and went on to suggest that the use of statisti-

       cal proof in disparate impact cases was unsound:23

                       UGESP also seems to assume some inherent inferiority of
                        blacks, Hispanics, other minorities, and women by sug-
                        gesting that they should not be held to the same stan-
                        dards as other people, even if those standards are
                        race-and sex-neutral. Operating from these premises,
                        UGESP makes determinations of discrimination on the
                        basis of a mechanical statistical rule that has no
                        relationship to the plain meaning of the term "discrim-

      Wards Cove agree that an exclusionary practice should not simply
      be assumed to be proper and that evidence to show its propriety
      is necessary, Judge Thomas has criticized this requirement as
      assuming "some inherent inferiority of blacks, Hispanics, other
      minorities, and women by suggesting that they should not be held
      to the same standards as other people". His reference to even
      this remaining common ground between Griacts and the later deci-
      sion in Wards Cove as outside "the plain meaning of the term
       *discrimination" necessarily raises the question whether he
      continues to accept this basic premise of Griaas. or whether he
      would go even farther than Wards Cove and abolish the disparate-
       impact standard altogether.

                       Such a change would restrict Title VII to cases of
       intentional discrimination, and leave minorities and women at the
      mercy of employers who would then have little incentive to curb
      their use of exclusionary practices. Indeed, employers which
       intended to limit their employment of blacks, Hispanics, or women
      could adopt paper-and-pencil tests, strength tests, and similar
      requirements secure in the knowledge that it would be extremely
      difficult to prove their wrongful intent in adopting such re-
      quirements but the results would be the same as with the more
      readily provable direct forms of intentional discrimination.

       nation, require statistical evidence.24 The Supreme Court has
       repeatedly held that proper statistical evidence taking job
       qualifications, availability and employer explanations into
       account can in appropriate cases be sufficient to prove discrimi-
       nation.25 Few employers admit that they are discriminating, and
       the nature of their actions has to be deduced from all of the
       employment decisions they have made. In Teamsters. the Court
       quoted with approval an appellate decision stating that "In many
       cases the only available avenue of proof is the use of racial
       statistics to uncover clandestine and covert discrimination by
       the employer or union involved."26

                       We cannot and do not quarrel with the propositions that
       statistical evidence must be both accurate and appropriate, that
       unchallenged qualifications must be taken into account, that the
       defendant must always have an opportunity to provide explanations
       for any statistical disparities and that these must be consid-
       ered, and that statistical evidence therefore creates at most a
       rebuttable presumption of discrimination. We also believe that
       there were legitimate grounds for the Chairman or anyone else to

      criticize the EEOC's approach to statistical proof in some of its
      cases. However, our concern is that Judge Thomas' general criti-
      cisms of statistical proof in connection with his statements on
      the Griaas rule and his attacks on the Uniform Guidelines seemed
      to disregard the value of statistical proof altogether.

                       In an important document describing his plans for
      regulatory changes at the EEOC, he told the Office of Management
      and Budget that the plaintiff's threshold burden of proving
      disparate impact under Griaas and the Guidelines was "a mechani-
      cal statistical rule that has no relationship to the plain
      meaning of the term %discrimination. "* Later in the same docu-
      ment, he stated that 'statistical disparities ... may reflect far
      too many factors other than unlawful discrimination by the
      employer for them to give rise to a presumption of such discrimi-
      nation."27

                      These statements are extremely troubling. They may
      reflect an unwillingness to credit statistical proof even where
      the defendant has no credible rebuttal to the statistical evi-
      dence and the plaintiff has gone as far as possible in showing
      that a substantial disparity exists even after taking into
      account racial, national origin or gender differences in avail-
      ability, in the possession of legitimate qualifications, and in
      other relevant factors. Such an approach would have the result
      of providing immunity for the many instances of discrimination

       where no direct proof of discriminatory purpose is available, and
       where discrimination can only be inferred from the results of the
       employer's actions and the absence of any credible explanation.

                        Judge Thomas' criticisms of Griaas. the Guidelines and
       the proper use of statistical proof represent a radical, unex-
       plained departure from his earlier endorsement of these tools for
       proving and remedying discrimination.

       III. Judge Thomas' Positions on Affirmative Action
                        Judge Thomas has consistently voiced reservations as to

       the use of race- and gender-conscious remedies for discrimina-
       tion.28 Despite his personal beliefs, during Judge Thomas'
       first two years at the EEOC, he usually was an advocate for
       existing EEOC policies including affirmative action, and specifi-
       cally including the .use of goals and timetables as flexible
       devices for monitoring an employer's conduct.29 This stance
       often put him at odds with others in the Reagan Administration --
       most frequently, William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney
       General For Civil Rights.

                        After President Reagan's re-election, Judge Thomas
       began to advocate publicly dramatic changes in EEOC policy.30

               28 Judge Thomas' views are discussed in detail in the Law-
       yers  Committee's Memorandum at 52-76.

       In an interview immediately after election day, Judge Thomas an-
       nounced that, henceforth, the Administration would speak with one
       voice and that there would be concerted efforts to make EEOC
       policy consistent with the Administration's philosophy.31 Al-
       though Judge Thomas pledged a concerted effort after the elec-
       tion, he often thereafter took positions worse than the litiga-
       tion positions of Mr. Reynolds' Civil Rights Division. Reynolds
       routinely relied on disparate-impact theory and thought it
       proper, while Judge Thomas was attacking the theory; Reynolds
       routinely relied on the Uniform Guidelines while Judge Thomas
       battled to have them revised. In late 1987, Mr. Reynolds joined
       Judge Thomas in his opposition to the Guidelines.

                        In 1986 and 1987, the Supreme Court decided a string of
       cases which together demonstrated conclusively that race- and
       gender-conscious policies were in many circumstances acceptable
       remedies for discrimination and acceptable responses to patterns
       of underrepresentation of women and minorities.32 Judge Thomas
       expressed his personal disagreement with each of these decis-
        ions.33 He has repeated his disagreement with these decisions

before this Committee.34

The bottom line with respect to Judge Thomas' alterna-

tives for affirmative action is that they are not alternatives.

They reach proven cases of intentional discrimination against

identified victims, but much of what is considered to be discrim-

ination today in this country under existing law cannot be proved

under that standard or does not constitute that type of discrimi-

nation, including most disparate-impact employment situations.

Judge Thomas answers that such discrimination is, at

least, far less significant than it used to be. He believe he is

incorrect; there is .current evidence which establishes that such
discrimination remains pervasive,33 and numerous decisions in

the 1980's and afterwards reflect its many occurrences.

If Judge Thomas is right                       if, for example, there are

few significant discriminatory practices resulting in victims who

cannot be identified      then there will be little further need

for affirmative action. When that happens, if it ever does,

Judge Thomas' concerns about affirmative action will be substan-

tially relieved.

There is much legitimate concern, and Judge Thomas

expresses such concern, over what are appropriate affirmative

action remedies in a particular case of proven discrimination, or

       in the settlement of discrimination claims, or in legislation
       providing for minority set-asides.36 The tailoring of equitable
       relief in this area must truly be equitable, and that is an
       enormously difficult task. Judge Thomas' answer is to do away
       with the remedy entirely, and that strikes at the heart of
       established civil rights jurisprudence long recognized by the
       Congress, successive Administrations, and the courts.

                        Judge Thomas' many public statements do not adequately
       address the difficulty of providing any meaningful remedy for
       patterns of discrimination if affirmative action is not allowed,
       and if it is not possible to determine which particular black,
       Hispanic, Asian or female candidates would have been selected in
       the absence of discrimination. The problem is a very real one,
       and it arises frequently. If there is no meaningful remedy, even
       an intentional discriminator would have succeeded in its primary
       goal: keeping its workforce lily-white, or Anglo, or male, or as
       much so as possible. Such an employer does not limit itself to
       keeping a particular black, Hispanic, Asian or woman out; it
       wants to keep as many as possible out. A remedy which does not
       deprive the employer of such a goal is ineffective.

                        It is not an adequate answer to reject the promotion of
       potential victims because the precise victims are unknowable. If
       such rejections were to become the law, minorities and women
       would be left without the hope of a meaningful change in their

       workplace and would have correspondingly little incentive to file
       charges and litigate cases.

                        There is a substantial question whether Judge Thomas
       would vote to overturn the affirmative-action decisions the Court
       handed down from Weber to Johnson and Paradise. and chus to leave
       minorities and women without any effective remedy for past
       discrimination in those cases where individual victims cannot be
       precisely identified.

       IV. Judge Thomas' Theories of Constitutional Interpretation
                       After reviewing Judge Thomas' legal writings and

       listening to his testimony before this Committee, we have con-
       cluded that Judge Thomas' disagreement with important Supreme
       Court decisions in the area of civil rights is merely an out-
       growth of his unusual, and potentially disastrous, theory of
       constitutional "interpretation, which disregards the Equal Protec-
       tion Clause and rejects the concept that persons are protected
       from violations of their rights based on their membership in a
       group disfavored by society or a legislature. Judge Thomas'
       views stand in stark contrast to long-established constitutional
       analysis and threaten the guarantees of the Equal Protection
       Clause.

                        The Equal Protection Clause, applied to the States in
       the Fourteenth Amendment and applied to the Federal government in
       the Fifth Amendment, prohibits the classification of persons for
       discriminatory treatment on either an impermissible basis (such

                                                                - 19 -

       as race, gender or natural origin), or in the exercise of funda-
       mental rights (such as the right to vote, to marry, to travel,
       and to seek access to the courts). The Equal Protection Clause
       stands as a guarantee that the exercise of fundamental rights are
       as available to the poor as to the wealthy, to whites as well as
       blacks, and to both men and women.

                        Despite the overwhelming importance of the Equal
       Protection Clause in our current system of constitutional juris-
       prudence, Judge Thomas has repeatedly rejected use of the Equal
       Protection Clause. Through statements concerning the proper
       application of constitutional principles,37 his criticism of the
       analysis in Brown v. Board of Education.38 and his interpreta-
       tion of Judge Harlan's dissent in Plessv v. Ferguson.39 Judge
       Thomas has made it plain that he opposes established equal
       protection doctrine on the asserted ground that it protects the
       rights of groups of persons, rather than individuals.

                        Thus, Judge Thomas has written that it is "error" to
       apply "the principle of freedom and dignity" to groups "rather

       than to individuals;**0 he has criticized the school desegrega-
       tion cases following Green v. County School Board, claiming that
       they were "disastrous* and "more concerned with meeting the
       demands of groups than with protecting the rights of individu-
       als;"41 and he has criticized Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke
       v. Board of Regents for an alleged misplaced concern with "the
       admission of groups of whites" rather than with "rights inherent
       in the individual."*2

                        It is apparent that Judge Thomas' rejection of the
       Equal Protection Clause arises from his conviction that the
       Constitution protects only the rights of individuals and that
       only an individual deprivation can be remedied. The result of
       this view of the Constitution is a refusal to recognize that
       discriminatory classifications affect not just one or several
       individuals, but all parsons who find themselves members of a
       disfavored group. Under such a theory, judicial relief or
       congressional enactments designed to remove state-imposed barri-
       ers that effect all persons within a legislative classification
       or disfavored group in society is not supported by the Constitu-
       tion.

                        Not only is Judge Thomas' view completely contrary to
       well-established law, but, if adopted by the Court, would seri-

        of this result is found in Judge Thomas' apparent criticism of
        the green decision as departing from a "color-blind* view of the
        Constitution49. In Green. the Court rejected the school board's
        arguments that it could continue to operate separate "white" and
        "negro" schools simply by adopting a policy that ostensibly
        permitted individual black students to choose to attend "white"
        schools, and held that school authorities had to do more than
        purportedly offer individual students a choice, and were instead
        required "to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to
        a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be elimi-
        nated root and branch."4* To the extent that Green andsubse-
        quent school desegregation decisions imposed an obligation upon
        school authorities to dismantle the segregated "dual" school
        systems, they required "race-conscious remedies." A view of the
        Constitution that forbade a restructuring of long-segregated
        school systems, would have left individual black school children
        alone to confront a segregated school system. In the Supreme
        Court's insistence that black school children be afforded more
        than a theoretical choice, Judge Thomas evidently finds it to
        have been "more concerned with meeting the demands of groups than
        with protecting the rights of individuals."4* The Supreme

       Court's requirement that the continuing reality and structure of
       segregated school systems be dismantled -- in enrollment, facul-
       ty, condition of facilities and other respects ~ Judge Thomas
       appears to perceive as 'disastrous,* reflecting a "lack of
       principle,* and 'against what was best in the American political
       tradition.***

                       Judge Thomas has not restricted his criticism of the
       application of equal protection principles to Brown and other
       school desegregation cases. For example, Judge Thomas has argued
       that deprivations of the right to vote should be found only with
       respect to individuals: 'Instead of looking at the right to vote
       as an individual right, the Court has regarded the right as
       protected when the individual's racial or ethnic group has
       sufficient clout.*47 He has, therefore, criticized equal protec-
       tion precedent generally: 'In both the areas of school desegrega-
       tion and voting, the Court has tended to think in terms of
       protecting groups.' *

                       An insistence that only the liberties of individuals
       are protected -- a deprecation of the protection of persons from

        ation of race, for example, even where necessary to remedy a
        constitutional violation, would render the lav incapable of
        removing barriers to equality for members of a disfavored group.

                           In the course of these hearings, Judge Thomas has
        indicated that he has no reason to 'question or disagree with the
        three tier approach* which the Supreme Court currently uses in
        analyzing cases which fall under the Equal Protection Clause.*9
        Moreover, he has gone so far as to indicate that in some instanc-
        es involving particularly egregious cases of discrimination it
        might be appropriate to be 'ratcheting up or applying a more
        exacting standard* than the current heightened scrutiny.90
        However, his unprecedented endorsement of equal protection
         analysis remains at odds with his long-standing rejection of the
         concept of protecting and remedying deprivations of rights that
        effect all persons falling within a classification. Moreover,
         the mere fact that Judge Thomas now states that he does not

       upon the manner In which he would apply such scrutiny to claimed
       violations. Unless Judge Thomas has completely abandoned his
       theory of constitutional interpretation, a transformation for
       which we have no evidence, and now accepts the notion that the
       constitution provides protection for all members of a group, as
       well as for individual violations, his acceptance of the court's
       current approach to equal protection analysis is meaningless.

                        Even in light of Judge Thomas' acceptance of the
       Court's three tiered approach to equal protection analysis, we
       believe that his preference for individual remedies, as exempli-
       fied by his testimony criticizing the result which the Court
       reached in both Green and subsequent school desegregation deci-
       sions, indicate a continuing emphasis on individual remedies for
       violations of individual rights and a hostility to effective
       protections lac aXl ""ihf o a. disfavored classification.
       Barriers or discriminatory acts which effect whole groups of
       individuals cannot be effectively addressed by remedies which
       only effect a single individual. In light of widespread, insti-
       tutional discrimination which we believe still exists in our
       society, Judge Thomas' emphasis on individual rights and reme-
       dies, and the inevitable consequences of these views, seriously
       threaten our ability to end systemic discrimination.

LAWYERS' COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW

a substantial majority of the members of the Board of Trustee* of

the Lawyers' Committee opposed Judge Thomas' nomination as

Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. After listening to his

testimony, we remain firm in our conviction that Judge Thomas'

legal philosophy, with its disregard for established precedent,

its hostility to the equal protection doctrine, and its reliance

on individual rights, poses a substantial threat to the ability

of minorities and women to enforce their civil rights.

Judge Thomas has criticized most of the judicial and

statutory building blocks for the protection of civil rights in

this country  not only admittedly controversial and difficult

court decisions and governmental policies, but also those widely

accepted as fundamental to the protection of civil rights for

ev6ry American. Judge Thomas has also attacked the Court and the

Congress for their role in laying down those building blocks,

arguing instead for a "limited government" that would leave

Americans with rights but uncertain remedies -- - or no remedies

at all -- - for violations of those rights.

Moreover, we believe that Judge Thomas' changes of

position with respect to matters of fundamental importance do not

demonstrate the reflection before reaching important conclusions

which is essential in a Justice of the Supreme Court.

We urge the Senate not to confirm this nomination.

                    NOTES FOR APPEARANCE OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD
BEFORE THE COMMITEE ON THE JUDICIARY OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE

                               -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1991

        In the time available to me, I can only summarize. I will
first say, though, that the present hearings seem to me to leave
open several basic and important issues.

                                        I. Qualifications
        No one questions that Judge Thomas is a fine man, and
deserves much credit for his achievements over the past forty-
three years. But that does not support the conclusion that he
has as yet demonstrated the distinction -- the depth of
experience, the broad legal ability -- which the American people
have the right to expect from persons chosen for our highest
judicial tribunal. Compare his experience and demonstrated
abilities with Charles Evans Hughes or Harlan Fiske Stone, with
Robert H. Jackson or the second John M. Harlan, with Thurgood
Marshall and Lewis H. Powell, for example. To say that Judge
Thomas has such qualifications is obviously unwarranted. If he
should continue to serve on the court of appeals for eight or ten

                                                               l
                                    125

years, he nay show such qualities, but he clearly has not done so
yet.

        I have no doubt that there are a number of persons, male or
female, African American or while or Hispanic, who have
demonstrated such distinction. I do not question that the
President has the right to take ideological factors into
consideration, and it seems equally clear to me that this
Committee and the Senate have a similar right and power. But
that is no reason for this Committee, or the Senate, approving a
presidential nominee who has not yet demonstrated any clear
intellectual or professional distinction. And the down side is
frightening. The nominee, if confirmed, may well serve for forty
years. That is until the year 2030. There does not seem to me
to be any justification for taking such an awesome risk.

                                          II. Natural Law
         Judge Thomas1 present lack of depth seems to me to be
demonstrated by his contact with the concept of "natural law."
He has made various references to "natural law" in his speeches
                                   126

and writing, though it is quite impossible to find in these any
consistent understanding of that concept. This is very
disturbing to me because loose use of the idea of natural law can
serve as support for almost any desired conclusion, thus making
it fairly easy to brush aside any enacted law on the authority of
a higher law -- what Holmes called a "brooding omnipresence in
the sky."

        That is bad enough, but the nominee has now said to this
Committee that he does not think that "natural law" plays any
role in constitutional decisions. This is frightening indeed --
for it is quite clear in the two hundred years of this country
under the Constitution that "natural law" or "higher law"
concepts do have an appropriate role -- not in superseding the
Constitution but in construing it.

                 Constitutional Law," 42 Harv. L. Rev. 149 (1928), 365

        The Dred Scott case, for example, was one where the Court
did not make adequate use of "natural justice." If it had done
so, recognizing that Scott had become a citizen when he ws taken
to free territory, it might have averted the Civil War.

        A more current example is Privacy. It is not mentioned in
the Constitution, but the Supreme Court has rightly found it
there by interpreting several of the Constitution's clauses
together, in the light of deep-seated "natural justice" concepts,
including the Court's conclusion and understanding that this is
implicit in the basic concept of the founding fathers when they
drafted the Constitution.

        Affirmative Action
        For more than two hundred years, the white settlers in this
new country grievously victimized persons of African descent,
whose descendants today are our African American citizens. Not
only were they held in slavery, but they were denied education
and all cultural advantages.
        It took a Civil War to end this massively unjust regime.
But then we had the period of share croppers, and lynching, and
Jim Crow. Though the slaves were free, their opportunities were
severely restricted by force of law. It was not until the middle
of this century that we began to move ahead, and, under the
leadership of Lyndon B. Johnson, the Congress enacted a number of
constructive statutes designed to provide greater equality of
opportunity.
        We should not forget that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments were adopted as a result of the Civil War.
They were essentially focused on African Americans. They were
designed to pull the African Americans up to a position of
                                    130

equality. Every one was protected by the Due Process Clause, but

the African Americans needed it most. The same was true of the

Equal Protection Clause. As Justice Blackmun has so well said in

this opinion in the Bakke case (Regents of the University of

California v. Bakke, 437 U.S. 265, 407 (1978):

                 In order to get beyond racism, we must first
                 take account of race. There is no other way.
                 And in order to treat some persons equally,
                 we must treat them differently. We cannot --
                 we dare not -- let the Equal Protection
                 Clause perpetrate racial supremacy.

        Frankfurter, J., in Railway Mail Association v. Corsi, 326
U.S. 88, 97 (1945)

                 A State may choose to put its authority behind one of
                 the cherished aims of American feeling by forbidding
                 indulgence in racial or religious prejudice to
                 another's hurt. To use the Fourteenth Amendment as a
                 sword against such State power would stultify that
                 amendment.

        Any one who has lived through the past fifty years can see

that we have made some progress. When I was a young man in the

Department of Justice, now sixty years ago, it would have been
                                  131

inconceivable that the President would nominate a black man to
the Supreme Court, or that the Senate would give serious
consideration in such a case. There were then no black lawyers
in the Department of Justice, no black F.B.I. Agents.

                 We have made progress, but not enough. I hate to think
that the progress we have made will come to a halt by a
literalistic interpretation of the Civil War Amendments, thus
frustrating the accomplishment of what they were clearly intended
to do.

                                       IV. Other Questions
        What is the nominee's approach to other important questions
which frequently come before the Court?
         Separation of Powers
        Preemption -- When dos a federal statute over-ride state
law?
         Intergovernmental immunities
                                    132

                          ON THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS
          AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

                     The Lawyers' Committee Cor Civil Rights Under Law was
 organized in 1963 at the request of President John F. Kennedy to
 enlist the private bar in the enforcement of civil rights. This
 statement is submitted on behalf of the members of the Board of
 Trustees of the Lawyers' Committee whose names are attached. We
 have concluded that Judge Clarence Thomas should not be confirmed
 as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

                    Since its founding, the Lawyers' Committee and its
 members have been concerned with making the rule of law as affec-
 tive fcr the protection of civil rights as it has been for the
 protection of other establisned rignts. We have sought to enf=r=e
 the existing law through litigation on behalf of racial minorities
 and women. In addition, we have endeavored to strengthen civil
-rights protections where necessary, and we. have opposed measures
 which would unjustifiably diminish or curtail equal protection
 under the law.

                    In evaluating any judicial nomination, we must consider
 whether the nominee's overall legal philosophy, if adopted general-
 ly by the courts, provides^ meaningful protection for the civil
 rights of minorities and women. We accept that a nominee nay
 differ with us on particular issues. We attach great weight,
 however, to adherence to the principle of legally enforceable
 equality of opportunity, and to the degree of thought and under-
 standing the nominee brings to the resolution of these issues.

                    Only when a nominee's stated legal philosophy clearly
 threatens these principles, which are of enormous national impor-

                                                                 1
                                    133

tance, have the members of the Lawyers' Committee chosen to recom-
mend the rejection of a nomination. In its 28-year history, the
members have opposed only one other judicial nomine*.

                   We have reviewed and considered the published articles
and written statements of Judge Thomas from the foregoing perspec-
tive. Judge Thomas has announced his disagreement with many of the
major judicial decisions that constitute the underpinnings of
modern-day civil rights jurisprudence. He has proposed in their
stead novel and ill-considered theories of constitutional and
statutory interpretation that would substantially erode the funda-
mental civil rights protections of minorities and woman. Regretta-
bly, we have not found the depth of analysis we must expect -- and
the nation sncuid require -- si any ncair.ee fcr the Supreme Court,
especially one who proposes the rejection of the foundation lor
hard-won, established legal prstactisr.s for equality.

                                                           * **
                   While conceding m a t discrimination still exists, Judge
Thcaas focuses on individual acts or discrimination and de-eapna-
sizes the importance of systematic institutionalized bias. Fcr
example, he has written that in his experience "even such veiled
policies are uncommon; discrimination is left to individual bigots
in positions of authority", "perhaps influencing only a few hiring
decisions". Ke nas disagreed wit-i tr.e legal theories and eviden-
tiary bases necessary to challenge systemic discrimination, and has
opposed the broad remedies the courts have often held to be neces-
sary in providing effective relief to the victims of such discrimi-
nation.
                                    134

                   Judge Thomas' legal philosophy evidences a hostility to,

and rejection of, the core of civil rights jurisprudence in the

areas of school desegregation, voting rights, employment discrimi-

nation, and affirmative action generally. Specifically, we empha-

size the following:

           He has criticized Gran v. School Board at Waw Kent
County. the unanimous 1968 Supreme Court decision which invalidated
"freedom-of-choice1* plans that served to perpetuate officially
segregated white and black schools, and imposed an obligation to
eliminate racial discrimination from schools "root and branch."
Judge Thomas wrote: "... in the Green ... case, we discovered that
Brown not only ended segregation but required school integration.
And then began a disastrous series of cases requiring busing and
other policies that were irrelevant to parents' concern for a
decent education." In the absence of Green. school authorities
would have had no obligation to dismantle state-segregated schools.

                   He has criticized the Supreme Court's decisions inter-
preting the Voting Rights kcz. on the ground that the Court has not
limited its inquiry to whether an individual's rignt to vote is
impaired. This view reflects a refusal to acknowledge that the Act
was designed to remove electoral or districting schemes that dilute
or render meaningless the ballots of minority voters. Judge
Thonas' views would preserve electoral systems that affectively
disenfranchise minority voters.

                   He has criticized the Grieas v. Duke Power Cs. decision,
which construed Title 711 as prohibiting employment practices
having a discriminatory impact, unless they are shown to be ]cb-
relatad. He has questioned the validity of statistical evidence
(an essential element of proof in disparate impact cases challeng-
ing practices that appear fair m fora cut discriminate in effect;,
and implied that the protections of Griaes should be limited to
aenial jobs.

                   He has rejected on policy grounds, such leading prece-
dents as United Steelworkers v. Weber. Johnson v. Transcortatior,
Acencv. Santa Clara Ccuntv. Local 23 of the Sheet Metal Workers v.
Z1.CC. and wnitad statas v. ?ar-adisa. permitting race- and gender-
conscious remedies under limited circumstances. These are often
the only effective remedies for broad patterns of discrimination.

                   He has rejected the Supreme Court's decision in Fullilove
v. Klutzr.ick and has strongly criticized Congress for enacting the
minority sec-aside program it approved as a remedy for the long-
standing exclusion of minority contractors from public works
programs. Similarly, he has sharply criticized affirmative action

of California.
                  Judge Thomas' views reflect a significant dapartura from

the civil rights jurisprudence and policies that are embodied in
Supreme Court decisions, federal and state laws, and the voluntary
actions of private and public institutions throughout the country.
Judge Thomas' views are even more disturbing because ha advanced
these positions when, as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportu-
nity Commission, he was under a sworn duty to enforce and uphold
auch of the law he was denouncing.

                   In addition to disapproving bedrock civil rights prece-
dents, Judge Thcnas has fashioned a radical and incomplete theory
of constitutional interpretation " . a ; undermines protections for
aany of the civil rights of American citizens. Specifically, Judge
Thomas disregards an analysis of discrimination and inequality
under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in
favor of his own only partially articulated interpretation of the
long-dormant Privileges and Immunities Clause, an interpretation
that would result in the protection of only the liberties of
individuals. This constitutional theory would endanger the power
of Congress and the courts to remove state-imposed barriers to
equality for disfavored groups. Quite apart from this nosiir.ee' s
sucstantive positions, his writings and statements suggest a
cavalier disregard for the context and substance of Constitutional
provisions, congressional enactments, and Supreme Court holdings
critical to the rights of minorities and women.
                   For example, in order to reach his theory of constitu-
tional interpretation, Judge Thomas ignores or rejects not only the

                                                               4

text and history of the Fourteenth Amendment, but of the Constitu-
tion itself. Judge Thomas supports bis thaory of interpretation by
the noval argument that tha Declaration of Indapandanca is incorpo-
rated into tha Constitution through its "explicit" rafaranca to tha
Daclaration in Articla VII, which states only:

                   DONE in Convention by tha Unanimous Consent of tha States
                   present tha Seventeenth Day of September in tha Year of
                   Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and
                   of tha Independence of the United States of America the
                   Twelfth.
                   Siailarly, although advocating the incorporation into the
Constitution of broad notions of "inalienable rights" ~ drawn from
the Declaration of Independence -- Judge Thomas rejects and ridi-
cules use of the Ninth Amendment, which refers specifically to
unenuaeraced rights "retained by the people." Thus, Judge Thcsas
displaces the text and established fraaework of constitutional
jurisprudence in favor of undefined natural-law theories.
                   Finally, he has criticized the reasoning of Brawn v.
3card af sd^ea-gian -- a decision that continues to stand as tha
pillar upon which rests much of the jurisprudence of equal rights
and opportunity for minorities and women -- and attributes what tie
views as subsequent Suprene Court arrcrs r= this allegedly faulty
reasoning. Yet his criticism places great emphasis on a question-
able interpretation of Justice Harian's 1396 dissenting opinion in
Plaaav v. >5uaon. and neglects the extensive and scholarly
contributions to the debate concerning the arawn decision. To
suggest that 3rswn and other landmark civil rights decisions rest
on insubstantial ground, without providing a persuasive argument or
analysis to support the criticism, cannot be ignored when the
critic stands as a nominee to the Supreme Court.

                                                               5

                                  ** *

                   Based upon a thorough analysis of Judge Thomas' published
articles and written statements, it is clear that he disagrees
with the legal theories and remedies necessary to remove the
formidable barriers that still block the path of African-Americans
and other minorities; that he is hostile towards leading Supreme
Court civil rights precedent; and that his ill-defined expressions
of constitutional and statutory interpretation would forsake
established constitutional protections for untested theories
lacking credible support in established legal and philosophical
jurisprudence. Although reasonable people may differ with respect
to whether any one of these points vould disqualify Judge Thomas
from being a Supreme Court Justice, we believe strongly that the
combination of these three inadequacies is clearly disqualifying.

                   In light of the deficiencies in his legal analysis, his
disregard for established precedent, and his stark opposition to
the principles thai: the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Cnder
Law has advocated -- which mist be vigorously defended at this
critical juncture in our country's history ~ we urge the United
States Senate to reject tr.e nomination =f Judge Clarence Thcnas as
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

                 Lawyers' Committee For Civil Rights Under Law

                                      Concurring Opinion of
                                  Laurence S. Fordham, Esq.

                                      Boston, Massachusetts

       As a member of the Board of Directors of the Lawyers'
Committee, X wish to file a concurring opinion opposing the
nomination of Judge Thomas as a Justice of the Supreme Court.
I do so solely on the basis that his public record as it
appears is not of the quality that should be nominated and
confirmed as a Justice of the Supreme Court.

       The Nation needs and deserves high quality on the Suprene
Court. The Court is too important for less. The practice of
ideological appointments do not serve the Nation well.

       The position of the Committee of the American Bar
Association that reviewed the nomination confirms this view as
to quality. It is difficult to say that any competent lawyer
or judge is not qualified. Many competent lawyers and judges
are qualified.

       The standard should be excellence or well qualified. Judge
Thonas has not been so rated.

       It does not appear that he has demonstrated the standard of
excellence that should be requisite to nomination and
confirmation to the United States Supreme Court.

       If the President is not going to insist on excellence in
appointments to the Supreme Court, then scrutiny of nominees as
to whether they meet the standard of excellence should begin in
the United States Senate

       Ideological differences aside, excellence should be the
standard, or well qualified in the rhetoric of the Committee of
the American Bar Association that reviews judicial appointments.

       Labels - conservative and liberal - do not assist. Quality
should be the core concern, such as demonstrated before
nomination by Justices Holmes, Harlan and Powell, all ot whom
would be widely perceived by lawyers and other interested
         145

citizens alike, as conservative and meeting the highest
standards of excellence. The Nation imperatively needs 
excellent or well qualified nominees, whether they be labelled
conservatives, moderates or liberals by those disposed to
labels.

       The most important label is excellence.

       If the nomination is confirmed, I sincerely hope he
demonstrates excellence as a Justice of the Supreme Court.

                                                      Respectfully submitted,

         Laurence S. Fordham
         Member, Board of Directors

          of the Lawyers Committee For
          Civil Rights Under Law

                          Dissent to the Statement Presented by
               the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law
                on the Nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas as an
            Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court'

                  I disagree with the decision to file in the name of the
Lawyers' Committee a Statement in Opposition to the nomination of
Judge Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court. I have
great respect for the judgment and intellectual integrity of the
members who prepared the Statement in Opposition. I would feel
more comfortable with their conclusion, however, if a more
balanced view were presented. I am disappointed that every
evaluation, observation or conjecture in the Statement is in the
negative. It is admittedly more a brief in opposition than an
objective evaluation. The Statement does not acknowledge the
positive qualities which Judge Thomas would bring to our highest
court. It does not give the Congress a fair picture of the
nominee.

                  Judge Thomas would bring to the Court a background of
experience seldom, if ever before, found on our highest tribunal.
It cannot be questioned that he is and will remain throughout
life a staunch foe of discrimination. It seems a gross
overstatement to describe Judge Thomas' view of the place of the
Declaration of Independence in constitutional interpretation as a
"radical and incomplete theory." Judge Thomas' view, as I
understand it, is that the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment
are undergirded by the assertion in the Declaration of
Independence "that all men are created equal." This is a
concept of fundamental morality which should be reflected in all
                                      147

of our laws and governmental actions. To suggest that such a
noble principle can be twisted and misused is not a legitimate
criticism of a person who expresses it in its purest form. Nor
does it take anything away from the Civil War Amendments to
recognize that the immorality of discrimination set forth so
clearly in the words of the Declaration of Independence should
have colored the interpretation of the Constitution in pre-war
years, particularly on the issue of slavery.

                  One might differ with some of Judge Thomas' views as to
the procedures by which equality may be achieved and
discrimination eliminated in our land. But he is a young man,
forty-three years of age, with less than twenty years of
professional life as a lawyer. Federal appointee and Judge of a
Federal Court of Appeals. It impresses me greatly that he is
willing to speak and write so extensively about our Nation's
social problems, the related laws and court decisions, the
philosophy behind them and their effectiveness in achieving their
declared objectives. His professional life has been a continuing
learning experience and he has been remarkably honest and
responsible to express his views and so invite constructive
comment. I feel confident that Judge Thomas1 judicial philosophy
will continue to grow and develop during future years on the
Court, just as has been true in the case of many other Justices
before him.

                  Judge Thomas undertakes to dignify the status of the
individual. Those in opposition to Judge Thomas would seemingly

                                                        -2-
                                      148

give primary attention to broad actions for the benefit of groups
with the expectation that individual benefits would follow. Of
course, neither emphasis is intended to be exclusive of the pther
but the difference is meaningful in understanding Judge Thomas'
strengths and the apparent basis for much of the opposition to
him. He has asserted repeatedly that the greatest needs for the
children of the very poor, especially among African-Americans and
other minorities, are education, self-esteem, the work ethic, the
influence of a stable family and the church. As I understand
Judge Thomas, he considers these to be valuable ingredients in a
young person's efforts to overcome the handicaps of racial
discrimination. The difficulty of attainment of these ends
should not direct attention away from their importance. Nor
should Judge Thomas be criticized for expressing his belief that
some of our social programs may not have been administered in a
way that supports attainment of these objectives. We should not
insist that our minority leaders think in "lock-step" and we
should not reject those who attempt to be objective and
innovative in their thinking. Judge Thomas has been an excellent
role model for our young people of all races and economic levels.
He should be applauded for this, not faulted on theoretical and
hypothetical grounds.

                  Judge Thomas' critics make much of his primary emphasis
on the individual rather than on the group in his years of
service as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. A former General Counsel of the EEOC under Judge

                                                        -3-

Thomas, Professor Charles A. Shanor of the Emory Law School,
tells me that, even though the program of the Commission had
reached a point where most large employers had introduced fair
employment policies, systematic cases of discrimination were
pursued vigorously. Additionally, many cases of individual
mistreatment were arising, particularly in discriminatory
discharges and these were actively pressed. Giving primary
emphasis to the vigorous pursuit of meritorious complaints by
individuals is the sort of policy decision a governmental
official must often make, with which others may differ, but it
hardly indicates a rigid and unacceptable judicial philosophy.

                  Over the past two academic years, Judge Thomas has
visited the Emory Law School where he has been named a
Distinguished Lecturer in Law. In that position, he talks with
students, staff, and faculty, teaches several classes and shares
his experiences as a federal judge, with the Law School community.
His travel expenses are paid, but there is no other financial
consideration. On his last visit, he taught classes in Legal
Ethics, Employment Discrimination and Constitutional Law. He met
with the Black Law Students Association, the Federalist Society,
the editorial boards of the School's three law reviews, and
joined in a discussion group with faculty members and, at his
request, the support staff. With the latter group, he spent
about two hours patiently answering questions about what it means
to be a judge. As expressed by Dean Howard 0. Hunter, "It was
apparent to me and to everyone else that he is a man who takes

                                                        -4-
                                      150

his duties as a judge vary seriously and who is aware that a

judge must, to the extent possible, be aware of the compassion of
the law as well as the rule of law.11

                  The following appraisal of Judge Thomas provided by

Dean Hunter is instructive:

                  He has not forgotten his roots. He
                  understands the importance of family, friends
                  and customs in the creation of a society. He
                  recognizes that law is a matter of trust in a
                  democracy, and that without the bonds of
                  trust among members of a. society the
                  possibilities for self-government are slim.
                  He has understanding and empathy for those
                  who are less fortunate, but he is not
                  condescending. He has a sharp intellect and
                  can hold his own with the best of our
                  faculty, but he can also carry on an easy and
                  mutually enjoyable conversation with every
                  member of our support staff. And perhaps
                  most important, he has a wry, self-
                  deprecating sense of humor. Judges who take
                  themselves too seriously and are too sure of
                  their own opinions concern me, but I have
                  more confidence in those blessed with a
                  healthy sense of their own limitations.

This appraisal was heartily endorsed by Larry D. Thompson, a

highly respected Atlanta lawyer, a former United States Attorney

and now a partner with the law firm of King and Spalding. Mr.

Thompson served with Judge Thomas in the legal department of a

national corporation and has for years been a close friend and

confidant.

                  At the least, it would seem appropriate for the

Lawyers' Committee to refrain from a recommendation until after

the nominee has been given a hearing.

                  The strength of my feeling about Judge Thomas is not
attributable to the fact that he is a fellow Georgian and
Southerner. However, interest in the welfare of a native son
compels me to express my views when otherwise I might be inclined
to remain silent. I must confess that my sense of "fair play" is
offended. I regret that the Statement in Opposition fails
entirely to recognize what a bulwark against discrimination and a
fighter for equality this young Judge from Pin Point, Georgia,
can be expected to be for many years ahead.

                  For the foregoing reasons, I dissent from the Statement
in Opposition.

                                                         Introduction
                          This Memorandum provides the background and context for
        the statement in opposition of Members of the Lawyers' Committee
        for Civil Rights Under Law On the Nomination of Judge Clarence
        Thomas as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme
        Court. While many of the materials discussed herein were avail-
        able to the members of the Lawyers' Committee who signed that
        statement, this Memorandum itself was not available because it
        was prepared subsequently. This Memorandum discusses the many
        public statements of Judge Thomas on the proper means of inter-
        preting the Constitution and on the existing legal framework for
        the protection of civil rights.
                           This assessment is based upon Judge Thomas's academic
        writings, speeches, written interviews, and stated positions as
        Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We have
        attempted to provide an accurate portrayal of Judge Thomas's
        views based on these materials. Where Judge Thomas has taken a
        position publicly, we assume that he continues to adhere to that
        position unless he has publicly revised such views. Where Judge
        Thomas has revised his views, we have attempted accurately to
        indicate the substance of the revision and the point in time at
        which it was made.
                           This memorandum does not discuss the decisions of Judge
        Thomas as a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the
        District of Columbia Circuit. Judge Thomas has testified that
        "as a lower court judge, I would be bound by the Supreme Court

        decision* governing a matter.1

                 A. Judge Thomas's Theory of Constitutional Interpretation
                          1. His Rejection of Existing Legal Protections
                                Based on the Equal Protection Clause
                          Judge Thomas has written and spoken widely on his views

        of constitutional interpretation. Judge Thomas has directed his
        attention primarily to the constitutional bases on which racial
        segregation is, or should have been, held to be unconstitutional.
        He has indicated that his analysis of the Constitution and post-
        Civil War Amendments, though based on his interpretation of
        Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson.2
        provides "a foundation for interpreting not only cases involving
        race, but the entire Constitution and its scheme of protecting
        rights."3 Judge Thomas's views stand in stark contrast to long-
        established constitutional analysis and Supreme Court precedent
        and, as such, threaten the foundations of the guarantees of the
        Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

                          The Equal Protection Clause, applied to the States in
        the Fourteenth Amendment and applied to the Federal government in
        the Fifth Amendment, prohibit these governments from classifying

        persons for discriminatory treatment on either an impermissible
        basis (such as race, gender, national origin, and illegitima-
        cy),4 or in the exercise of fundamental rights (such as the
        right to vote, to marry, to travel, and to seek access to the'
        courts). "In recent years the equal protection guarantee has
        become the single most important concept in the Constitution for
        the protection of individual rights.** It was on equal protec-
        tion grounds, for example, that poll taxes, property-ownership
        and other restrictions on the right to vote were invalidated, and
        inequitable voting districts were required to conform to the
        principle of "one person-one vote."* The Equal Protection
        Clause has also stood as a guarantee that the exercise of funda-
        mental rights are as available to the poor as to the wealthy, not
        only with regard to voting, but when faced with criminal prosecu-

                           Judge Thomas has consistently expressed an incomplete
        theory of constitutional interpretation, difficult to understand,
        that radically departs from this most basic protection of civil

        rights afforded by the Constitution. Specifically, Judge Thomas
        disregards an analysis of discrimination and inequality under the
        Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in favor of
        a suggested analysis based upon the Privileges or Immunities
        Clause of that Amendment.

                          Judge Thomas's speeches and written statements do not
        specifically reject every use of the Equal Protection Clause.
        While not disagreeing with the result in Brown v. Board of Educa-
        tion.' Judge Thomas has criticized the basis on which the deci-
        sion was rendered. Through statements concerning the proper
        application of constitutional principles, his criticism of Brown
        and subsequent cases based on equal protection grounds, and his
        interpretation of Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessv and its
        significance, Judge Thomas makes plain that he opposes estab-
        lished equal protection doctrine that he views as protecting the
        rights of groups of persons.

                          Thus, in criticizing the views of Professor Ronald
        Dworkin, Judge Thomas writes:9

                           ... Dworkin does go to the core of the civil rights
                 debate today. Dworkin correctly notes the primacy of the
                 principle of freedom and dignity, but I think he misunder-
                 stands the substance of that principle. He reveals his
                 error by applying his principle to groups, rather than to
                 individuals. For it is above all the protection of individ-
                 ual rights that America, in its best moments, has in its
                 heart and mind.

                          In an 'attempt to recover that foundation of individual
        l i b e r t i e s , * Judge Thomas c r i t i c i z e s the *[Supreme] Court for
        'voodoo jurisprudence'* and *the development of c i v i l rights law
        since Brown*.10 The Brown decision, he contends, i s without
        'adequate principle,* and subsequent Supreme Court decisions that
        followed and applied Brown are 'disastrous* and are 'more con-
        cerned with meeting the demands of groups than with protecting
        the rights of individuals.'11

                          Judge Thomas has developed much of his criticism of the
        Supreme Court's use of the Equal Protection Clause starting from
        his criticism of the reasoning of the unanimous opinion in Brown.
        Specifically, Judge Thomas attributes the "lack of principle* in
        Brown to i t s reliance on * [psychological evidence, compassion,
        and a failure to connect segregation with the evil of slav-
        ery*.12 'Judge Thomas is not alone in his criticism regarding
        Brown, although his statements and writings do not discuss#the
        substantial scholarly debate on this subject.13 Instead, his
        criticism is based nearly exclusively on the reading he gives to
        Justice Harlan's Plessy dissent, discussed below.

                          2. His Proposed Substitution of a Theory of Rights
                                Based on the Privileges or Imjffuruties Clause

                          Judge Thpmas concludes that Brown should have been
        decided on an entirely different basis. "The great flaw of Brown
        is that it did not rely on Justice Harlan's dissent in Pleasv.
        which understood well that the fundamental issue of guidance by
        the Founders' constitutional principles lay at the heart of the
        segregation issue,"14 asserts Judge Thomas. In order to fully
        understand this reference, it is important to understand Judge
        Thomas's interpretation of Justice Harlan's dissent. Essential-
        ly, he views it as an expression of "higher law" jurisprudence,
        and as having been based on the Thirteenth Amendment and the
        Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

                          Specifically, Judge Thomas states that: "Justice
        Harlan's opinion provides one of our best examples of natural
        rights or higher law jurisprudence."" This may not be readily
        apparent, asserts Judge Thomas, because "[i]n order to appreciate
        the subtleties of Justice Harlan's dissent, one must read it in
        light of the 'higher law' background of the Constitution."16
        Such natural law principles are expressed in the Declaration of
        Independence and Judge Thomas finds Justice Harlan to have
        implicitly written them into the Constitution through the Privi-
        leges or Immunities Clause and the guarantee clause of Article

        IV, Section 4 of the Constitution.17 Thus, Judge Thomas con-
        cludes that *[t]he proper way to interpret the civil War Amend-
        ments is as extensions of the promise of the original Constitu-
        tion which in turn was intended to fulfill the promise of the
        Declaration."1* Reference to "the old Natural law tradition of
        the founders -- which enshrines the natural rights of all men",
        Judge Thomas posits, "allows us to reassert the primacy of the
        individual*.19

                          More particularly, Judge Thomas finds the dissent
        premised on three bases growing from the Founder's notions of
        "universal principles of equality and liberty."20 First, he
        restates the dissent's view that the Thirteenth Amendment prohib-
        ited "badges of slavery* in addition to abolishing slavery and
        "decreed universal civil freedom".21 Second, Judge Thomas as-
        serts that Justice Harlan applied the intention of the Founders
        in viewing segregation as "an unreasonable infringement "of
        personal freedom."22 Third, Judge Thomas finds that the dissent
        articulated a view of the Constitution as "color-blind."23

                          Judge Thomas does not inform us of his view of the
        significance of Justice Harlan's reliance on the Thirteenth
        Amendment, other than that Brown was remiss in not finding the
        roots of segregation in slavery.2* As to his emphasis on "per-
        sonal freedom," Judge Thomas has made clear his perspective:
        "Thus has civil rights become entrenched as an interest-group
        issue rather than an issue of principle and universal signifi-
        cance for all individuals."23 Finally, with regard to the "col-
        or blind" Constitution, Judge Thomas identifies "racial prefer-
        ence policies" as at odds with "color-blind principles," and
        criticizes Justice Powell's equal protection analysis in Bakke as
        more concerned with "the admission of groups of whites" than with
        "rights inherent in the individual.""

                          Having identified what he views as the bases on which
        Brown should have been decided, Judge Thomas does not explain the
        practical consequence of such"a decision. Instead, we are
        informed that "[t]he first principles of equality and liberty
        should inspire our political and constitutional thinking" and
        "... could lead us above petty squabbling over * quotas,' * affir-
        mative action,' and race-conscious remedies for social ills."27

                           3. The Consequences of a Theory that the Constitution
                                Doaa Not Require "Equal Protection of the Laws*.
                                But Only Protects Individual Liberty Interests

                          In search of illustrations of the consequences of a
        Brown decision reaching the same result, but based on the princi-
        ples suggested by Judge Thomas, we return to his criticism of the
        cases following Brown. "[I]n the Green ... case," he contends,
        "we discovered that Brown not only ended segregation but required
        school integration. And then began a disastrous series of cases
        requiring busing and other policies that were irrelevant to
        parents' concern for a decent education."28 That Judge Thomas
        distinguishes the Green holding from that of the original Brown
        decision and views it as leading to a series of decisions he
        views as "disastrous" provides some insight into the change in
        course he perceives would, or should, have followed a Brown
        decision grounded in "an adequate principle."29

                           The decision in Green v. County School Board of New
        Kent County.3 was the Supreme Court's response to fourteen
        years of massive resistance to the right of school children to be
         free from segregation announced in Brown. In a unanimous deci-
        sion, the Court held that such rights were not guaranteed simply
        by pronouncements that individual black students were permitted
        to choose to attend "white" schools, where separate "white" and

        "negro" schools continued to be operated on a completely segre-
        gated basis. An officially segregated school district sought to
        preserve segregation by continuing to operate its separate one-
        race schools, but adopting a policy that individual students had
        a 'freedom of choice" to attend a different school. No white
        students chose to attend black schools and few black students
        risked crossing the "color line" to enroll in all-white schools.
        Indeed, this "freedom of choice" was frequently impaired by
        intimidation, threats and violence.31 In answer to the pleas of
        black parents, the Supreme Court held that school authorities had
        to do more than purportedly offer individual students a choice,
        and were instead required "to take whatever steps might be
        necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrim-
        ination would be eliminated root and branch."32

                          Judge Thomas's criticism or characterization of the
        Green decision as "requir[ing] school integration"33 mirrors the
        argument of the segregationist school board in that case: to
        require it to do more to end segregation than announce a "freedom
        of choice* policy amounted to a reading of the Fourteenth Amend-
        ment as requiring "compulsory integration."34 This argument,
        and such a reading of the Fourteenth Amendment, was rejected by

       the Court, which found presented 'the question whether the Board
       has achieved the 'racially nondiscriminatory school system' Brown
       II held must be effectuated," and refused to adopt a per se rule
       invalidating all "freedom of choice" plans."

                          Similarly, to the extent Judge Thomas criticizes the
       decision as not viewing the interests of school children at issue
       as "personal freedom[s]," his argument is similar to that once
       advanced by the segregationists, who sought to avoid the command
       of Brown by arguing that the Constitution guaranteed only "per-
       sonal rights" that could be asserted and enforced only by each
       individual. They were acutely aware that if the Constitution
       protects only the rights of individuals, then only an individual
       deprivation could be remedied, and segregated institutions could
       be preserved, subject only to the exceptional individual case.

                          This strategy is clearly described in correspondence
       between the Chief Counsel of the South Carolina School Segrega-
       tion Committee (the "Gressette Committee"), David W. Robinson,
       and the Attorney General of South Carolina, T. C. Callison, dated
       June 5, and June 11, 1954, respectively -- one month after the
        first Brown decisidn." In suggesting arguments to be presented
       by either the Clarendon County School District or the State of
       South Carolina in the argument leading to the second Brown
       decision, Mr. Robinson proposed the following:

LAWYERS' COMMITTEE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS UNDER LAW

                                    In a recent conversation with you I suggested that
                          the problem of adjusting our public school situation to
                          Chief Justice Warren's opinion might be soluble if the
                          Supreme Court in its decree held to the view that the
                          equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment
                          protected a personal right which could not be enforced
                          or waived by any other person.

                                    It seems to me that if the Court would restrict
                          its decree in line with the principle that the right to
                          go to a mixed school is individual and personal, for
                          which reason each child or each parent may exercise the
                          right, or refuse to exercise it, the school authorities
                          could adjust their operations within the frame work of
                          the present segregated public school program.

                                    Such a restrictive decree would in the first
                           instance permit the Board of Trustees to assign white
                          and negro students to segregated schools. The Legisla-
                          ture might then provide an administrative procedure
                          whereby any parent dissatisfied with the assignment of
                          his child to the nearest segregated school could peti-
                          tion the County board to permit his child to go to the
                          nearest school of the other race. This right to peti-
                          tion should be restricted in various ways. A suggested
                          procedure might require the petition to be filed sixty
                          days before the opening of the September term; might
                          authorize the Board of Trustees to take sworn testimo-
                          ny; require the presence of the parents; restrict the
                          legal representation by the parent to members of the
                          South Carolina Bar resident in the State; might provide
                          an appeal to the County Board, then to the State Board,
                          then to the Court of Common Pleas.

                                    Since it is my view that most of the parents
                          prefer their children to go to segregated schools,
                          there would be few taking advantage of this procedure.
                           If a negro parent persisted in urging his constitution-
                          al right, it is my thought that a few negro children in
                          the white schools would not create a serious problem.

                          Judge Thomas's apparent criticism of the Green decision

        as departing from a "color-blind" view of the Constitution37 is

        troubling. To the extent that Green and subsequent school

                                  decisions imposed an obligation upon school author-
        ities to dismantle the segregated "dual" school systems, they
        required "race-conscious remedies." In the absence of a restruc-
        turing of long-segregated school systems, the black school chi-
        ldren in Green would still have only a choice between a white
        school and a black school. In the Supreme Court's insistence
        that black school children be afforded more than a theoretical
        choice, Judge Thomas evidently finds it to have been "more
        concerned with meeting the demands of groups than with protecting
        the rights of individuals."38 The Supreme Court's requirement
        that the continuing reality and structure of segregated school
        systems be dismantled -- in enrollment, faculty, condition of
        facilities and other respects -- Judge Thomas appears to perceive
        as "disastrous," reflecting a "lack of principle," and "against
        what was best in the American political tradition."39

                           Judge Thomas has not restricted his criticism of the
        application of equal protection principles to Brown and other
        school desegregation cases. For example, Judge Thomas has argued
        that deprivations of the right to vote should be found only with
        respect to individuals: "Instead of looking at the right to vote
        as an individual right, the Court has regarded the right as
        protected when the individual's racial or ethnic group has

        sufficient clout."40 He has, therefore, criticized equal pro-
        tection precedent generally: "In both the areas of school deseg-
        regation and voting, the Court has tended to think in terms of
        protecting groups. This tendency is most sharply noted in cases
        dealing with what is known as affirmative action, but is better
        denominated racial (or gender) preference schemes." 41

                          An insistence that only the liberties of individuals
        are protected -- a deprecation of the protection of persons from
        different treatment through group-based governmental classifica-
        tions -- and a view of the Constitution that forbids consider-
        ation of race, for example, even where necessary to remedy a
        constitutional violation, would render the law incapable of
        removing barriers to equality for members of a disfavored group.

                                   As discussed in the preceding section, Judge

        Thomas has fashioned an interpretation of the Constitution based
        primarily on his own reading of Justice Harlan's dissent in
        Plessv v. Ferguson. Apart from the substance of that interpreta-
        tion, Judge Thomas's method and sources of analysis, in this and
        other instances, deserve comment.

        of the Harlan dissent in Plessv is his conclusion that the
        opinion, insofar as it relied on the Fourteenth Amendment, was
        based on the Privileges or Immunities Clause, rather than the
        Equal Protection Clause. Thus, Judge Thomas begins his analysis
        with the statement that: "It is not sufficiently appreciated that
        Justice Harlan's dissent focused on both the Thirteenth and the
        entire Fourteenth Amendments -- in particular, the 'privileges or
        immunities of citizens of the United States' clause."42 Howev-
        er, he subsequently departs from this view of the dissent's
        treatment of the Fourteenth Amendment and concludes that the
        dissent relied exclusively on the Privileges or Immunities
        Clause. Judge Thomas reaches this conclusion based on the
        following interpretation of the language employed by Justice
        Harlan in the opinion:43

                           He brings us back to privileges and immunities by
                           constantly speaking of "citizens* and their rights.

                                    That Justice Harlan spoke of "citizens" rather
                           than "persons" shows that he relied on the Privileges
                           and Immunities Clause rather than on either the Equal
                           Protection or the Due Process Clause, both of which
                           refer to persons.
                           Justice Harlan, however, quoted the Privileges or
         Immunities, Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the
         Fourteenth Amendment together, along with the separate clause
        granting citizenship to persons born or naturalized in the United
        States, and made frequent use of the word "citizen."'" He did

        not single out the Privileges or Immunities Clause, and used lan-
        guage fully consistent with analysis under the Equal Protection
        Clause:**

                          But in view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law,
                          there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling
                          class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our Con-
                          stitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor toler-
                          ates classes among citizens.
                          Another basic premise of Judge Thomas's interpretation
        of the Plessy dissent is his determination that: "Justice Har-
        lan's opinion provides one of our best examples of natural rights
        or higher law jurisprudence.**4 Although Justice Harlan did not
        speak of "natural law," "higher law," or the Declaration of
        Independence, Judge Thomas finds Justice Harlan to have implicit-
        ly written into the Constitution the natural law principles of
        the Declaration of Independence. As support for this proposition
        Judge Thomas refers us to "the briefs which Homer Plessy submit-*
        ted" to the Court, and the following quote from the briefs:"

                          The Declaration of Independence ... is not a fable as
                          some of our modern theorists would have us believe, but
                          the all-embracing formula of personal rights on which
                          our government is based .... [This] controlling genius
                          of the American people ... must always be taken into
                          account in construing any expression of the sovereign
                          will ... .

                          Indeed, Judge Thomas repeatedly asserts that the
        Constitution cannot be comprehended without reference to higher
        law.

                          The rule of law in America means nothing outside con-
                          stitutional government and constitutionalism, and these
                          are simply unintelligible without a higher law. Men
                          cannot rule others by their consent .unless their common

                          of Nature's God." Natural Law provides a basis in
                          human dignity by which we can judge whether human
                          beings are just or unjust, noble or ignoble.4*

        Although the concept of natural law i s not referred to in the

        text of the Constitution, Judge Thomas argues that the Declara-

        tion of Independence, which includes a reference to "Laws of

        Nature and of Nature's God" is explicitly incorporated into the
        Constitution." According to Judge Thomas,30

                             . . . the Constitution makes explicit reference to the
                           Declaration of Independence in Article VII, stating
                           that the Constitution is presented to the states for
                           ratification by the Convention "the Seventeenth Day of
                           September in the Year of our Lord one-thousand seven-
                           hundred and eighty-seven [and] of the Independence of
                           the United States of America the Twelfth . . . . "

        Based upon this short phrase in the Constitution, he asserts that

        the Constitution should be understood "in light of the Declara-

        tion of Independence" and that the Framers intended to incorpo-
        rate the Declaration into the Constitution.51

                                Which Are Mot Specified

                          Although Judge Thomas has posed an interpretation of
        the Constitution in such a way as to incorporate the natural law
        concepts of the Declaration of Independence, he has expressed a
        disdain for the concept of unenumerated rights "reserved to the
        people" in the Ninth Amendment, despite its explicit inclusion in
        the text of the document. The Ninth Amendment provides that
        *[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall
        not be construed to deny or disparage other retained by the
        people." The Supreme Court has repeatedly found that the Ninth
        Amendment protects the right to privacy and personal liberty.
        For example, relying upon the privacy protections embodied in the
        Ninth Amendment, in Griawold v. Connecticut.32 the Supreme Court
        struck down a Connecticut law that banned distribution of medical
        information and advice about contraceptives to a married couple;
        seven years later, in Eisenstadt v. Baird." the Supreme Court
        held that, under the Ninth Amendment, laws which banned the
        distribution of contraceptives to unmarried individuals were also
        unconstitutional.

                          Judge Thomas does not view the Ninth Amendment as a
        source of unenumerated rights, as in these decisions, but states

                   " 381 U.S. 479 (1965)

        that "it has a great significance in that it reminds us that the
        Constitution is a document of limited government. "** Thus, he
        has expressed "misgivings about activist judicial use of the
        Ninth Amendment,"" and has argued against a reading of the -
        Amendment that protects unenumerated rights. He has suggested
        that an interpretation of the Ninth Amendment which gives the
        Supreme Court power to strike down legislation

                             ... would seem to be a blank check. The Court could
                           designate something to be a right and then strike down
                           any law it thought violated that right."
                           Although Judge Thomas rejects the use of the Ninth
        Amendment to define and protect unenumerated rights as a "blank
        check," he advocates the reinvigoration of the "Privileges or
        Immunities Clause" of the Fourteenth Amendment as a vehicle
        through which undefined natural or higher law principles are
        incorporated into the Constitution." Indeed, Judge Thomas
         frankly admits that such an approach attempts to "giv[e] body to
        open-ended constitutional provisions,"38 and that "[t]he specif-
         ic content of these privileges and immunities is to be determined
        by both the courts* and Congress."3' Judge Thomas would thus
        apparently abandon established Ninth Amendment precedent and the

        to incorporate the undefined higher law principles noted in the

                       and on Enforcement of the 1982 Ayntfrmirts to
                       the Voting Rights Act
                          As noted in the discussion of Judge Thomas' theories of

        constitutional interpretation above, he has rejected the reason-
        ing of the decision in Brown v. Board of Education as without
        "adequate principle.*60 He has also criticized the supreme
        Court's holding in Green v. County School Board, mischaracteri-
        zing it as requiring integration. Although not identifying them
        with any specificity, he has expressed an apparent blanket
        rejection of more than 20 years of established Supreme Court
        school desegregation precedent following Green:61

                          And then began a disastrous series of cases requiring
                          busing and other policies that were irrelevant to
                           parents' concern for a decent education. The Court
                           appeared in these and many other cases to be more
                           concerned with meeting the demands of groups than with
                          protecting the rights of individuals. I could go into
                           other cases, but the principle, or rather the lack of
                          principle, is clear enough. In a good cause, the Court
                           was attempting to argue against what was best in the
                          American political tradition.
                          Judge Thomas's criticisms of Green and of the Supreme
        Court decisions following Green are not limited to his opposition

        to 'busing* as a remedy. The criticized cases include the
        Court's unanimous decisions rejecting persistent delays and
        attempts to avoid compliance with Brown even after Ssn,"
        requiring that faculties be desegregated,'3 announcing that only
        upon school authorities' default in the obligation to remove
        official segregation could courts order desegregation plans,**
        and authorizing compensatory and remedial education programs for
        students harmed by segregation." In addition, these decisions
        applied Brown to 'Northern* school districts, required discrimi-
        natory 'intent* as a prerequisite to the duty to desegregate,66
        and limited the scope of metropolitan remedies.67

                           The grave consequences of Judge Thomas' theories of
        constitutional interpretation with respect to the Equal Protec-
        tion Clause and school desegregation have been discussed above.
        However, if Judge Thomas' views had prevailed, hundreds of
        thousands of school children now in desegregated schools would
         still be attending schools established along racial lines.

                           Judge Thomas has also criticized the Court's Voting

        Although he did not specify the objectionable decision by name,
        it is clear he was referring to Thornbura v. Ginales.'9 a deci-
        sion interpreting the 1982 amendments to Section 2 of the Voting
        Rights Act, which prohibits election laws and practices with a
        racially discriminatory effect, including those that would dilute
        the voting strength of minorities. In Ginales the Court did not
        "assume* that people vote in racial blocs. Instead, the Court
        said that Section 2 requires the plaintiff to bear the burden of
        proving that racial bloc voting does occur in the jurisdiction;
        only then can a challenge be raised to election laws and redis-
        tricting plans that would scatter minority voters so that they
        have no opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice.70

                          A nominee's awareness that there are still substantial

        problems- of entrenched discrimination against blacks, Hispanics,
        other minorities, and women is likely to affect his or her under-
        standing of the cases which come to the attention of the Court.
        For example, if a nominee believes that the remaining problems of
        discrimination essentially involve isolated instances of individ-
        ual discrimination, he or she is unlikely to understand the

        importance of the kinds of procedural and evidentiary rules
        required to allow effective challenges to systemic discrimina-
        tion. The question whether a nominee believes that systemic
        discrimination still exists is therefore highly relevant to his
        or her suitability to sit on the Court.

                          We recognize, as does everyone, that an enormous amount
        of progress in reducing discrimination has been made since the
        time of the decision in Brown v. Board of Education and since
        passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. At the same time, we
        must recognize that a great deal more remains to be done.

                           The Urban Institute's recent studies on disparate
        treatment involving matched pairs of black and white job appli-
        cants, and matched pairs of Hispanic and Anglo job applicants,
        graphically illustrate the extent of the remaining problem. Each
        member of a pair had the same "age, physical size, education,
        experience, and other 'human capital' characteristics," as well
        as the same "openness, apparent energy level, and articulate-
        ness". They had conventional appearance, conventional dress, and
        used conventional language. They applied for low-skilled entry-
         level jobs requiring limited experience, in response to newspaper
        advertisements.71 The testing for disparate racial treatment
        between equally qualified blacks and whites took place in Chicago
         and in Washington, D.C. The results showed substantial differ-
        ences: in 20% of the pairs, whites advanced farther than equally-

qualified blacks, compared to 7% of the pairs in which blacks

advanced farther than equally-qualified whites. In 15% of the

pairs, only whites received job offers, compared to 5% of the
pairs in which only blacks received job offers.72 The testing

for disparate national-origin treatment involved Hispanic citi-

zens and Anglo citizens in Chicago and in San Diego. Hispanics

were three times more likely than equally-qualified Anglos to

encounter unfavorable treatment. Anglos received 33% more

interviews, and 52% more job offers, than equally-qualified
Hispanics.73 The same results could probably be replicated in

every city in the country.                     (

Between 1983 and 1987, his view of the breadth of

discrimination seems to have narrowed substantially. In 1983,

Judge Thomas recognized that discrimination was more than an

isolated phenomenon, and that it could not be eradicated solely

through individual remedies. In a speech to personnel officials,
he stated:7'

Our experience in administering fair employment laws
for over the past 18 years has provided greater knowl-
edge and understanding of the complex and pervasive
manner in which employment discrimination continues to
operate. Experience has taught us all that apparently
neutral employment systems can still produce highly

                          discriminatory effects. They can also perpetuate the
                          effects of past discrimination.

        In a 1983 speech to a women's organization, he stated:73

                          Although, my commitment to individual rights causes me
                          to raise questions about the effectiveness of group
                          remedies, with the exception of quotas, I support many
                          affirmative action remedies. I support these remedies
                          because the remedies which are truly necessary to make
                           individual rights a meaningful reality are not yet on
                          the books.

        In a 1983 speech to the Kansas City Bar Association, Judge Thomas

        stated: "I have even supported the use of some so-called affirma-

        tive action remedies . . . despite the social problems which can
        result from an over-reliance on them . . . ."76 At that time,

        Judge Thomas often stressed the pervasiveness of discrimination

        notwithstanding its changing nature, while recognizing that other
        problems must also be addressed:77

                           In many respects, the problem of discrimination also
                           has changed. Yesterday, we confronted clear-cut acts
                           of blatant discrimination. Today, we are facing less
                           obvious, but no less pervasive effects caused by dis-
                           crimination. Moreover, the problem of discrimination
                           is compounded by a lack of preparation.

                           The EEOC's enforcement priorities mirrored the narrow-

        ing of his views over this period. In a 1987 law review article

        describing his disagreement with race- and gender-conscious

        relief, Judge Thomas argued that reliance on such relief was a

        natural outgrowth of an emphasis on broad challenges to employ-

        ment discrimination:7*

                            ... During the mid- and late-1970s, the Commission
                          concentrated its efforts to enforce Title VII on suits
                          that would affect large numbers of people. The EEOC
                          first obtained authority to litigate employment dis-
                          crimination suits under a 1972 amendment to the Civil
                          Rights Act of 1964. At that time, blatant discrimina-
                          tion was still prevalent. Many employers openly main-
                          tained "No Blacks/Women Need Apply* policies, and many
                          others had moved such practices underground. Minori-
                          ties and women were not advancing into the workforce in
                          as great numbers as many had hoped.

                                   The Commission, confronted with the enormity of
                          the problem and limitations on its litigation resourc-
                          es, took a "bang for the buck" approach to fighting
                          discrimination. Although Title VII guaranteed individ-
                          uals the right to be free of discrimination in employ-
                          ment, the Commission did not attempt to right every
                          wrong individually, a task for which its litigation
                          machinery was not prepared. Instead, the Commission
                          tried to make quick statistical progress by funneling
                          resources into challenges against the hiring practices
                          of some of the country's largest employers. During
                          this period, suits were brought against such companies
                          as American Telephone and Telegraph, General Electric,
                          Ford Motor, General Motors, and Sears Roebuck.

                                   The use of remedies that included racially defined
                          goals and timetables was a necessary consequence of the
                          emphasis on this kind of litigation. Under then-pre-
                          vailing judicial standards, many of these cases were
                          based solely on statistical disparities. Frequently,
                          all that was known was that members of one group were
                          substantially underrepresented in the employer's work-

        many rejected applicants would have been hired absent discrimina-
        tion,* Judge Thomas stated that the result was a resort to relief
        "under which other members of the victims' class were given
        positions as substitutes for those who would have been employed
        had nondiscriainatory selection criteria been used." The result
        of the Commission's concentration on big cases was, he argued,
        that individuals who did not raise class-type issues or other
        priority issues were overlooked. The Commission was unlikely "to
        go to bat" for them in court."

                           In point of fact, the courts have developed means for
        providing back pay relief in situations in which it is impossible
        to identify the individuals who would have been selected in the
        absence of discrimination.80 In Congressional hearings held on
        April 15, 1983, Judge Thomas recognized the propriety of using
        formulas in order to provide effective back pay relief where the
        nature of the employer's discrimination made it impossible to
         identify which of the discriminatees would have been selected in
        the absence of discrimination:31

                          cult to determine the precise relief that should go to
                          the individuals, remedies have permitted the use of
                          formula relief. Whether or not the specific case that
                          you outline would be one of those cases, I do not know.

                          tical to provide such individual relief.

                          In his Yale article, Judge Thomas then turned to the

        present breadth of discrimination and of the EEOC's litigation

        challenging discrimination:*2

                                   The Commission has now entered a new stage in its
                          enforcement work. Although systemic litigation is
                          still an area of emphasis for the Commission, it no
                          longer need consume our resources to the exclusion of
                          other types of cases. Many of the very large employers
                          who once appeared to discriminate have been brought
                          into compliance through lawsuits and Commissioner
                          Charges. Other large and sophisticated employers, in
                          response to the publicity surrounding the Commission's
                          efforts, voluntarily changed their discriminatory
                          practices and sought to remedy the continuing effects
                          of those practices. Now, for the first time, the
                          Commission has the luxury and freedom to fight to
                          vindicate the Title VII rights of every individual
                          victim of discrimination. The Commission has committed
                           itself to a policy of seeking full relief for every
                          victim of discrimination who files a charge.

                                    It is now more likely that the Commission will be
                          able to identify the discriminatees entitled to back
                          pay or placement after making a finding of discrimina-
                          tion in hiring or promotion. Our emphasis on helping
                          all individuals who come to the Commission's offices
                          with claims of discrimination means that in most cases
                          we will know who the victims are. Even many of our
                           larger class action cases are set in motion by com-
                          plaints filed by individuals rather than by the obser-
                          vation of a statistical disparity. Needless to say,
                          the Commission's ability to produce flesh-and-blood
                          victims is very helpful when we go to court to prove
                          discrimination.

                                    In addition, most of our cases involve discrimina-
                          tion by a particular manager or supervisor, rather than
                          a "policy* of discrimination. Many discriminating
                          employers first responded to Title VII by turning from

                          explicit policies against hiring minorities and women
                          to unstated ones. Now even such veiled policies are
                          uncommon; discrimination is left to individual bigots
                          in positions of authority. As a result, the discrimi-
                          nation that we.find today more often has a narrow
                           impact, perhaps influencing only a few hiring deci-
                          sions, and does not warrant the use of a goal that will
                          affect a great number of subsequent hires or promo-
                          tions .

                          We do not know of any change in the actions of employ-

        ers during the four years from 1983 to 1987 which would justify

        the conclusion that broad patterns of discrimination had dimin-

        ished in importance, or that women and minorities faced a differ-

        ent kind of threat at the end of this period than they had faced

        at its beginning. As the Urban Institute reports above show,

        there are still broad patterns of disparate treatment affecting

        numerous persons at numerous employers.

                           Indeed, Judge Thomas may have come to his present views

        even if he were convinced of the continuing nature of broad-

        scale, entrenched discrimination. In his profile in The Atlantic

     ' Monthly. he seemed to agree with the author's conclusions:33

                                    If an employer over the years denies jobs to
                           hundreds of qualified women or blacks because he does
                           not want women or blacks working for him, Thomas is not
                           prepared to see a "pattern and practice* of discrimina-
                           tion. He sees hundreds of local, individual acts of
                           discrimination. Thomas would require every woman or
                           black whom that employer had discriminated against to
                           come to the government and prove his or her allegation.
                           The burden is on the individual. The remedy is back
                           pay and a job. "Anyone asking the government to do
                           more is barking up the wrong tree," Thomas says.

                                    Thomas has made it EEOC policy to shy away from
                           class-action suits. He doesn't want to see blacks

                          treated as numbers. So he favors aggressive attacks on
                          employers only when they are proved to have discrimi-
                          nated against particular persons. "My view is that the
                          most vulnerable unit in our society is the individual.
                          And blacks, in my opinion being one of the most vulner-
                          able groups, should fight like hell to preserve indi-
                          vidual freedoms so people can't gang up on us. Blacks
                          are the least favored group in this society. Suppose
                          we did band together, group against group -- which
                          group do you think would win? We're breaking down
                          everything, ten percent for the blacks, twenty-five
                          percent for the women, two percent for the aged, every-
                          thing broken out according to groups. Which group
                          always winds up with the least? Which group always
                          seems to get the hell kicked out of it? Blacks, and
                          maybe American Indians."

        This is a philosophy incapable of redressing patterns of discrim-

        ination. Placing repetitive burdens on victim after victim

        ensures that some will falter, ensures that the EEOC's resources

        would be wasted in litigating the same question over and over

        against the same defendant, and ensures that much of the employ-

        er's discrimination will go unremedi,ed.

                          As Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-

        sion, Judge Thomas was responsible for directing the administra-
        tive processing34 of scores of thousands of employment discrim-

        ination charges annually. In addition, as Chairman he partici-

        pated with other Commissioners in setting EEOC policy, and in

                  84 Such administrative processing includes intake, investigation, deciding
         whether there is reasonable cause to believe that discrimination occurred, and

        determining whether the Commission would bring suit on particular
        charges of discrimination. He had the right to file Commis-
        sioner's charges of discrimination to challenge broad patterns of
        discrimination. He dealt with other Federal agencies sharing
        responsibilities for equal employment opportunity and for person-
        nel policy, including the U.S Department of Justice, the U.S.
        Department of Labor and its Office of Federal Contract Compliance
        Programs, and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.

                          The powers and duties of the Chairman affect every
        aspect of the EEOC's activities. Charge intake officials and
        investigators look for guidance to the statements and actions of
        the Chairman, and reflect that guidance in their write-up of
        charges and in their performance of investigations. EEOC attor-
        neys look to the Chairman's statements and actions for guidance
        on the kinds of lawsuits the Commissioners will authorize for
        filing. All of these officials will rely on such guidance to
        avoid wasting their time working on claims of discrimination
        which the Commission will not pursue.

                           Nor is this effect limited to the EEOC itself. Because
        of President Carter's Executive Order 12067, issued July 1, 1978,
        the EEOC is the lead agency for the development of EEO policy.35
        Until policy changes are formally voted by the Commission, the
        statements and actions of the Chairman are other agencies' best

          Federal statutes, Executive orders, regulations and policies which require equal

guidance as to th policies the EEOC will adopt in the future,

and as to which they will then have to consult, and possibly pay

deference.

            The EEOC and its Chairman are not, of course, free to

adopt any policies they wish. They are constrained by the

language and intent of Congress in enacting the statutes they

administer  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the

Equal Pay Act of 1963, and the Age Discrimination in Employment

Act of 1965 -- - and the decisions of the courts interpreting

those statutes, with the limited exception of charges of dis-

crimination involving Federal agency employers, Congress has not

given the EEOC the power to issue binding decisions under any of

these statutes. The EEOC may only issue advisory decisions; the

courts have been given the authority to make binding determina-

tions on the meaning of the law and on its application in partic-

ular cases. The administrative*enforcement of the EEO laws

cannot be effective unless it is consistent with the warp and

woof of controlling caselaw interpreting those laws.

            It is obvious that the Chairmanship of the EEOC is an

extremely influential position. While every public official has

the duty to be accurate and fair as to the law and its applica-

tion, a Chairman of the EEOC is under a heightened duty of

accuracy and fairness.

            As Chairman, Judge Thomas failed this test, with

results which seriously harmed the government's enforcement of

Title VII. Consistency in the statement of agency positions is

important to allow staff to perform their jobs under clearly

understood principles and in allowing employers to shape their

personnel actions in accordance with the law. Unfortunately,

Judge Thomas's abrupt shifts of positions on major questions of

Title VII interpretation after President Reagan's 1984 re-elec-

tion left the agency and the public in confusion.

Judge Thomas's views on the breadth of discrimination

also had a major impact in reducing the effectiveness of the

fight against discrimination. During the 1980's, fewer and fewer

private attorneys and the clients they represented were able to

afford decade-long litigation against broad patterns of discrimi-

nation. Broad patterns of discrimination continued, but in

subtler forms which required a much greater investment of time

and money to prove. The courts were imposing ever-greater

evidentiary burdens on plaintiffs, thus requiring greater and

greater reliance on expert testimony while the courts were

simultaneously suggesting      and then holding    that a winning

plaintiff could not recover expert fees even if the expert

testimony had been essential.

The result was that fewer and fewer private attorneys

were willing to file class actions challenging broad patterns of

discrimination, and could only afford to handle individual cases.

Nationally, class action filings to enforce the civil rights laws

went down dramatically, from 1,174 new class actions filed in the

judicial reporting year ending June 30, 1976 to 48 filed in the

judicial reporting year ending June 30, 1987. At the same time,

1987."                                         /

        In these circumstances, enforcement of Title VII by the

EEOC became even more important. When the private bar can no

longer afford to tackle broad problems of discrimination, there

is no effective substitute for governmental enforcement. The

EEOC's shifting of its emphasis from broad cases to individual

cases simply replicated what the private bar was doing, and did

nothing to fill the gap which only the EEOC could fill.

        2. Background and Context of the Supreme Court's

        Unanimous 1971 Decision in Griaas v. Duke Power Co.

        One of the most important developments in the legal

effort to dismantle racial discrimination and exclusion in hiring

was the challenge to discriminatory employment tests and diploma

requirements having little or no relation to job performance.

        Widespread legal attention to the possibility of racial

differences in the ability of tests to make predictions about the

future performance of students or employees did not arise until

the beginning of the substantial dismantling of segregation in

the 1960's. "In a society in which blacks were openly excluded

from jobs, the idea of devoting effort to studying the problem of

        subtle exclusion through tests hardly seemed worthwhile."*7
                          Challenges to employment tests as discriminatory began

        before Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. SS
        2000e e seo., was enacted. In the debate leading to passage of
        the Act, there was extended discussion of a decision by a hearing
        examiner for the Illinois Fair Employment Commission, Mvart v.
        Motorola Co.M The case sparked so much interest because the
        hearing examiner suggested that standardized tests could not be
        used, even if the employer's legitimate interests required their
        use. This led to concern whether passage of Title VII would
        require the same result.

                           Sen. Tower proposed an amendment to immunize from the
        reach of Title VII 'professionally developed ability tests* which
        are "designed to determine or predict whether such individual is
        suitable or trainable with respect to his employment ... . "89
        The amendment was defeated because, in the words of Senator Case,
         it would authorize any test, "whether it was a good test or not,
         so long as it was professionally designed. Discrimination could
        actually exist under the guise of compliance with the stat-
        ute."90 Two days later, Senator Tovver proposed an amendment

        which became section 703(h) of the Act, immunizing only those
        professionally developed ability tests which are 'not designed,
        intended or used to discriminate'.91

                          Thus, Congress accepted the proposition that even a
        good-faith qualification required by an employer would be unlaw-
        ful if the qualification requirement had an exclusionary effect
        on minorities or women and was not job-related. In its brief as
        amicus curiae to the Supreme Court in Griaas v. Duke Power
        Co.n. the Nixon Administration supported this principle.

                           3. The Griaas Decision
                          Griaas upheld the disparate-impact theory of discrimi-
        nation recognized by Congress in enacting the statute. Duke
        Power had imposed high school degree and resting requirements for
        the company's better-paying jobs in the Operations, Maintenance,
        and Laboratory and Test Departments. The unappealed findings of
        the district court'specified that the jobs in these departments
        included positions as trainee, as Power Station Control Operator,
        as Pump Operator, as Utility Operator, as Mechanic, as Electri-
        cian-Welder, as Machinist, as Lab and Test Assistant, as Lab and
        Test Technician, and as supervisors."
                           Existing employees could be assigned to one of these
        departments with either a high school degree or a passing score

        on certain personnel tests. Outside applicants for these better-
        paying departments had to meet both the high-school degree
        requirement and the testing requirement.

                          The Supreme Court found that while the company had not
        acted with a discriminatory purpose, neither the tests nor the
        degree requirement had been "shown to bear a demonstrable rela-
        tionship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was
        used."'* They were therefore unlawful. If these selection
        practices had been proven to be necessary and related to job
        performance, however, their use would have been lawful notwith-
        standing their exclusionary effect.

                                Decisions

                           Griggs held that the 1966 and 1970 EEOC Guidelines on
        Employee Selection Procedure were supported by the Act and its
        legislative history, that there was "good reason to treat the
        guidelines as expressing the will of Congress", and that they are
         "entitled to great deference."'5 The Court re-affirmed this
         ruling in Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody.96 Even the partial re-
        versal of Griaas in Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio.97 left

        on whether the test or other employment practice dispropor-
        tionately affected minorities or women, the refusal to accept a
        mere assumption or assertion that an exclusionary practice is
        job-related, and the employer's burden of at least producing
        meaningful evidence that the exclusionary practice is job-relat-
        ed.98 These surviving common aspects of the Court's disparate-
        impact decisions are the ones which concern us here.

                          The Department of Justice, the Department of Labor, and
        the Office of Personnel Management also have some responsibility
        for enforcement of the fair employment laws. Thus, in 1978,
        these three agencies joined the EEOC in issuing the Uniform
        Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures ("UGESP")," which
        incorporated the principles expressed in Griaas.

                          5. The Practical Importance of the Griaos Decision
                           "The use of tests and similar requirements can be an
        engine of exclusion of minorities far more efficient than any
        individual's personal intent."100 Griaas provided an effective
        means of challenging these practices. The treatise on employment
        discrimination law most widely used by practitioners describes
        Griaas as "the most important court decision in employment

                          As a result of Griaas. many employers stopped using

        off-the-shelf tests which arbitrarily102 excluded minorities and
        women from job opportunites. Many employers had assumed from the
        assurances of test developers that the tests automatically had a
        useful function, and learned otherwise when Griaas. Albemarle
        Paper. and the Guidelines required them to determine whether the
        tests were in fact useful. As a result of Griaas. arbitrary
        height-and-weight requirements were ended for many jobs, includ-
        ing positions as police officers; this had the effect of opening
        up these jobs to the women, Hispanics, and Asians interested in
        these public-safety careers. The elimination of arbitrary high-
        school degree requirements opened up many industrial jobs for
        blacks, particularly in the South where many blacks had been
        required by economic circumstances to leave school to work as
        agricultural laborers, but were then being displaced from agri-
        culture by increasing mechanization.

                          The Executive Officer of the American Psychological
        Association testified before Congress in 198 5 that "psychologists
        generally agree that the caliber of employment practices in
        organizations has improved dramatically since publication of the

        general re-introduction of such t e s t s would defeat the purpose of

                                and for tha Uniform Guidelines

                          As late as 1983, Judge Thomas's public statements

        provided strong support for Griggs and the Uniform Guide-
        lines:103.

                                   We know that employment discrimination today often
                          results from facially neutral employment policies and
                          practices. Our experience in administering fair em-
                          ployment laws for over the past 18 years has provided a
                          greater knowledge and understanding of the complex and
                          pervasive manner in which employment discrimination
                          continues to operate. Experience has taught us a l l
                          that apparently neutral employment systems can s t i l l
                          produce highly discriminatory effects. They can also
                          perpetuate the effects of past discrimination.

        While recognizing that the Uniform Guidelines might need to be

        updated on occasion, he cautioned against any substantial weaken-
        ing:106

                                    We have recognized, for example, that there can be
                          problem areas in the very guidelines for which we have
                          pledged our continued support. But it should also be
                          remembered that the development of the EEOC guidelines
                          was an exceedingly lengthy process. It involved ex-
                          haustive public comment, public hearings and analysis.
                          Any future decision to reassess these important provi-
                          sions will be made with an eye to that kind of delib-
                          erate procedure -- one in which our aim must be limited
                           to measuring the performance of the guidelines as set
                          against their critical purpose. As long as they serve
                           that purpose effectively, there is no present need for
                           revision. We are not dealing with common s  n i n q ordi-

                          measures such as these.

                           In further support of the continuation of the Guide-

        lines, Judge Thomas emphasized the need for stability and pre-
        dictability:.107

                           The policies advanced by the EEOC Guidelines on "Employ-
                           ee Selection Procedures ... have been given the force
                           of law; they have given rise to a measure of certainty,

                           dards upon which both employers and employees can rely.

        Uniform Guidelines, and their importance changed abruptly after

        President Reagan's landslide 1984 re-election, without any public

        explanation for the shift or for its timing. He began the change

        a few days after the re-election, stating that he had *a lot of

        concern* about the Uniform Guidelines, and that there was a good
        possibility there will be 'significant changes*.10*

                          In a newspaper interview three weeks later, he stated
        that he thought the affirmative-action decision in Firefighters
        Local Union Ho. 1784 v. Stotts10' somehow 'modified Griggs*110
        or drew Griaas into question.111 Judge Thomas's statement in
        the interview that "recent Supreme Court decisions preclude
        preferential treatment for anyone who was not actually found to
        be a victim of discrimination* makes clear that the decision to
        which he referred was Stotts; no other recent decision fits that
        description.

                          On its face, this contention is difficult to under-
        stand. The Court's opinion in stotts did not even mention either
        Griaos or the disparate-impact doctrine, stotts involved a
        consent decree establishing hiring goals for blacks as a remedy

        with a seniority system when the fire department implemented
        layoffs. In order for blacks to maintain the percentage repre-

the meaning of  703(h) of Title VII, which the lower courts had

relied upon to state that the layoffs would have a racially

discriminatory effect. The Court held that competitive seniority

an effective protection against the layoffs    could not be

given to blacks who were not actual victims of past discrimina-

tion.

       Compounding the problem of his meaning, Judge Thomas

went on in one of these interviews to state incorrectly that the

employment practices in Griaas had been applied to persons

seeking ditch-digging jobs, and that Griaas had been taken too
far:1"

       "I'm not saying Griaas fv. Duke Power Co.1 is bad* law,"
       Thomas said. "In that case they were asking that work-
       ers have a high school diploma to dig ditches. But the
       way Griggs has been applied has been overextended and
       over-applied."

This description of Griaas had the facts and import of the case

exactly backwards, an error surprising for the head of an en-

forcement agency when discussing the most important case constru-

ing the law he is charged with enforcing.

       It seems a fair inference from this statement that

Judge Thomas favored limitation of the Griaas doctrine to un-

skilled laboring positions. Such a limitation would have robbed

        Griotys of most of its value. Exclusionary practices are rarely

        applied to jobs at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, and

        are much more frequently applied to higher-level positions,

        including higher-level trainee positions such as some of the jobs

        in Griaaa itself. The Lawyers' Committee testified before

        Congress shortly after this statement was made, and commented on
        the importance of the Uniform Guidelines:1"

                          Much of the job advancement of members of minority
                          groups and of women over the last two decades has been
                          a direct result of these rules. The "reasonably cer-
                          tain" awards of back pay against employers, even if
                          they are acting in good faith, does in fact spur em-
                          ployers to take a second look at exclusionary practices
                          before suit is brought, and to look for alternatives
                          which will be just as good in determining real qualifi-
                          cations and which will not have the exclusionary
                          effect. This "spur* would not work, however, if em-
                          ployers did not know in advance the standards by which
                          their tests and other selection standards would be
                          judged.

        Notwithstanding Judge Thomas's earlier statements on the need for

        caution in considering changes to the Uniform Guidelines, and on

        the need of employers and employees alike for stability, at some

        time in 1984 he decided to undertake a complete review of the

        Guidelines. An internal EEOC document outlining the scope of the

        proposed review included questions on whether there should be any
        Uniform Guidelines at all.11* The revelation of this inquiry

        triggered a wave of Congressional hearings and caused substantial

        uncertainty among th parsons and organizations affectad by the

        Uniform Guidelines.

                          In a February 1985 report to the Office of Management

        and Budget on the Commission's regulatory agenda, Judge Thomas

        wrote his sharpest criticism of the Gripas rule:113

                                   The premise underlying UGESP is that but for
                          unlawful discrimination by an employer, there would not
                          be variations in the rates of hire or promotion of
                          people of different races, sexes, or national origins
                          who are hired or promoted by that employer. ... UGESP
                          also seems to assume some inherent inferiority of
                          blacks, Hispanics, other minorities, and women by sug-
                          gesting that they should not be held to the same stan-
                          dards as other people, even if those standards are
                          race-and sex-neutral, operating from these premises,
                          UGESP makes determinations of discrimination on the
                          basis of a mechanical statistical rule that has no
                          relationship to the plain meaning of the term "discrim-
                           ination.*

                                    The premises underlying UGESP are conceptually
                          unsound because (1) blacks, Hispanics, other minori-
                          ties, and women are not inherently inferior, and
                           (2) statistical disparities in the rates at which an
                          employer hires or promotes people of different races,
                          sexes, or national origins may reflect far too many
                           factors other than unlawful discrimination by the
                           employer for them to give rise to a presumption of such
                          discrimination. Moreover, the use of a mechanical
                           statistical rule to define "discrimination" encourages
                           employers to discriminate in order to secure the work-
                           force composition necessary to satisfy the statistical
                           rule.

                          The critical point is that, although Griaqs and even

       be assumed to be proper and that evidence to show its propriety
        is necessary, Judge Thomas has criticized this requirement as
        assuming "some inherent inferiority of blacks, Hispanics, other
       minorities, and women by suggesting that they should not be held
        to the same standards as other people". His reference to even
        this remaining common ground between Griaas and the later deci-
        sion in Wards Cove as outside "the plain meaning of the term
        xdiscrimination' necessarily raises the question whether he
        continues to accept this basic premise of Griaas. or whether he
        would go even farther than Wards Cove and abolish the disparate-
        impact standard altogether.

                          Such a change would restrict Title VII to cases of
        intentional discrimination, and leave minorities and women at the
        mercy of employers who would then have little incentive to curb
        their use of exclusionary practices. Indeed, employers which
        intended to limit their employment of blacks, Hispanics, or women
        could adopt paper-and-pencil tests, strength tests, and similar
        requirements secure in the knowledge that it would be extremely
        difficult to prove their wrongful intent in adopting such re-
        quirements but the results would be the same as with the more
        readily provable direct forms of intentional discrimination.

                          The EEOC continued the issue of changes in the Uniform
        Guidelines on its regulatory agenda for some years, but the
        agency never did announce proposals for specific changes. The
        Uniform Guidelines were still intact when Judge Thomas left
        office as Chairman to take up his judgeship on the U.S. Court of

        Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
                          8. Judge Thomas's Views on the Use of Statistical
                                Evidence in Discrimination Cases
                          The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that proper

        statistical evidence taking job qualifications, availability and
        employer explanations into account can in appropriate cases be
        sufficient to prove discrimination.116 Few employers admit that
        they are discriminating, and the nature of their actions has to
        be deduced from all of the employment decisions they have made.
        In Teamsters. the Court quoted with approval an appellate deci-
        sion stating that "In many cases the only available avenue of
        proof is the use of racial statistics to uncover clandestine and
        covert discrimination by the employer or union involved."117 In
        disparate-impact cases, the plaintiff has the burden of persua-
        sion that the challenged requirement disadvantages members of
        minority groups or women to a substantially greater extent than
        whites or men; such proof is necessarily statistical.

                           In discussing statistical evidence, some important
        qualifications must be kept in mind. First, statistical evidence
        has no weight unless it is both accurate and appropriate. Where
        there are legitimate qualification requirements, such as a
        teaching degree for a position as teacher or an engineering
        degree for a position as engineer, a plaintiff has the burden of

                   116 E.g.. International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States. 431 0 S

        taking such qualifications into account in presenting any statis-
        tical proof.

                          Second. a plaintiff's statistical evidence never
        creates a conclusive presumption of discrimination. A court must
        always consider the defendant's explanation of the statistics,
        and must always consider any alternative statistical analysis
        offered by the defendant. The Supreme Court has made clear that
        a proper statistical showing, not adequately rebutted by the
        defendant, is sometimes enough to prove discrimination. No
        matter how strong or appropriate the statistical proof, there-
        fore, the most it can do is to create a rebuttable presumption of
        discrimination.

                          Third, in the judgment of the Lawyers' Committee there
        were legitimate grounds for the Chairman or anyone else to
        criticize the EEOC's approach to statistical proof in some of its
        cases. Sometimes, the EEOC's presentation was too simple;
        sometimes, it was based on unchecked assumptions on the avail-
        ability of minorities or women for some kinds of jobs. Some-
        times, the EEOC did not pay careful enough attention to the
        employer's explanations and determine whether nondiscriminatory
        factors accounted for substantial parts of the racial, national
        origin or gender disparities on which it relied. Sometimes, the
        EEOC failed to develop the kinds of non-statistical testimony
        which would have made its statistical case much more convincing.
        We cannot criticize Judge Thomas for calling attention to such
        problems. His former agency, and other agencies, bring bad cases

                                                              - 48 -

from time to time. Any serious attempt to reduce the number of

such cases is commendable.

However, our concern is that Judge Thomas's general

criticisms of statistical proof in connection with his statements

on the Griacs rule and his attacks on the Uniform Guidelines

exceeded the dimension of the problems mentioned above, and

seemed to disregard the value of statistical proof altogether.

In his August 8, 1985 statement of the EEOC's regulatory program,

he referred to provisions of the Uniform Guidelines on the

determination of adverse impact                which is the same as the

threshold burden on the plaintiff in a disparate-impact case

as a "mechanical statistical rule that has no relationship to the
plain meaning of the term xdiscrimination. " Later in the same

document, he stated that "statistical disparities ... may reflect

far too many factors other than unlawful discrimination by the

employer for them to give rise to a presumption of such discrimi-
nation."11'

These statements are extremely troubling. The refer-

ence to "the plain meaning of the term 'discrimination'" has been

discussed above. The latter statement may reflect an unwilling-

ness to credit statistical proof even where the defendant has no

credible rebuttal to the statistical evidence and the plaintiff

has gone as far as possible in showing that a substantial dispar-

ity exists even after taking into account racial, national origin

        or gender differences in availability, in the possession of
        legitimate qualifications, and in other relevant factors. Such
        an approach would have the result of providing immunity for the
        many instances of discrimination where no direct proof of dis-
        criminatory purpose is available, and where discrimination can
        only be inferred from the results of the employer's actions and
        the absence of any credible explanation.

                          This type of statement was taken by some EEOC district
        offices as an indication that they were not allowed to consider
        statistical evidence offered by a charging party, or that they
        were only allowed to consider such evidence where some unusual
        condition was met. In one case, we were told that a charging
        party's statistics could only be relied upon if the charging
        party produced a witness who had direct personal knowledge of
        intentional discrimination. In another case, a plaintiff's
        attorney was told that a charging party's statistics could only
        be relied upon if the charging party produced a list of all
        victims of the discrimination in question. We think it unlikely
        that Judge Thomas gave these types of instructions to the dis-
        trict offices; instead, these misguided policies seem to us to
        reflect the confusion of EEOC officials across the country
        arising from Judge Thomas's repeated criticisms of statistical
        evidence without his having clarified what he saw as the proper
        role, if any, of statistical proof.

                          In fact, the type of lawsuit the Commission was likely
        to bring changed during Judge Clarence Thomas' tenure from the

        type of high-impact cases requiring statistical proof to cases
        brought on behalf of individuals alleging specific acts of
        discrimination against themselves.11'

                 E. Judge Thomas's Positions on Affirmative Action
                          1. Overview
                          Judge Thomas has consistently voiced reservations as to

        the use of race- and gender-conscious remedies for discrimina-
        tion. Despite his personal beliefs, during Judge Thomas' first
        two years at the EECC, he usually was an advocate for existing
        EEOC policies including affirmative action. This stance often
        put him at odds with others in the Reagan Administration -- most
        frequently, William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney General
        For Civil Rights. After President Reagan's re-election, Judge
        Thomas began to advocate publicly dramatic changes in EEOC
        policy. In an interview immediately after election day, Judge
        Thomas announced that, henceforth, the Administration would speak
        with one voice and that there would be concerted efforts to make
        EEOC policy consistent with the Administration's philosophy.120

                          Although Judge Thomas pledged a concerted effort after
        the election, he often thereafter took positions worse than the
        litigation positions of Mr. Reynolds' Civil Rights Division.
        Reynolds routinely relied on disparate-impact theory and thought

        it proper, while Judge Thomas was attacking the theory; Reynolds
        routinely relied on the Uniform Guidelines while Judge Thomas
        battled to have them revised. In late 1987, Mr. Reynolds joined
       Judge Thomas in his opposition to the Guidelines.

                          For the next two years, Judge Thomas argued that under
        stotts race- and gender-conscious remedies for discrimination
        were unconstitutional and inconsistent with Congressional intent
        and existing Supreme Court precedent. After the Supreme Court
        held in a series of decisions that United Steel Workers of
        America v. Weber1" was still good law and that narrowly-tai-
        lored and adequately supported race- and gender-conscious reme-
        dies remained both constitutional and in compliance with Title
        VII,122 Judge Thomas opposed such remedies on policy grounds.

                          These developments are set forth in greater detail
        below.

                                President-Elect Reagan's Transition Team

                          Judge Thomas urged major changes in the direction of
        EEOC policy when he served, in December of 1980, on a Reagan
        Administration transition team preparing a report on civil rights

       policy.123 In that role, Judge Thomas drafted a memorandum
        which said:124

                                   It appears that EEOC has made little effort to
                          validate the assumptions underlying affirmative action
                          and has not evaluated the effects of affirmative action
                          on the lot of minorities, especially those who are
                          disadvantage^. . . .

                                   There appears to have been little effort made to
                          determine whether disadvantaged minorities and women
                          have actually been helped as a result of affirmative
                          action. Nor does it appear that there has been any
                          determination that the inadequacies which resulted in
                          the disadvantage have been removed or whether they can
                          be remedied by mere inclusion in the workforce.

                                    In essence, EEOC has extended its authority to
                          include voluntary affirmative action in the private
                          sector without constitutional or statutory basis.
                          Moreover, the assumption that this approach would help
                          minorities and women overcome disadvantages caused by
                          past discrimination has not been verified or reas-

        The memorandum concluded that the EEOC:123

                             ... should reexamine the assumptions underlying affir-
                          mative action, with special emphasis on determining
                          whether there are non-employment and non-race-related 
                          causes of underrepresentation of minorities and women
                           in certain areas.

                               Hia Appointment fta EEOC Chairman in 1982 Until the
                                1984 Re-Election of Preaiden-t Reagan
                                    (a)

                          Although his work on the civil rights transition team
        focused on EEOC policy, Judge Thomas was not initially appointed
       to a position at the EEOC, but instead was named Assistant
       Secretary for Civil Rights in the Department of Education. A
       year later, when he was nominated to be Chairman of the EEOC,
       Judge Thomas was given an opportunity to point the EEOC in the
       direction described in the transition team memorandum. However,
        the new Chairman's initial public statements and actions suggest-
        ed that his personal opposition to race-conscious policies would
        not dramatically affect his administration of the EEOC.

                          Despite his earlier harsh words for affirmative action,
       Judge Thomas initially defended the use of goals and timetables.
        At his 19.82 confirmation hearing as Chairman of the EEOC, Judge
       Thomas testified that:1"

                           [T]here has been an overreliance on quotas in remedying
                          past problems with respect to discrimination. I do
                          not, however, believe that there should be a wholesale
                          abandonment of any sort of numerical timetables, at
                          least as monitoring devices.
                          In public remarks, Judge Thomas explained that much of
        the "heated debate and public confusion over affirmative action
        in fact stems from the confusion between flexible goals and

        inflexible quotas*.127 Judge Thomas told BNA through an aide
        that he has 'never been against goals and timetables when used
       properly for monitoring purposes. But when they are used as ends
        in themselves they become nothing more than quotas".121

                          In March, 1983, Judge Thomas told a women's organiza-
        tion that he continued to have questions about the effectiveness
        of group remedies, but supported affirmative-action remedies
        other than quotas "because the remedies which are truly necessary
        to make individual rights a meaningful reality are not yet on the
        books."12' In April, 1983 Judge Thomas spoke to the Kansas city
        Bar Association, saying that "I have even supported the use of
        some so-called affirmative action remedies ... despite the social
        problems which can result from an over-reliance on them").130

                          Early in Judge Thomas's tenure as Chairman of the EEOC,
        the Commission strongly disagreed with the Justice Department on
        the issue of the propriety of race-conscious prospective remedies
        under Title VII. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
        Fifth Circuit had reversed the district court's denial of approv-
        al for a consent decree containing race-conscious relief in

       appeals had voted to/rehear the case an bane at the request of

        the Justice Department, which argued that such relief was imper-

       missible under Title VII and violated the constitutional right of
       other officers to equal protection.132

                          Judge Thomas and the other Commissioners of the EEOC,

        surprised by this about-face in the federal government's civil

        rights enforcement strategy and disturbed at the Justice Depart-

       ment's failure to consult the EEOC before acting, sent a jointly-

        signed sharply worded letter on January 26, 1983 to Attorney

        General William French Smith, Solicitor General Rex Lee and

       Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds calling

       Justice's failure to consult with the EEOC "deplorable" and

        stating that:

                          Many of our lawsuits and conciliations under Title VII
                          have resulted in the adoption and implementation of
                          affirmative action goaf relief programs which are
                          currently being monitored and enforced by the Commis-
                          sion.

                                   The Justice Department's brief, however, urges the
                          Court of Appeals to reverse a panel decision by an en
                          bane ruling on the ground that Title VII flatly prohib-
                          its courts from awarding any affirmative action relief
                          which benefits individuals who were not specific vic-
                          tims of discrimination. This interpretation of Title
                          VII is the direct opposite of the interpretations

                          the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. If this
                          position is adopted by the courts, it could seriously
                          affect our ability to enforce many existing judgments,
                          consent decrees and settlement agreements entered into
                          between this agency and employers over the last 11
                          years. ...
                          The EEOC Commissioners subsequently voted to file their
        own aiigyy brief in the citv of New Orleans case supporting
        approval of the consent decree and arguing that neither Title VII
        nor equal protection prohibits a court from ordering race-con-
        scious remedies.1" In another letter to Attorney General Wil-
        liam French Smith, chairman Thomas informed Smith of the EEOC's
        substantive position in City of New Orleans and suggested that,
        though it would be beneficial if the Administration could speak
        with one voice on these issues, "considerable public benefit
        would result from squarely joining these important legal issues
        for consideration in the Fifth Circuit.*134 On April 5, 1983,
        bowing to intense pressure from the White House, the EEOC re-
        scinded the decision to file its own brief in Citv of New Or-
        leans.X3i Explaining the Commission's decision, Chairman Thomas
        stated, "The Commission decided it would be within the public

ment litigation responsibility."13* Judge Thomas later asserted

that this was the only time the White House ever attempted to
influence EEOC policy.1"

       In a Kay 1983 interview, Judge Thomas reflected on his

first year at the EEOC and on Williams v. City of New Orleans.

He defended the substantive position in support of affirmative

action which the Commission took in its letters to the Attorney

General - -- and which the EEOC had wished to defend in an amicus

brief  because it was supported by the law in effect at the

time, but also mentioned his disagreement with affirmative action
on policy grounds:13*

                "The debate over affirmative action is a real
       one," he observed. "There is argument about what the
       law should be, there is no argument about what the law
       is, and that's the position the Commission took in the
       Williams case," he said. "I disagree from an ideologi-
       cal viewpoint [with] what was being done in Williams,
       but the law supports what is being done. .That was the
       opinion of our general counsel and that is precisely
       what I have an obligation to uphold."

       to undertake 'affirmative action to ensure that applicants are
       employed, and that employees are treated during employment,
       without regard to their race, color, religion, sex or national
       origin.'140 The order i s implemented by the Department of
       Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs ("OFCCP").
       Since 1978, OFCCP's implementing guidelines have required that
        any government contractor with SO or more employees and a con-
        t r a c t of $50,000 or more maintain a written affirmative action
        plan.141 The plan must contain an analysis of the contractor's
        workforce to determine whether there are any occupations in which
        minorities or women are not being utilized in accordance with
        their availability, and must detail the steps being taken to
        address any problems with the utilization of women or minorities.
        Where there are deficiencies, the contractor is to establish
        "gn*]s and timetables to which the contractor's good faith
        efforts must be directed to correct the deficiencies*.1'2
        'Goals may not be rigid and inflexible quotas which must be met,
        but must be targets reasonably attainable by means of applying
        every good faith effort to make all aspects of the entire affir-
        mative action program work."1'1

        issue revised guidelines under Executive Order 11246 by the end
        of 1982.14t The proposed revisions were controversial, in part
        because they raised the threshold for the written affirmative
        action plan requirement to contractors with 100 or more employees
        and a contract of at least $100,000 and in part because they cut
        back on the use of pre-award audits. When they were submitted to
        the EEOC for review, the Commissioners, including Chairman
        Thomas, objected to portions of the guidelines as contrary to
        established equal opportunity policy.143

                          In hearings before the Subcommittee on Employment
        Opportunities of the House Education and Labor Committee on
        April 15, 1983, Chairman Thomas voiced the Commission's view that
        the proposals were not stringent enough and would create the
        possibility of a contractor's being in compliance with OFCCP's
        regulations but susceptible to a finding of discrimination under
        Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.lts

tie VII, including too narrow an approach to the determination of

the availability of women and members of minority groups, by

"failure to include in their definition of 'availability' minori-

ties and women whom the contractor can reasonably train". He

expressed concern that OFCCP had already implemented certain

policy changes without having published the changes in the

Federal Register for public comment, such as orally instructing

OFCCP field staff that contractors would not be permitted to

establish hiring goals that exceed the proposed narrow definition
of "availability.*147 Judge Thomas was concerned by this limi-

           told BNA. In the future, the five-member Commission

           will be working to see that its philosophy is carried

           out on the field and that its policy -- "not filtered

           and translated'  is carried out by Commission staff-

           ers.

Notwithstanding his prior recognition of the utility of goals and

timetables as instruments by which to measure an employer's

progress in remedying the effects of its past discrimination, he

stated:"'

           People have tended to take comfort in these numbers

           'They think that somehow hiring by these numbers

           even without any oversight or monitoring  enough was

           being done. I think that's baloney."

Further notwithstanding his earlier support for goals and time-

tables as monitoring devices, in 1987 he criticized them and

their proponents:130
                  Goals and timetables, long a popular rallying cry among
                  some who claim to be concerned with the right to equal
                  employment opportunity, have become a sideshow in the
                  war on discrimination.

He specifically criticized their use as a monitoring device,

because this "allows an employer to hide continuing discrimina-
tion behind good numbers."151

           Judge Thomas's comments, although predicting a new

direction for the EEOC as a whole, could only reflect his own

views. In a subsequent interview, he acknowledged that the

        Commission's view on affirmative action for non-victims of
        discrimination was *evolv[ing],* but he insisted that the tenden-
        cy of the Commission was moving "very strongly away* from approv-
        ing affirmative action for persons not proven to be individual
        victims of discrimination."2

                          Despite the fact that the EEOC's position on the issue
        was far from settled, in late 1985 the EEOC's acting General
        Counsel Johnny J. Butler began orally instructing regional EEOC
        attorneys not to include goals and timetables in settlements sent
        to the Commission for approval because i t was his assessment that
        a three-member majority of the Commission would not approve the
        use of goals and timetables.133 Regardless of his e a r l i e r d i s -
        approval of OFCCP's changes in policy without bothering to go
        through the public procedures required for such changes,13'
        Judge Thomas agreed that Mr. Butler's action was taken pursuant
        to a s facto policy which had not been submitted to the full
        Commission:155

                                    "As a practical matter, there are at l e a s t three

                           Butler said, using the term interchangeably with goals

                          you shouldn't be bringing any more quota c a s e s . "

                                    EEOC Chairman Thomas said the da facto policy has
                          been in affect for about a year as the commission
                          considers proposed legal settlements.

                                    Thomas said he will put the new policy before the
                           full commission, but could not say when. "It is not a
                          burning issue with me," he said.

                          Meanwhile, in 1986 and 1987, the Supreme Court decided

        a string of cases which together demonstrated rather conclusively

        that race-conscious policies were -- in many circumstances --
        acceptable remedies for discrimination.13' Judge Thomas ex-

        pressed his personal disagreement with each of these decis-
        ions.137 Judge Thomas specifically expressed great disappoint-
        ment at the Court's decision in Johnson:15*

                           I thought that where the Court was going in its previ-
                          ous cases was to say that there needed to be a finding
                          of egregious discrimination before conscious remedies
                           in the form of quotas or goals were needed. In this
                          case, I think they went far beyond what I thought the
                          Court would do. This is basically throwing out any
                          kind of pretense that explicit race-conscious remedies
                          have to be predicated on a finding of discrimination.
                           It's just social engineering, and we ought to see it
                           for what it is. I don't think the ends justify the
                          means, and we're standing the principle of nondiscrimi-
                          nation on its head -- it's simple as that -- and we're
                           standing the legislative history of Title VII on its
                          head.

                          At his renomination hearing in 1986, Judge Thomas was

        pressed for his personal views on the use of goals and timeta-

                          With much of the legal basis for his arguments against
        goals and timetables undermined, Judge Thomas returned t o themes
        that he had emphasized in the early years of his tenure at EEOC,

        bad public policy. In a 1987 a r t i c l e in the Yale Law & Policy

        timetables.162 He argued that goals and timetables are ineffec-
        tive and possibly harmful for the following reasons: (1) they
        allow employers to hide behind a "good bottom l i n e , " (2) they
         fail to address the opportunity for upward mobility after hiring,

        victims of compensation in the form of back pay and tend to
        benefit the least needy in the minority community, (5) they do

        employers to shift the costs of the remedy from themselves to
        their inadequately-compensated victims and to other employees who
        bear the burden of reduced opportunities, and (7) they create

        found inherent in race-conscious remedies.1** Judge Thomas

        blamed the lack of appropriate c i v i l rights penalties for the
        widespread acceptance of race-conscious programs:1"

                          Today, the c i v i l rights laws often appear to be without
                          the teeth to ensure nondiscrimination. And, as a
                          result, social engineering i s substituted for a remedy
                          that f i t s the wrong.

        In Judge Thomas' view, a well-tailored remedy would penalize

        those who discriminate and would operate as a viable deterrent,
        ultimately removing the need for broad group-based remedies.1"

                          Judge Thomas said that Title VII's equitable remedies

        are not as "compelling* as the c i v i l remedies available under

        other statutes because they do not penalize employers who dis-
        criminate.167 Judge Thomas repeatedly lamented that:

                           [T]here is something less than equitable about a system
                           that subjects an individual to stronger sanctions for

                          c i v i l rights of another human being.1"
        Judge Thomas believed that the public does not perceive c i v i l
        rights statutes as providing effective remedies for discrimina-
        tion because they lack such penalty provisions. In a frequent
        comparison, Thomas states:

                          One significant difference between the antitrust laws
                          and the c i v i l rights laws i s the magnitude of public
                          acknowledgment that a violation will result in the
                          imposition of a meaningful remedy.169
        Lacking such penalties as the treble damages assessed against
        antitrust violators, the c i v i l rights laws, Judge Thomas says, do
        not 'command meaningful compliance*.170 For Judge Thomas, the
        obvious solution is to "change the law to permit greater penal-
        t i e s , " such as the compensatory and punitive damages then allowed
        under California law.171
                          In his Yale a r t i c l e , Judge Thomas identified other ways
        to penalize discriminating employers including: allowing courts
        to impose heavy fines and j a i l sentences against discriminators
        who defy injunctions; handing over control of a discriminating
        employer's personnel operations to a special master; and seeking

        specific recruitment and hiring practice changes.172 However,
        anyone defying an injunction is obviously already exposed to
        severe sanctions by way of civil or criminal contempt. In
        addition, a court enforcing Title VII has always had the power to
        appoint a Special Master to oversee the affairs of a particularly
        recalcitrant defendant; this actually occurred in the Sheet Metal
        Workers case.173 Specific recruitment and hiring practice chan-
        ges are already common features of litigated and consent decrees.

                          This leaves penal sanctions for discussion. Some
        criminal penalties for civil rights violations already exist.17'
        Some or all of Title VII could also be criminalized, although
        most blatant, intentional civil rights violations with identifi-
        able victims could probably be prosecuted under existing law. In
        that regard, some State Fair Employment Practice Laws include
        criminal sanctions, but these have not been seen as very effec-
        tive.

                          The bottom line with respect to Judge Thomas's alterna-
        tives for affirmative action is that they are not alternatives.
        They reach proven cases of intentional discrimination against
        identified victims, but much of what is considered to be discrim-
        ination today in this country under existing law cannot be proved
        under that standard or does not constitute that type of discrimi-

nation, including most disparate-impact employment situations.

Judge Thomas answers that such discrimination is, at

least, far less significant than it used to be. We believe he is

incorrect; there is current evidence which establishes that such
discrimination remains pervasive,173 and numerous decisions in

the 1980's and afterwards reflect its many occurrences.

If Judge Thomas is right -- if, for example, there are

few significant discriminatory practices resulting in victims who

cannot be identified  then there will be little further need

for affirmative action. When that happens, if it ever does,

Judge Thomas's concerns about affirmative action will be substan-

tially relieved.

There is much legitimate concern, and Judge Thomas

expresses such concern, over what are appropriate affirmative

action remedies in a particular case of proven discrimination, or

in the settlement of discrimination claims, or in legislation
providing for minority set-asides.176 The tailoring of equita-

ble relief in this area must truly be equitable, and that is an

enormously difficult task. Judge Thomas's answer is to do away

with the remedy entirely, and that strikes at the heart of

established civil rights jurisprudence long recognized by the

Congress, successive Administrations, and the courts.

                                    (o) His Policy Rationale for Disapproving
                                           Affirmative Action

                          In a 1987 profile of Judge Thomas in The Atlantic. Juan

        Williams related a story Judge Thomas had' told him years be-

        fore:1"

                          He was on the back porch, playing blackjack for pennies
                          with some other boys. As the game went on, one boy
                          kept winning. Thomas finally saw how: the cards were
                          marked. The game was stopped. There were angry words.
                          Cards were thrown. From all sides fast fists snatched
                          back lost money. There could be no equitable redistri-
                          bution of the pot. The strongest, fastest hands,
                           including those of the boy who had been cheating, got
                          most of the pile of pennies. Some of the boys didn't
                          get their money back. The cheater was threatened. The
                          boys who snatched pennies that they had not lost were
                           also threatened. But no one really wanted to fight --
                           they wanted to keep playing cards. So a different deck
                          was brought out and shuffled, and the game resumed with
                           a simple promise of no more cheating.

                                    That story, Thomas said, is a lot like the story
                           of race relations in America. Whites had an unfair
                           advantage. But in 1964, with the passage of the Civil
                           Rights Act, the government stopped the cheating. The
                           question now is, Should the government return the
                           ill-gotten gains to the losers "-- the blacks, the
                           Hispanics, and the women who were cheated by racism and
                           sexism? Does fairness mean reaching back into the
                           nation's past to undo the damage? . . .

                                    Thomas believes that government simply cannot make
                           amends, and therefore should not try. The best it can
                           do is to deal a clean deck and let the game resume,
                           enforcing the rules as they have now come to be under-
                           stood. "There is no governmental solution,* Thomas
                           said. "It hasn't been used on any group. And I will
                           ask those who proffer a governmental solution to show
                           me which group in the history of this country was
                           pulled up and put into the mainstream of the economy
                           with governmental programs. The Irish weren't. The
                           Jews weren't. Use what was used to get others into the
                           economy. Show us the precedent for all this experimen-
                           tation on our race."

                                    He returned to the ida of the cheater on the
                          porch: "I would be lying to you if I said that I didn't
                          want sonatinas to ba abla to chaat in favor of thosa of
                          us who wara chaatad. But you hava to ask yoursalf

                          which you can ovarlook anothar parson's rights?"

        Whan government does try to help, Judge Thomas believes, it fails

        to help those really in need. *[T]hose who are the best prepared

        are the beneficiaries of programs and policies which are, or
        should be, designed to help the least prepared.'171

                          Judge Thomas has also voiced great distaste for poli-

        cies that classify people into groups, even where this is neces-

        sary to address a pattern of discrimination. His conviction that

        this is inappropriate is so strongly felt that he is willing to

        abide by it even at the price of rendering the civil rights laws

        powerless to deal effectively with broad patterns of discrimina-
        tion.17'

                           If we permit taking race into account in classifying

        people. Judge Thomas argues, we undermine the only principled
        defense against racial discrimination.180

                                   The NAACP, the Urban League and other civil rights
                          organizations considered it a victory when we got the

                          Civil Rights Act of 1964, which pointedly said, don't
                          consider [race and national origin]. Civil Rights
                          organizations fought for the public not to consider
                           race when one goes for a job.

                                    . . . Once you start conceding that under certain
                           circumstances, one can consider race, you are setting a
                          precedent for the consideration of race in a lot of
                           other instances. If it is okay to consider that I am
                          black to get a job, why isn't okay to consider that I
                           am white to get the same job?
                          Judge Thomas's many public statements do not adequately
        address the difficulty of providing any meaningful remedy for
        patterns of discrimination if affirmative action is not allowed,
        and if it is not possible to determine which particular black,
        Hispanic, Asian or female candidates would have been selected in
        the absence of discrimination. The problem is a very real one,
        and it arises frequently. If there is no meaningful remedy, even
        an intentional discriminator would have succeeded m its primary
        goal: keeping its workforce lily-white, or Anglo, or male, or as
        much so as possible. Such an employer does not limit itself to
        keeping a particular black, Hispanic, Asian or woman out; it
        wants to keep as many as possible out. A remedy which does not
        deprive the employer of such a goal is ineffective.

                           It is not an adequate answer to reject the promotion of
        potential victims because the precise victims are unknowable. If
         such rejections were to become the law, minorities and women
        would be left without the hope of a meaningful change in their
        workplace and would have correspondingly little incentive to file
         charges and litigate cases.

                           There is a substantial question whether Judge Thomas

                                                               - 73 -

        would vote to overturn the affirmative-action decisions the Court
        handed down from Weber to Johnson and Paradise. and thus to leave
        minorities and women without any effective remedy for past
        discrimination in those cases where individual victims cannot be
        precisely identified.

                 P. Judge Thomas's Positions on Fullilove v. Klut2nick.
                       and on Set--Asides of Government Contracts for
                      Minority Contractors
                          Judge Thomas has denounced the Supreme Court's decision

        in Fullilove v. Klutznick.181 which approved Federal legislation
        requiring that at least 10% of the Federal grants from the public
        works projects being funded be set aside for minority business
        enterprises. The legislation was passed as a Congressional
        effort to halt years of exclusion of minority contractors from
        the business opportunities created by such public-works projects.
        Congress had included the provision in the Public Works Employ-
        ment Act of 1977 after receiving 'abundant evidence* that minori-
        ty businesses had been denied effective participation in public
        contracting opportunities "by procurement practices that perpetu-
        ated the effects of prior discrimination."182

                          While individual Justices in the majority disagreed
        about the standard to be used in reviewing race-conscious reme-
        dies, all agreed that the program satisfied whatever level of
        scrutiny they applied, as it was "equitable" and "reasonably

        necessary to the redress of identified discrimination. "liS
                          Judge Thomas denounced the Court's decision in Fulli-

        love for accepting the idea the Congress has .'virtually unlimited
        power.'1** In fact, each of the opinions of the Court stated an
        explicit and far from unlimited standard for review of congres-
        sional racial classifications.

                          Judge Thomas's criticism of the Court's decision in
        Fullilove is tame compared to his criticism of the Congress which
        enacted the provision at issue. Judge Thomas wrote:

                           Not that there is a great deal of principle in Congress
                           itself. What can one expect of a Congress that would
                          pass the ethnic set-aside law the Court upheld in
                           Fullilove v. Klutznick? What the two branches were
                           saying is this. . . . Congress can devise laws justify-
                           ing racial and ethnic set-asides on the basis of its
                           powers to regulate interstate commerce. Any "equal
                           protection" component of the Fifth Amendment due pro-
                           cess clause is irrelevant. . . .18i

        In fact, in enacting the remedial provision to assure minority
        business enterprises a portion of public works contracts, the
        Congress was relying on "an amalgam of its specifically delegated
        powers":186 specifically the spending power, whose reach, Chief
        Justice Burger said, is as broad as the Commerce Clause,187 and

                   135 Id at 396 In a 1988 speech, Judge Thomas appeared to express a
          general denunciation of Congress' role in the arena of civil rights. See April
          18, 1988 Tocqueville Forum Speech, supra note 4 0 , at 20 (Congress has "proven to
          be an enormous obstacle to the positive enforcement of civil rights laws that

            Conclusion

            Because Judga Thomas is a nominaa for a lifatima

position on tha highest court in the land, his stated views must

not only withstand rational scrutiny, but must demonstrate that

he has the ability to work within the framework of over two

hundred years of established Supreme Court precedent to address

the difficult issues that are sure to arise.

            Judge Thomas has criticized most of the judicial and

statutory building blocks for the protection of civil rights in

this country -- - not only admittedly controversial and difficult

court decisions and governmental policies, but also those widely

accepted as fundamental to the protection of civil rights for

every American. Judge Thomas has also attacked the Court and the

Congress for their role in laying down those building blocks,

arguing instead for a "limited government" that would leave

Americans with rights but uncertain remedies   or no remedies

at all      for violations of those rights.

            Moreover, Judge Thomas has presented a novel and

ill-considered constitutional theory as an alternative to the

jurisprudence of the Supreme Court since Brown v. Board of

Education. The potential consequences of this theory for Supreme

Court jurisprudence in a wide array of constitutional issues are

enormous. There is no sign in Judge Thomas's statements and

writings that he has thought through the implications of his

          theories.
                            Judge Thomas's abrupt and unexplained changes of

          position on the breadth of discrimination in this country, on the
          Griag-s rule, on the Uniform Guidelines for Employee Selection
          Procedures, on the use of statistical evidence in proving dis-
          crimination, on the remedies for discrimination in the common
          situation in which the form of the employer's discrimination has
          made it impossible to prove which particular minorities or women
          would have been selected in the absence of discrimination, and in
          the propriety of goals and timetables as devices for measuring an
          employer's compliance with the law, do not demonstrate the
          reflection before reaching important conclusions which is essen-
          tial in a Justice of the Supreme Court.

                     timony of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil

                     Rights Under Law and Related Documents in the

                     Record of the Confirmation Hearings of Judge

                     Clarence Thomas

Dear Senator Biden:

        On September 10, 1991, we transmitted to the Senate
Judiciary Committee, by letter to you, a statement in opposition
to the confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas as an Associate
Justice of the United States Supreme Court. We included with
that statement the names of individual members of the Board of
Trustees and others affiliated with local Lawyers' Committees who
endorsed the statement. We also included a concurring statement
and three statements of dissent. Moreover, we included a lengthy
Memorandum on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas,
discussing, in detail, the reasons that the Lawyers' Committee
opposed the confirmation of Judge Thomas.

        On September 17, 1991, Dean Erwin Griswold and myself
testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on behalf of the
the Lawyers' Committee. In light of the number of groups which
requested an opportunity to testify, we greatly appreciated being
given the occasion to appear before the Senate Judiciary
Committee. At the time of our testimony, we submitted written
copies of our testimony to members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and to the recording secretary who was present at the
Hearings.

                Although we have already submitted our written testimony and
       other related documents to all of the members of the Senate
       Judiciary Committee, we formally request that these documents be
        included in the record of the Hearings on the Confirmation of
       Judge Clarence Thomas. Furthermore, we would like to update the
        list of names appended to the statement in opposition to the
        confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas and the dissent. As is
       reflected on our updated list, ninety members of our Board of
       Trustees have signed the statement of opposition in their
        individual capacity and seventy-eight lawyers affiliated with
        local Lawyers1 Committee have joined in expressing their
        opposition. One additional member has joined the dissent, for a
       total of eight dissenters.

                To faciliate the inclusion of these documents in the record,
       we enclose three complete sets of the documents which the
       Lawyers' Committee requests be entered into the record of
       Confirmation Hearings of Judge Clarence Thomas. If possible, we
       would appreciate it if these documents are included in the record
       of the afternoon session of September 17, 1991, following or near
       the recordation of our testimony.

                Once again, we appreciate being given the opportunity to
       testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. We would also
        like to express our appreciation for the efforts made by all of
       the members of staff, including Mr. Jeff Peck, in facilitating
       our participation in this process.

                                                             William H. Brown

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Brown.
   Dean Griswold, welcome.

                   STATEMENT OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD

   Mr. GRISWOLD. Thank you, Senator. Obviously, I can only sum-
marize. It seems to me, however, that the present hearings have
left open several basic and important issues. No one questions that
Judge Thomas is a fine man and deserves much credit for his
achievements over the past 43 years. But that does not support the
conclusion that he has as yet demonstrated the distinction, the
depth of experience, the broad legal ability which the American
people have the right to expect from persons chosen for our highest
court.

  Compare his experience and demonstrated abilities with those of
Charles Evans Hughes or Harlan Fiske Stone, with Robert H. Jack-
son or the second John M. Harlan, with Thurgood Marshall or
Lewis H. Powell, for example. To say that Judge Thomas now has
such qualifications is obviously unwarranted.

  If he should continue to serve on the court of appeals for 8 or 10
years, he may well show such qualities, and I hope he does. But he
clearly has not done so yet.

  I have no doubt that there are a number of persons--white, Afri-
can-American, or Hispanic, male or female--who have demonstrat-
ed such distinction. I do not question that the President has the
right to take ideological factors into consideration, and it seems
equally clear to me that this committee and the Senate have a
similar right and power. But that is no reason for this committee
or the Senate approving a Presidential nominee who has not yet
demonstrated any clear intellectual or professional distinction.

  And the downside--and this worries me profoundly--is frighten-
ing. The nominee, if confirmed, may well serve for 40 years. That
would be until the year 2030. There does not seem to me to be any
justification for taking such an awesome risk.

  Judge Thomas' present lack of depth seems to me to be demon-
strated by his contact with the concept of natural law. He has
made several references to natural law in his speeches and writ-
ings, though it is quite impossible to find in these any consistent
understanding of that concept. This is very disturbing to me be-
cause loose use of the idea of natural law can serve as support for
almost any desired conclusion, thus making it fairly easy to brush
aside any enacted law on the authority of a higher law what
Holmes called a brooding omnipresence in the sky.

   That is bad enough, but the nominee has now said to this com-
mittee that he does not think that natural law plays any role in
constitutional decisions. And this is frightening, indeed, for it is
quite clear in the 200 years of this country under the Constitution
that natural law concepts do have an appropriate role, sometimes
in modern times called moral concepts, law and morals, not in su-
perseding the Constitution but in construing it.

   There are a number of excellent articles in this difficult field.
The great Princeton scholar, Corwin, wrote on the higher law back-
ground of American constitutional law. Professor Fuller wrote a
book on the morality of law. The philosopher, not a lawyer, Raul,
                                         234

wrote a book on a theory of justice. And, finally, I would refer to
Alexander Bickel's book on the morality of consent.

  As an example of what I have in mind, I might refer to the Dred
Scott case. It was one where the Court did not make adequate use
of natural justice. If it had done so, recognizing that Scott had
become a citizen when he was taken to free territory, it might have
averted the Civil War.

  A more current example is privacy. It is not mentioned in the
Constitution, but the Supreme Court has rightly found it there by
interpreting several of the Constitution's clauses together in the
light of deep-seated natural justice concepts, including the Court's
conclusion and understanding that this is implicit in the basic con-
cept of the Founding Fathers when they drafted the Constitution.

  We also find natural law, natural justice concepts in such areas
as cruel and unusual punishment, in rights of conscience where I
would refer to the case of Welsh v. United States involving a consci-
entious objector during the Vietnam war who expressly disclaimed
any religious basis for his objection. He simply said that it was
against his conscience and he would not serve, and the Supreme
Court held that that came within the proper construction of the
statutes which Congress had enacted for conscientious objection.

  Finally, I would turn to the whole area of process, including the
application of statutes enacted by Congress providing for affirma-
tive action. We have, for example, the one-man, one-vote cases
which have a large element of natural justice in them.

  We have cases going back more than a century rejecting discrim-
ination on the ground of race, Griswold v. Hopkins in 1886. We
have more recently the case of Moore v. City of East Cleveland, the
place where I was born, where the Court held that a city ordinance
forbidding families to live together unless they were parent and
child, and this had a grandparent and two grandchildren who were
not brothers and sisters, but were cousins, and the Court held that
the city ordinance was invalid, essentially on natural justice con-
cepts. We have Gideon v. Wainright, the appointment of counsel,
which has a large element of natural justice.

  Now, with respect to affirmative action, we have, of course, a ter-
rible history in this country. For more than 200 years, the white
settlers here grievously victimized persons of African descent,
whose descendants today are African-American citizens. Not only
were they held in slavery, but they were denied education and all
cultural advantages.

  It took a Civil War to ends this massively unjust regime. But
then we had the period of share croppers and lynching and Jim
Crow. Though the slaves were free, their opportunities were severe-
ly restricted by force of law. It was not until the middle of this cen-
tury that we began to move ahead, and under the leadership of
Lyndon B. Johnson, the Congress enacted a number of constructive
statutes designed to provide a greater equality of opportunity.

  We should not forget that the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments
were adopted as a result of the Civil War. They were essentially
focused on African-Americans. They were designed to pull Afri-
can-Americans up to a position of equality. Everyone was protected
by the due process clause, but the African-Americans needed it
                                         235

most. The same was true of the equal protection clause. As Justice
Blackmun has so well said in his opinion in the Bakke case:

  In order go get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no
other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differ-
ently. We cannot, we dare not, let the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial su-
premacy.

  Anyone who has lived through the past 50 years can see that we
have made some progress. When I was a young man in the Depart-
ment of Justice, now 60 years ago, it would have been inconceiv-
able that the President would nominate a black man to the Su-
preme Court, or that the Senate would give serious consideration
in such a case. There were then no black lawyers in the Depart-
ment of Justice, no black FBI agents.

  We have made progress, but not enough. I hate to think that the
progress we have made will come to a halt by a literalistic inter-
pretation of the Civil War amendments, thus frustrating the ac-
complishment of what they were clearly intended to do.

  In conclusion, I would only say that, having followed these hear-
ings through the newspapers, but very closely, it seems to me that
there are many significant issues as to which no information has
been given.

  What is the nominee's approach to other important questions
which frequently come before the Court, the whole area, for in-
stance, of separation of powers, of the allocation of function be-
tween the President and the Congress and the judiciary?

  What about the problems of preemption, which occupy perhaps
10 or 15 percent of the Court's cases, the question of when an act of
Congress can supersede a statute enacted by a State?

  Finally, I would refer to the area of intergovernmental immuni-
ties, relations between State and the Federal Government. I join
with Mr. Brown on behalf of the Lawyers Committee on Civil
Rights Under Law, of which I have been a member by invitation of
President Kennedy since 1963, in hoping that the Senate will not
confirm this nomination.

  Thank you.

                     NOTES FOR APPEARANCE OF ERWIN N. GRISWOLD
BEFORE THE COMMITEE ON THE JUDICIARY OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE

                               -- TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1991
        In the time available to me, I can only summarize. I will
first say, though, that the present hearings seem to me to leave
open several basic and important issues.

                                         I. Qualifications
         No one questions that Judge Thomas is a fine man, and
deserves much credit for his achievements over the past forty-
three years. But that does not support the conclusion that he
has as yet demonstrated the distinction -- the depth of
experience, the broad legal ability -- which the American people
have the right to expect from persons chosen for our highest
judicial tribunal. Compare his experience and demonstrated
abilities with Charles Evans Hughes or Harlan Fiske Stone, with
Robert H. Jackson or the second John H. Harlan, with Thurgood
Marshall and Lewis H. Powell, for example. To say that Judge
Thomas has such qualifications is obviously unwarranted. If he
should continue to serve on the court of appeals for eight or ten
                                  237

years, he may show such qualities, but he clearly has not done so
yet.

         I have no doubt that there are a number of persons, male or
female, African American or while or Hispanic, who have
demonstrated such distinction. I do not question that the
President has the right to take ideological factors into
consideration, and it seems equally clear to me that this
Committee and the Senate have a similar right and power. But
that is no reason for this Committee, or the Senate, approving a
presidential nominee who has not yet demonstrated any clear
 intellectual or professional distinction. And the down side is
frightening. The nominee, if confirmed, may well serve for forty
years. That is until the year 2030. There does not seem to me
 to be any justification for taking such an awesome risk.

                                            II. Natural Law
         Judge Thomas1 present lack of depth seems to me to be
 demonstrated by his contact with the concept of "natural law."
 He has made various references to "natural law" in his speeches
                                     238

and writing, though it is quite impossible to find in these any
consistent understanding of that concept. This is very
disturbing to me because loose use of the idea of natural law can
serve as support for almost any desired conclusion, thus making
it fairly easy to brush aside any enacted law on the authority of
a higher law -- what Holmes called a "brooding omnipresence in
the sky."

         That is bad enough, but the nominee has now said to this
Committee that he does not think that "natural law" plays any
role in constitutional decisions. This is frightening indeed --
for it is quite clear in the two hundred years of this country
under the Constitution that "natural law" or "higher law"
concepts do have an appropriate role -- not in superseding the
Constitution but in construing it.

        Affirmative Action
        For more than two hundred years, the white settlers in this
new country grievously victimized persons of African descent,
whose descendants today are our African American citizens. Not
only were they held in slavery, but they were denied education
and all cultural advantages.
         It took a Civil War to end this massively unjust regime.
But then we had the period of share croppers, and lynching, and
Jim Crow. Though the slaves were free, their opportunities were
severely restricted by force of law. It was not until the middle
of this century that we began to move ahead, and, under the
leadership of Lyndon B. Johnson, the Congress enacted a number of
constructive statutes designed to provide greater equality of
opportunity.
         We should not forget that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments were adopted as a result of the Civil War.
They were essentially focused on African Americans. They were
 designed to pull the African Americans up to a position of
                                  242

equality. Every one was protected by the Due Process Clause, but

the African Americans needed it most. The same was true of the

Equal Protection Clause. As Justice Blackmun has so well said in

this opinion in the Bakke case (Regents of the University of

California v. Bakke, 437 U.S. 265, 407 (1978):

                  In order to get beyond racism, we must first
                  take account of race. There is no other way.
                  And in order to treat some persons equally,
                  we must treat them differently. We cannot --
                  we dare not -- let the Equal Protection
                  Clause perpetrate racial supremacy.

         Frankfurter, J., in Railway Mail Association v. Corsi, 326
U.S. 88, 97 (1945)

                  A State may choose to put its authority behind one of
                  the cherished aims of American feeling by forbidding
                  indulgence in racial or religious prejudice to
                  another's hurt. To use the Fourteenth Amendment as a
                  sword against such State power would stultify that
                  amendment.
         Any one who has lived through the past fifty years can see
that we have made some progress. When I was a young man in the
Department of Justice, now sixty years ago, it would have been

                                                         7
                                     243

inconceivable that the President would nominate a black man to
the Supreme Court, or that the Senate would give serious
consideration in such a case. There were then no black lawyers
in the Department of Justice, no black F.B.I. Agents.

                 We have made progress, but not enough. I hate to think
that the progress we have made will come to a halt by a
literalistic interpretation of the Civil War Amendments, thus
frustrating the accomplishment of what they were clearly intended
to do.

                                        IV. Other Questions
         What is the nominee's approach to other important questions
which frequently come before the Court?
         Separation of Powers
         Preemption -- When dos a federal statute over-ride state
law?
         Intergovernmental immunities
                                        244

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Dean Griswold.
  It is not often, if my recollection serves me well, that you have
come before this committee to urge rejection of a nominee. As a
matter of fact, the last very controversial nominee we had, you
came to support that nominee, Judge Bork.
  Mr. GRISWOLD. NO, Senator, I did not appear
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU did not appear. I am mistaken.
  Mr. GRISWOLD [continuing]. On either side with respect to Judge
Bork.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I am glad you have refreshed my recollec-
tion correctly. I am sorry, I assumed that you had.
  The point I wish to get to--and I apologize for misrepresenting
your position, I thought you had--concerns the issue of qualifica-
tion. You measure and measured Judge Thomas against an array
of giants in the legal profession and on the Court.
  Let me ask you this question, if you would, because there has
been assertions made by some on and off this committee that Judge
Thomas is being held to a different standard, a higher standard,
than others who have recently come before this committee. How
would you rate, using the same test, comparing them to the giants
that you mentioned, the second Justice Harlan and others, Justice
Jackson, how would you rate Justice Souter, a person who had lim-
ited experience and practice, little governmental experience as a
counsel to a Governor from an extremely small State, only about
as small as mine, and had served only on the State court? How
would you rate him relative to the men that you mentioned?
  Mr. GRISWOLD. Senator, this is embarrassing. He was as former
student of mine, and if there were deficiencies, perhaps I share
some of the responsibility, but I would not have regarded him as a
distinguished nominee.
  The CHAIRMAN. The last question I will ask--and I do not say
this to embarrass you, Dean Griswold, I say this to genuinely elicit
information, because the charge has been made and will be made
again, and that is why the record should reflect this, that not only
you, but others who have raised questions--is whether you are lim-
iting your high standard for admission to the Court to just Judge
Thomas. Justice Kennedy, when he was before us, regardless of
how he is performing now, but when he appeared before us at the
time, Justice Kennedy did serve on the Federal bench for some
time longer, how did he rate?
  Mr. GRISWOLD. Well, he came much closer to it. He had an exten-
sive period in the practice and about 10 years on the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals, where he had a very sound and substantial
record in dealing with the difficult Federal-type questions which
come before the courts of appeals. I would have no hesitation in
saying that Judge Kennedy was qualified, although I agree that it
is hard to hold anyone up to the standard of Charles Evans Hughes
and the second Justice Harlan.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would point out--and I do not say this as a crit-
icism of the print media, which is the source of most of your infor-
mation--that there was, to put your mind at ease or raise your
concern, whichever, there was extensive questioning of Judge
Thomas on the matter of separation of powers, probably several
hours, at least I know an hour, I think, of more detailed question-
                                         245

ing. I will not characterize the extent of the answers, but there was
a genuine attempt to deal with that issue, and I would say it is
more likely he was forthcoming on that issue of separation of
powers than, I would suggest, he was on other issues. We did dis-
cuss with him, as a matter of fact--I may be mistaken, but I think
the Senator from Colorado, among others--discussed the principle
of federalism and preemption with the Judge, as well. Again, I do
not say that to be critical, but just to assure you that there is a
good deal of testimony and even a greater deal of questioning on
that subject.

  Let me ask you, Mr. Brown, if I may, one last question: How do
you deal with the Booker T. Washington-DuBois analogy that is
always made with regard to the rights of black Americans, Afro-
Americans? His views are constantly put in that context, that is,
he is committed to civil rights. There is a sort of litany about
Booker T. Washington and William DuBois that is brought out, I
think an historically accurate litany, that there has been a split for
over 200 years, on occasion, among and between black leaders, and
that at one point or another throughout the history of the struggle
of black Americans to reach equality in this Nation, there have
been different tactics offered, with the same fundamental commit-
ment, that is, to see to it that black Americans receive their fair
share of what people often refer to as the American birthright,
equality under the law.

  I do not know whether you heard the eloquent testimony of the
president of Lincoln University, which, as I understood her testimo-
ny, is basically that Judge Thomas may have a different view than
the prevailing view of the establishment of the black leadership
today, in particular the NAACP, and white civil rights leaders who
come from that genre of leaders, but that does not mean he is not
committed, and it does not mean blacks are any likely to be less
well off than they would be under the present regime of conceptual
approach to the Constitution? How do you respond to that?

  Mr. BROWN. First let me say, Senator, that the Lawyers Commit-
tee has only appeared here once to oppose a nominee to the Su-
preme Court. And we, like most groups, do not come to the conclu-
sion that we have arrived at lightly.

  I think that African-Americans, like all other groups, you will
find differences of opinion in terms of the approach and what is the
best way of getting to a reasonable and a valid objective. And we
are no different in that regard than anyone else.

  What we have looked at, though, is not so much the positions
that are taken by people who are not considered to be candidates
for the Supreme Court of the United States. I think we ought to
make that distinction right up front.

  What we are talking about here is an individual who, through
his writings, through his

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me just stop you there to make sure this is
well--at least is understood by me, and if it is understood by me,
then it is well taken here. That is, if DuBois were before this com-
mittee with his views, I assume in the general sense you would not
be particularly excited about confirming him. Is that correct?

  Mr. BROWN. Well, I don't know whether we would be excited
about confirming him to the Supreme Court, but clearly he would
                                         246

have a right to articulate those views, his own positions. His posi-
tions, I think, are shared by quite a number of people. There may
be a number of ways of achieving a certain objective.

  But when it comes to the question of looking at someone for the
Supreme Court of the United States, you, like ourselves, have a
limited amount of things to look at. You look at what he has done
before; you look at his prior record, obviously; you look at what he
has done in the Federal branches of Government; and you look at
what he has done since he has been a judge on the appellate court.

  It seems to me when you look at these particular areas, Judge
Thomas has not exhibited, in my opinion and in the opinion of the
90 members of the board of trustees of the Lawyers Committee, the
kind of concern that would justify the Senate committee approving
him to be on the Supreme Court. When we look at the different
positions he has taken--and I am not here to criticize anyone
changing their positions, because it seems to me all of us, given the
nature of the human being, can, and at appropriate times, make
changes in our own positions.

  But the changes which have come about on the part of Judge
Thomas have been fairly recent changes, and I think in that con-
text we have to look at what are the reasons for those changes. To
whom were those changes communicated? And don't we have a
reasonable expectation that in the event that someone does articu-
late what his positions are on these very critical issues, that those
positions will continue to be his positions at the point in time when
he goes on the bench. So

  The CHAIRMAN. I just want to make it--I am sorry. I didn't mean
to cut you off.

  Mr. BROWN. GO ahead.
  The CHAIRMAN. I just want to make it clear that the reason for
my questions to you as the spokesperson for the Lawyers Commit-
tee is that this is a Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights.
  Mr. BROWN. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. This is not a Lawyers Committee on all subjects,
although you are all completely competent to speak on a broad
range of subjects. I can't think of any that Dean Griswold was not
competent to speak on, and I expect you are in the same situation.
  But I want to make it clear the reason for the questions relate to
the essence of the view that you are attempting to communicate to
us from the Lawyers Committee, which is that an overwhelming
majority of the Lawyers Committee on Civil Rights believe that
Judge Thomas is not qualified to be on the Court. I assume it stems
from at least his view on civil rights, among other things. Is that
correct?
  Mr. BROWN. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
 .1 want to thank all of the witnesses on this panel for coming and
appearing here today and testifying. Dean, I am glad to see you
again.
  I have no questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Brown.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                         247

  Dean Griswold, the committee is honored that you would join us
today. I can't help but noting that you had presented arguments on
cases before the U.S. Supreme Court some 5 years before William
O. Douglas was nominated to that Court, if my mathematics is cor-
rect.

  I would be interested in your observations about Justice Douglas
and his young, relatively young age at being elevated on to the
Court. Obviously Judge Thomas is relatively young or quite young
compared to other judges when they have been nominated.

  Was the youth of Justice Douglas a major impediment to his
functioning on the Court? What was your observation about his
early service?

  Mr. GRISWOLD. Well, Senator, that is a long--a question that in-
volves reviewing a long period of time and is very complicated.

  Douglas was a man of great intellectual brilliance, which I don't
think the present nominee has shown so far. He had great energy,
great imagination, and his first 10, 15 years he was a great Justice.

  After that, he in my judgment went steadily downhill. He got
bored with the Court's work. He dashed it off. And the final 10
years, at least, of his membership on the Court was not, in my
view, distinguished. And I have heard the same reaction expressed
by other people.

  In the case of Douglas, you are starting out with a really great
mind. I don't see any signs of corresponding scholarly intellectual
ability in the present nominee. As I have said, if he had 8 or 10
years on the court of appeals he might show it. But to me it is
quite clear that he has not shown any qualifications comparable to
those of Justice Douglas at the time he was appointed.

  Senator BROWN. Mr. Brown, your committee has been kind
enough to come and share their views today with us. Was the deci-
sion of your committee a unanimous one?

  Mr. BROWN. NO, Senator. As I have indicated, we have 90 mem-
bers of the committee who support the position. There were 8 indi-
viduals who either filed their own position in dissent or had joined
with others. So there were 8 who did not ascribe to the position of
the 90 of those who did.

  We also had some 20 members who abstained for various rea-
sons, some of which would have presented conflicts of interest for
them.

  Senator BROWN. If you are comfortable, would you be willing to
summarize for us the comments or the concerns or those who dis-
sented?

  Mr. BROWN. I think, as best I recall the primary reasons for their
dissent, some felt that we should delay taking any position until
after the conclusion of the testimony of Judge Thomas. Some felt
that he did, in fact, possess the necessary qualifications to be con-
sidered and approved for service on the Supreme Court.

  Senator BROWN. Well, I am sure we all appreciate both of you
coming, and we appreciate your taking the time to counsel the
committee. Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. I have one question. Senator Kennedy wanted
very much to be back to ask this question of the panel, and he
asked if I would ask it on his behalf.

       56-271 O--93 9
                                        248

  That is, gentlemen, what do you anticipate the impact on the
past 25 years of progress on civil rights would be if Judge Thomas'
views, as you believe them to be, prevail on the Supreme Court?

  Mr. GRISWOLD. Judge Thomas alone is very important on that
question. But we already have on the Court a number of far more
conservative Justices than we have seen for many years. And the
real substance of the question is what would be the impact of the
last four appointments. I think in my view it will be disastrous. I
think it will stop in its tracks the slow but steady progress we have
been making.

  Let me just add, Senator, that I think my interest in civil rights
goes back to the time when I was in the fourth grade in the public
schools in East Cleveland, OH. And for the first time, I had in my
hand a copy of the Constitution. I was about 10 years old. And I
read it. And I raised with the teacher problems about voting in the
South.

  The teacher said to me--and I pointed to the 15th amendment.
The teacher said to me, well, that is a part of the Constitution that
is not enforced. And I remember that just burned me up at age 10.
Here is the Constitution. This is us. This is our Government. But
there is the part that isn't enforced. As I look back, I think that
then and there I decided I was going to try to do what I could to
try to see to it that the Constitution is enforced, including the 13th,
14th, and 15th amendments, and that we have real due process of
law and real equal protection of the laws.

  Nothing really much happened until the early 1950's, but since
then many things have happened. Many of the current generation
are not aware of how much things have improved, but they have
improved. But the task is by no means done, and I feel that that is
one of the important issues before this committee and the Senate
now, whether we shall erect another obstacle toward the eventual
achievement of true equal protection of the laws of all persons in
this country.

  Mr. BROWN. Senator, I can only add to that, if in fact Judge
Thomas' articulated positions on these issues had been followed,
many of the major advancements in the area of civil rights would
not have occurred. There is no doubt about that in my mind. I
guess the best example we can give is of the AT&T litigation which
we were involved in at the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission.

  If we had indeed had to prove individual cases, we would be even
today still trying to resolve many of those issues. We found that
some 7 percent of the individual charges pending before the Com-
mission involved some of the same issues. And we were able on an
across-the-board basis to eliminate discrimination and the systems
which have given rise to many discriminatory conducts. I think
that is critically important.

  I also think that if we were to follow Judge Thomas' current po-
sitions, if we look at his record at the Office of Civil Rights and at
the EEOC, the idea of not completely enforcing all the laws that
the agency which you are heading would have a devastating effect
on this country.

  I think that laws which are either flagrantly broken or laws
which are poorly enforced strike at the very heart of our society.
                                     249

And while we all agree there have been significant advancements,
I could not agree more with Dean Griswold that but for those ad-
vancements, through the Supreme Court in most cases, this coun-
try would not be the country that it is. And I think we would be a
long, long way away from what we consider to be the real objective,
and that is the attainment of civil rights for all groups, both mi-
norities and for women.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I thank you both very much. I know you
did not take this decision lightly, nor did the Lawyers Committee
take it lightly. I appreciate your concern and your willingness to
come forward. The committee thanks you, and I apologize that we
kept you all waiting so long.

  Mr. BROWN. That is quite all right. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thanks again.
  Our next witness is a very distinguished American: Dean Cala-
bresi, the current dean of Yale Law School, who has come to testi-
fy. He was going to be on a panel. Come forward, Dean. Welcome.
He was going to testify with the president of Lincoln University
whom we put on an earlier panel. So, Dean, the table is yours
alone.
  Thank you very, very much for taking the time to come. You
have come to testify on behalf of Judge Thomas and we are anx-
ious to hear what you have to say.

  STATEMENT OF GUIDO CALABRESI, DEAN, YALE LAW SCHOOL

  Mr. CALABRESI. Senator Biden, Senator Thurmond, over the
years, I have had the honor and pleasure of teaching various Mem-
bers of this body, ranging from former Senator Gary Hart, to Sena-
tor Joseph Lieberman, to Senator John C. Danforth.

  I did not teach Judge Clarence Thomas, but because some of his
closest friends in law school were students of mine and were people
to whom I was especially devoted, I came to know him well when
he was at Yale.

  He was at the time an admirable person who demonstrated a ca-
pacity for independent thought that is always unusual, but is espe-
cially so among students, for they tend all too frequently to con-
form to the current mood. His approach to law when he was a stu-
dent was not especially linked with the left or with the right. What
characterized him was that he could not be predicted, that he was
always seeking more information in order to decide what made
sense to him, and that whatever position he took was his own and
was powerfully and eloquently held. Because of this, I recommend-
ed him to Senator Danforth, who was looking for an able youngster
who could think for himself. I was glad I did so then, and I am glad
I did so now.

  Many of his views have changed, several times, since those days.
That does not surprise me. It is almost inevitable with people who
are truly struggling with ideas and wrestling with the great issues
of the day. I would expect that at least some of his views may
change again. I would be less than candid, if I did not tell you that
I sincerely hope so, for I disagree with many, perhaps most of the
public positions which Judge Thomas has taken in the past few
years.
                                         250

  But his history of struggle and his past openness to argument,
together with his capacity to make up his own mind, make him a
much more likely candidate for growth than others who have re-
cently been appointed to the Supreme Court and who, whatever
they may have said at their confirmation hearings, had in fact
been set in their ways and immovable back to their lack school
days.

  Such a capacity for growth, as a Justice develops his or her own
constitutional philosophy, is essential if a person is to become a
truly great Justice. None of the great Justices of the past, not Jus-
tice Black, nor Justices Harlan or Stewart, not Justice Holmes nor
Justices Brandeis or Cardozo, not even Justice Frankfurter, for all
his years of teaching constitutional law, came to the Court fully
formed.

  The Court itself, and the individual cases that came before them,
shaped them, even as they shaped the Court. In the end, it was as
combination of character, ability, willingness to work really hard,
and openness to new views that made them great Justices. These
qualities, if there truly is openness, matter far more than past posi-
tions. Many a Justice has changed his mind dramatically since
going on the Court. I hope and believe that Judge Thomas has
these qualities, and that is why I am here today.

  I would like to close with one anecdote about Judge Thomas as a
student. Judge Thomas had a fine law school record. But early on
he did get a poor grade, though clearly passing grade, from one of
the toughest teachers in the school. When that happens, most stu-
dents stay as far away from such a professor as they possibly can.
Not Judge Thomas. He not only went back to the same teacher for
another course, but chose to do his senior essay, his dissertation,
for that teacher, and this time he received an honors, the highest
grade given in the school. The quality this demonstrates has stood
Judge Thomas well in the past. It will stand him well in the future.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I want to note, Dean, that you are being
watched. Look to your right, and eagle-eye Danforth, your former
student, is over there. I just did not want
  Mr. CALABRESI. He was a good student.
  The CHAIRMAN. He is a good Senator, as well.
  I do not have any questions for you, because you have stated
your views very bluntly, and you have said it and you have
summed it up.
  Quite frankly, although some of us have not fully decided how
we are going to vote, we have to vote, as you well know, and I
think all of us share what I would only characterize as an aspira-
tion you have, and that is that his character and tenacity and will-
ingness to work hard, coupled with his basic sound intellect, will
overcome what seem to be some preposterous notions he has assert-
ed in the past. That is my words, not yours. I used the word "pre-
posterous. '
  Believe me, Dean, whether or not I vote for Judge Thomas, I
pray you are correct, because I, like you, disagree with a number of
his previously asserted positions. But I, like you, also believe that,
for a 43-year-old man, with his limited experience, not in life, not
in dealing with the problems of life, but limited experience in law,
                                     251

and it is limited, notwithstanding the fact he is on the Bench, the
notion that he would have a fully informed view of constitutional
law would be premature.

  I hope, at a minimum, that preparing for this process has in-
formed Judge Thomas as to what he does and does not know, and
also has done what it does for anyone who goes through the process
of having to represent one of the three branches of Government,
the President, a Member of Congress or the Court. We all have our
elections, if you will, and we hope that they are designed not only
for us to let our views be known to the people, but let the people's
views be known to us. I have never known a candidate who was not
more informed when the process was over than before he or she
ran. I have never known a President, and I have known five now,
who did not have a clearer notion of the needs of the country after
having campaigned in every nook and cranny of the country, than
before he campaigned.

  I am hopeful that that process works as well in this situation be-
cause this is the equivalent of a campaign for a Supreme Court
Justice, in my view, as it should be. I can see one of your former
graduates coming in. If you want to respond to that, I will yield.

  Mr. CALABRESI. I just want to say that this is an extraordinary
time in the history of the Court. It has been 24 years since a Demo-
cratic President has nominated a Justice to the Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. That has not been lost on some of us.
  Mr. CALABRESI. And that is as long a time, perhaps as there has
ever been in the history of this country, certainly since the Civil
War, from 1860 to 1884 was a period of equivalent time.
  At other times when there has been such an extended period of
time, the President has attempted to name people to the Court
whose views are very different from his own. Presidents Roosevelt
and Truman, for what seemed an eternity but was only 20 years,
named all the Justices and made a point of naming some Justices
who were very conservative and some from the other party. Justice
Reid and Justice Burn were Democrats and very conservative; Jus-
tice Burton was a Republican.
  The CHAIRMAN. I doubt whether we are ever going to see that
enlightenment in this administration.
  Mr. CALABRESI. This administration and the past administration
have not done so. Under these circumstances, they have continued
to name people whom they thought would share their views, and
that is their right in the first instance. But under those circum-
stances, I think that we have to hope that the people they have
named at least have the capacity for growth, which some of the
previous people who were nominated and who had, in my judg-
ment, a less distinguished--Dean Griswold was quite candid in
saying that some at least were with no more distinguished a record
than Judge Thomas--but those people did not have a capacity for
growth which Judge Thomas has.
  I hope that in the future the administration will be more open to
other views, but in the meantime, I think we are bound to hold
people to the standard you have held in the past, especially when
this is a nominee who has some capacity for growth which I did not
discern in some of the earlier ones.
                                     252

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I respect you very much, Dean, as thou-
sands and thousands of lawyers across the country do, and I mean
that sincerely. Of all the testimony that has been received, yours is
the most persuasive to me, in the sense that if I do not factor in
what you are talking about, I quite frankly find it hard to find a
sufficient rationale to support Judge Thomas, because, as has been
pointed out by you, other Presidents in similar periods have under-
stood the wisdom of having the third branch reflect a diversity of
view on the great issues of the day. I do not see that occurring and,
as you know, as a student of history, and the one thing I can say--
it sounds self-serving, but I have become a student of the history of
the Court

  Mr. CALABRESI. YOU have indeed.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. After having to do so many of these,
and have spent a great deal of time with your colleagues and pro-
fessors of the law and legal scholars. I know for certain that in all
those instances where the Presidents have attempted to remake
the Court in their own image, they are the instances and essential-
ly only the instances in which the U.S. Senate has said all right, if
that is the way you are playing the game, then we must play it the
same way.
  I yearn for the day, especially if I remain chairman of this com-
mittee, I yearn for the day when the President, Democrat or Re-
publican, picks a nominee simply based upon his or her overall in-
stinct about what the nominee's intellectual capacity is, and not on
what his or her views are.
  I trust President Bush. I believe he is an honest man. But I
doubt whether there is a single American out there who believes
that President Bush said:

  By the way, just go find me a nominee who has an open mind, just find me a
nominee who has integrity, just find me a nominee who is schooled in the law, I ask
no more.

  John Sununu would have had an apoplexy, if that were the call.
I just cannot fathom that having happened.

  Mr. CALABRESI. I cannot imagine that happened, either, Senator.
On the other hand, it would be ironical, if the test were the one
which you are now proposing, and that were applied for the first
time to someone who has more promise of growth, who at least has
experienced life in a way that the previous nominees had not, who
knows these things and who, insofar as he is showing these views
of the administration, is in that particular also at odds with many
of the friends that he made all through his growing up, that is,
that the person who is doing this has shown more independence,
although an independence in a direction that I do not share. So, it
would be quite ironical to find that person being turned down for
this, when the others just got through with all sorts of people, even
people who are opposing this one, clapping their hands.

  The CHAIRMAN. Although I have more time, I do not wish to take
more time now, but at some point after this is over, I would really
enjoy having an opportunity to sit down with you and discuss this,
not Judge Thomas, but this whole process. Because, as you know,
this is a cumulative process.

  Mr. CALABRESI. It is indeed.
                                         253

  The CHAIRMAN. If this were the first time a person was put on
the Bench, if he or she is the first idealogue of a Republican Presi-
dent leaning to the right, I think that is fine. I say fine, there
should be people on the Bench who share that view, even if it is
further right than I would agree to.

  The second one, I say it is less fine. When it gets to the point
where it looks like the attempt for the entire Court, all nine mem-
bers to be that, then the standard will and, I will argue, intellectu-
ally must change, must change, not will, but must. One is fine, two
is okay, three is okay. Four, five, six, seven, eight nine--it gets to
the point where you are talking about 40 years of Supreme Court
Justices, and that does make us all think. And I am sure, because
you are a man of great intellectual honesty and integrity, you are
sitting there saying I hope to God I am right about this guy.

  Mr. CALABRESI. Of course I am.
  The CHAIRMAN. We share the same concern. I wasn't being solic-
itous. Yours, to me, because of where I am on this nominee, is prob-
ably the most compelling testimony that I have heard in the
entire
  Mr. CALABRESI. It may come to the point, Senator, that it came
with President Hoover when, I am told, that Senator Borah went
to President Hoover and said, "There is one person whom this com-
mittee will confirm, and that is Benjamin Cardozo." It may come to
the point where the committee will have to take a leadership role
in suggesting names rather than simply listening if the administra-
tion does not do its part. But that is different from what one can do
when a name has been sent.
  The CHAIRMAN. I agree, and we may be approaching that point.
  I yield to my colleague from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Calabresi, I want to welcome you here. Wasn't there a Gov-
ernor of Ohio by the name of Celebrezze?
  Mr. CALABRESI. He spelled his name differently and was not re-
lated to me. His name was
  Senator THURMOND. He wasn't related to you?
  Mr. CALABRESI. NO. He arrived in the United States, or his
family did, long before I did. I arrived 52 years ago yesterday.
  Senator THURMOND. It is almost the same name, isn't it?
  Mr. CALABRESI. Almost the same name. Almost the same.
  Senator THURMOND. I think he was a Cabinet member down here
at one time, too.
  Mr. CALABRESI. He was a Cabinet member (HEW) in President
Johnson's administration.
  Senator THURMOND. He had two S's in his name?
  Mr. CALABRESI. He had several Z's in it, I think.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, how long have you been dean at the
law school?
  Mr. CALABRESI. This is my seventh year, and I am surprised to
have survived that long--Dean Griswold, of course, being dean at
Harvard, was able to survive much longer.
  Senator THURMOND. HOW long did you teach there before you
became dean?
  Mr. CALABRESI. I have been teaching at Yale Law School since
1959, Senator.
                                              254

   Senator THURMOND. 1959?

   Mr. CALABRESI. Yes, sir.

   Senator THURMOND. Did you teach my good friend from Missouri,
Senator Danforth?

   Mr. CALABRESI. I did, indeed. He was one of my best students.
   Senator THURMOND. Or was he in school with you?
  Mr. CALABRESI. NO, no. He was one of my students. [Laughter.]
   He is much younger. He tries to look older, and has for many
years, but he was in fact much younger.
  Senator THURMOND. HOW about the distinguished Senator from
Pennsylvania? Did you teach him?
  Mr. CALABRESI. NO, I did not. He is older. He looks younger.
Unlike Senator Danforth. [Laughter.]
  Senator THURMOND. He was in school with you, I guess.
  Mr. CALABRESI. NO. He could have taught me, but he graduated
before I went to law school.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, everybody knows those two gentlemen
have a high regard for Yale Law School. I have to say that.
  Now, we had a professor here from Yale earlier today. Did you
hear him testify?
  Mr. CALABRESI. Yes, I did. He was also my student.
  Senator THURMOND. He is a member of your faculty?

   Mr. CALABRESI. Yes, he is.

  Senator THURMOND. He testified against this nominee. Now, I am
glad to see the head man testify for Judge Thomas.

  Mr. CALABRESI. I think that most members of my faculty would
deny that a dean was the head man. They would allow that some-
body has to raise money for them, but they would not give me
much more primacy than that.

  Senator THURMOND. I am very pleased to see the dean, the top
man in the law school, come here and testify on behalf of Clarence
Thomas.

  Mr. CALABRESI. Well, I am delighted to do that.
  Senator THURMOND. I don't believe we have had any other dean
testifying against him.
  Mr. CALABRESI. YOU had Dean Griswold of the Harvard Law
School testify against him.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, he retired many years ago. [Laughter.]
  You are the only dean that has testified for Clarence Thomas, I
believe, and I want to congratulate you. A person of that stature's
opinion always carries great weight.
  I am just going to ask you two questions. Again, I appreciate
your appearing here today and taking the time and lending your
talent to this hearing.
  Is it your opinion--as I understand, you taught Clarence Thomas
in law school, did you?
  Mr. CALABRESI. I did not actually teach him, but I knew him well
at the law school.
  Senator THURMOND. I see. Well, from your knowledge of him--
and that is what really counts--your knowledge of him--is it your
opinion that Judge Thomas is highly qualified and possesses the
necessary integrity, professional competence, and judicial tempera-
ment to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court?
                                     255

  Mr. CALABRESI. Yes, I do. I believe that he has the integrity and
the knowledge and the ability to be a very good Justice of the Su-
preme Court. I think he is fully as qualified as the people who have
been appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court over many,
many years.

  Senator THURMOND. DO you know of any reason why Clarence
Thomas should not be made a member of the Supreme Court?

  Mr. CALABRESI. NO; I do not know any reason why he should not.
Incidentally, Senator, my colleague, Drew Days, who testified
against, when asked by this committee if Judge Thomas was quali-
fied to be on the Court, quite candidly gave the same answer I did,
that he was. But he testified against for other reasons. But in
terms of qualification, he agreed that he was qualified.

  Senator THURMOND. That is all the questions I have. I think your
answer covered everything.

  Mr. CALABRESI. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. I think your answers are clear, direct, to the
point, and you are for Clarence Thomas being on the Supreme
Court.
  Mr. CALABRESI. I am here testifying in favor of him.
  Senator THURMOND. That is all I have to say. Thank you very
much.
  Mr. CALABRESI. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  At the outset, I want to express regret that I was not here to
hear the testimony of Dean Griswold and William Brown, repre-
senting the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. But
we have a heavy schedule today with the Philadelphia Navy Yard,
which took a little precedence for the past 45 minutes. So I have to
absent myself, and I was especially sorry to miss the testimony of
Bill Brown, who was a deputy district attorney when I was in
office. I will peruse their report with care.
  Dean Calabresi, it has been a good week for the Yale Law School,
a good week and a couple of days, lots of good comments. When
Senator Thurmond commented about you were the only dean and
we found out there was one other dean, I think there was an alter-
native holding that Senator Thurmond might have used aside from
the fact that he was a retired dean. It was only the Harvard Law
School that he was dean of
  Senator THURMOND. Excuse me, what was that?
  Senator SPECTER. The other dean was only from Harvard, Strom.
This man is from Yale.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU think as little of Harvard, Strom, as he
does, I know. [Laughter.]
  Senator THURMOND. Who was the other dean?
  The CHAIRMAN. Dean Griswold, former Dean Griswold from Har-
vard.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, as the dean stated earlier, he is re-
tired. He is no longer active.
  The CHAIRMAN. The point the Senator was making was that even
if he weren't retired, it wouldn't count for much because he is from
Harvard. That was his point.
  Mr. CALABRESI. YOU have not heard me say that.
                                        256

  Senator THURMOND. Well, I imagine that the chairman is right.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Senator Thurmond.
  First, Dean Calabresi, I thank you for your letter to me of Sep-
tember 6, 1991 in response to my inquiry about Judge Thomas in
terms of the preferential program at Yale. I would ask, Mr. Chair-
man, that Dean Calabresi's letter be made a part of the record as if
read in full.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be.

                September 6, 1991

Tha Honorable Arlen Specter
United Statas Senate
Committee on tha Judiciary
Washington, DC 20510-6273

Via FAX: 202-224-1893.

Dear Arlen,

It haa taken ae more time than I would have hoped to get tha information
about affirmative action plans at Yale Law School at the tine Judge
Clarence Thomas vaa admitted. The reason for this is that I was not then
Dean and I did not wish to go merely on my recollection as a faculty
member. After talking to the then Dean, tha Associate Dean in charge of
Admissions at the time, etc., I think I can be pretty confident of what I
an writing you.

First, a bit of history. Affirmative action both in its sense of looking
widely and more deeply and in its sense of some possible preferential
treatment has deep roots at this Law School. In the 1880's Francis
Wayland, tha first Dean of the Yale Law School, wrote Samuel Clemens (Mark
Twain) to ask him for scholarahlp money specifically for a black student,
because the student was holding down two jobs while going to law school to
pay his way. Clemens sent the money and wrote that he would not have given
money to white students, but in view of the way blacks had been treated and
were still treated, it was an appropriate thing to do. (This Is apropos of
tha current debate about scholarships designated for particular groups.)
The student who received that scholarship went on to win one of the first
desegregation cases, a housing case, out of Maryland. And it was in his
office, I believe, that Thurgood Marshall first started practicing law.

By the time Clarence Thomas applied, the number and quality of black
applicants to the Yale Law School had increased greatly. In part for that
reason, a few years before his application, the faculty voted to create a
more formal structure than the casual "affirmative action" approach, that
had been in place earlier. The program that was put in was essentially a
"set aside" program. Up to 10X of the places in the entering class were
sec aside for members of minority groups. The members of these groups
would compete with each other for these places. A minimum standard was
also applied, and a rather Interesting one.
                                258

                                                     -i-

Before this program  u put into effect members of minority groups were
pretty much automatically accepted if it was thought that they could do the
work well. The increasing size, quality of the applicant pool, and
availability of places at other lav schools, which had earlier not been as
open to minority students as Yale, led to a different "minimum standard,"
Students would now be admitted only if it was believed that they were of
such ability as to make it a distinct advantage for them to come to Yale
Law School as against any other law school. In other words, while, before,
anyone who would do well here was likely to be admitted, even if he or she
might get as much or more from another school, at the time Judge Thomas was
admitted the standard was to accept only those of such quality that coming
to this School was a d e a r benefit.

As to Judge Thomas himself, I cannot say whether he would have been
admitted apart from this program. This is because admissions among people
of top ability are always highly subjective and so, unless I could speak to
those who actually read his files (some of whom are dead), I could not give
an answer to the question. Frankly, even if I could, I would not. It has
long been the policy of the Law School not to divulge information with
respect to admission of particular students. Our policy, I believe, is now
required as a matter of law by the Buckley Amendment.

Mot many years after this program was put in effect, it started to fall of
Its own weight. The quality and numbers of minority applicants continued
to increase at such a rate that a "set aside" program seemed unnecessary
and undesirable. By the time the Bakke case (which held similar programs
invalid) came along, our "set aside" program was well on its way to being
abandoned. Today all applicants are considered as part of one pool and I
believe that our minority students are the equal of, or superior to, the
whole student body in any other law school. Whether some faculty readers
give advantage to individual applicants because they are members of
minorities, is impossible to say. But the same is true as to any number of
other possible characteristics for admission. There is one large pool and
every member of the faculty reads files antt applies to them his or her
subjective Judgment. Each file Is read by three different faculty readers
and this, too, tends to mitigate the effect of any one reader's
enthusiasms.

I hope this is of help to you as you begin what undoubtedly will be a very
interesting set of hearings.

                                                                   Best always,

            Y_

  Senator SPECTER. Dean Calabresi, a good bit of our discussion has
focused on Clarence Thomas' background in a sense, as opposed to
Judge Thomas' writings. And some have said that the writings are
a much better indication of the man than his background in terms
of his roots and his previous position.

  In looking at the critical issue of human rights, civil rights, af-
firmative action, I would be interested in your evaluation of Judge
Thomas in comparing the writings which are much more restrict-
ed, constricted, than his background in terms of trying to make a
prediction, which is essentially our job on this committee. How
would you look at that?

  Mr. CALABRESI. I cannot make a certain prediction. I wish I
could. Predictions aren't of that order. All I can say is that I think
that Judge Thomas is a person with respect to whom there is a sig-
nificant chance--a significant chance--that were he on the Su-
preme Court of the United States he would be a powerful figure in
the defense of civil rights.

  That is more than is the case with most of the people who have
been nominated by the last two administrations. If I am faced with
a chance as against no chance, I will go for that chance. I cannot
say I am confident. I do not think that one can be that sure, and I
will be quite candid on that. On the other hand, I do think that
there is enough in his background and enough in his sensitivity
and enough in what he has said here to make me think that he
may well be a significant figure.

  Frankly, one can cut this another way. If I am wrong, he will
join a majority that is already such a strong majority that, though
it will make some difference, it will not make that much differ-
ence. But if I am right, it will make an enormous difference the
other way.

  Incidentally, I would cite one person, the Justice for whom I
worked, of whom many of the same things were said, Justice Black.
If one looked at certain things in his background, one would have
said--some of his speeches, some of his things, one would have said
he would not have been the kind of Justice that he was. If one
looked at other things in his background, the things he had to
struggle against, one would say that there was a chance. In that
case, the chance came through. Did it ever.

  Senator SPECTER. Dean Calabresi, on philosophical grounds, do
you agree with Judge Thomas on affirmative action?

  Mr. CALABRESI. NO, I don't. I think affirmative action is a very
complicated issue. It is not a simple kind of thing. I don't mean his
position is simple, but I sometimes think that the people who have
taken opposite views tend to make it more simple than it is.

  One of the key things for with respect to affirmative action is: Is
affirmative action really something that is benefiting a disadvan-
taged group where the bulk of the burdens are being borne by
people who have all the advantages? And then I am for it, and it is
in that respect that I disagree with Judge Thomas.

  On the other hand, it often is the case that what is described as
affirmative action is not those who have putting a burden on them-
selves for the benefit of the have-nots, which is admirable and
should be supported, but it is those who have putting a burden on
one group of have-nots in order to help another group of have-nots.
                                         260

And that is much more of a problem. I think many of the issues
which turn around affirmative action today turn on questions of
which of these two things it is.

  I think that Judge Thomas has been too sensitive to this second
part and thinks that it always is this way. I think that some of the
people on the other side have been too insensitive to the existence
of that.

  There has been discussion about affirmative action in a place
like Yale and affirmative action in the workplace. And in many
ways, the workplace is a more important place to have affirmative
action than a place like Yale. On the other hand, it should be said
that those who may lose because of affirmative action at Yale,
those who are not admitted to Yale because of affirmative action,
will end up going to Harvard. And that is not the end of the world.
While in the workplace, those who may lose may be people who are
also in need.

  All in all, I still come out in favor of it, but it is on that issue
that I think differences turn and why it is such an emotional issue,
and properly an emotional issue.

  Senator SPECTER. SO notwithstanding the fact that you have a
different philosophical approach to affirmative action than Judge
Thomas and in fact disagree with him, you conclude that his view
of affirmative action is within the realm of reasonableness and
does not rule him out as having a keen sense of civil rights?

  Mr. CALABRESI. If his views on affirmative action were not within
the realm of reasonableness, neither would that of a great many
people who currently are on the Supreme Court. His view is well
within the range of that of others who have been confirmed.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Dean Calabresi, I don't know that that
comparison necessarily holds up too well.

  Mr. CALABRESI. It worries me. It worries me. But, in fact, I think
that Judge Thomas' views are well within the range of reasonable-
ness.

  Senator SPECTER. He was characterized by one of the witnesses
this morning as being from the radical right. Would you disagree
with that characterization?

  Mr. CALABRESI. Yes, I would disagree with that characterization.
At least if one looks at the Court today, if one looks at the courts
today, even more than the Supreme Court, if one looks at people
who have been appointed in the last 24 years, Clarence Thomas is
not on the radical right.

  I might wish that he were as I might wish that the center were
some place else, but the center has moved a long way.

  Senator SPECTER. Dean Calabresi, other colleagues have joined
us, and we are trying to move along. So I will ask you just one
more question, and that is: The American Bar Association has
rated Judge Thomas only as qualified. Would you agree with that,
or would you give him a well-qualified rating for the U.S. Supreme
Court?

  Mr. CALABRESI. Senator Specter, I don't mean this to sound snide,
but my ratings, if I were doing it, would be far more severe than
those of the American Bar Association. If the American Bar Asso-
ciation rates, as they did, Justices Kennedy and Souter as well
                                        261

qualified or highly qualified, I would certainly rate Judge Thomas
as highly qualified.

  My own judgment would have been to rate neither of the past
two nor some who have been appointed before as highly qualified. I
would save highly qualified for very, very few people. But on the
basis of the ratings that they have exercised, he is as qualified as
the others, and if they are highly qualified, so is he.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dean Calabresi.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Dean, thank you--oh, I am sorry. Senator Grass-
ley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have no questions of this wit-
ness. I would like to ask, though, whether or not we are going to
finish all the panels that are on today's list.
  The CHAIRMAN. Come heaven or high water, we are going to do
it. That is why I didn't break for lunch. That is why I stayed in
this chair, and we are going to go right through votes, even if it
means I end up missing some votes. So we are going to keep going.
  Dean, thanks a million.
  Mr. CALABRESI. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. I really do appreciate your coming.
  Now, our next panel is a panel of very distinguished Americans:
Ms. Marcia Greenberger, an attorney at the National Women's
Law Center, who authored the report on Judge Thomas that argues
that Judge Thomas' record demonstrates a lack of support of
women's rights; Ms. Judy Lichtman, of the Women's Legal Defense
Fund, which wrote a report arguing that Judge Thomas' endorse-
ment of an article by Thomas Sowell threatens working women's
rights; and Prof. Patricia King, a professor at Georgetown Univer-
sity Law Center, who teaches family and poverty law. Professor
King believes Judge Thomas' record is, as I understand it, antithet-
ical to the interest of women and blacks.
  If I have misrepresented your positions in any way, please at the
very outset make it clear for the record that I did.
  With that, why don't we start in the order that I--or does the
panel have a desired way to begin?
  Ms. LICHTMAN. We do. If it pleases you, can we have Professor
King begin?
  The CHAIRMAN. Of course.
  Ms. LICHTMAN. Then we will proceed with Marcia Greenberger.
  The CHAIRMAN. Professor King, why don't we begin with you.

STATEMENTS OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF PATRICIA KING, PRO-
  FESSOR, GEORGETOWN LAW SCHOOL; MARCIA GREENBERGER,
  ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER; AND
  JUDITH LICHTMAN, ON BEHALF OF THE WOMEN'S LEGAL DE-
  FENSE FUND

  Ms. KING. Thank you very much. Chairman Biden and members
of the committee, as a black woman, it is exceedingly difficult for
me to oppose the nomination of a black individual who has known
great personal struggle. Nevertheless, Judge Thomas' extensive
record and personal posture is so antithetical to the interests of
                                             262

women and blacks--especially black women--that I feel an obliga-
tion to testify against his nomination.

   Much has been said of Judge Thomas' rise from Pin Point, GA,
to the Federal bench. And without question, the Supreme Court
should include people who have endured such struggles. But we
must recognize that that alone is not enough.

   I don't talk often publicly about my own background, but I think
it is necessary here to put Judge Thomas' life story--dramatic and
compelling as it is--into the context of life in black America. Judge
Thomas' background is not unique among African-Americans of
our generation. And virtually all of us over the age of 40 have at
least one exceptional grandparent who has been injured and se-
verely humiliated by racism in America.

  I grew up during segregation with my sister in a female-headed
household in a public housing project in Norfolk, VA. I attended
segregated schools through high school and never knew any white
contemporaries. I was able to apply to one college because we did
not have money for multiple applications. I was able to attend
Wheaton College in Norton, MA, because my uncle put a second
mortgage on a house he owned--the only piece of real property
owned by anyone in my family--in order to pay college bills.

  I am very reluctant to parade that family history in public, but
not because I am ashamed of my background. I am proud of my
mother's strength and tenacity and the love and determination she
employed in raising my sister and me. I am grateful to my uncle
for what he gave to me and to the other members of my family for
the encouragement they gave me. I am profoundly grateful to a
high school teacher who taught, inspired, and pushed me to
achieve. And I am proud of them all as strong black people who
battled through racism and material poverty to hold themselves in
dignity and to forge spiritually rich lives. I don't talk about it
simply because it has no impact on my capacity to function effec-
tively as an adult or professionally as a lawyer and legal educator.
Moreover, my story is not unique in the black community, and
frankly I don't want people's sympathy or their condescension.

  My background was not a predictor of my performance as a Gov-
ernment worker in the State, Justice, and Health, Education and
Welfare Departments, or during the time I worked at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. Some of that Government
service, by the way, was rendered the Nixon and Reagan adminis-
trations. Nor could that background have served as a predictor of
success in my 18-year career as a law professor at Georgetown Uni-
versity.

  Frankly, I don't think Judge Thomas' background is any more a
predictor of his future service on any bench than mine has been for
my career.

  Though there are similarities between Judge Thomas' back-
ground and my own, it seems to me that there is an attitudinal dif-
ference that separates us. I readily acknowledge that some of my
successes resulted from affirmative action--my admission to Har-
vard Law School, for example--and from the help and support I re-
ceived from others. In remembering where I came from, I also re-
member very bright young black people who were not as fortunate
as I. They did not have my mother and my aunts and my uncles.
                                             263

But if they have had a chance, they could have made some real
contributions to this society. But affirmative action came too late
for them; they had slipped away before it was firmly established in
the late 1960's when I went to law school. Somehow Judge Thomas
seems not to remember those he must have encountered along the
way who were lost to the darkness simply because there was no
help for them. I surely worry that that lack of memory and empa-
thy in someone of my race who is proposed as a Justice for the Su-
preme Court.

  Even his behavior toward his own family raises serious concerns.
While Judge Thomas gives his grandfather great credit for his suc-
cess, he has not been so generous to his sister, Emma Mae Martin.
In describing his rise from humble beginnings, he has frequently
criticized her need to turn to welfare for a period in her life,
saying: "She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare
check. That's how dependent she is." He has criticized her children
as well: "What's worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the
check, too. They have no motivation for doing better or getting out
of that situation."

  Judge Thomas' willingness to castigate his sister publicly for per-
sonal gain is deeply troubling not only for his opportunism but also
for what it reveals about his lack of compassion and understanding
about his own sister's struggle to overcome great obstacles. Similar-
ly, Judge Thomas' ability to extend compassion to others whose
cases may come before the Court is also in question since the situa-
tion faced by Emma Mae Martin is one shared by many other
black women.

  The story of the women in Judge Thomas' family demonstrates
an ethos of family support, resourcefulness, and interdependence--
not dependence. When husbands left the family or relatives fell ill,
it was the women who carried the burden for the family--at great
cost to any personal ambition. At the same time, though, their
story makes plain the limited range of opportunities and choices
available to black women, especially those who are single heads of
households. Judge Thomas, however personal and painful his expe-
riences were and are, because of racism, did not face the multiple
barriers of race and poverty when compounded by sex discrimina-
tion and family responsibility. Moreover, in his oft-repeated recita-
tion of his personal history, little space or respect is given to the
intense struggle of these women. Yet stories like these are at the
heart of the heroic rise of our people, and Judge Thomas' insensi-
tivity to that aspect of his personal and our communal life is
deeply troubling.

  Judge Thomas' record shows no understanding of the imperative
to provide opportunities and choices to black women. The notion of
choice, usually perceived as limited to issues of reproductive free-
dom, is really a much broader concern for black women. Black
women understand that no matter how hard they work and no
matter how well prepared they might be, workplace choices and op-
portunities for them may be limited. The work experiences of
Judge Thomas' mother and sister are not unique. African-Ameri-
can women historically have been represented in substantial pro-
portions in the work force. However, we have yet to reap the full
economic rewards of that participation. While it is true that many
                                         264

of us have improved our status as workers, many more remain in
low-wage jobs. Even when women hold equal amounts of education,
job training, and work experience, they are three times more likely
to earn low wages as white men. African-American women are four
times as likely to be low wage workers. The average family income
for black women is less than that of white women. The unemploy-
ment rate is higher for black women than for white women. Black
women--like Judge Thomas' sister--are more likely to hold several
low-wage part-time jobs with no health insurance or other benefits.

  As demonstrated by Judge Thomas' own experience, the status of
black women in the workplace contributes to their poverty and to
the poverty of their families. It also reflects the dearth of choices
available to them as black women--in particular black women
heading households in rural Georgia.

  Judge Thomas' positions on affirmative action, wage discrimina-
tion, class action litigation, and other proven remedies for discrimi-
nation may possibly become law and public policy that would fur-
ther limit the choices of black women in the workplace.

  Of equal concern to me is Judge Thomas' record on reproductive
freedom. That issue is all too often viewed through the narrow
prism of abortion and thought to be of interest only to white
women. That is not the case. The fundamental right to privacy, in-
cluding the right to abortion, is at the core of equality for all
women, including black women and other women of color. If
women cannot control their own bodies, it is difficult, if not impos-
sible, for them to fight for or enjoy the other rights to which they
are entitled.

  Black women interpret this right as the right to choose to have a
baby, as well as the right to choose not to. For black women, the
right to reproductive freedom also means access to information
about family planning and to safe and affordable health care, in-
cluding prenatal and postnatal care. No one needs a broad array of
reproductive choices more desperately than black women, poor
women, and women with children.

  Before he was nominated to the Court, Judge Thomas made
speeches, he wrote articles, and signed onto reports that criticized
or attacked constitutional protections of reproductive freedom that
have enhanced the power of black women over their lives. His post-
nomination retreat from his record, his refusal to discuss Roe to
any meaningful degree, and his claims that he has never thought
seriously about these issues provides us with scant comfort.

  A decision to overturn Roe will have drastic implications for our
lives and our health. Women who are captives of poverty or geogra-
phy, including many women of color, will be robbed of their choices
and again forced to risk their lives in back alleys.

  In conclusion, I want to repeat that this has been a most difficult
decision for me to make. Our role models are all too few, and Judge
Thomas' personal achievements are indeed impressive.

  However, we cannot afford to let those achievements blind us to
the reality of his record on issues of critical importance to black
women--including, but not limited to, his apparent lack of compas-
sion and understanding of the struggle of the black women in his
own life.
                                         265

  Our role models--and our Supreme Court Justices--should in-
clude not only those men and women who have demonstrated per-
sonal achievements, but also those men and women who have dem-
onstrated an understanding of what it takes to rise up and out of
oppressive circumstances.

  All of us who have made it have an obligation to help others, and
to recognize that others need our help. Judge Thomas has been
able to dream and to reach for his dreams. Yet, he has ignored the
need for or worked to deny that choice to others. He should not be
confirmed.

                                  Testimony of Patricia King
                                                 Professor

                             Georgetown University Law Center

         Chairman Biden and members of the Committee, I appreciate the
opportunity to testify before you on the nomination of Judge
Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court.

        As a black woman, it is difficult for me to oppose the
nomination of a black individual who has known great personal
struggle. Nevertheless, Judge Thomas's extensive record and
personal posture is so antithetical to the interests of women and
blacks -- especially black women -- that I feel an obligation to
testify against his nomination.

        Much has been said of Judge Thomas' rise from Pinpoint,
Georgia to the federal bench. Without question, the Supreme Court
should include people who have endured such struggles. But we must
recognize that that alone is not enough.

         I don't often talk publicly about my own background, but I
think it is necessary here to put Judge Thomas' life story
dramatic and compelling as it is -- into the context of life in
black America. Judge Thomas' background is not unique among
African Americans of our generation. And virtually all of us over
the age of forty have had at least one exceptional grandparent who
has been injured and severely humiliated by racism in America.

         I grew up during segregation with my sister in a female headed
household in a public housing project in Norfolk, Virginia. I
                                    267

attended segregated schools through high school and never knew any
white contemporaries. I was able to apply to only one college
because we did not have the money for multiple applications. I was
able to attend Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, because my
uncle put a second mortgage on a house he owned -- the only piece
of real property owned by anyone in my family -- in order to pay
college bills.

         I am reluctant to parade that family history in public, but
not because I am ashamed of my background. I am very proud of my
mother's strength and tenacity and the love and determination she
employed in raising my sister and me. I am grateful to my uncle
for what he did and to the other members of my family for the
encouragement they gave me. 1 am profoundly grateful to the high
school teacher who taught, inspired, and pushed me to achieve. And
I am proud of them all as strong black people who battled through
racism and material poverty to hold themselves in dignity and to
forge spiritually rich lives. I don't talk about it simply because
it has no impact on my capacity to function effectively as an adult
or professionally as a lawyer and a legal educator. Moreover, my
story is not unique in the black community and, frankly, I don't
want either people's sympathy or their condescension.

        My background was not a predictor of my performance as a
government worker in the State, Justice and Health, Education and
Welfare Departments or during the time I worked at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. Some of that government
service, by the way, was rendered during the Nixon and Reagan
                                    268

administrations. Nor could that background have served as a
predictor of success in my eighteen-year career as a law professor
at Georgetown University or in my service on a broad array of
government commissions and panels dealing with the most complicated
and delicate problems of medical and legal ethics that our country
has faced in the last decade and a half.

         And, frankly, I don't think Judge Thomas' background is any
more a predictor of his future service on any bench than mine has
been for my career.

         Though there are similarities between Judge Thomas' background
and my own, it seems to me that there is an attitudinal difference
that separates us. I readily acknowledge that some of my successes
resulted from affirmative action -- my admission to Harvard Law
School, for example -- and from the help and support I received
from others. In remembering where I came from, I also remember
very bright young black people who were not as fortunate as I.
They did not have my mother or my aunts and uncles, but if they had
had a chance, they could have made some real contributions to this
society. But affirmative action came too late for them; they had
slipped away before it was firmly established in the late 1960s
when I went to Jaw school. Somehow Judge Thomas seems not to
remember those he must have encountered along the way who were lost
to the darkness simply because there was no help for them. I
surely worry about that lack of memory and empathy in someone of my
race who is proposed as a Justice for the Supreme Court.

        Even his behavior towards his own family raises serious
                                    269

concerns. While Judge Thomas gives his grandfather great credit
for his success, he has not been so generous to his sister, Emma
Mae Martin. In describing his rise from humble beginnings, he has
frequently criticized her need to turn to welfare for a period in
her life, saying, for example: "She gets mad when the mailman is
late with her welfare check. That's how dependent she is." He has
criticized her children as well: "What's worse is that now her
kids feel entitled to the check, too. They have no motivation for
doing better or getting out of that situation."1

        Judge Thomas' willingness to castigate his sister publicly for
personal gain is deeply troubling not only for its opportunism, but
also for what it reveals about his lack of compassion and
understanding about his own sister's struggle to overcome great
obstacles. Similarly, Judge Thomas' ability to extend compassion
to others whose cases may come before the Court is also in question
since the situation faced by Emma Mae Martin is one shared by many
other black women.

        Judge Thomas' father abandoned his family when he and his
siblings were very young. As is the case in many female-headed
households, the family was poor. Judge Thomas' mother supported
her family by picking crabs at five cents a pound. When a fire
destroyed their home and their belongings, Mrs. Thomas could no
longer support her family on her salary (she moved from picking
crabs to cleaning houses), and sent the children to live with

        1 New York Times, "Thomas's Journey on Path of Self-Help, "July
7, 1991.
   270

relatives. While the boys lived with their grandfather, an
independent middle-class businessman, Judge Thomas' sister was sent
to live with her aunt. She graduated from high school, married,
and had children. When her husband left, she supported her
children by holding down two minimum wage jobs. Only when that
aunt suffered a stroke and needed care was Ms. Martin forced to
turn to welfare; like many women, Ms. Martin had no choice but to
quit her job in order to provide such care. She was on welfare for
four or five years before returning to the workforce; she is now
employed as a cook.2

         The story of the women in Judge Thomas' family demonstrates an
ethos of family support, resourcefulness and interdependence -- not
dependence. When husbands left the family or relatives fell ill,
it was the women who carried the burden for the family -- at great
cost to any personal ambition. At the same time, though, their
story makes plain the limited range of opportunities and choices
available to black women, especially those who are single heads of
households. Judge Thomas, however painful his personal experiences
were, and are, because of racism, did not face the multiple
barriers of race and poverty when compounded by sex discrimination
and family responsibility. Moreover, in his oft-repeated
recitation of his personal history, little space or respect is
given to the intense struggle of these women. Yet stories like
these are at the heart of the heroic rise of our people and Judge

Different Road", July 5, 1991, p. 4 col. 1.
                                    271

Thomas' insensitivity to that aspect of his personal and our
communal life is deeply troubling.

        Judge Thomas' record shows no understanding of the imperative
to provide opportunities and choices to black women. The notion
of "choice," usually perceived as limited to issues of reproductive
freedom, is really a much broader concern for black women:

        Choice is the essence of freedom. It's what we African-
        Americans have struggled for all these years... the right
        to select our own paths, to dream and reach for our
        dreams. The right to choose how we would or would not
         live our lives.3
         Black women understand that no matter how hard they work, and
no matter how well prepared they might be, workplace choices and
opportunities for them may be limited. The work experiences of
Judge Thomas' mother and sister are not unique. African-American
women historically have been represented in substantial proportions
in the labor force; however, we have yet to reap the full economic
rewards of that participation. While it is true that many of us
have improved our status as workers, many more remain in low wage
jobs.4 Even when women hold equal amounts of education, job
training, and work experience, they are three times more likely to

        * "We Remember", Statement of African-American Women for
Reproductive Freedom, (1989).

        4 For example, in 1989, 27.3 percent of employed black women
were in low-paying service occupations, as compared to 16.1 percent
of white women. M. Power, "Occupational Mobility of Black and
White Women Service Workers," (Presented at the Institute for
Women's Policy Research Second Annual Women's Policy Conference,
June 1990) (unpublished manuscript).

earn low wages as white men.9 African-American women are four
times as likely to be low wage workers.6 The average family income
for black women is less than that of white women.7 The
unemployment rate is higher for black women than for white women.*
Black women -- like Judge Thomas' sister -- are more likely to hold
several low-wage part-time jobs with no health insurance or other
benefits.

        As demonstrated by Judge Thomas' own experience, the status of
black women in the workplace contributes to their poverty and to
the poverty of their families. The number of black women who head
households is growing; to the extent that single parents fare badly
in the labor market, or are unemployed, their children suffer.
That Judge Thomas' mother and sister have worked as crab pickers,
cooks, and maids, as have thousands of other black women, is not an
accurate indication of their abilities, but rather a reflection of
the dearth of choices available to them as black women -- in
particular black women heading households in rural Georgia.

        Judge Thomas' positions on affirmative action, wage
discrimination, class action litigation, and other proven remedies
for discrimination may possibly become law and public policy that
would further limit the choices for black women in the workplace.
For example, Judge Thomas has repeatedly attacked well-established
Supreme Court case law on affirmative action -- even when developed
to remedy proven egregious discrimination and despite its
demonstrated effectiveness in expanding equal employment
opportunity. As head of the EEOC he deliberately chose not to seek
goals and timetables in settlement agreements and consent decrees,
changing course only in reluctant response to vigorous objections
from members of Congress. He drastically cut back enforcement of
the Equal Pay Act, the law that prohibits gender-based
differentials in jobs that are equal or substantially equal; and,
notwithstanding the EEOC's obligation to enforce the laws
prohibiting gender- and race-based wage discrimination, he adopted
a cramped analysis of Title VII's application to such
discrimination that left the claims of many women unremedied. And,
in spite of the proven effectiveness of class action litigation,
Judge Thomas criticized the EEOC's reliance on that strategy and
reduced the resources devoted to it -- causing a substantial
reduction in the number of class action cases filed by the agency.

        Of equal concern to me is Judge Thomas' record on reproductive
freedom. That issue is all too often viewed through the narrow
prism of abortion and thought to be of interest only to white
women. That is not the case. The fundamental right to privacy,
                                    274

including the right to abortion, is at the core of equality for all
women, including black women and other women of color.* If women
cannot control their own bodies, it is difficult -- if not
impossible -- for them to fight for or enjoy the other rights to
which they are entitled.

         Black women interpret this right as the right to choose to
have a baby, as well as the right to choose not to. For black
women, the right to reproductive freedom also means access to
information about family planning options and to safe and
affordable health care, including pre-natal and post-natal care.10
No one needs a broad array of reproductive choices more desperately
than black women, poor women, and women with children." When
women's reproductive freedom is curtailed, black women and other
women of color and their families suffer first and most deeply.

        Before he was nominated to the Court, Judge Thomas made
speeches, wrote articles, and signed on to reports that criticized
or attacked constitutional protections of reproductive freedom that
have enhanced the power of black women over their own lives. His
post-nomination retreat from his record, his refusal to discuss Roe

to any meaningful degree, and his claims that he has never thought
seriously about these issues provides us with scant comfort. A
decision to overturn Roe will have drastic implications for our
lives and our health. Women who are captives of poverty or
geography, including many women of color, would be robbed of their
choices and again forced to risk their lives in back alleys.

        In conclusion, I want to repeat that this has been a most
difficult decision for me to make. Our role models are all too
few, and Judge Thomas' personal achievements are indeed impressive.
However, we cannot afford to let those achievements blind us to the
reality of his record on issues of critical importance to black
women -- including, but not limited to, his apparent lack of
compassion and understanding of the struggle of the black women in
his life. Our role models -- and our Supreme Court justices --
should include not only those men and women who have demonstrated
personal achievements, but also those men and women who have
demonstrated an understanding of what it takes to rise up and out
of oppressive circumstances. All of us who have "made it" have an
obligation to help others, and to recognize that others need our
help. Judge Thomas has been able to dream and to reach for his
dreams; yet- he has ignored the need for or worked to deny that
choice to others. He should not be confirmed.

  The CHAIRMAN. Professor, you went well beyond the 10 minutes.
I did not cut you off, because, obviously, it was such a heartfelt
statement you were making.

  Ms. KING. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. It was as moving statement. I understand the
degree of difficulty, I think I understand--let me rephrase that, I
appreciate how difficult it is for you, a proud woman who probably
has been reluctant to talk about her past, not for lack of pride, but
for concern that others may react like maybe many people did,
black and white, with a sense of sympathy. And knowing of you
and your reputation, that is the last thing you want or need or
seek.
  But I appreciate your testimony, and I hope you all appreciate--I
know that your two colleagues, knowing this place as well as they
do, will fully appreciate what is about to happen, and that is there
is only about 2V2 minutes left for me to go and vote. If I miss the
vote, I assume, Professor, you will do what you would do for a stu-
dent in class and write a note for me, indicating that you were the
reason I was late.
  With that, we will recess. I am told that we are going to have
three votes back to back. We try to catch the very beginning of the
third vote and get back to start, so we will recess for approximately
15 to 17 minutes. We will, I say to the last panel, we will in fact
have the last panel, made up of Ms. Holyfield, Bryant, and Frazier,
we will hear their testimony today, but keep in mind we are going
to honor the fact that Yom Kippur is tomorrow and the observance
begins late this afternoon, so we are going to try very hard to
finish by 4.
  Again, I will recess for 15 minutes
  Senator SPECTER. Senator Biden.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry, Senator Specter, I yield the gavel to
you. I am going to go vote, and you can recess whenever you feel
appropriate.
  Senator SPECTER [presiding]. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair-
man.
  As Senator Biden noted, we are in the midst of a vote, so I have
gone over to vote and I have come back and had to leave just as
Professor King was testifying. I have tried to read your statements
on the subway, but have not got too far on reading the statements.
  I did get into Ms. Lichtman's statement and noted the concern
on the issue of women's rights and I believe on the abortion issue.
Let me ask a question of you women, generally, and that is, a cen-
tral core of concern has been raised by a number of Senators about
Judge Thomas not answering how he is going to rule on Roe v.
Wade. Judge Souter, now Justice Souter, refused to answer that
question, as well, and nine Senators voted against Judge Souter on
that basis.
  Do you think that--I am sorry, Ms. Lichtman and Ms. Green-
berger have not made statements yet, so you
  Ms. LICHTMAN. I thought you were significantly advantaged, as
no one else had had the opportunity to hear our statement, but we
are prepared to answer your questions, if you would prefer to go
on.
                                         277
  Senator SPECTER. I think that is a core question. Candidly, it is
not the core question for me, but I think it is for some Senators,
and there has been a contention--I have stated my view and it is
worth just a momentary summary.
  I think I have pressed hard on answers to questions, but I believe
that when it comes to an issue like Roe v. Wade or a specific case.
You have to have it in the context of a specific factual situation,
you have to have briefs, arguments, deliberation among the Jus-
tices and then a decision. There are a lot of permutations of the
way the issue can arise.
  But I would be interested to hear your views on that question.
Professor King.
  Ms. KING. AS I stated, Senator Specter, my opposition to Judge
Thomas has a number of sources, not just his lack I think of under-
standing about the reproductive needs of black women, but I do
indeed believe that the right of privacy, a right of privacy that in-
cludes a broad range of choice, is one of the bottom principles or
basic principles that I would look for in a Supreme Court Justice.
It is not the only one.
  I feel that way about the principles articulated in Brown v.
Board of Topeka, and I would be opposed to any nominee whose
record did not demonstrate an appreciation of the fundamental
nature of that principle for our jurisprudence.
  I am not suggesting that he needs to be examined on Roe v.
Wade as a specific case holding. I am, in fact, concerned about his
views about the right to privacy and reproduction.
  Senator SPECTER. SO, you would not disqualify him, Professor
King, solely on his failure to answer how he would rule on Roe v.
Wade?
  Ms. KING. Not on how he would rule on that specific case, but I
would disqualify him, if I were not satisfied about how he felt
about the right to privacy and reproductive choices, more general-
ly, yes.
  Senator SPECTER. SO, you would want an inquiry as to his philos-
ophy?
  Ms. KING. Yes, indeed, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, he testified fairly extensively about his
recognition of a right to privacy and a right to marital privacy and
a right to privacy for those who were not married. Do you think his
testimony went far enough in that respect?
  Ms. KING. Let me say, Senator, that by examining his record
before these hearings and listening as well as I could, with my
other responsibilities while the hearings were going on, yes, he
indeed made those statements, but I would say that he certainly
was not as clear as I would like him to be about exactly what right
to privacy he was affirming.
  Senator SPECTER. MS. Greenberger, how do you respond to those
issues?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. I think there are several bases for my con-
cerns with Judge Thomas' testimony here with respect to the right
to privacy in general, as well as covering the issue of abortion in
particular that go beyond the concerns with respect to Judge
Souter, which I had, as well.
                                         278

  First of all, in the case of Judge Thomas, he came to these hear-
ings with a record of having criticized the right to privacy, having
endorsed statements of others and reports, especially the Lehrman
article that has been discussed in some detail in a lavish way.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, anything besides the Lehrman article?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Yes, well, the White House Study Group,
which he endorsed and then said he had not read. There was his
citation to Roe v. Wadein an article that he had written with some
implicit criticism of it as a controversial case, his discussion of the
right to privacy as being an invented right in another forum, his
discussion in political context of abortion as an issue that was trou-
blesome. I think there are a number of specific statements that
were a part of his record before these hearings that were the cause
for concern, to begin with.
  His statements with respect to his record I think added to the
concern immeasurably. This is an issue, regardless of where one ul-
timately comes out, which is enormously important to every Amer-
ican, and certainly to every American woman and her life and
health. For him to have picked out the Lehrman article, regardless
of where he was located when he did so, and say that it was a
splendid article, a splendid example of the application of natural
law, had to have signaled, because it was such an extreme article,
taking a position, in essence, that abortion should be illegal across
the country, a gross insensitivity to the importance of the issue, if
one credits at full value his statement that he skimmed it at best
and barely read it.
  The fact that during these hearings, after so much had been
made of the article, he said that he had not even read it, really I
think was a devastating comment to those of us who looked for
something that we could come away with, a sense of reassurance
that he was approaching this with an open mind. He certainly said
he had an open mind, but when he discounted these extreme state-
ments and treated the issue in such a cavalier way, however he
were to come down on it, I think that in and of itself set off enor-
mous concern and worry and exacerbated what had been a very
troublesome record.
  Finally, I add the contrast between his answers in the area of
privacy, which were not very specific, which never did deal with
the explicit right to privacy for an individual who was not married
in any clear way, let alone moving up to some of the more specific
principles underlying Roe. When we contrast that failure to re-
spond to the very specific responses he gave to other issues that are
of burning importance that will come before the Court, where he
not only talked about the legal analysis, but the bottom line hold-
ings, I think that we see a very different and very extreme cause
for worry here that is even greater than it was in the case of Judge
Souter.
  Senator SPECTER. MS. Greenberger, let us examine that for just a
minute. He had the single line approving the Lehrman article and
he commented about that, that he was crediting Lehrman, because
he was in Lehrman Hall, and the Lehrman dealt in detail with the
abortion issue, but Judge Thomas' comment about Lehrman did
not deal with it at all.
                                         279

  Then in one of his speeches he had made a reference to Roe v.
Wade as being an issue that the conservatives sharply disagreed
with. Then you have his refusals to respond on the question on pri-
vacy beyond a short distance on agreeing that there was a right to
privacy, marital privacy, and then privacy for unmarried people.
Then you do have him answering some questions, which he may
have been ill-advised to answer, on the separation of church and
state, for example, the establishment clause, and I wondered--
nobody asked him whether he knew that case was on the docket
for next year, but I do not think anybody can be expected to know
everything about the docket. He answered to some extent on the
exercise clause, he answered the death penalty question, and that
is about it.

  Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, those are quite a number of burning
issues, no doubt.

  Senator SPECTER. All right.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. I would like to go back for 1 minute to some
of the
  Senator SPECTER. I would like to just review the record as to your
basis and just understand that those are the operative facts that
lead you to conclude that if he answered on the ones I articulated
and did not further on the abortion question, that leads you to your
concern and essentially to your opposition.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. I think, as I said, there were multiple bases. If
you look first at the Lehrman article and the fact that he said he
complimented it because he was in Lehrman Hall, the article is a
radical approach to banning abortion across the country. If one
wanted to be gracious and kind in making a speech in a hall
named after someone, there were many, many ways that he could
have complimented Mr. Lehrman. There were many things he
could have said that he admired about the article in a way that
was qualified.
  We saw that he was very skilled at qualifying his answers over
all these days. It was not a qualified statement, and the fact that
he called it a throw-away, to me, if we credit the fact that he
skimmed the article, it was as throw-away, it was, in essence, a
gratuitous compliment on an issue of such burning importance in
this country, an issue that is of such heartfelt importance to the
health and lives of women, I cannot credit that as an acceptable
response. That is my first basis.
  With respect to his saying that conservatives find Roe v. Wade
controversial, he called himself a conservative. He did not distance
himself in any way. That is, in fact, his trademark, that he is a
conservative. He did not say some conservatives may view it as
controversial and, as we all know, some conservatives might not.
He pulled himself in. These were implications, these were state-
ments, these were praise.
  The fact that he signed onto the White House Working Commit-
tee report on the family and did not read it, and to this point had
not in the hearing really gone through it--at best, for him, if we
credit all of those statements as true, show the kind of insensitivity
that Professor King talked about and is so concerned about.
  Senator SPECTER. MS. Lichtman.
  Ms. LICHTMAN. Senator, can I jump in for 1 second?

        56-271 0--93-
                                          280

   Senator SPECTER. By all means, it is your turn.
   Ms. LICHTMAN. I want to lay out with you for 1 minute the anal-
ogy that Professor King began a few minutes ago around Brown v.
Board of Education, because, indeed, I think your questions sug-
gest, to me at least, that you think perhaps we are being overly
rigid in what we are expecting.
  While I do not think anybody is asking, certainly we are not,
that someone come here and prejudge a particular fact situation
before it is presented in a courtroom, we are saying that there are
some fundamental principles about which a nominee must assure
us in its application, or that person is not worthy of confirmation.
  For instance, could a nominee in 1991 come before this commit-
tee and assert that they believed that States sanctioned separation
or apartheid if you will, it is constitutionally based? I doubt it. I
don't think that a nominee could be neutral on the application of
those constitutional principles and get confirmed either.
  I think there is wide agreement that there are some fundamen-
tal rights, and that is really the analogy here. What are the funda-
mental rights, the application of those constitutional principles
that Judge Thomas was unwilling to come forward and assert. And
I find that very troubling.
  If I take the Brown analogy further, he was quite willing, by the
way, to criticize Brown historically, but say he agreed in the hold-
ing. Now, he may have found that right in a clause of the 14th
amendment that you and I might not agree with, but he was will-
ing to say that there were constitutional principles

              STATEMENT OF MS. MARCIA GREENBERGER

  Ms. GREENBERGER. Thank you, Chairman Biden.
  The National Women's Law Center is opposed to the confirma-
tion of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. We do not
take this position lightly, and I know that is the case for many of
the witnesses who have indicated their opposition.
  We oppose Judge Thomas because of our grave concerns that,
based on his record, Judge Thomas does not have a commitment to
the core constitutional and statutory protections that form the
basis for women's legal rights in this country. Instead, Judge
Thomas has taken positions that conflict with women's rights
under the equal protection clause of the Constitution; the constitu-
tional right to privacy; and women's rights to education and em-
ployment secured by Federal law.
                                         281

  You did make reference to the report that the National Women's
Law Center prepared, and I will ask that that be made a part of
the record.

  We looked at his record in that report, and I can now say, unfor-
tunately, that Judge Thomas' testimony before this committee has
intensified rather than allayed our concerns.

  Judge Thomas has been nominated to fill a crucial seat on the
Supreme Court. Last term, five Justices announced their intention
to rethink cases decided by narrow margins over spirited dissents.
With the changing composition of the Court, cases upon which
women's legal rights really could now fit into the category of those
ripe for rethinking.

  In particular, we fear for women's protection under the equal
protection clause of the Constitution. The equal protection clause
has been interpreted to give special protection to women against
Government-sponsored discrimination. Key cases have given
women equal rights to parental support, to be executors of estates,
to Social Security benefits for their dependents, for their children,
for their spouses, to serve on juries, and to Government employ-
ment and education benefits. Until 20 years ago, when the stand-
ard changed for measuring sex discrimination under the equal pro-
tection clause, no challenge to Government-sponsored sex discrimi-
nation was ever successful.

  With Justice Marshall's retirement, there are only four members
of the Supreme Court who have accepted this heightened protec-
tion for women under the Constitution. Justice Rehnquist has con-
sistently opposed providing that protection to women, and the posi-
tions of Justices Scalia, Kennedy and Souter are unknown. There-
fore, Judge Thomas' views on this issue are of the utmost impor-
tance.

  Unfortunately, Judge Thomas' record of supporting, the applica-
tion of natural law as reflected in the Declaration of Independence
provides little, if any, protection for women. Judge Thomas' testi-
mony at this hearing calling into question how his past statements
of natural law apply to deciding cases under the Constitution pro-
vide little comfort to those looking for an understanding on his
part of the nature of sex discrimination or the way the heightened
scrutiny test has actually been used by the courts to eradicate sex
discrimination in this country.

  His statement, for example, made to Senator Kennedy, and I
quote: "I don't think that Professor Sowell or others are in any
way sexist or in any way people who would discriminate," demon-
strates this lack of understanding. Thomas Sowell has denied the
very existence of sex discrimination in employment based on
stereotypes of women's abilities and interests. Yet, the heightened
scrutiny test must be applied "free of fixed notions concerning the
roles and abilities of males and females," and the purpose cannot
reflect "archaic and stereotypical notions" about men and women.
Whether or not Thomas Sowell thinks he is sexist or means to
sanction discrimination, his rationales for women's lower pay and
limited job opportunities are precisely the rationales which have no
place in the true heightened scrutiny test.

  So, too, women's constitutional right to privacy, which includes
pregnancy and termination of pregnancy, is at risk. Four Justices
                                         282

have already applied a standard which, in effect, overturns Roe v.
Wade,and Justices Souter and O'Connor have each taken positions
that are cause for alarm.

  At stake is not only the continued vitality of Roe v. Wade, but
the degree to which States could restrict rights related to abortion,
contraception and other privacy rights. The actual contour and
scope of the right to privacy could well be determined by the
person who takes Justice Marshall's seat. Of great concern is that
Judge Thomas has praised legal theories taking the most extreme
position on the right to privacy and abortion--theories that could
not only overturn Roe v. Wade, but require States to criminalize
abortion.

  His statements at the hearing that he only skimmed, or never
even read extreme positions he praised or endorsed, are unavailing.
His willingness to discuss other controversial legal doctrines, while
refusing to discuss this most critical issue, only heighten the con-
cern. If Judge Thomas is unwilling to speak, the members of this
committee must recognize the ominous portent of his silence.

  Finally, we have seen the twin pillars of statutory rights central
to women--title VII prohibiting sex discrimination in employment
and title IX prohibiting sex discrimination in education--endan-
gered by increasingly restrictive Supreme Court interpretations.

  From May 1981 to May 1982, Clarence Thomas was head of the
Office for Civil Rights, the office that enforces title IX. For 8 years
he then served as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportuni-
ties Commission, which enforces title VII. During these years,
Judge Thomas ignored court orders, refused to enforce Supreme
Court decisions, and was criticized repeatedly by Congress because
of his poor enforcement record.

  The National Women's Law Center was counsel for the sex dis-
crimination plaintiffs in the WEAL and Adams cases, the cases in
which a Federal judge expressed his frustration and concern with
Clarence Thomas, as head of the Office for Civil Rights, for not
complying with the court order designed to get enforcement
moving again.

  We saw Judge Thomas limit the scope of title IX and the other
antidiscrimination laws--even to the point of being criticized by
Brad Reynolds, who was then Assistant Attorney General for Civil
Rights at the Justice Department. And we saw Judge Thomas cut
back seriously on the employment rights of women, minorities, and
the elderly at the EEOC. Again, Judge Thomas' attempts at the
hearing to minimize the significance of the court order against him
and to dismiss the devastating impact on people across the country
of the policies he adopted are unconvincing.

  Judge Thomas said that he enforced the law vigorously when in-
dividual victims of intentional discrimination were harmed. But his
record proves otherwise. For example, Judge Thomas tolerated em-
ployer policies intentionally barring women of child-bearing years
from jobs, and reduced EEOC efforts to protect women suffering in-
tentional pay discrimination.

  As Chairman of EEOC, Judge Thomas went so far as to criticize
one of EEOC's own major sex discrimination cases, the Sears case,
which sought to open higher paying jobs to women--to the point
where Sears, in defending the case, tried to call then Chairman
                                          283

Thomas as a witness on its behalf. The ABA Model Code of Profes-
sional Responsibility bars even a junior EEOC lawyer on the case
from making those kinds of public statements.

  Judge Thomas assured this committee that he would not justify
discrimination, nor he said, "would I shy away from it." But his is
a record of shying away from discrimination, of closing his eyes,
and turning his back on victims of discrimination who sought the
help of the Government agencies he ran, and of embracing and
praising individuals who would undo the major gains women have
won under the law in the last 20 years.

  Thank you.

   Judge Clarence Thomas: A Record Lacking in Support of Women's Rights

                                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

What is at stake
          The Supreme Court has shifted radically in recent years. In June, Chief Justice Rehnquist, in an

opinion joined by Justices O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, and Souter, announced the Court's intention to
rethink cases decided by narrow margins over "spirited dissents." The Court may be poised to reverse
decisions protecting women's rights, including:

  The constitutional right to equal protection of the laws, which ensures that any

government policy that discriminates based on sex must be substantially related to an important

governmental objective not based on stereotypes about gender roles. Only four Justices are

known to support this type of analysis, known as "heightened scrutiny," for sex-discrimination;

others may hold such laws to a weaker standard.

  The constitutional right to privacy, which includes marriage, contraception, pregnancy,

and abortion. At least four sitting Justices oppose constitutional protection for the right to

privacy.

         Broad interpretations of statutes barring sex discrimination, including Title IX,

relating to education, and Title VII, relating to employment. In recent years, increasingly

conservative majorities have narrowed these statutes, leaving increasing numbers of women who

experience discrimination without remedy.
                                    289

Because of the growing activism of the Court, the next Justice's views regarding each of these key
protections for women are critical.

Judge Thomas's views; Equal Protection
          Judge Thomas's articulated views and record are antithetical to the continued viability of the

heightened scrutiny standard of protection against sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment.

  Judge Thomas's view that the Constitution should be interpreted as the founders originally

intended freezes the Constitution at the time of its drafting - a time when women were second-

class citizens, could not vote, and were subjugated to their fathers and husbands.

  The original intent of the Founders, according to Judge Thomas, is to be found in the

Declaration of Independence, which in turn is based on "Natural Law" principles. Natural Law

principles found their most consistent application in a century of Equal Protection cases decided

before 1971. In these cases, "women's natural roles" as wife and mother were considered reason

enough to deny women important benefits and opportunities.

  Judge Thomas proposes to make the Privileges or Immunities Clause the "core of the

Fourteenth Amendment." This provision of the Constitution has never provided protection

against sex discrimination, is a discredited source of individual rights, and is inadequate as a

substitute for the Equal Protection Clause.
                   290

     In fact, Judge Thomas has made statements that indicate that he is skeptical that sex

discrimination in employment exists. Rather, he has stated that women choose lower-paying jobs

of their own accord. He has also praised the theories of Thomas Sowell, who writes that women

do not experience the type of discrimination that should be prohibited by law.

Judge Thomas's views: Privacy
          Judge Thomas's record indicates that he is hostile to the Ninth Amendment fundamental right to

privacy and that he would an interpret the Constitution to protect life, defined to begin at conception.

     Judge Thomas has described the Court's interpretation of the Constitution to include a

right to privacy through the Ninth Amendment as an "invention." He has specifically criticized

the analysis of both Griswold v. Connecticut, which upheld married couples' right to use birth

control, and Roe v. Wade, which protects women's right to abortion.

     The right to privacy criticized by Judge Thomas also protects the right to marry and

divorce, and to have children. If no right to privacy exists, a legislature may place onerous

restrictions on these intensely private matters.

     In fact, Judge Thomas has written that "allowing, restricting, o r . . . requiring abortions

are all matters for a legislature to decide." He sees no role for the Court in protecting women's

right to privacy.

     Judge Thomas's theories of Natural Law, however, do support a right to life for the

   fetus. In praising Lewis Lehrman's article that argues that the Constitution and the Declaration
                                  291

of Independence must be read together to guarantee a fetus's right to life, Judge Thomas indicated
that Lehrman's was "a splendid example applying natural law." The logical end of Lehrman's
and Judge Thomas's theory is that all abortions must be banned.

Judge Thomas's views; Discrimination in Education
          Judge Thomas's overall record as Assistant Secretary for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of

the Department of Education was characterized by a concerted effort to minimize enforcement of Title
IX and other anti-discrimination laws, even where intentional discrimination against individuals was
involved.

  Judge Thomas defied a federal court order designed to secure enforcement of Title IX

and other civil rights laws.

  During Judge Thomas's tenure, OCR sought to exclude most cases of employment

discrimination from the scope of Title IX. The Supreme Court eventually reversed the OCR

position, but in the meantime, complaints of employment discrimination in violation of Title IX

were not processed.

  Judge Thomas instituted policies that reduced remedies to victims of educational

discrimination, including those who had been intentionally denied benefits based on their sex.

During Judge Thomas's tenure, OCR implemented policies that called on educational institutions

to assess and monitor their own compliance with civil rights laws, at the expense of individual

victims of discrimination.
                                              292

     Judge Thomas's OCR challenged Title IX's protection against nonintentional, but

pervasive discrimination against girls and women. Although proof of an intent to discriminate

was not required by the courts in order to establish a violation of Title IX, OCR required such

a standard, particularly in athletics cases.

Judge Thomas's views: Employment Discrimination
          As chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Judge Thomas presided

over efforts to cut back on enforcement and limit the scope of anti-discrimination laws. These policies
limited relief even for individual victims of intentional discrimination.

     Judge Thomas's EEOC tolerated employer policies intentionally barring women of child-

bearing age from jobs. Under Judge Thomas, the EEOC took the position that these so-called

fetal protection policies would be permitted as long as they were implemented for a legitimate

business reason and failed to process complaints for several years. The Supreme Court

subsequently reversed the EEOC position, holding that these policies had to meet the higher

"bona fide occupational qualification" standard used for other types of sex-discrimination.

     Judge Thomas's EEOC reduced its efforts to protect women suffering intentional pay

discrimination. During his tenure, the EEOC cut back enforcement of Equal Pay Act cases, and

   refused to process or issue a policy for other types of pay discrimination cases.

     Judge Thomas's EEOC failed to enforce affirmative action approved by the Supreme

   Court as a remedy for intentional as well as nonintentional discrimination. He forcefully
                               293

criticized the Supreme Court's holding that voluntary affirmative action to remedy
underrepresentation of women was permissible under Title VII.

  Judge Thomas reduced EEOC's use of class aaion cases protecting many women from

intentional discrimination while doing little to help individual women's cases.

  Judge Thomas challenged Title VTI's protection against nonintentional, but pervasive

discrimination against women. Judge Thomas was openly critical of a case against Sears brought

by his agency because it relied on sutistics to show discrimination against women employees.

Conclusion
          When looked at as a whole, Judge Thomas's record shows no commitment to core constitutional

or statutory protections for women. In fact, his stated views and actions evidence opposition to key
protections. President Bush has said that Judge Thomas is the best "man" for the job. His record raises
concerns about the basis for that conclusion.
                                        294

                                                     INTRODUCTION

          The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution to contain two core principles upon which
women's access to the full panoply of rights and opportunities in this country rest. These principles are
first, that sex discrimination must be subjected to especially searching scrutiny under the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; and second, that there is a fundamental right to privacy, which
includes pregnancy and termination of pregnancy. Any nominee to the Supreme Court who does not fully
support these two core principles should not be confirmed to the Supreme Court. Further, an individual
nominated to the Supreme Court who has displayed hostility to the statutes designed to protect women
from sex discrimination lacks an essential commitment to equal justice and should not be confirmed.

          The next Justice's respect for core constitutional principles and existing precedents upholding both
constitutional and statutory rights is of even greater significance given the increasing activism of the
Court's conservative wing. Last term, Chief Justice Rehnquist made clear the Court's intention to review
existing precedents, particularly those decided or reaffirmed by narrow margins over "spirited dissents."'
Justice Marshall, in one of his last dissenting opinions, warned that the Court, due to the change in
 "personnel," had sent "a clear signal that scores of established constitutional liberties are now ripe for
reconsideration." Justice Marshall included a list of sixteen "endangered precedents," including

      1 See Payne v. Tennessee. 59 U.S.L.W. 4814, 4819 (1991). The Court in Payne upheld the use
 of victim impact evidence in capital cases, overturning two recent Supreme Court decisions that had
 barred such evidence. Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion contended that the Court is not bound
 by the doctrine of stare decisis when cases are unworkable or badly reasoned, particularly in
 constitutional cases where "correction through legislative action is practically impossible." Payne at
 4819, quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.. 285 U.S. 393, 407 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).

Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AC_O_G),2 which reaffirmed the
right to abortion recognized in Roe v. Wade.3

          The new Justice may indeed provide a fifth vote to overturn existing precedents of critical
importance to women. However, when viewed in the context of the Chief Justice's criteria for
overturning existing precedents, the seat vacated by Justice Marshall becomes of even greater importance.
Larger majorities embolden the Court to issue broader opinions, as the need to narrowly craft a decision
to pick up a needed swing vote is eliminated. In areas where the Court has already begun to undermine
rights guaranteed by previous Courts, the shift from a 5-4 to 6-3 or even 7-2 majority enables more
sweeping decisions of greater durability. There is little doubt that the core constitutional protections for
women are among those precedents threatened by the Court's ideological shift and increasing activism.

                                                        Equal Protection
           Until 1971, the Court had never applied the Equal Protection Clause to invalidate a law treating
men and women differently. In these earlier cases, the Court would accept any "rational" basis as reason
enough to uphold the discriminatory law, including one based on gender stereotypes. Since 1971,
however, the Supreme Court has applied more searching or "heightened" scrutiny to government policies
 that discriminate based on sex. Under the heightened scrutiny standard, a state must demonstrate that
 an important governmental interest is substantially served by the discriminatory practice. Further, the
 test must be applied free of fixed or stereotyped notions concerning the roles of males and females.4
 Using heightened scrutiny, the Supreme Court has struck down a wide variety of laws disadvantaging
 women in many diverse areas of life, including women's right to serve as executors of estates,3 secure

Social Security and other government benefits for their families,* be supported by their parents to the
same age as their brothers,7 and manage jointly owned community property with their husbands.*

         Since the last gender-based equal protection challenge was heard by the Court in 1982,* the
composition of the Court has changed radically. Only four of the current Justices have used heightened
scrutiny to review a sex-discriminatory law. One - Chief Justice Rehnquist - has consistently rejected
application of the heightened scrutiny standard to gender discrimination.10 Judge Thomas, if confirmed,
may well provide the fifth vote to return the Court to the days when any reason - even one based on
gender stereotypes -- was justification enough for government-mandated sex discrimination.

                                                      Privacy
         As Justice Marshall pointed out in his dissent in Payne, the right to privacy as it protects
productive freedoms, is similarly endangered by the Court's recent realignment. Because the right to
privacy is "fundamental," the Constitution requires that government demonstrate a "compelling" state
interest in order to justify its restriction." The landmark decision in Roe v. Wade, extended the right

century-old line of cases, including Griswold v. Connecticut, which held that the privacy right includes
the right of married couples to use contraception.13

          In recent years, however, women's right to privacy has been seriously undermined, with the
Court upholding state and federal laws that severely limit women's access to abortion. Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services.14 called into question whether a majority of the Supreme Court will
interpret the fundamental right to privacy to apply to abortion, certain forms of contraception, and by this
questioning, to pregnancy itself. In Webster, a 5-4 majority upheld a Missouri law declaring that life
begins at conception and placing onerous restrictions on abortion, including a prohibition on the use of
public facilities to perform abortions. Last term, again by a 5-4 majority, the Court relied on Webster
to hold in Rust v. Sullivan that family planning program regulations prohibiting health care personnel in
federally funded clinics from providing any information about abortion-related services did not violate
women's right to abortion or doctors' right to freedom of speech.13 Webster put four Justices -
Rehnquist, White, Kennedy, and Scalia - on record as no longer applying strict scrutiny when the
privacy right to contraception and abortion is implicated. In providing the fifth vote in Rust. Justice
 Souter aligned himself with the conservative attempt to render the privacy "right unenforceable, even
 against flagrant attempts by government to circumvent it."16 The right to privacy, including abortion,
 now hangs by a fraying thread - Justice Souter or Justice O'Connor, or the new Justice may provide the
 fifth vote to end constitutional protection for reproductive rights.

                                                Statutory Rights
        The twin pillars of statutory rights central to women are Title VII, prohibiting discrimination in
employment, and Title IX, prohibiting discrimination in education. Each of these statutes contains broad-
based protections, the contours of which have been interpreted by landmark Supreme Court cases over
the years. For example, in the area of education, the Court has interpreted Title IX, to bar schools'
employment discrimination on the basis of gender,17 and to allow for a private right of action so that
individuals who experience discrimination covered by the statute may seek redress through the courts."
In the area of employment, the Court has held that the Title VII prohibitions on sex discrimination
encompass sexual harassment,19 and policies that discriminate against women based on their parental
status3* and child-bearing capacities.21 As the statutes were silent in each of these important areas, the
Court's broad reading of prohibited discrimination has made a significant difference to millions of women
in education institutions and in the workplace.
         In recent years, several key decisions have restricted the reach of Title VII, making it harder for
women and others who experience employment discrimination to prevail. For example, Ward's Cove
Packing Co. v. Antonio made it more difficult to win "disparate impact" discrimination cases in which
an apparently neutral employment practice, such as a height or weight restriction, actually discriminates
 against women or minorities.22 In Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, the Court held that if an employer
 makes a hiring, firing or promotion decision based on both discriminatory and nondiscriminatory factors,

the employer will not be guilty of violating Title VII if he or she can show the same decision would have
been made in the absence of in intentional discrimination.23 Last term, in EEOC v. Arabian American
Oil Co.. the Court held that Title VII does not apply to United States employers who employ United
States citizens at locations outside the United States.24

         Next term, the Court will review at least one major issue with respect to Title IX: whether or
not individuals may recover compensatory damages for intentional discrimination under Title IX. In
September, the Eleventh Circuit determined in Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public that they may not;13
the Third Circuit in Pfeiffer v. Marion Center Area School District held a month later that such damages
are available in the case of intentional sex discrimination.26 The Court has granted certiorari in the
Franklin case;27 its decision will determine whether women who experience sex discrimination in
education will be able to receive compensation for their injuries.

         As the Court moves to the right, those who would seek to restrict the scope of and remedies
available under Title IX, Title VII, and other anti-discrimination laws have new opportunities to see
earlier decisions overruled or limiting new precedent established. At the same time, victims of
discrimination are having a harder time using the federal courts to redress their injuries. Given the
growing power of those on the Court who would restrict anti-discrimination laws, it is clear that the rights
of millions of Americans who experience education or employment discrimination, as well as other forms
of bias, may be in grave jeopardy if the new Supreme Court Justice takes a narrow view of statutory civil
 rights protections.

                                                  Judge Thomas's Record
          Clearly women have much at stake in the areas of Equal Protection, privacy, and anti-
discrimination laws. Judge Thomas's record therefore must be examined to measure his commitment to
critical constitutional and statutory rights.

                                         Judge Thomas and Equal Protection
          Judge Thomas's writings on "Natural Law" give cause for grave concern about his commitment
to a 14th Amendment that provides real protection to women. According to Judge Thomas, the
Constitution should be interpreted by examining the Declaration of Independence to discern the "original
intent" of the Framers. His theory sets him far outside the mainstream of legal thinking in two ways that
do not bode well for women. First, despite two centuries of social change, Judge Thomas's reliance on
the original intent of the Framers freezes the meaning of the Constitution and its amendments at the time
of their drafting. Since neither the Framers nor the drafters of the 14th Amendment were concerned with
sex discrimination, a theory of original intent could well read women out of the Equal Protection
Clause.2* Second, and even more extreme, Judge Thomas's view that original intent flows from the
Declaration of Independence grounds his constitutional theory in the "laws of nature and nature's God."
To him, these "laws set forth immutable principles that existed well before the drafting of the Constitution
and will remain ever thus. Under such "laws of nature," women's "God-given" biological differences,
 rather than their abilities, could become the test for determining the scope of their constitutional
protection. Not surprisingly, these Natural Law principles found a consistent application in the century
 of 14th Amendment decisions upholding blatant sex discrimination prior to 1971 .M It is therefore deeply
 disturbing that Judge Thomas's theory of constitutional interpretation may return women to the days when
 childbearing was reason enough to deny women the benefits and opportunities associated with public life.

                                          Judge Thomas and Privacy
         Natural law poses a similar threat to the fundamental right to privacy. Because it was not
explicitly articulated by the Framers, under Judge Thomas's theory no right to privacy would exist.
He has referred to the right to privacy under the Ninth Amendment as an "invention," and sharply
criticized the decisions, including Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade, that apply this right.30
Of equal concern is the potential that Judge Thomas's theory of natural law would offer constitutional
protection for a right to life for the fetus. This theory is spelled out in a 1987 American Spectator
article by Lewis Lehrman which Judge Thomas has praised as "a splendid example of applying
natural law."" Describing Roe v. Wade as a "coup" and resulting legal abortions as a "holocaust,"
Lehrman's anicle contends that the Declaration of Independence's statement that all men are endowed
with the inalienable right to life and liberty signals the Founding Fathers' intent that 1) the fetus retain
an inalienable right to be born; and 2) that the fetus's right is superior to any right to liberty retained
by a pregnant woman.32 Such a theory would not only require the reversal of Roe v. Wade, but
could require that all states criminalize abortion. Further, it could support prosecuting women who
have abortions -- and the doctors who perform them - under criminal laws. Given Judge Thomas's
favorable commentary about Lehrman's article, we must be seriously concerned for the future of
reproductive freedom.

                                         Judge Thomas and Statutory Rights
          Judge Thomas's record as an executive branch official charged with enforcing key statutes
barring discrimination in education and employment raise similar concerns. As Assistant Secretary
for Civil Rights in the Department of Education and Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, Judge Thomas presided over efforts to cut back enforcement of and narrow the scope of
civil rights laws.33 He made numerous statements indicative of a personal philosophy unsupportive
of broad protections against sex discrimination, and pursued policies consistent with that philosophy.
He defied Congress, the federal courts, and even the Justice Department on occasion, in pursuing
policies inconsistent with the law. Whether the discrimination at issue was raised through a class-
action or individual suit, and whether the case involved a disparate impact or intentional
discrimination claim, Clarence Thomas too often proved to be no friend to plaintiffs seeking to
redress their statutory rights.

                                                           Conclusion
           Given the current Court's activist position regarding reversal of longstanding precedent, and
the narrow margins by which core constitutional protections for women are now supported on the
 Court, Judge Thomas's views regarding constitutional interpretation raise deep concerns about the
 continued viability of these protections. In the case of equal protection, he has articulated legal
 theories and approaches in his writings that are antidietical to the application of the heightened
 scrutiny test to sex discrimination as we know it today. Similarly, Judge Thomas has criticized the
 key decisions upholding the right to privacy as applied to abortion and articulated legal theories and
 approaches which not only deny that such a right exists, but support a right to life for the fetus.
 Furthermore, Judge Thomas's record of limiting the scope and enforcement of civil rights laws

                                                                   15

suggests that he will join the conservative wing of the Court in narrowing statutory protections for
women and others against discrimination.

          This report elaborates on Judge Thomas's record in each of these key areas affecting women's
rights: equal protection; privacy; and statutory protections against sex discrimination in education and
employment. Clearly other aspects of Judge Thomas's experience also raise important concerns,
including his legal qualifications, hostility to Congress, and lack of support for the rights of
minorities, older Americans, and the disabled. This report is intended to add to the picture of Judge
Thomas's record an analysis of his work and theories in distinct areas most critical to women. The
portrait that emerges is one that has profound consequences for the future of legal rights and
protections in this nation.

I.  JUDGE THOMAS'S VIEWS REGARDING CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION

    ARE INCONSISTENT WITH PROTECTIONS FOR WOMEN UNDER THE

    FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.

    Judge Clarence Thomas's articulated views and record are antithetical to critically important

constitutional protections women have gained over the past twenty yean. Judge Thomas's original

intent theory, which he grounds in "Natural Law" principles, could undermine the governing Supreme

Court precedent that women have heightened protection under the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment.34 Furthermore, he threatens to dispense with equal protection analysis

altogether by relying on the now disfavored Privileges or Immunities Clause, which has never

afforded any protection to women, as the preferable constitutional source of equality analysis."

    A. With the Current Composition of the Court. Women are in Danger of Losing
              Heightened Scrutiny Protection under the Equal Protection Clause of the
              Constitution.

    Prior to 1971, no constitutionally based sex discrimination case had ever been won before the

Supreme Court. Cases brought under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment

failed because a "rational basis" test was applied, giving the government virtually unlimited leeway to

treat men and women differently. For example, the Court upheld various state statutes that

prevented women from working beyond a certain number of hours, prohibited women from

bartending unless their fathers or husbands owned the bars, and deterred women from serving on
juries.3*

         Commencing with Reed v. Reed, the Supreme Court abandoned the rational basis analysis and
adopted what has come to be known as the "heightened scrutiny" test.37 Under this standard a party
seeking to uphold a gender-based classification must show "an exceedingly persuasive justification"
for the classification. The burden is met only when the differential treatment is "substantially related"
to the achievement of "important governmental objectives." Moreover, the test must be applied "free
of fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of males and females"; the statutory objective
cannot reflect "archaic and stereotypical notions" about men and women.3* This standard has been
used repeatedly, since 1971, to overturn discriminatory laws premised on stereotypical assumptions
about the roles of men and women. For example, the Court has struck down laws allowing
servicemen but not servicewomen to claim spouses as dependents automatically;39 providing Social
Security payments to widows, but not widowers, with children;40 providing for a higher age of
 majority for males than females so that males were entitled to parental support for a longer period of
 time;41 giving husbands exclusive authority over community property;42 providing Aid to Families

and granting Social Security survivor's benefits to any widow but only to widowers who had been

receiving half of their support from their wives.44

          With Justice Marshall's retirement, however, only four of the current Justices have a record

of applying the heightened scrutiny standard to analyze sex discriminatory policies. For example,

Justices Stevens and White joined Justice O'Connor's majority opinion in Mississippi University for

Women v. Hoean CMUW). the last sex-based equal protection decision, to strike down a state-

supported nursing school policy to limit enrollment to women.43 Although Justice Blackmun

dissented in MUW.46 he has previously applied the heightened scrutiny test in gender-based equal

protection challenges.47 Chief Justice Rehnquist, on the other hand, has generally been hostile to a

heightened scrutiny analysis.4* Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Souter have not yet addressed any sex-

based equal protection challenge, so their position on the proper standard of review is not known.

        Continued vitality of the heightened scrutiny analysis for sex-based equal protection challenges
is of critical importance for women. In the almost ten years since the Court last applied this test,
lower courts have used heightened scrutiny to hold unconstitutional, for example, a law denying
citizenship to foreign-born offspring of female, but not male United States citizens;49 a trial court's
decision in a child custody case to look less favorably on a mother's employment outside the home
than a father's;30 and the denial of a promotion to a government employee because she was pregnant
and her employer believed she should stay home widi her family.31

         However, recently several lower courts have evaluated government-sanctioned gender
discrimination in a deeply troubling fashion. In U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia (VMI), a district
court held in June of this year that Virginia may continue to exclude women from the taxpayer-
supported Virginia Military Institute because the school's unique instructional method contributed to
the overall diversity of the Commonwealth's public university system.52 The court found that this
instructional method -- which involves tormenting of first-year students, frequent punishment, lack of
privacy, and intentional inducement of stress - would ultimately have to be abandoned if the school
became coeducational because most women would require a "system that provides more nurturing and

 case during his confirmation hearings for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In response, Judge Thomas
 stated diat it would be inappropriate for him to comment on a case that might come before a circuit court.
 He did, however, incorrectly identify the case as a possible violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act -
 - which bars race discrimination in education -- radier than as a gender-based equal protection challenge.

support."33 The court further noted that the presence of women would distract men from their
studies, increase pressures relating to dating, and impair the esprit de corps of the institution. The
VMI decision provides an opportunity for the Supreme Court to reverse MUW. which held
unconstitutional a publicly funded women's nursing school. VMI's reliance on women's inability to
adapt to an environment that was not "nurturing" flies in the face of the Court's position in MUW
that statutory objectives may not reflect stereotypic views of males and females.*1

         Another recent decision similarly counters constitutional principles established in earlier cases.
In United States v. Hamilton, the Fourth Circuit held that the Equal Protection Clause does not
prohibit prosecutors from using peremptory challenges to exclude women from criminal juries on the
basis of their sex.53 Although the Supreme Court since 197S has held that the Sixth Amendment
right to a fair trial prevents women from being excluded from a jury based on their gender, and in
1988 held that the Equal Protection Clause bars the use of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors

a result, the court upheld the prosecutor's elimination of three Black women from the jury solely
because they were women.31 This case has serious implications for women's right to be free from
government-sponsored discrimination, with particularly troubling results for women of color: the fact
that sex but not race is an acceptable reason to strike a juror allows prosecutors to limit the

participation of Blacks on the jury by striking Black women, but not white women or Black men.39
         Given the important role that the Equal Protection Clause has played in ending gender

discrimination, the recent decisions of lower courts in VMI and Hamilton are disturbing indeed. With
the shift in the make-up of the Court, it is of critical importance that the next Supreme Court justice
show commitment to preserve the kind of equal protection analysis that has served women well over
the last two decades.

         B- Judge Thomas's View of Constitutional Interpretation is Inconsistent With
                  Heightened Scrutiny of Gender-Based Distinctions under the Equal Protection
                  Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

         Judge Thomas's writings on "Natural Law" as the basis for constitutional interpretation raise
grave concerns about his commitment to a heightened scrutiny analysis "free of fixed notions
concerning the roles and abilities of men and women.'"0 If he lacks this commitment, Judge
Thomas could well provide the deciding fifth vote to return the Court to the days when preserving
women's traditional role in the family was reason enough to deny women the economic, social, and
family benefits and opportunities associated with equal status under the law.

         Although Judge Thomas claims to "not have a fully developed constitutional philosophy,"61
he has written numerous articles arguing that the Constitution should be interpreted by examining the
 Declaration of Independence and other founding documents to discern the "original intent" of the
 Framers.62 The Declaration, in turn, embodies moral principles of higher law, or "natural law."63

Judge Thomas's theory sets him far outside the mainstream of legal thinking64 in two ways that

present serious dangers to women's equal protection rights.

         First, despite two centuries of social change, Judge Thomas's reliance on original intent of the

Framers freezes the meaning of the Constitution and its amendments at the time of their drafting. In

order to reconcile original intent with the existence of slavery, Judge Thomas argues that the founding

documents intended equality for blacks. He states that slavery was "the greatest violation of the

fundamental principle of equality, one of the [Founding Fathers'] higher law principles informing the
Constitution.B6S To support his thesis, Judge Thomas refers to The Federalist Papers in which the
slave trade is described as an "unnatural traffic."66 In fact, he says, the Founders abhorred the

institution of slavery so much that they did not permit the words "slave" or "slavery" to appear in the
Constitution.67 Furthermore, according to Judge Thomas, the "three-fifths" clause, which counted

black males as "three-fifths" of a man for taxation and representation purposes, was meant in fact to

weaken the power of the slave states by reducing the number of people who could be counted for
representation in the House of Representatives.6*

          Through this reasoning, Judge Thomas extends his concept of the Founding principles of
equality to include Blacks. But he has said nothing about how, if at all, these founding principles
apply to women. That women would be included in the Founders' principles of equality is
improbable, as it is well established that neither the Framers of the Constitution nor the drafters of the
Fourteenth Amendment were concerned at all with sex discrimination.49 The theory of original
intent effectively reads women out of the Constitution, and inevitably leads to a return to the use of
the rational basis test, instead of heightened scrutiny, in sex-based equal protection challenges. This
rational basis standard offers virtually no protection to women.

          Second, Judge Thomas grounds his constitutional theory in the "laws of nature and nature's
God."70 To him, these "laws" set forth immutable principles that "transcend[] and underl[y] time
and place, race and custom."71 Thomas's views of natural law include a strong religious emphasis.
He refers to equality as a God-given right72 and to the rights of life, liberty, and property as "given
to man by his Creator."73 He quotes John Quincy Adams in explaining natural law:

                    Our political way of life is by the laws of nature [and] of nature's
                    God, and of course presupposes the existence of God, the moral rule of
                    the universe . . . .7*
    .nrding to Judge Thomas, natural law principles are the basis of the Declaration of Independence
and omer founding documents. They should form the basis for constitutional interpretation because
the original intention of the Constitution is "the fulfillment of the ideals of the Declaration of
Independence as Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, and the Founders understood it."75

          The implications of using the "laws of nature" as the basis for constitutional interpretation are
troubling. In an equal protection challenge, a court might well find that women's biological function
of childbearing is sufficient to justify unequal treatment of women.

          Our concern over the adverse implications of a Natural Law theory for women's constitutional
rights is based squarely in the history of the Court's analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment. Reliance
on the "laws of nature and of God" in American jurisprudence has been used explicitly to justify
gender-based discrimination. Archaic and stereotypical notions about women's roles, grounded in
women's "different" nature were applied to justify discriminatory treatment in a century of gender-
based Fourteenth Amendment challenges decided prior to 1971. Natural law has meant that men and
women are relegated to separate spheres and allocated and denied rights depending on gender.

          The case of Bradwell v. Illinois.7" clearly illustrates the result of "natural rights" reasoning.
The Supreme Court upheld an Illinois statute that prohibited women from obtaining licenses to
practice law.77 In his concurring opinion, Justice Bradley stated that "civil law, as well as nature
herself, has always recognized a wide difference in the respective spheres and destinies of man and
women. The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently
unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life."7* Furthermore, "[t]he paramount destiny and

      77 In denying Myra Bradwell's license to practice law, the Illinois Supreme Court stated:

                     That God designed the sexes to occupy different spheres of action, and that it belonged
                     to men to make, apply, and execute the laws, was regarded as an almost axiomatic truth
                     ... In view of these facts, we are certainly warranted in saying that when the legislature
                     gave to this court the power of granting licenses to practice law, it was with not the
                     slightest expectation that this privilege would be extended to women.

mission of woman are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of

the Creator."79

         Using a similar analysis, the Court in Muller v. Oregon.10 upheld an Oregon statute that

limited the number of hours women can work, by ruling that inherent differences between the sexes

provide ample justification for the state to limit a women's liberty right to contract. The Court held

that:

                  [T]he sexes differ in structure of body, in the functions to be
                  performed by each, in the amount of physical strength, in the capacity
                  for long continued labor, particularly when done standing, the
                  influence of vigorous health upon the future well-being of the race, the
                  self reliance which enables one to assert full rights, and in the capacity
                  to maintain the struggle for subsistence. This difference justifies a
                  difference in legislation, and upholds that which is designed to
                  compensate for some of the burdens which rest upon her."

         In Goesaert v. Clearv.*2 the Court again limited women's work opportunities by upholding a

Michigan statute that prohibited all women, except for wives or daughters of male bar owners, from

 license tax for hand laundry work). The Court stated that Montana can "put a lighter burden upon
 women than upon men with regard to an employment that our people commonly regard as more
 appropriate for the former." Thus the Court found mat the state can not only reward women who pursue
 traditionally acceptable work, but also punish those men who do "women's work." 223 U.S. at 63..

working as bartenders. The Court stated that Michigan can, in fact, prohibit all women from working
as bar maids, since the state has an interest in preventing "moral and social problems" which may be
caused by bartending by women.

          Even where a basic responsibility of citizenship, rather than a job opportunity, was at stake,
the Court did not hesitate to accept traditional gender roles as a sufficient reason to justify
discriminatory treatment. As recently as 1961, the Court, in Hoyt v. Florida." upheld a Florida
statute that automatically exempted women from jury duty, unless the individual women affirmatively
registered for such duty. Not surprisingly, this law commonly resulted in all-male juries." The
State of Florida justified the law by arguing that "[e]ver since the dawn of time," the rearing of
children has been the prime responsibility of women, and breadwinning the responsibility of men.13
Because women were the center of home and family life, the State, acting in pursuit of the general
welfare, could relieve women from the civic duty of jury service, unless the individual woman
determines that such service is "consistent with her own special responsibilities. "M

           Because Natural Law principles have provided the underpinnings of the historic legal analysis
that kept women from full and equal participation in public life, it is important to know how Judge
Thomas reads the Fourteenth Amendment's application to sex discrimination. His scholarly writings

on the Constitution do not specifically address the issue. However, his statements during his tenure
as a top executive branch official charged with enforcing our nation's civil rights laws underscore the
serious concerns raised by his support of Natural Law. For example, Judge Thomas has discounted
the role of sex discrimination in the concentration of women in low-paying jobs. He instead attributes
women's disproportionate presence in certain poorly paid jobs and their absence in better, higher-
paying jobs to women's own preferences - that "women choose to have babies" rather than obtaining
higher education and that "cultural differences" between men and women explain hiring
differentials.17 These types of statements suggest a lack of understanding of discriminatory factors
which have historically kept women out of many higher paying jobs and reflect stereotypical notions
of the roles and abilities of women."

          Judge Thomas's stated views mirror those of his self-proclaimed "intellectual mentor,"
Thomas Sowell.*9 Sowell in his many books on issues of race and politics has contended that
"Political activists may analogize the situation of women to that of minorities and attribute economic

     17 It could be, Thomas says, that blacks and women are generally unprepared to do certain
          kinds of work by their own choice. It could be that blacks choose not to study chemical
          engineering and that women choose to have babies instead of going to medical school.

disparities to forces more sinister than domestic lifestyles but their reiterated vehemence is not
evidence."*" Sowell elaborates on this statement inthe chapter, "The Special Case of Women," in
his book Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality? This chapter, which Judge Thomas has described as "a
much needed antidote to cliches about women's earnings and professional status,"91 concludes that
there is noevidence that "employer bias and 'stereotypes'* cause economic disparities." Rather,
women are attracted tothe lower-paying jobs "that make sense towomen."0 Because these jobs are
so appealing to women, they "are likely to have their pay held down by the competition of many
applicants."" Sowell contends that women are underrepresented in fields such as engineering,
research, law, and sports, not because of sex bias in those fields, but because the emphasis insuch
jobs on "continuous full-time work," make them unappealing to women.*9 Sowell fails to
acknowledge the fact that women, including those who are married orhave children, indeed choose
jobs in engineering, research, law, and sports. Further, Sowell does not explain why within many
specific job categories, holding education and experience levels constant, women still earn less than
men." Although herecognizes that employers may find a woman with family responsibilities tobe

"less valuable as an employee or less promotable," he does not consider this to be discrimination.77

Finally, he declines to accept that Black women experience dual discrimination based on sex and race.

Instead, he asserts incorrectly that Black women do better in the workforce than both Black men and
white women, a fact which he believes "is a very serious embarrassment to the civil rights vision."9*

         Based on Thomas Sowell's arguments, Judge Thomas concludes that "women cannot be
understood as though they were a racial minority group, or any kind of minority at all."99 These

comments, coupled with the general absence of discussions of the problems of discrimination against
women,100 are particularly disturbing given Judge Thomas's position as a top official, both atthe

Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Education and at the Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission, charged with enforcing equality laws.

         The omission is even more blatant given that Judge Thomas's considerable writings explaining

how his original intent theory does include equality for racial minorities, even though the Founders
allowed the practice of slavery to continue proposed theories that have no application to women.101

     100 Judge Thomas's speeches to women's groups and labor organizations have highlighted sex

 discrimination cases undertaken by the EEOC during his tenure. See, e.g., Speech by Clarence Thomas
 to the National Women's Law Center, New York, New York (June 17, 1983); Speech by Clarence
 Thomas to the AFL-CIO Civil Rights Institute, Silver Spring, Maryland (Apr. 3, 1984). However,
 women are conspicuously absent in his writings on the Constitution or otherwise.

     101 [The Founders] did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were then actually
          enjoying that equality, nor yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them.
          In fact they had no power to confer such a boon. They meant simply to declare the

Judge Thomas's arguments with respect to racial equality are not transferable to equality between the
sexes, as they are based on the history of slavery and its abolition. With respect to women,
principles of Natural Law as embodied in the founding documents have been exclusionary. If it is
true that Judge Thomas does not read the founding documents to intend equality for women as he
contends they did for Blacks, women may indeed lose the core protections guaranteeing their equality
if he is confirmed.

         C. Judge Thomas's Reliance on the Discredited Privileges or Immunities Clause is
                  Inconsistent with Continued Use of the Equal Protection Clause to Protect
                  Against Government-Sanctioned Sex Discrimination.

         Judge Thomas relies on the Privileges or Immunities Clause as the preferable constitutional
source of protection against discrimination.102 Specifically, he contends that in Brown v. Board of
Education.103 the Court erred in relying on social science data, instead of following the analysis in
Justice Harlan's dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson.104 which relied on the Privileges or Immunities
Clause.105 This analysis has serious adverse implications for women's rights. First, Judge Thomas

would suggest replacing equal protection doctrine -- which has been critical in protecting women's
rights -- with die Privileges or Immunities Clause, which has been discredited as a source of protected
individual rights.106 The Privileges or Immunities Clause was given very limited application by the
Slaughter-House Case."" It is limited to those matters which are derived from national as opposed
to state citizenship and has been construed to extend only to a limited set of rights including those to
carry on interstate commerce, to travel from state to state, to petition Congress, to vote for national
offices, to enter public lands, to be protected while in custody of die United States marshals, to
inform United States authorities of violations of their laws, and to take and hold real property.10*
All of these rights are already protected by other portions of the Constitution, thus rendering the
Privileges or Immunities Clause a redundant and empty provision.10*

         Second, based precisely on die Natural Law reasoning that Judge Thomas embraces, the
Privileges or Immunities Clause has historically been construed to offer no protection for women's
rights -- a matter Judge Thomas neither acknowledges nor addresses. A prime example of this
problem is the Bradwell case, discussed earlier.110 In upholding a statute denying women a license
to practice law, the Court ruled that die Fourteenth Amendment did not grant Bradwell the right to
bar admission in the state of Illinois, since admission to a state bar is not a privilege or immunity of
 United States citizenship. Justice Bradley, in his concurring opinion, emphasized that the Privileges

 years." J. ELY, DEMOCRACY AND DISTRUST, 22 (1980).

or Immunities Clause did not grant women as citizens the right to engage in any and "every
profession, occupation, or employment in civil life." Since the right to practice law is a privilege
granted by the states to its citizens, the state has the authority to determine who is and is not qualified
for the profession. The state in this case determined that women were not qualified to practice law,
given women's particular "delicate nature" and role in society as wife and mother.

          A further limitation in the Privileges or Immunities Clause is evident within Justice Harlan's
dissent in Plessy. upon which Judge Thomas relies. Justice Harlan envisioned the Privileges or
Immunities Clause to provide for a "color-blind" constitution, even though the "white race" is the
"dominant race" and "will continue to be for all time, if it remains true to its great heritage.""1 He
contended that proper application of the Privileges or Immunities Clause would correct such
anomalies as the fact that it is a violation of the law "If a colored maid insists upon riding in the same
coach with a white woman whom she has been employed to serve, and who may need her personal
attention while traveling.""2 Judge Thomas attempts to deal with these problematic aspects of the
dissent by arguing that Justice Harlan meant that the superiority of the white race is dependent upon
 its accepting that it is not superior but equal and that the Constitution is color-blind."3 The limits
 of this approach, however, are apparent, as a color-blind Constitution in the context of a society
 struggling with racism is a limited tool.

           Further, Justice Harlan's dissent refers to Chinese immigrants as being from "a race so
 different from [the white race] that we do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the
 United States.""4 Judge Thomas attempts to deal with this glaring flaw by arguing that under

Justice Harlan's principles, the "Chinese and anyone who undertook the duties of citizenship could
become citizens [and thus entitled to equality]," since citizenship requires both rights and duties.113
Yet Justice Harlan explicitly excluded Chinese immigrants from the possibility of ever becoming
citizens. This analysis presents a stark contrast to the more expansive equal protection analysis which
extends to all persons and is not limited to citizens.

          Taken as a whole, Judge Thomas's views regarding natural law and the primacy of the
Privileges or Immunities Clause suggest that women have reason to be concerned. As a lower court
judge, Judge Thomas was duty-bound to follow Supreme Court precedent applying heightened
scrutiny to gender-based challenges under the Equal Protection Clause. As a Supreme Court Justice,
he may have the opportunity to reverse precedent in this critical area. Judge Thomas's theory of
constitutional interpretation undermines the Equal Protection Clause for women, as it is logically
 incompatible with applying heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause in gender
discrimination cases. Even if heightened scrutiny is applied, Judge Thomas's support for Natural
Law principles means that adherence to the traditional roles of women may be reason enough to
justify unequal treatment of women. The Privileges or Immunities Clause, which has historically
 been used to deny women opportunities and which Judge Thomas proposes to revive "as the core of
 the Fourteenth Amendment,""6 offers a poor alternative to the Equal Protection Clause, which since
 1971 has offered women substantial protection against government-sanctioned discrimination. For
 these reasons, Judge Thomas's record is inconsistent with the core constitutional protection against
 unequal treatment of men and women by federal, state, and local government.

II. JUDGE THOMAS HAS FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO THE
         FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY THAT APPLIES TO
         PREGNANCY AND TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY
         The long line of cases recognizing a constitutionally protected fundamental right to privacy

stands for the clear proposition that decisions affecting marriage, childbirth, reproductive rights and
family relationships are so fundamental and critical to self-determination that governmental
interference must survive "strict scrutiny" judicial review. Under strict scrutiny, the government
must demonstrate a compelling interest justifying its interference and that the interest is furthered by
means which are the least restrictive on fundamental rights."7 The Supreme Court's application of
the right to privacy to pregnancy and termination of pregnancy, including contraception, assures that
its basic protections are fully available to women, as they are to men. Any nominee to the Supreme
Court must have a commitment to these core constitutional protections for women guaranteed by the
fundamental right to privacy.

         A. The Constitutional Right To Privacy That Includes Contraception. Abortion and
                  Pregnancy is Threatened.

         In a line of decisions stretching back more than half a century, the Supreme Court has
recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, exists
 under the Constitution. Decisions recognizing a fundamental privacy interest have forbidden
governmental intrusion into marriage;"1 procreation;"9 family relationships;120 and child rearing
 and education.121

     117 See Roe v. Wade. 410 U.S. 113, 155 (1973).
     111 Loving v. Virginia. 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967).

                                        324

          The leading modern case first recognizing the constitutional right to privacy in reproductive
decisions is Griswold v. Connecticut.m in which the Court considered the constitutionality of a
Connecticut law prohibiting the sale or use of contraceptives, even by married couples. The Griswold
Court held that a right to privacy is found in the "penumbras" of the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth
Amendments and protected by the Ninth Amendment, which provides that "[t]he enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the
people."123 Finding that the Connecticut law implicated the right to privacy, and that the state
lacked a compelling interest in the statute, the Court held the law to be invalid. In Eisenstadt v.
Baird.12* the Court extended the right to contraception to unmarried persons and defined a
constitutional right to privacy broad enough to include "the right of the individual, married or single,
to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person
as the decision whether to bear or beget a child."123

         Against this backdrop, the Court issued its decisions in Roe v. Wade126 and Doe v.
Bolton.127 In opinions written by Justice Blackmun, the Court recognized that a woman's
fundamental right to privacy includes the right to abortion, and thus any governmental interference
with that right would be subjected to strict scrutiny. Under Roe, until the time a fetus is viable, in
the beginning of the third trimester, the only state interest compelling enough to justify regulation of
abortion is protection of the woman's health. The state's interest in fetal life only becomes a

sufficiently compelling justification to interfere with a woman's fundamental right when the fetus is
viable.

          The application of the right to privacy to contraception, abortion, and pregnancy assures that
its basic protections are available to women as well as men. However, women's right to privacy
based on weir unique reproductive capacity is under serious threat.

          After Griswold and RQ were decided, the Supreme Court repeatedly struck down state laws
which infringed on women's privacy rights. For instance, the Court invalidated laws prohibiting the
sale of contraceptives to minors and limiting their distribution to licensed pharmacists;13* laws
restricting the availability of unemployment benefits for pregnant women;129 laws requiring that
 married women obtain their husbands' consent to have an abortion;'30 and laws requiring physicians
 to convey intimidating information designed to dissuade women from having abortions.131

           However, with the changing composition of the Supreme Court, the assault on women's
 privacy rights - and especially the strict scrutiny of governmental interference in contraception and
 abortion, including minors' access to abortion -- has intensified.

           The Supreme Court's decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'32 was an
 unprecedented retreat from the long line of cases recognizing that contraception and abortion are
 included in the fundamental right to privacy, and thus any governmental interference with these rights
 must be subjected to strict scrutiny. The Missouri law at issue in Webster began with a preamble,
 which stated the legislature's "findings" that a human being's life begins at conception, defined as the

time of fertilization, and that "unborn children" have protectable interests in life, health and well-
being. The preamble further directed that the laws of Missouri be interpreted to assure that "unborn
children" have the same rights as all other persons in the state, within the limits imposed by the
United States and Missouri Constitutions.

         Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for five justices in upholding the preamble, construing it as
merely expressing the state's value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion. Since the preamble
by itself did not restrict the activities of the plaintiffs, these justices decided that only when Missouri
uses the preamble to restrict an individual's actions would the Court determine whether the particular
restriction was constitutional.

         The four dissenting justices held that an assault on the fundamental privacy right to
contraception and abortion was inherent in the preamble. According to the dissent, the preamble's
definition of life as beginning at conception and conception as occurring at the time of fertilization
unconstitutionally interferes with a woman's right to abortion and to use methods of contraception that
can prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum, including the IUD, the "morning-after" pill, low-
dosage oral contraceptives, and the French-produced drug RU-486.133

         The preamble to the Missouri law at issue in Webster was enacted as part of a comprehensive
law placing onerous restrictions on abortion, including a prohibition on the use of employees or
public facilities (broadly defined) to perform abortions; a requirement of specific viability tests for
 abortions at twenty weeks of pregnancy; and a prohibition on the use of public funds for abortion
 counseling. In addition to the preamble, the Court upheld the prohibition on public funding and the
 viability testing requirement.134

     133 109 S.Ct. at 3068, n.l, 3081 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
     134 The prohibition on the use of public funds for abortion counseling was dismissed as moot and the
 Court did not rule on its constitutional validity.

                                       327

         Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion on these provisions - joined by Justices White and Kennedy
- did not explicitly overrule Roe, but undermined its foundation by concluding that the viability
testing requirement is "reasonably designed to ensure that abortions are not performed where the fetus
is viable -- an end which all concede is legitimate -- and that is sufficient to sustain its
constitutionality."135 This language suggests the plurality is applying rational basis review, the
standard applied to rights granted only minimal constitutional protection, not fundamental rights like
the right to privacy. Moreover, the plurality also concluded that there was no reason that the state's
interest in protecting fetal life should come into existence only at the point of viability, referring to a
"compelling interest" in protecting potential human life throughout pregnancy, from the moment of
conception. Under this analysis, even if the rights to abortion and contraception remain in name
fundamental rights, strict scrutiny is satisfied by the state's compelling interest in potential life from
the very beginning of pregnancy, and thus any governmental interference with the rights could be
upheld. Justice Scalia's separate opinion recognized that the plurality's analysis covertly overruled
Roe and denounced the failure to repudiate RQ completely and explicitly. Thus, there are at least
four Justices13* no longer applying the strict scrutiny protection of the rights to contraception and
abortion included in the fundamental right to privacy."7

     133 109 S.Ct. at 3058.
     136 Although dissenting from the plurality's analysis in Webster, in previous cases Justice O'Connor
 has supported the authority of states to enact restrictions which do not impose an "undue burden" on the
 right to choose, a less rigorous standard than strict scrutiny review. See, e.g., Thornburgh v. ACOG.
 476 U.S. at 828 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).
     137 Two 1990 Supreme Court decisions upholding rigid parental notification laws, Hodgson v
 Minnesota. 110 S.Ct. 2926 (1990) and Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health. 110 S.Ct. 2972
 (1990), demonstrate that young women's abortion rights have already been severely eroded.

                                                                   40
                                    328

          Last term, the Court continued its assault on Roe v. Wade in Rust v. Sullivan.'3' with
Justice Souter joining the four Justices who had abandoned strict scrutiny protection for abortion
rights in Webster. In Rust, a five-member majority upheld regulations prohibiting health care
personnel at federally funded family planning clinics from providing information on any abortion-
related services, even in response to direct inquiries by women. Despite the fact that the statute
implicated not only the right to privacy, but also the first amendment, the Court found that the
government's regulations were constitutionally permissible because the "Government has no
constitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely because the activity is constitutionally
protected."1" Justice Blaclcmun, however, found that the Rust majority had gone beyond previous
Jecisions, such as Webster, which limited the availability of abortion, and had reached a level of
coercion that violated women's right to choose: 'Roe v. Wade . . . and its progeny are not so much
about a medical procedure as they are about a woman's fundamental right to self-determination."140
He concluded that Rust v. Sullivan resembles Webster, in that it technically leaves the fundamental
right protected by Roe v. Wade intact, while robbing it of substance. He called the decision "nearly
 as noxious as overruling  o j directly, for if a right is found to be unenforceable . . . then it ceases to
 be a right at all."141

           The next appointee to the Supreme Court may well provide the fifth or sixth vote to end
 constitutional protection of women's fundamental right to privacy, including the rights to
 contraception and abortion. In the wake of Webster, numerous states have enacted laws that could
 provide the basis for a full reversal of Roe v. Wade.

          A recently enacted Louisiana law, for example, outlaws abortion except in very narrowly
defined cases of rape, incest, or to save the woman's life. The Louisiana law carries with it a penalty
of a fine of $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years for any doctor who performs an abortion.
Although the law was struck down by a federal district court judge, the state is seeking an expedited
review of the case by the Supreme Court. Both Guam and Utah have enacted similar laws, which
could also be used to overturn Roe.'"

          A Pennsylvania statute, held unconstitutional by the federal district court, imposes a 24-hour
waiting period for abortions, requires spousal notification, "informed consent" by both a minor
seeking an abortion and a parent, and mandatory counseling by a physician.143 The district court
observed that several of these provisions are essentially the same as those struck down in Thornburgh
in 1986 and rejected the state's argument that the constitutional standard had been modified by
Webster and other recent decisions. The Pennsylvania statue, therefore, also presents a clear
opportunity for the Court to undermine Thornburgh and the decision upon which Thornburgh was
based - Roe v. Wade - and to continue the Court's pattern of chipping away at the right to privacy
until it ceases to exist.

           As the Court moves toward returning the rights of women to the days of back-alley abortions
 and prohibitions on contraceptives, there is no more important inquiry than where the nominee stands
 on the fundamental right to privacy.

      142 The Guam law, which was recently suspended by a federal court, prohibits abortions except when
 two physicians determine that continuing the pregnancy would endanger the woman's life or gravely harm
 her health. Unlike the Louisiana law, it carries a penalty against the woman. The Utah statute allows
 abortion only if the woman's life or health is gravely endangered or if the fetus has significant defects.
 A federal district court is expected to rule on its constitutionality in the near future.

        B. Judge Thomas's Record Indicates That He is Hostile to the Fundamental Right
                 To Privacy and Supports an Interpretation of the Constitution That Includes the
                 Principle that Life Begins At Conception.

        Judge Thomas has criticized the key constitutional decisions that establish the right to privacy.
Finding the line of cases based on the Ninth Amendment to be constitutionally flawed as inconsistent
with the intent of the Framers, Judge Thomas argues that Natural Law principles are the appropriate
basis for interpreting the scope of unenumerated constitutional rights. These Natural Law theories,
discussed in die previous section, are not only inconsistent with a right to privacy that includes
termination of pregnancy, but could read into the Constitution the principle that life begins at
conception.

         In his writings on Natural Law, Judge Thomas criticizes the line of cases upholding the right
to privacy based on the Ninth Amendment. In his article "The Higher Law Background of the
Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment," Judge Thomas argues against "the
willfulness of both run-amok majorities and run-amok judges" in favor of limited government based
on the "higher law political philosophy of die Founding Fathers."1" A self-proclaimed
conservative,149 Judge Thomas notes that the "current case provoking die most protest from
conservatives" is Roe v. Wade.146 He cites bodi RQ and Griswold v. Connecticut, which struck
down a statute barring married couples from using birth control, as examples of activist judicial use
of the Ninth Amendment in violation of higher law principles.147

        Judge Thomas explained his "misgivings" about Roe,. Griswold. and other privacy cases in
"Civil Rights as a Principle Versus Civil Rights as an Interest." This article criticizes Justice Arthur
Goldberg's "discovery, or rather invention," of the Ninth Amendment in Griswold.'4* Justice
Goldberg's often-cited concurring opinion in Griswold elaborated upon Justice Douglas's majority
opinion, which held that the right to privacy is found in the "penumbras" of specific rights contained
within the Bill of Rights and given force through the Ninth Amendment.149 Justice Goldberg's
concurrence suggests that although the "right to privacy" is not explicitly stated within the
Constitution, it exists as a fundamental personal right, found in the "'traditions and [collective]
conscience of our people," and applied through the Ninth Amendment. According to the Goldberg
concurrence, just as the Government could not impose a "totalitarian limitation of family size,"IS0
the government cannot outlaw voluntary birth control by married persons, absent a showing of a
compelling subordinating state interest.

         Judge Thomas, however, regards the Ninth Amendment as "an additional weapon for the
enemies of freedom."'51 If the Court can find the right to privacy in the Constitution, Judge
Thomas argues, might the Court not also find a right to welfare, for example? The desire to protect
rights "simply plays into the hands of those who advocate a total state," because rights read into the
Constitution by Congress or the Court will be enforced through "the expansion of bureaucratic
government."152 In short. Judge Thomas makes the extreme argument that the rights of people must
be limited in order to stop the growth of government.

          The right to privacy expressed in Griswold and & would presumably not find a place within
Judge Thomas's framework of limited government. This framework would place at risk not only
women's right to terminate a pregnancy, but also the right npi to have an abortion. Judge Thomas
has written that "allowing, restricting, or . . . requiring abortions are all matters for a legislature to
decide."133 In Judge Thomas's view, a court may not rely on the Constitutional right to privacy to
prevent a legislature from, for example, limiting the number of children a family may have or
requiring the sterilization of certain individuals, as long as the state could articulate a rational reason
for the policy.

          Other manifestations of the right to privacy unrelated to issues of abortion and contraception
would also be implicated. For example, the Court in Moore v. Ckv of East Cleveland relied on the
Griswold precedent to find strong constitutional protection for the sanctity of the family, and thereby
invalidated a local housing ordinance that made it a crime for a woman to share her home with her
son and two grandsons.15* If no privacy right is found in the Constitution, however, a legislature
might be able to separate families without running afoul of the Constitution.

           Judge Thomas's participation in a 1986 White House Working Group on the Family confirms
 his hostility toward the Court's interpretation of the Ninth Amendment. The Working Group issued a
 Report sharply critical of Roe. Griswold. Eisenstadt v. Baird. Planned Parenthood v. Danforth and
 Moore, describing them as part of a series of cases that "abruptly strip the family of its legal
 protections and pose the question of whether this most fundamental of American institutions retains
 any constitutional standing."133 The Report further pledges that "a fatally flawed line of court

 the family upon the death of his mother.

decisions can be corrected, directly or indirectly, through . . . the appointment of new judges and
their confirmation by the Senate, the limitation of the jurisdiction of Federal courts, and, in extreme
cases, amendment of the Constitution itself."15*

          While Judge Thomas's writings indicate that he would not construe the Ninth Amendment to
provide constitutional protection for a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy, he has made
statements indicating that he might find that the fetus has greater rights than it has ever been given.
Depending on the grounds, a reversal of Roe v. Wade might nonetheless permit states the option of
preserving legal abortion. However, a reversal based on the notion that life begins at conception
could go much further, requiring that all abortions throughout the United States be prohibited.

          This extreme philosophy is laid out in "The Declaration of Independence and the Right to
Life," by Lewis Lehrman, an article that Judge Thomas has described as "a splendid example of
applying natural law."157 Lehrman, like Judge Thomas, contends that the Constitution must be
 interpreted in a manner consistent with the original intent of the Framers, and that this intent may be
 found in the Declaration of Independence. Lehrman goes on to interpret the Declaration's statement
 that all men are endowed by their Creator with the inalienable right to life and liberty as including "a
 right to life of the child-about-to-be-born (a person)."131 As "all persons cannot be endowed both
 with the liberty to take innocent life by abortion and with the inalienable right to life," Lehrman
 concludes that the Supreme Court overstepped its lawful authority in the Roe v. Wade decision.119
 He bases this argument on his view that the right to abortion is "a spurious right born exclusively of

judicial supremacy with not a single trace of lawful authority, implicit or explicit, in the actual text or
history of the Constitution itself."160 He further argues that as the text of the Declaration and the

Constitution place "life" sequentially ahead of "liberty," life must be regarded as the more important

right:
         Is it to be reasonably supposed that the right to liberty is safe if the right to life is not
         first secured; and, further, is it to be maintained that human life 'endowed by the
         Creator' commences in the second or third trimester and not at the very beginning of
         the child-in-the-womb?161

For these reasons, Lehrman concludes that Roe v. Wade can only be regarded as a "'coup' against
the Constitution," with legal abortions as "the resulting holocaust.""2

         Lehrman's views on the rights of the fetus place more at stake even than the ability of a
woman to terminate her pregnancy. As Justice Stevens points out in his dissenting opinion in
Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, if life begins at conception "common forms of
contraception such as the IUD and the morning-after pill" and even some versions "of the ordinary,
 daily ingested birth control pill" which prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterine wall
 would be outlawed.10 Further, as the majority concluded in Roe, if a fetus is entitled to
 constitutional rights, a woman who has an abortion must be prosecuted, and, if guilty, given "the
 maximum penalty for murder."16*

 to a fetus and thetypical abortion statute: "Ithasalready been pointed o u t . . . that in Texas the woman

 is the woman not a principal or an accomplice? Further, the penalty for criminal abortion . . . i s

          The logical conclusion of these views --the principle that a fetus possesses a protected
constitutional right to life combined with a repudiation of the right to privacy under the Ninth
Amendment - allows for total state control of the most private details of our lives. These theories
free the state to impose restrictions that not only affect procreation, but the ability of individuals to
marry and live with whom they please, to obtain a divorce, and to make their own decisions
regarding other intensely private matters.

III. IN HIS ROLE AS CHIEF ENFORCER OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS PROHIBITING
          DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT, JUDGE THOMAS
          ADOPTED POLICIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE SCOPE AND
          ENFORCEMENT OF THESE LAWS, THEREBY RAISING CONCERNS REGARDING
          HIS COMMITMENT TO EQUAL JUSTICE.
          Judge Thomas's overall record at the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education

(OCR) and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOQ was characterized by the failure
to carry out enforcement responsibilities properly - even including court-ordered requirements - as
well as increasingly narrow interpretations of substantive key legal protections for women, minorities,
the elderly and disabled. There can be no more important rights than those protecting individuals
from discrimination in their efforts to seek an education or a job. The rights abridged included
discrimination targeted against individuals or large classes of people, discrimination arising from
intentional discrimination or discrimination resulting from the adverse impact of a policy or practice,
and discrimination stemming from narrowed policy interpretations or seriously inadequate
enforcement efforts. Judge Thomas's record of limiting these rights in education and employment, as
found by the courts, congressional oversight committees and even the General Accounting Office,
warrants serious concern.

           A. As the Chief Official Charged With Enforcing Laws Prohibiting Discrimination in
                     Education. Judge Thomas Presided Over Efforts to Diminish the Effectiveness of
                     Title IX and Other Anti-Discrimination Laws.

           Clarence Thomas took over as Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights of the Department
of Education in May, 1981. He was confirmed for this post in July, 1981, and served through May,
 1982. In this capacity, he was responsible for the OCR, the office within the Department of
 Education that is charged with enforcing laws barring discrimination in education. These laws include
 Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, barring sex discrimination in education, Title VI of
 the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibiting discrimination based on race and national origin, the Age

                                                          49
                                        337

Discrimination Act, protecting victims of age discrimination, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation

Act, which bars discrimination on the basis of disability.

          When Judge Thomas arrived at the Department of Education as its chief civil rights enforcer,

problems of sex discrimination in schools were serious. The National Advisory Council on Women's

Educational Programs issued a report at that time entitled Title IX: The Half Full. Half Empty Glass,

documenting widespread sex discrimination in scholarships, athletics, employment, and math, science
and vocational education programs faced by girls and women in schools throughout the country169.

          Despite these serious problems, the Administration was determined to retrench enforcement

efforts. Shortly before Judge Thomas's appointment, then-Secretary of Education Terrell Bell wrote

to then-Senator Paul Laxalt suggesting his intention to adopt a new approach to civil rights

enforcement:

                     In my opinion, the Title IX regulations need to be modified.... I
                     am still reviewing these and other regulations and plan to take action
                     to cut back as much as I can under the law and under the restraints
                     and demands imposed by the courts.... The Federal Courts may soon be
                     after us for not enforcing civil rights laws and regulations. Your
                     support for my efforts to decrease the undue harassment of schools
                     and colleges would be appreciated. It seems that we have some laws
                     we should not have, and my obligation to enforce them is against my
                     own philosophy.166

           During his confirmation hearings to be Assistant Secretary, Judge Thomas stated that he
 indeed intended to enforce civil rights laws "in the least intrusive manner."167 His record at OCR,

when taken as a whole, confirms that he used his role as chief enforcement officer for civil rights in
education to create agency enforcement so unintrusive as to be a nonpresence in many key respects.
A court found that Judge Thomas, as Assistant Secretary, failed to comply with its order designed to
cure nonenforcement through mandatory timeframes and procedures that OCR must follow in
handling its complaints and compliance reviews. Moreover, by narrowly construing the controlling
law and seriously limiting OCR's enforcement activities in a number of areas, Judge Thomas
undermined the ability of those protected by civil rights laws to obtain remedial action. His record at
OCR, when taken as a whole, demonstrates a lack of regard both for a court's order and for the
underlying rights of women, the disabled, and persons of color that order sought to protect.

          1. Judge Thomas Defied a Court Order Designed to Secure Enforcement of Title IX
                    and the Other Civil Rights Laws Under His Jurisdiction.

          Following a long history of litigation prior to Judge Thomas's tenure at OCR regarding the
agency's failure to enforce Title IX, Title VI and Section 504,'** a court order was entered setting
forth detailed timeframes and procedures intended to improve enforcement by requiring OCR to
handle complaints and compliance reviews within specified timeframes, thereby eliminating the
office's ability to put enforcement on indefinite hold and allow discrimination to continue
 jncnecked.1** Under Judge Thomas's watch, however, OCR's enforcement efforts slackened, and
the clear requirements of the court order were violated.

      '" The National Women's Law Center represented the plaintiffs in Women's Equity Action League
             et al. v. Cavazos. 906 F.2d 742 (D.C. Cir. 1990), which was originally brought in 1974 to

 challenge government nonenforcement of Title IX. Court orders were entered in the case in 1975 and
 1977 designed to remedy the nonenforcement. In 1981, the plaintiffs in WEAL filed a motion to show
 cause why the government should not be held in contempt for its failure to adhere to the terms of the
 court order. The case was ultimately dismissed in 1990 for lack of standing of the plaintiffs to pursue
 the claims.

      " See Court Order, Adams v. Bell. No. 3095-70 and WEAL v. Bell. No. 74-1720 (D.D.C. Dec.
 29, 1977).

                                                                  51
                                     339

        In March, 1982, the district court judge who entered the order held a hearing to determine
whether there was noncompliance, and to decide whether the order should remain in place, or be
lifted as requested by the government. In his testimony before the court, then-Assistant Secretary
Thomas admitted to violating the time frames:

                  Q. And you go down to the 12-month average for compliance
                  reviews, you find, do you not, that the time frames were met with
                  respect to compliance reviews only three percent of the time; is that
                  correct?
                  A. That's right.170

                  Q. Well, whatever numbers we use, it's pretty clear
                  that most of the time you violate the time frames for compliance
                  reviews?

                  A. Definitely.171

         At the conclusion of the hearing, at which Judge Thomas testified extensively, the court found
that:

                  The order has been violated in many important respects and we are
                  not at all convinced that these violations will be taken care of and
                  eventually eliminated without the coercive power of the court.172

 Starkly contrasting Judge Thomas to previous OCR Assistant Secretary David Tatel, Judge Pratt
 observed that whereas under David Tatel, "things were on the way to being improved,"173 under

Clarence Thomas's supervision, "we've almost come full cycle."114 Judge Pratt specifically
criticized Judge Thomas's lack of commitment to complying with the court order, stating that OCR's
enforcement of the civil rights statutes was being carried out, not as required by the law, but
according to Judge Thomas's "own way" and "own schedule."179 Judge Pratt explained that he
regarded the time frames as important to "impress on the people who observe those time frames that
after all we've got, first of all, a Constitution; we've got certain acts of Congress, and we've got to
pay attention to those things."176 He stated:

         I don't like to hold people in contempt. On the other hand, I'd like to see some kind
         of manifestation by the people that administer these statutes that they realize they are
         under the constraints of a court order and accordingly, are going to make a good faith
         effort to comply.177
While Judge Thomas may have sincerely believed that the time frames were not sound policy, he
substituted his judgment for that of a court order, demonstrating an alarming disregard for the law.
As a result, many individuals who suffered discrimination received no remedy, while federal funds
continued to flow to the discriminatory schools.
         2. Judge Thomas's OCR Sought to Limit Employment Discrimination Protections,

                  Even for Individual Employees Suffering Intentional Discrimination, Under Title
                  IX and Section 504.
          Since their promulgation in 197S, Title IX regulations have provided that job discrimination
on the basis of sex was covered by Title IX's prohibitions against sex discrimination by education
 institutions.17* Although a Supreme Court decision on precisely this point was anticipated within

 was Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.

the next term, Judge Thomas announced in July of 1981 that the Department was planning a change
in rules to exclude employment from the scope of Title IX.'79 Following this announcement, the
Department sought permission from the Justice Department to repeal the existing regulations, which
would effectively have reversed the government's position in litigation before the Supreme Coun
urging that employees were protected under Title IX.1" However, the Justice Department refused,
and the Education Department's position on this matter was subsequently repudiated by the Supreme
Court. In North Haven Board of Education v. Bell.'" the Supreme Court held that Title IX covers
employment discrimination.

          Judge Thomas took a similar position on Section 504, by putting "holds" on Section 504
employment cases. Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds questioned "the propriety
of refusing to process" the Section 504 employment discrimination complaints in areas of the country
not affected by contrary judicial orders."2 He requested that Judge Thomas "direct OCR to begin
accepting, investigating and, where appropriate, remedying those complaints. "1O Judge Thomas
 rejected Reynolds' recommendation, however, and continued the policy of not enforcing the law in

      179 See UPI Release, July 13, 1981; UPI Release, August 4, 1981. The proposed policy would have
 protected employees only insofar as the discrimination against then was proved to cause discrimination
 against students, or if the federal funding was not for general cjucational purposes, out for the purpose
 of providing employment.

this area.1*4 In Consolidated Rail Com, v. Darrone."3 the Court held that Section 504 prohibits

employment discrimination, again rejecting the narrow position Judge Thomas followed.

3.  Judge Thomas Instituted Policies That Reduced Remedies to Victims of

    Educational Discrimination, Including Individual Victims of Intentional

    Discrimination.

The Early Complaint Resolution (ECR) procedure, implemented during Judge Thomas's

tenure at OCR, involved seeking settlements in individual cases before an investigation would be

undertaken. In November, 1981, the Justice Department notified OCR of its "major concern" that the

ECR procedure does:

    not require that the agreements reached between a complainant and
    recipient meet the legal standards set by Title VI, Title IX, Section
    504 and your implementing regulations. The apparent willingness of
    OCR to accept any agreement which results in a withdrawn complaint,
    regardless of the substance of that agreement, could lead to a
    weakening of your enforcement posture and our litigation
    position.1*6

Judge Thomas, however, declined to alter the procedure, which the House Committee on Government

Operations eventually concluded "may be illegal, may not protect the rights of complainants, and may
jeopardize future litigation involving violations of civil rights laws."1*7

Also during Judge Thomas's tenure, OCR began a policy of accepting promises of remedial

action, rather than actual compliance by the institution accused of violating civil rights laws, as

sufficient settlement of cases yrior to the issuance of a Letter of Finding. In such cases, the Letter of

     ** Letter to Reynolds from Clarence Thomas (Apr. 31, 1982).

Finding would indicate that any violation had been corrected."* In practice, the institutions'
assurances often involved vague or inadequate promises of remedial action; in addition, OCR did little
or nothing to monitor whether the institution actually undertook the promised action.1*9 The
practical effect of this policy was to diminish enforcement of laws protecting the rights of and
remedies received by women, minorities, and persons with disabilities in education.190

          Judge Thomas's exceedingly limited view of federal civil rights enforcement is effectively
summarized in an OCR budget document advocating a dramatically diminished federal role in civil
rights enforcement. Judge Thomas proposed, among other things:

                     reviewing the desirability of OCR investigating every complaint over
                     which it has jurisdiction; . . . reviewing the procedure of allowing
                     recipients to assess their own compliance prior to an OCR compliance
                     review; reviewing the procedure of having community groups rather
                     than the Federal government monitor the implementation of remedial
                     plans.1"
 And he concluded, "Ican foresee the time when OCR, instead of automatically conducting a
 compliance review when a serious civil rights violation becomes apparent, would require the
 institution to conduct a self-assessment of its compliance status.""2

        Title IX regulations, since their promulgation in 1975, have prohibited practices which are
intentionally discriminatory, and those which, although not necessarily by design, have an unfair
discriminatory impact against girls and women in education.193 Title IX protection against practices
with discriminatory impact on the basis of sex is of great importance in opening educational
opportunities to women young and old.

         For example, young women have been hurt by improper uses of SAT tests - which are
designed to predict first year college grades. While women's grades are higher than their male
colleagues, since 1972 women have scored lower than men in the verbal and math sections of the
SAT.1*1 When SAT scores are rigidly used, young women can be denied scholarships, admission to
schools or educational programs, and a host of other educational benefits. Relying on the Title IX
adverse impact regulations, a court recently violated a New York state program for awarding college

        onips to high school students, because it improperly relied on the SAT to the detriment of
many deserving young women."5

     193 For example, the regulations addressing admissions, employment, counseling and vocational
education covers practices which have an adverse effect based on sex. 34 C.F.R. 106.21(b)(2)(1990);
34 C.F.R. 106.52(1990); 34 C.F.R. 106.36(b) and (c)(1990); 34 C.F.R. Part 100, App. B, IV, K

          With Judge Thomas at the helm, OCR began to undercut the Title IX prohibition against
adverse impact discrimination. For example, in the area of sex discrimination in athletics, OCR sent
a letter of findings that despite the fact that the female athletic program did not give its athletes
honors given to the male athletes, there was no violation of Title IX"* because it was not done for a
"sexually discriminatory purpose." In 1982, the National Women's Law Center testified before the
House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, expressed its concern about the use of an
intent standard, and stated that "[i]t and is not uncommon to read Letters of Findings from OCR
which articulate legal standards which are the reverse of those required by the statute and
regulations.""7

          The OCR budget document for FY 1983 prepared while Judge Thomas was at OCR, in
addition to the changes in enforcement strategies discussed above, also suggests that OCR will be
considering "reviewing all policies and regulations for appropriateness" and that "compliance review
activities will be targeted exclusively at the comparatively small number of recipients which seem to
knowingly and severely violate major civil rights guarantees.""* The process began while
Judge Thomas was at OCR ultimately led to a situation after his departure in which:

                     "The National Office made it virtually impossible to find
                     a violation of the civil rights laws because the standard
                     of proof required to establish a violation was the stringent
                      "intent" standard, which many regional office staff interviewed
                     believed was not required by the courts.1"

          In short, while at OCR, Judge Thomas presided over the beginning of serious cutbacks in the
enforcement and interpretation of Title IX and the other statutes prohibiting discrimination in
education. This disturbing trend continued over the time he was at the head of the EEOC.

          B. Judge Thomas Undercut the Laws Prohibiting Employment Discrimination as
                    Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

          Judge Thomas's efforts to cut back on enforcement and limit the scope of anti-discrimination
laws that began during his short tenure as head of OCR, continued with great force over the eight
years he served as Chair of the EEOC. Those years were marked by restrictive EEOC interpretations
of employment protections, whether intentional discrimination or practices with discriminatory impact
were at stake, whether individuals or large classes of victims of discrimination were injured, and
whether the issues were novel or settled.

                    1. Judge Thomas's EEOC Tolerated Employer Policies Intentionally Barring
                               Women of Child-Bearing Years From Jobs.

          Just last term, a unanimous Supreme Court held in United Auto Workers v. Johnson
Controls. Inc..200 that policies that exclude all fertile women from certain jobs, ostensibly to reduce
perceived risks to fetal health from exposure to workplace hazards, can be an intentional violation of
Title VII. These policies typically prohibit all women between 16 and 50 who are unable to prove
 'heir sterility from jobs that, according to the employer, pose reproductive risks. The policies apply
only to women, despite the fact that workplace hazards can pose risks to all adult workers, and can
 cause fetal harm by paternal exposure prior to conception through reproductive or genetic
 damage.201 As many as 20 million jobs in the United States expose workers to reproductive or fetal

 strongly criticizes the Commission for its inaction on this issue during the Judge Thomas' tenure.

health hazards,301 making the stakes of "fetal protection" policies for women's employment very
high. So, too, these policies coerce women into becoming sterilized in order to keep jobs that they
desperately need to support themselves and their families.203 By excluding women as a class from
entire job categories, these policies constitute blatant and intentional sex discrimination in
employment, and therefore fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the EEOC.

          During Judge Thomas's tenure at the EEOC, virtually no women who filed complaints with
the EEOC alleging this blatant form of discrimination received any help from the agency in handling
their complaints.3" Until 1988, the EEOC did not develop guidelines for reviewing fetal protection
policies, in spite of repeated calls to do so and a mounting number of sex discrimination complaints
filed by women over the issue. While the EEOC supposedly followed a "case by case" approach to
complaints filed by women who were turned away from jobs as a result of fetal protection
policies,39 in fact EEOC staff were told to forward complaints to the agency's Office of Legal

 protection policies that exclude women from jobs based on gender. In 1980, the EEOC issued proposed
 interpretive guidelines on the issue of employment discrimination and reproductive hazards. After
 widespread controversy over the proposals, the EEOC withdrew the guidelines with a statement that "the
 most appropriate method of eliminating employment discrimination in the work place where there is
 potential exposure to reproductive hazards is through investigation and enforcement of the law on a case
 by case basis, rather than by the issuance of interpretive guidelines." 46 Fed. Reg. 3916 (Jan. 16,1981);

Counsel, which in turn was instructed to do nothing with them. Over 100 of these claims were
simply "warehoused."206

          When EEOC did develop a policy, the approach taken was far less protective of women's

employment rights than the position ultimately adopted by the Supreme Court in Johnson. Under

Chairman Thomas, the EEOC first took a position as a participant in several important federal court
cases addressing the issue. In Wright v. Olin Corporation.3" the agency argued that Olin's fetal

protection policy constituted facial discrimination in express violation of Title VII, but also took the

unprecedented position that although none was present in the case, a "legitimate business interest"
might justify the policy in some cases.201 The EEOC position was unprecedented for the only Title

VII statutory defense to facial sex discrimination which had ever applied was the far more narrow

     506 Id- at 16. An unsuccessful effort was made to provide guidance to field investigations in the
EEOC compliance manual. However, according to the House Fetal Protection Report:

                     in the final drafting stages, a disclaimer was added to the Compliance
                     Manual Section at the request of EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas. The
                     disclaimer reflected the EEOC's effort to duck the fetal protection
                     issue: 'The Commission has not yet decided whether such a policy or
                     practice can lead to or be a violation of Title VII, or how the theories
                     of disparate treatment and adverse impact should be applied.' Although
                     this language was not included in the final version, the Chairman's
                     request for such a disclaimer suggests at a minimum that he approved
                     of the EEOC's default on this issue.

                     Chairman Thomas' desire that the Compliance Manual Section reflect
                     the Commission's neutrality on the fetal protection issue was
                     ultimately satisfied by the deletion of a discussion of how the
                     facial discrimination or disparate impact theories might apply to
                     such policies.

bona fide occupational qualification ("BFOQ") defense.3" The Wright court followed the EEOC
position. In Hayes v. Shelby Memorial Hospital.210 the EEOC again urged the court to move from
the stringent "BFOQ" defense, and adopt the looser standard it had advanced which was adopted by
the court in Wright.*" The Haves court agreed to the lower business necessity standard.

          In 1988, the EEOC finally issued interpretive guidelines on the applicability of Title VII to
fetal protection policies. The 1988 policy guidance adopted the analysis of Wright and Hjve:

                     [PJolicies which exclude only women constitute per se violations of
                     the Act. Although the BFOQ defense is normally the only available
                     defense in the case of overt discrimination the Commission follows the
                     lead of fWright and Hayesl that the business necessity defense applies
                     to these cases.212
           These guidelines are in sharp contrast to the approach taken by the majority in Johnson
 Controls.213 In this landmark decision, the Supreme Court repudiated the attempt to weaken Title
 VII protections for women suffering intentional sex discrimination by soundly rejecting the business
 necessity defense which was advanced while Clarence Thomas was at the EEOC. The Supreme Court
 ruled that the statutory language could not admit Judge Thomas's interpretations.
           In sum, in an area of vital concern to women, with women's access to millions of jobs at
 stake, Judge Thomas failed to establish a policy, warehoused cases, and ultimately adopted a policy
 that directly contradicts the clear statutory language of Tide VII as interpreted by the Supreme Court
 last term. As the House Report noted, in 1990, the EEOC took its most forceful stand up to that

point in condemning the lower court decision in Johnson Controls which had upheld the fetal
protection policy.214 This EEOC stand came after Judge Thomas left the agency.

                  2. Judge Thomas's EEOC Reduced Its Efforts to Protect Women Suffering
                           Intentional Pay Discrimination.

         The EEOC is responsible for enforcing the two major laws that prohibit discrimination in pay
on the basis of sex: the Equal Pay Act of 1963215 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.2'*
While under the Equal Pay Act, the jobs being compared for purposes of determining whether a pay
discrimination exists must be the same or substantially so, the Supreme Court in County of
Washington. Oregon v. Gunther held that Title VII also prohibits employers from intentionally
segregating even very different jobs according to sex and then depressing the wages of the jobs held
predominantly by women.217 The Court noted, however, that it was not ruling on the issue of
"comparable worth," where purposeful pay discrimination was not an issue, but where traditionally
"female" jobs paid less than those held by men. The Court left open the question of whether a Title
VII violation could apply when women's wage rates were not intentionally reduced on account of sex,
but where the lower pay could not be justified on the basis of nondiscriminatory factors such as
relative skill, difficulty or importance of the jobs in question.

     On May 22, 1984, the House Committee on Government Operations submitted a report entitled
Pav Equity: EEOC's Handling of Sex-Based Wage Discrimination Complaints.2" The Committee
made a series of findings extremely critical of EEOC and Judge Thomas as its chair.

                                    351

        First, the Committee found that the EEOC had taken no action on charges and cases of sex-
based wage discrimination, other than straight Equal Pay Act cases, since the June 1981 Gunther
decision. At the time of the report, EEOC had no policy on handling these types of cases, yet the
Commission believed it needed to adopt such a policy before any charges could be processed. The
Committee found the need for a policy questionable, since the issue was simply one of implementing
the Gunther decision. By its insistence on a policy in this area prior to taking action and then
refusing to adopt a policy, the EEOC had denied relief to victims of intentional pay discrimination
and failed to provide guidance for the courts and employers.219

         Second, the Committee determined that there were over 250 sex-based wage discrimination
charges, some dating from 1974, languishing in EEOC's Washington office. These claims were all in
areas outside the limited Equal Pay Act criteria of identical or substantially similar jobs and therefore
were not covered by EEOC policy, but could violate Title VII under Gunther.230

         Third, the Committee recognized that in May, 1984, the EEOC adopted a Compliance Manual
Section on Wage Discrimination, but believed that the adoption came only as a result of the
Committee's investigation and hearings and public attention to EEOC's lack of activity in the wage
discrimination area. Further, the EEOC hastily formed a task force to examine the more than 250
pending charges, again, according to the Committee, in response to its investigation.-1

          When the EEOC finally began to handle cases, its long-awaited policy simply tracked the
 specific Gunther ruling, and gave no additional guidance or explication of issues left open by the
 Court. The EEOC's policy, issued four years after the Gunther decision, merely reiterated the
 Gunther finding that Title VII does not bar claims of sex-based wage discrimination merely because

the jobs involved are not identical.m According to one report, a draft decision had been approved
by the four other EEOC commissioners a week before the final June 17, 1985,release of the final
policy, but Clarence Thomas wanted a more restrictive position than called for in the draft
decision.225 As a result, the policy was revised to simply restate the Gunther holding, adding no
new guidance. Moreover, me EEOC not only refused toconsider odier types ofpay discrimination
claims where no intentional discrimination was alleged - the issue left open in Gunther - but even
refused toinvestigate the pending charges ithad received which did not explicitly allege intentional
discrimination to determine if intentional discrimination was present.224 In sum, then-Commissioner
Thomas warehoused over 250 claims for more than three years in order to develop a policy, which
once developed, only reiterated Supreme Court case law. Moreover, the ultimate policy adopted
interpreted the issue left open by the Supreme Court of Title VII protection for nonintentional pay
discrimination adversely to the interests of women.

         Moreover, the EEOC's lack of attention to pay discrimination of the type prohibitedin
Gunther was not accompanied by any increased attention to traditional Equal Pay Act cases. Even
straightforward Equal Pay Act claims, where a woman is paid less for virtually the identical job held
by a man, did not fare well during Judge Thomas's tenure atthe EEOC. In fact, the number of
cases brought by the EEOC under the Equal Pay Act during Judge Thomas's tenure dropped
noticeably from the number brought in FY 1980, the year before he arrived.223

           3.  Judge Thomas's EEOC Failed To Enforce Affirmative Action Approved

               By The Supreme Court As A Remedy For Intentional As Well As

               Nonintentional Discrimination.

During Judge Thomas's tenure at the EEOC, his view on the appropriateness of affirmative

action to remedy the effects of discrimination against women and minorities seemed to evolve. He
began his tenure articulating some support for such remedies,26 but moved to consistent, strong and

vocal opposition, even to those remedies explicitly approved by the Supreme Court.

          The importance of affirmative action to women is highlighted by the Supreme Court case,
Johnson v. Santa Clara County.217 Johnson dealt with an all-too-common situation, the total

absence of any women in well-paid, but traditionally male jobs. The job in this case was road

dispatcher in Santa Clara County, California. Concerned that it had never employed any women in
this position,22* the County voluntarily reviewed its employment practices. Determining that a

female employee of the County for nine years was rated well qualified for the job, the County

promoted her to a road dispatcher job over a white male who had a similar rating. The white male,

who had scored 75 points to the female candidate's 73 points in an oral interview, sued claiming
reverse discrimination.329 The Supreme Court upheld the County's action as entirely consistent with

Tide VII.

Judge Thomas forcefully criticized the decision, embracing Justice Scalia's dissent and stating

his hope that it would "provide guidance for lower courts and a possible majority in future

                                         354

decisions."230 Yet, Justice Scalia's opinion was a broadside attack on Title VII Supreme Court case

law. Justice O'Connor, in her concurring opinion in Johnson, stated that "Justice Scalia's dissent

rejects the Court's precedents and addresses the question of how Title VII should be interpreted as if
the Court were writing on a clear slate."231

         In fact, Judge Thomas has repeatedly criticized Supreme Court precedent, giving rise to

serious concern that he, like Justice Scalia whom he has praised, would ignore the principle of stare

decisis and disregard or overturn settled Supreme Court cases which have set boundaries for
affirmative action under Title VII.232

         Judge Thomas's aversion to Supreme Court interpretations of Title VII was reflected in his

reluctance to enforce the law's mandate as Chair of the EEOC. In 1985, the EEOC acting general

counsel, with Judge Thomas's knowledge, ordered EEOC regional attorneys to avoid the use of goals

and timetables in any settlements or actions in which EEOC was involved, and to halt enforcement of
goals and timetables in any ongoing consent decrees.233 It was not until his reconfirmation hearings

as Chair of the EEOC in 1986 that he promised to withdraw the EEOC ban on the use of goals and

timetables as a remedy.234 He only did so in recognition of explicit Supreme Court cases decided in

1986 reaffirming the appropriateness of goals and timetables, not because he agreed with the

decisions. Rather, Judge Thomas is quoted as saying "That's the law of the land whether I like it or
not."235

4.  Judge Thomas Reduced EEOC's Use of Class Action Cases Protecting

    Many Women from Intentional Discrimination While Doing Little to Help
    Individual Women's Cases.

As Chair of the EEOC, Judge Thomas made no secret of his strong preference that the EEOC

bring cases on behalf of individuals, rather than the more broad-based class action suits that are

designed to benefit large numbers of employees. According to the Washington Post:

The Reagan-run EEOC has announced its intention to move away

from class-action suits on employment discrimination in favor

of smaller, individual suits for persons who can prove that
they, specifically, were victims of bias.236

Judge Thomas indicated his agreement with this new focus. The New York Times reported that

Judge Thomas wanted to move toward a policy of bringing cases where an individual could testify
about "what happened to me."37

The results of the policy were predictable: the ability of the agency to remedy discrimination

against large numbers of women was severely reduced. A good example of the policy's impact is the

recent, widely publicized S66 million settlement on behalf of 13,000 women in a case brought by

EEOC in 1978 against Western Electric. The company had a policy forcing pregnant women who

were willing and able to work to take unpaid leave at the end oftheir sixth or seventh month of
pregnancy, then limiting their seniority benefits and offering noguarantee of a job when they sought
to return.23' Inabandoning these kinds of class action cases, which remedied intentional
discrimination against thousands of women, Judge Thomas's EEOC did not substitute 13,000
individual cases vindicating the rights ofthese women. Infact, during his tenure atthe EEOC, there
was only a small increase in the number of individual cases brought, while the number of class action
cases dropped substantially.2" A significant net reduction in EEOC effectiveness resulted.

         Moreover, the way in which the EEOC handled individual cases has been faulted. The
General Accounting Office (GAO) concluded that the EEOC routinely closed cases without adequate
investigations.240 The bottom line was that the percentage of individuals filing claims of
discrimination who got no relief jumped from 28.5% inFY 1980 to 54.2% in FY 1989.*"

         Nowhere isthe damage done to individual victims of discrimination more stark than in
EEOC's handling of age discrimination cases. During Judge Thomas's tenure, thousands of charges
filed byolder workers were ignored, and the two-year statute of limitations ran, thereby causing these
workers to lose their right to pursue their claims in court. Congress enacted the Age Discrimination
Claims Assistance Act to extend the period of time forfiling temporarily, sothat these cases couldbe

     239 In FY 1980, the EEOC filed 218 class action cases. In the last year of Judge Thomas' tenure
at EEOC, FY 1989, the EEOC filed only 129 such cases. InFY 1980 the EEOC filed 326 cases intotal

brought. Even after the law was passed, however, Judge Thomas's EEOC allowed thousands of
additional claims that were filed after the law's effective date to lapse.30 Judge Thomas's rationale
that older workers facing age discrimination still had state law claims fails to address the serious
adverse consequences of losing EEOC enforcement and access to the federal courts.313

          Although the EEOC under Judge Thomas supported the rights of older women workers in
several cases involving sex discrimination in retirement benefits,2** the EEOC also failed to secure
benefits to which older workers were entitled. For example, despite an EEOC policy determination
that regulations allowing employers to stop paying into employer pension accounts when they reached
the age of 65 violated the ADEA, the EEOC did not rescind the regulations.2*5 Even cases of
intentional facial discrimination against older workers were left unremedied during Judge Thomas's
tenure at the EEOC.

           5. Judge Thomas Challenged Title VII's Protection Against Nonintentionai, but
                     Pervasive Discrimination Against Women.

           Twenty years ago, the Supreme Court established in Griggs v. Duke Power Co..** that
Title VII prohibits unjustified employment policies that have discriminatory impact against women or
 minorities, whether intended to have such adverse impact or not. While in 1983 Judge Thomas

indicated approval of Griggs.2*7 his later comments explicitly rejected this seminal Supreme Court

decision's basic holding on adverse impact. Judge Thomas said:
                    We have unfortunately permitted sociological and demographic
                    realities to be manipulated to the point of surreality by
                     convenient legal theories and procedures such as adverse impact
                     . . . We have locked amorphous, complex, and sometimes
                    unexplainable social phenomena into legal theories that sound
                     good to the public, please lawyers, and fit legal precedents,
                     but make no sense. If I have my way, we will have the legal
                     theories conform to reality as opposed to reality being made to
                     conform to legal theories.241

This hostility to Title VII protection for practices which may seem fair on their face, but actually

adversely affect women or minorities, is reflected in Judge Thomas's criticisms of reliance on
statistics which demonstrate such adverse impact. His controversial handling of the Sears case249

demonstrates the difficulties his approach caused in eliminating discrimination against women in the

workplace.

           The case began in the Nixon Administration with the filing of an EEOC Commissioner's
charge in 1973.250 In 1979, the EEOC filed a lawsuit that included claims that Sears segregated its

female employees into low-paying noncommission sales while men were in high-paying commission
 sales jobs.231 The segregation of Sears's workforce resulted in a tremendous disparity between the

pay scales of its male and female employees, and the purpose of the suit was to open Sears's higher-
paying jobs to women.

         As Chair of the EEOC, Judge Thomas openly criticized his own agency's case against Sears
while it was pending in court. For example, his criticisms were reported in the New York Times:

                  [Thomas] said the agency had relied too heavily on statistics in
                  investigations initiated by the commission itself and in its
                  review of complaints filed by individuals. For example, he said,
                  a case filed by the commission in 1979 against Sears, Roebuck &
                  Company, still pending in a Federal court, 'relies almost exclusively
                  on statistics' to show discrimination against women.132

The Washington Post quoted Thomas as saying, "I've been trying to get out of this [case] since I've
been here [at the EEOC]."253

         Judge Thomas's main criticism of the case was its reliance on statistics. He stated in a

 congressional hearing that the EEOC had relied too much on statistical disparities:
                   I, personally, have problems with cases that rely exclusively on
                   statistics.... I did not say that statistics were not useful.
                   In my opinion at least, we should not rely solely on statistics
                   to process cases.254

 A New York Times, article explained that Thomas believes that statistical disparities can often be
 explained by cultural and educational differences.255

          The press even reported that EEOC officials hoped to lose the case. The Washington Post

 reported that "administration officials privately make little secret of their desire to lose the case, and

 lose it in a way that would explode any chance for future EEOC officials to bring class-action suits on

 calling it "an albatross around our neck," GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE RELATIONS REPORT, June 17, 1985.
      255 N.Y. Times, Dec. 3, 1984.

the basis of statistics."25* That article quoted an unnamed "high-ranking Justice Department official

who has followed the Sears case, but who refused to be quoted publicly," who described the Sears

case as "a 'straw man we would like to have beat to death to prevent future class-action cases' by the
government.*m The Nation reported that "Administration officials have made it clear they'd like
to lose the case to discourage EEOC officials from bringing similar suits."291 Another news article

reported that "[t]he EEOC under President Reagan was only halfheartedly pursuing the Sears

case."*"

Judge Thomas was widely criticized for his public statements about the Sears case. Judge

Thomas was asked by Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D.-Calif.), Chairman of the House Subcommittee

on Employment Opportunities, during a congressional hearing, "Do you think it is appropriate for

you, as Chairman of the Commission, or for the other Commissioners, to be criticizing the
Commission's own case while the case is still before the Court?"30 Judge Thomas responded:

          I did not say that the Sears case was not a winable

          case or a defensible case. I simply indicated that it was

          a case that relies exclusively on statistics. I, personally,

          have problems with cases that rely exclusively on statistics.1*1  ^

ethical obligations as a lawyer by criticizing the case publicly. Disciplinary Rule 7-107(G) of the ABA
Model Code of Professional Responsibility provides:

                    A lawyer or law firm associated with a civil action shall not during its investigation or
                    litigation make or participate in making an extrajudicial statement, other than a quotation

                                         361

Sears lawyers were impressed enough with the helpfulness of his statements to their case that they
attempted to subpoena him to testify at the trial.262

          In fact, EEOC didlose the Sears case, and never appealed. The trial judge criticized the
agency for not calling any individual witnesses, claimed its statistics were faulty and otherwise
asserted that the EEOC failed to present itscase adequately.263 The quoted hopes of some
government officials that EEOC lose the Sears case and no longer bring cases affecting such large
numbers of women were realized.

                                                         CONCLUSION

          Judge Thomas's record includes his actions as chief enforcer of the nation's primary laws
prohibiting discrimination in employment and education and a body of speeches, interviews and
writings. When looked at as a whole, it is not a record in which a commitment to core constitutional
or statutory protections for women emerges. Instead, the overarching constitutional philosophy of
 national law which Judge Thomas has articulated is at odds with equal protection and privacy rights
 for women. His actions as head of OCR and EEOC give no comfort that this philosophy will bend to

                     from or reference to public records, that a reasonable person would expect to be
                     disseminated by means of public communication and that relates to: . . . (4) His opinion

 "The Disciplinary Rules, unlike the Ethical Considerations, are mandatory incharacter. The Disciplinary
 Rules state the minimum level of conduct below which no lawyer can fall without being subject to
 disciplinary action." Id. at 1. This rule would prohibit Judge Thomas's statements about the Sears case
 if held to apply to him, for his statements about the reliance on statistics fall under his "opinion asto the
 merits of the claim."

happen is, just like this cumulative effect upon nominees, there is
going to be a cumulative effect upon witnesses.

   And, Judith, you are getting the cumulative effect of this panel.

utes.

   The CHAIRMAN. All right, I always believe you, so I will believe
you believe it.

                   STATEMENT OF JUDITH L. LICHTMAN

   Ms. LICHTMAN. I respectfully request to submit to you a longer
statement, if you will, and, as well, to put into the record the
report that the Women's Legal Defense Fund did.

   The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.
   Ms. LICHTMAN. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I
come here reluctantly, for it is not easy to testify in opposition to a
judicial nominee. When these hearings opened, it was clear that
the record cast grave doubt on Judge Clarence Thomas' commit-
ment to affirm and support fundamental principles of equal em-
ployment opportunity, constitutional protections against gender
discrimination, and reproductive freedom.

  After 5 days of testimony from the nominee, our alarm has in-
creased. The next U.S. Supreme Court Justice will help determine
the outcome in cases that will affect our lives well into the next
century. Judge Clarence Thomas' record is deeply troubling, be-
cause it includes an extensive pattern of disregard for principles of
fundamental importance to women and their families.

  In his testimony, Judge Thomas has intensified, rather than al-
layed, our concerns. While trying to distance himself from state-
ments and positions articulated during 10 years as a public figure,
Judge Thomas has alternately suggested that his record is not rele-
vant to this inquiry or that he cannot be held to words he did not
mean or to references he did not thoroughly explore. We urge this
committee not to allow Judge Thomas to selectively choose which
portions of his record are relevant to conformation.

  Judge Thomas has tried to use judicial impartiality to justify his
refusal to respond to questions on women's fundamental right to
reproductive choice, while failing to apply the same standard to
other constitutional issues. This tactic blurs the distinction be-
tween prejudging a specific case that may come before the Court
and discussing the constitutional analysis applicable generally in
cases of that type.

   A woman's ability to enjoy all other personal liberties guaran-
teed by the Constitution depends upon her freedom to make per-
sonal decisions about procreation. Judge Thomas' professed lack of
opinion on the constitutional right to choose--particularly in light
of his record--strains credulity.

   But reproductive choice is not the only area in which Judge
Thomas has been less than forthcoming. He did not provide ade-
quate assurance that he is committed to striking down invidious
                                             365

sex-based discrimination, failing to make a commitment to apply a
rigorous level of scrutiny to sex-based distinctions in the law. It is
not clear that this nominee is willing or able to ferret out and
reject stereotypes reflected in the law.

  Under Judge Thomas' leadership, the EEOC failed to prevent
employers from excluding women of child-bearing age from certain
high-paying jobs, because hazards associated with those jobs could
harm their fetuses they might carry. These policies allowed em-
ployers to selectively discriminate against women workers, rather
than cleaning up the workplace for all employees, women and men.
Several women were sterilized, so that they could keep their jobs
under these "forced-sterilization" or "fetal protection" policies. The
analysis finally adopted under Judge Thomas' leadership would
have allowed employers to continue to exclude all fertile women of
child-bearing age from these jobs. Fortunately, the Supreme Court
soundly rejected Judge Thomas' analysis.

  Judge Thomas also has attempted to distance himself from his
praise for academic Thomas Sowell's analysis of working women,
suggesting that he did not necessarily adopt or agree with all of
Sowell's conclusions. Yet, in a 1987 interview, Judge Thomas re-
ferred to Sowell as "not only an intellectual mentor, but my salva-
tion as far as thinking through these issues." This is particularly
significant, because Mr. Sowell's commentary--lauded in 1988 by
Judge Thomas as a "much-needed antidote to cliches about
women"--is riddled with just the sort of stereotypes that the Court
has consistently rejected as constitutionally repugnant.

  Since his nomination, Judge Thomas has abandoned candor and
consistency and offered little real assurance of his commitment to
protecting women's freedom and equality. Judge Thomas either is
running from his record or he has not carefully thought through
critical issues that have enormous significance for Americans.
Either way, it is evident that a lifetime appointment on our High-
est Court for Judge Clarence Thomas would pose a danger to the
economic security and personal freedom of American women.

  The Court's vigilance is needed now more than ever, as gender-
based discrimination still tarnish the American dream. The stakes
simply are too high to entrust our constitutional future to a nomi-
nee like Clarence Thomas, who does not demonstrate unwavering
commitment to the law's essential guarantees of individual rights
and liberties.

  I urge you to refuse to confirm Judge Thomas to the U.S. Su-
preme Court.

  I went over, and I apologize. Thank you.

                              before the United States Senate
                                  Committee on the Judiciary
                                         September 17, 1991

         Chairman Biden and Members of the Committee, my name is
Judith L. Lichtman. As President of the Women's Legal Defense
Fund, I am pleased to have this opportunity to testify before you
on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.

         This nomination comes at a time when women, especially women
of color who face double discrimination based on both gender and
race, are ever more vulnerable to invidious discrimination that
threatens their economic security and personal freedom. With a
Supreme Court that appears poised to roll back the law's most
basic protections of equality and individual liberty, the next
Justice will help determine the outcome of cases that carry
enormous meaning for our lives far into the 21st century.

         The Supreme Court's impact on women's lives is made clear in
Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, where the
Court upheld women's access to equal employment opportunity.
That case centered around the promotion of Diane Joyce to the
position of county road dispatcher -- a position never before
held by a woman. In fact, no woman had ever held any of the
county's 238 skilled positions. As part of a voluntary effort to
bring qualified women into its skilled workforce, the county
promoted Ms. Joyce, the only woman in a pool of seven persons

         1 480 U.S. 616 (1987).
                                     367

judged qualified on the basis of experience and an oral

interview. A male candidate who had scored 75 to her 7 3 in a

subjective oral interview filed suit. When the Court upheld the

county's plan to expand equal employment opportunity to qualified

women and people of color, it demonstrated its power to extend --
                                                         2

or deny -- such opportunity.

         Because the Court exerts life-shaping force on millions of

Americans, the record of each and every nominee must be carefully

examined. Despite Judge Thomas' impressive personal

achievements, his record reveals an extensive pattern of

disregard for principles of fundamental importance to women and

their families. As we have documented in our report, Endangered

Liberties: What Judge Thomas' Record Portends for Women, Judge

Thomas' record suggests that the prism through which he views the

legal claims of women is clouded by an ideology that

misinterprets, restricts, or ignores legal principles of the

greatest importance. We ask that this report be included in the

 record of these confirmation hearings.

             2

              Judge Thomas harshly criticized the Court's decision as
 "social engineering" and urged lower courts to look to Justice
 Scalia's dissent for guidance. "Anger and Elation at Ruling at
 Affirmative Action," N.Y. Times, March 29, 1987, at Dl, col. 1;
 Thomas, Speech before the Cato Institute, April 23, 1987, at 20-
 21. In fact, the county's program appears remarkably similar to
 the program under which Judge Thomas was admitted to Yale Law
 School. Both involved the consideration of race and/or gender in
 choosing among qualified applicants competing for a limited
 number of openings; both operated within the framework of federal
 anti-discrimination law (Title VII, which bars race- and sex-
 based discrimination in employment, and Title VI, which prohibits

        Judge Thomas' record alone leaves us unwilling to entrust
our constitutional future to his care; five days of his testimony
during these hearings has done nothing to allay our concerns.
Indeed, Judge Thomas' efforts to distance himself from his record
of the past 10 years as a public figure suggests either that he
believes that this record is not relevant to the Senate's inquiry
or that he believes he cannot be held to his words and writings
because he did not mean them or did not read them. He has
refused to discuss the issue of constitutional protection of
reproductive choice, despite his willingess to discuss other
pressing constitutional questions. And, when he has responded to
questions of critical importance to women -- such as
constitutional protections against sex discrimination -- his
answers have provided little reassurance.

Judge Thomas has attempted to retreat from his record during
these confirmation hearings.

         Throughout his 10 years as a public official. Judge Thomas
has delivered speeches, written articles, and signed onto reports
discussing issues of the greatest concern to women, in particular
women of color, and their families. Despite Judge Thomas'
attempts to distance himself from this record throughout these
hearings, we submit that this record can not be so easily
dismissed.

         In numerous speeches and articles, Judge Thomas has
reiterated his support for a "higher law" or "natural rights"
                                  369

theory of constitutional law. He maintained in 1988, for

example, that

         [H]igher law is the only alternative to the willfulness
         of both run-amok majorities and run-amok judges. . . .
         The higher law background of the American Constitution,
         whether explicitly invoked or not, provides the only
         firm basis for a just, wise, and constitutional
         decision.

            Judge Thomas now says that his numerous references to

natural law theory were not intended to suggest that he believed

that it should be used as a form of constitutional analysis, and

that he sees no "role for the use of natural law in

constitutional adjudication." Rather he dismisses his

extensive writings and speeches as nothing more than the musings

of a "part-time political theorist."

         Another example of Judge Thomas' efforts to retreat from his

record concerns his 1987 praise for an article by Lewis Lehrman

as "a splendid example of applying natural law." The article

urged that Roe v. Wade was incorrectly decided and that the

              Thomas, "The Higher Law Background of the Privileges or
Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment," 12 Harvard
journal of Law & Public Policy 63, 64, 68 (1988) (emphasis in
original). Our concerns about natural law jurisprudence are
premised on the possibility that cases will be decided on the
basis of judges' personal beliefs and intuitions -- beliefs that
Judge Thomas was often unwilling to discuss during these
hearings.

Constitution affirmatively protects the "right to life."6

During these hearings Judge Thomas sought to distance himself

from the Lehrman article by explaining that he praised it only to

win over his audience of conservatives -- not because he

actually believed what he was saying about it.

         Judge Thomas' comments on his authorship of a 1986 report

offer still another example of his attempted retreat from his

record during these confirmation hearings. Judge Thomas served

on the 1986 White House Working Group on the Family, which

produced a report sharply critical of Roe v. Wade and other

Supreme Court decisions protecting the right of privacy,

including the right of unmarried individuals to buy and use
                              g

contraceptives. Although his name appears on the report as

              "My interest [in citing the Lehrman article] was a very

to make my point, and it was an important point to me."

one of its authors, he now testifies that he never read the
controversial portions of the report at any time.

        At other times in these hearings, Judge Thomas has argued
that his record as a public figure is now largely irrelevant to
this inquiry to his fitness for the Supreme Court. It should
be of great concern to members of this Committee and to the
American public that the White House wants us to look favorably
on the personal background of Judge Thomas, while dismissing or
discounting his actions and statements during 10 years as a
public official. If confirmed. Judge Thomas will bring the
entire range of his experiences and beliefs to bear on his
deliberations in the Court. The Senate should not accept his
attempt to pick and choose for these confirmation hearings which
portions of his record are relevant for consideration in
evaluating his fitness for the Court.

               "The Chairman: You haven't to this moment read that
 report?

                  Judge Thomas: To this day, I have not read that

               E.g., as Judge Thomas advised Senator Kohl, "I think
 that you have to weigh or discount to the best of your abilities
 or your judgment speeches that were made outside of the judiciary
when one has a different role, for example a person who's a law
 professor, a person who's in the executive branch. But I think
 it would be important to look closely at a speech that I made as
 a judge." Transcript, 9/13/91 p.m.

Judge Thomas refused to respond to critical questions on the
consitutional right to privacy, including a woman's right to
choose whether to terminate or continue her pregnancy.

        Judge Thomas asks this Committee, the Senate, and the

American public to support his nomination while refusing to

provide assurances that he will protect our rights if elevated to

the Court. Nowhere is this more clear than in Judge Thomas

refusal to respond to questions about his views on the

constitutional right of privacy. What is at stake here is not

mere theoretical principle -- the lives, health, and livelihoods

of millions of women and their families hang in the balance.

         Judge Thomas professes to have an open mind on the

constitutional protection afforded the right to terminate a

pregnancy. But in the years before this nomination, he

expressed opinions critical of Roe v. Wade and other Supreme

                                                                                                13

Court decisions involving the right of privacy. Indeed, as

discussed above. Judge Thomas endorsed an anti-choice diatribe
             See e.g., Transcript, 9/11/91 p.m. at 105:

         "Senator Leahy: Let me ask you this. Have you made any
decision in your own mind whether you feel Roe y. Wade was
properly decided or not, without stating what that decision is?

         Judge Thomas: I have not made. Senator, a decision one way
or another with respect to that important decision."

          13

             See Thomas, "The Higher Law Background of the Privileges
or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment," 12 Harvard

Rights as a Principle Versus Civil Rights as an Interest,"

that concluded that the fetus has a "God-given" "inalienable
right to life."14

        Now, despite that record. Judge Thomas asks this Committee
to believe not only that he has an open mind about the right to
choose, but that he actually has no opinion on the issue. In
response to questions from Senator Leahy, Judge Thomas stated
that in the 18 years since Roe v. Wade was decided, he has never
debated the case or formed an opinion about what he even
acknowledged is "one of the more important" and "one of the more
highly publicized and debated cases." Judge Thomas' professed
lack of opinion -- particularly when viewed in the context of his
record -- strains credulity.

         In refusing to answer questions about Roe, Judge Thomas hid

                                                                                        18

behind the mantle of judicial impartiality. This tactic blurs
the distinction between prejudging a specific case involving
specific facts that may come before the Court, and commenting on
the constitutional standards applicable generally in cases of
that type. Indeed, Judge Thomas' testimony on other cases that
present issues that will come before the Court shows that his

             See e.g., Transcript, 9/10/91 p.m. at 149: "I do not

 think that at this time that I could maintain my impartiality as
 a member of the judiciary and comment on that specific case [Roe
v. Wade]."

                                  374

professed concerns about impartiality were selectively
applied. In adopting this strategy of selective silence.
Judge Thomas assumes that the Committee will not view his failure
to respond to questions on privacy and choice as significant.

        Would the Senate Judiciary Committee confirm a Supreme Court
nominee who trumpets his or her open-mindedness on the issue of
whether segregated schools violate the Fourteenth Amendment's
guarantee of equal protection? Of course not. The idea of
confirming a nominee who does not firmly support such a
sacrosanct legal principle is unthinkable.

         The fundamental principles articulated in Roe are as
critical as those spelled out in Brown. A woman's ability to
enjoy all other personal liberties guaranteed by the Constitution
hinges upon her freedom to make personal decisions about
procreation. This Committee should reject any nominee who fails
to affirm the right to choose just as it should, and would,
reject a nominee who failed to affirm the constitutional
principles enunciated in Brown. As Chief Justice Rehnquist
recognized in 1959, in the wake of the Brown decision, "what
could have been more important to the Senate [in 1957] than Mr.
Justice Whittaker's views on equal protection and due process?
 ...The only way for the Senate to learn of these sympathies is to

their views on these questions.1"

To the extent that Judge Thomas responded to questions on
constitutional equal protection theory, his answers provided
inadequate assurances of his commitment to strike down invidious
sex-based discrimination.

         In refusing to answer any questions on abortion or
constitutional protections of reproductive freedom -- while
responding to other questions about unsettled areas of the law --
Judge Thomas has abandoned candor and consistency. This creates
a double standard that works against any commitment to
protections of women's freedom and equality. At the same time.
Judge Thomas would have us believe that he has isolated
reproductive choice as the only area of critical importance to
women about which he was not forthcoming. Such is not the case.

         For example. Judge Thomas' discussion of equal protection
analysis failed to provide adequate assurances of his commitment
to the Constitution's most basic protections against sex
discrimination: the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. This is the primary constitutional source of equality
for women; the Supreme Court has consistently used it to strike
down sex-based distinctions in the law that are based on "archaic

                                                   19
and stereotypic notions."

        Judge Thomas appeared at first blush to offer satisfactory

assurances that he supports the Court's equal protection analysis

of constitutional claims of sex discrimination. For example.

Judge Thomas told Senator DeConcini: "I have no reason and had

no reason to question or disagree with the three-tier

                                           Ml

approach" and "I do accept this structure of the three-tier
test."21

        Upon careful review, though, his claims fall short of a

commitment to apply a rigorous level of scrutiny to sex-based

distinctions in the law. As he told Senator DeConcini later in

the hearings,
        I think that it's important that when I don't know
        where I stand on something or I haven't reviewed it in
        detail, that it's best for me to -- to take a step back
        and say 'I have no reason to disagree with it' rather
        than saying 'I adopt it as mine.'

This makes clear that, absent explicit assurances, Judge Thomas'

testimony on equal protection analysis cannot be construed as an

actual commitment to apply such analysis to constitutional

claims. Without such a commitment, women are left vulnerable to

invidious sex discrimination.

             With the departure of Justice Marshall, only four
sitting Justices (Justices Blackmun, O'Connor, Stevens, and
white) are on record as applying heightened scrutiny analysis to
constitutional claims of sex discrimination. Chief Justice
Rehnquist has generally been hostile to heightened scrutiny.
E.g., Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718,
742 (1982) (Powell, J., and Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Craig v.

                                                                ll
                                   377

        Nor did Judge Thomas provide any assurances that he would
apply equal protection analysis free of stereotypic notions about
women that too often work to limit their lives and opportunities.
As Justice O'Connor has made clear, the Court must apply its test
"free of fixed notions concerning the roles and abilities of
males and females," and must reject classifications that
"reflect[] archaic and stereotypic notions."24 For example, the
Court rejected such stereotypes in striking down statutes that
provided Aid to Families with Dependent Children to families when
the father became unemployed, but not when the mother lost her
job -- a statute based on the stereotype that the wages of
fathers, but not mothers, are essential to families' economic
security.

         Judge Thomas' responses in no way made clear that he is
willing or able to ferret out and reject such stereotypes when
reflected in the law. For example, in 1988 Judge Thomas lauded
academic Thomas Sowell's analysis of working women as "a much-
needed antidote to cliches about women's earnings and

Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 217 (1976) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (both
 arguing that gender-based classifications need only pass under
 "rational basis" scrutiny). Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Souter
have not yet addressed any sex-based equal protection challenge,
 so their positions remain unknown.

 742 (1982).

                                  378

professional status." Yet Sowell's commentary is riddled with

just the sort of stereotypes that the Court has consistently

rejected as constitutionally repugnant. For example, Sowell

wrote that
        What are called 'traditional1 women's jobs are often
         jobs which meet other specific requirements that make
         sense to women -- slow obsolescence rates, adjustable
         hours, and less demand for physical strength are just a
         few examples. Where particular jobs are especially
         attractive to particular groups, those jobs are likely
         to have the^r pay held down by the competition of many
         applicants.

         During these hearings Judge Thomas attempted to downplay his

praise for Sowell's analysis of working women, suggesting that he

did not necessarily adopt or agree with all of Sowell's
                        28

conclusions. Yet in a 1987 interview, Judge Thomas referred

to Sowell as "not only an intellectual mentor but my
                    29

salvation" when discussing discrimination issues. Judge

Thomas also failed to identify the "cliches" to which Mr.

Sowell's commentary -- which concludes that sex-based inequities

in pay and career advancement stem from women's own choices and

behavior -- provided an "antidote."

         Nor was Judge Thomas willing to refute during these hearings

         Judge Thomas' failure to recognize and reject dangerous

stereotyping statements casts serious doubts about his commitment
to apply equal protection analysis free of fixed notions about
women's roles and abilities, as the Court's constitutional
jurisprudence requires.

Conclusion
         Judge Thomas' record casts grave doubt about his commitment

to affirm and support fundamental principles of equal employment
opportunity, constitutional protections against gender
discrimination, and reproductive freedom. This record should not
 be ignored -- instead, it must be part of this Committee's
determination of his fitness to serve on the Supreme Court.

         Judge Thomas' responses to this Committee have failed to
 assuage our concerns. He has endeavored to distance himself
 during these five days of testimony from statements and positions
 he has articulated during the past 10 years as a public figure.
 He has refused to respond to questions on women's fundamental
 right to reproductive choice on grounds of judicial impartiality,

               Sowell, Civil Rights at 92. Indeed, Judge Thomas
 remarked only that "I can't say whether or not women are
 attracted or not attracted to those areas. I think that is a
 normative comment there." Transcript, 9/11/91 a.m. at 65-66.

although he failed to invoke the same doctrine in responding to
inquiries involving other pressing constitutional issues. And
his reponses to questions on constitutional protections against
gender discrimination failed to provide adequate assurance of his
commitment to strike down invidious sex-based discrimination.

         The Court's vigilance is needed now more than ever, as
gender- and race-based discrimination still tarnish the American
dream. The stakes are too high to entrust our constitutional
future to any nominee who does not demonstrate unwavering
commitment to the law's essential guarantees of individual rights
and liberties. Judge Thomas' testimony reaffirms our opposition
to his confirmation. Either he is running from his record, which
strains credulity, or he has not carefully thought through
critical issues carrying enormous significance for the lives of
Americans. Either way. Judge Thomas should not be confirmed.

                                           EXECUTIVE SUKE&RT
         The Supreme Court and our nation are at a crossroads. This
is a time when women, especially women of color who face double
discrimination based on both gender and race, are ever more
vulnerable to invidious discrimination that threatens their
economic security and personal freedom. The Court is poised to
roll back the law's most basic protections of equality and
individual liberty. At this critical time the judicial
philosophy -- the principles that inform legal analysis -- of
each Justice will determine the outcome of cases that carry
enormous meaning for^ our lives far into the 21st century.

                                        t i
         This report analyzes Judge Clarence Thomas' record in
three key areas of particular concern to women: equal employment
opportunity, constitutional protections against gender
discrimination, and reproductive freedom. After reviewing Judge
Thomas' words and actions, the Women's Legal Defense Fund finds
in his record a disturbing pattern of disregard for these most
fundamental principles.
         First. Judge Thomas' record as leader of the agency charged
with enforcing the nation's laws prohibiting employment discrimi-
nation is deeply troubling. It reveals a predilection to
interpret restrictively equal opportunity laws that have proven
essentiax to the economic security of working women and their
families. While chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (EEOC), Judge Thomas too often worked to deny equal
employment opportunity -- even as he was sworn to enforce the
                                     385

nation's laws designed to expand such opportunity. For example,

he stripped or attempted to strip the agency of several of its

most effective tools for enforcing federal anti-discrimination

law:

          As EEOC chair, Judge Thomas retreated from the proven
                  and effective enforcement strategy of systemic
                  litigation, while individual victims of discrimination
                  too often received no remedy at all;

          Judge Thomas attacked affirmative action as a strategy
                  in battling on-the-job discrimination, despite its
                  proven effectiveness and repeated affirmation by the
                  Supreme Court; and

          Judge Thomas proposed to weaken federal guidelines that
                  set standards for employee selection practices in
                  contravention of prevailing law.

         As EEOC chair, Judge Thomas also:

          refused to perform his duty as required by law to
                  enforce and evaluate anti-discrimination efforts by the
                  federal- government;

          failed to enforce the law against sex discrimination to
                  ban employment practices that exclude all women of
                  child-bearing age from certain high-paying jobs;

          failed to challenge gender-based wage discrimination
                  under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act; and

          failed to enforce federal age discrimination law --
                  letting the claims of thousands of older workers
                  lapse -- and took policy positions against the
                  interests of the older workers he was sworn to protect.

         Second. Judge Thomas' views of constitutional rights,

articulated over more than 10 years as a public figure, reveal an

allegiance to a judicial philosophy that could prove inimical to

and inconsistent with the rights of women. For example, his oft-

expressed support for jurisprudence based on a theory of "natural
                                      386

rights" raises substantial concern about his adherence to the

Constitution's most basic guarantees against sex discrimination:

          Judge Thomas' seeming indifference to the Equal
                  Protection Clause is troubling, as the Equal Protection
                  Clause has been interpreted as the primary source of
                  constitutional protections against sex discrimination;

          Judge Thomas has not stated how or whether he would
                  apply a natural rights analysis to sex discrimination;
                  historically, though, natural law principles have been
                  used to limit the lives and opportunities of women; and

          Judge Thomas has embraced an analysis of the status of
                  working women that denies the reality of discrimination
                  they face and its effects on their economic security
                  and individual opportunity.

         Third. Judge Thomas' record contains strong indications that

he opposes the constitutional right to privacy that includes a

woman's right to reproductive freedom:

          Judge Thomas praised as a "splendid example of applying
                  natural law" an article arguing not only that Roe v.
                  Wade was wrongly decided but that the Constitution
                  affirmatively protects the fetus' "right to life";

          Judge Thomas served on the 1986 White House Working
                  Group on the Family, which authored a report sharply
                  criticizing Roe and other Supreme Court decisions
                  protecting the right of privacy; and

          In other writings, Judge Thomas criticized Roe and even
                  Griswold v. Connecticut, the case protecting the
                  fundamental right of married couples to use
                  contraceptives.

         Taken as a whole, Judge Thomas' words and actions reveal a

pattern of judgment and legal analysis that we find deeply

troubling. We fear that the prism through which he views the

legal claims of women, especially women of color, and

disadvantaged people is clouded by an ideology that
                                  387

misinterprets, ignores, or restricts legal principles of the
greatest importance. In short, we believe that his record raises
significant questions about his fitness for a lifetime
appointment to the Supreme Court, the last bastion for justice
and the protection of constitutional rights and liberties for all
Americans.

                INTRODUCTION: THE CURRENT CLIMATE ON THE COURT

         The loss of Justice Thurgood Marshall as a key voice for

equality and individual dignity leaves a void that must be filled

with the greatest care. Careful scrutiny of any nominee to the

Court is thus essential if our nation is to live up to its

aspirations of "liberty and justice for all." The stakes are too

high to entrust our constitutional future to any nominee who does

not demonstrate unwavering commitment to the law's essential

guarantees of individual rights and liberties.

         Indeed, recent evidence confirms that the Court's vigilance

in this area is needed now more than ever, as gender- and race-

based discrimination still tarnish the American dream. For

example:

          A recent General Accounting Office study on federally
sponsored job training programs found that 20 percent of the
programs discriminated against women and blacks. Some complied
with employers' requests for white applicants only.; others
provided women and blacks with less classroom training and
steered them towards lower-wage jobs.1

          Women of color suffer the economic effects of double
discrimination. Economist Marilyn Power of Sarah Lawrence
College found that black women are still frequently trapped in
low-wage jobs: in 1989, 27.3 percent of employed black women
were in low-paying service occupations, as compared to 16.1
percent of white women.2

          A 1991 study by The Urban Institute examined racial
discrimination in hiring by charting the relative success of
black and white men in the hiring processes of randomly-selected
private-sector jobs. When pairs of men who were matched in all
characteristics other than race -- age, speech, education, work
experience, demeanor, and physical build -- applied for the same
job, whites advanced farther than blacks 20 percent of the time;
blacks advanced farther than whites only seven percent of the
time. Whites received a job offer 15 percent of the time,
compared to five percent for blacks.3

        As another recent study has found, "setting a tone that

condemns acts of bias and hatred will, in fact, discourage
them."4 Psychologists at Smith College found that people are

encouraged to express anti-racist opinions after hearing others

voice similar views. Those who hear opinions that condone racism

are more likely to support or only weakly condemn racist

incidents. These experts conclude that "[i]f national authori-

ties were more vocal in disapproving of prejudice, you'd have
less of it."5 Such findings underscore the need for strong

leadership from the Supreme Court in refusing to tolerate illegal

discrimination.

         In a cast of only nine players, every member of the Court

plays an important role. The dynamics of this small body that

must reach all its decisions by majority are dramatically

affected by each new appointment. Even if this Court's decisions

on important issues of our day are increasingly predictable, what

the decisions say and how they say it are not at all certain.
Indeed, the Court's underlying reasoning and analysis set
precedents for future cases that are just as important as
identifying the winning and losing parties. Thus, each case is
shaped by the approach of a new Justice.

         Because the Rehnquist Court has moved farther to the right
in recent years, we believe the margin by which cases are decided
has also become increasingly important: the closer the case, the
narrower the opinion because Justices are less willing to extend
their reasoning beyond the fact situation at hand. On the other
hand, comfortable 7-2 margins free the Court to write far more
sweeping opinions, unrestrained by the need to accommodate a
hesitant member of a shaky coalition. Without diversity of
viewpoint among members of the Court, the Rehnquist majority will
be even more emboldened to produce aggressively conservative
opinions.

         Indeed, just such aggressiveness provoked an ominous warning
from Justice Marshall in his final opinion. His words speak
eloquently about why we must care about his successor. In his
dissenting opinion in Pavne v. Tennessee.6 Justice Marshall
warned that the Court had launched a "far-reaching assault upon
this Court's precedents" and that in so doing, the majority
"sends a clear signal that essentially all decisions implementing

         6 59 U.S.L.W. 4814 (U.S. June 25, 1991) (No. 90-5721).

the personal liberties protected by the Bill of Rights and the
Fourteenth Amendment are open to reexamination."7

         It becomes clear from reading the Chief Justice's majority
opinion in Payne why Justice Marshall was so alarmed. The Chief
Justice declared that the Court's principle of adhering to its
own precedent is strongest in cases involving property and
contract rights, weakest in cases involving the Constitution or
procedural and evidentiary rules.8 By applying Chief Justice
Rehnquist's additional criterion for overruling -- that a case
either was decided or reaffirmed by a 5-4 margin "over spirited
dissenft]"9 -- it becomes clear that this Court is poised to
alter some of the most important rulings of the past. The
victims of such revisions are likely to be women, especially
women of color, and disadvantaged people.

         Justice Marshall was so disturbed by the Court's shift that
he compiled an "endangered precedents" list. This list includes
Metro Broadcasting v. FCC.10 Justice Brennan's final opinion in
which five members of the Court upheld affirmative action
programs for minority broadcasters; and Thornburgh v. American

College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.11 which reaffirmed
the right to abortion recognized in Roe v. Wade.12

         Given this inclement judicial climate, next term's docket
provides fertile ground for the Rehnquist Court to assault civil
rights, social welfare, and reproductive freedom. The Court
already has agreed to hear two cases challenging the government's
role in eradicating the vestiges of race-based segregation.
Freeman v. Pitts13 involves the desegregation policies of the
DeKalb County, Georgia, public schools, which were formerly
segregated by law and have been under federal court supervision
since the 1960s. The county argues that it should no longer be
forced to operate under a court decree -- even though segregation
has been perpetuated in its schools. The other case, United
States v. Mabus.14 concerns a Department of Justice challenge
to Mississippi's state university system, which remains almost
completely segregated by race. Mississippi claims (and a lower
federal court agreed) that the state has done all it needs to do.
In each case, the Court will decide whether the governmental

entity has met its constitutional obligation to dismantle

segregated public institutions.15

         Even more ominous, the Court may soon choose to reconsider

the critical 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Indeed, no fewer than

four laws may provide the test case for overturning Roe;

          Pennsylvania's anti-choice law, enacted in 1989,
         is furthest along in the federal appeals process.
         Pennsylvania's statute was found unconstitutional by a
         federal district court in 1990. The invalidated
         provisions include a 24-hour waiting period, husband
         notification, mandatory "counseling," and "informed"
         parental consent;

          Guam's 1990 law prohibits abortions except when
         two physicians determine that there is a substantial
         risk that continuing the pregnancy would endanger the
         woman's life or gravely impair her health. A federal
         district court found the statute unconstitutional;

          Utah's statute, enacted in January 1991, bans
         abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or in
         situations where the woman's life is in danger, there
         would be grave damage to the woman's medical health, or
         the fetus has grave defects. The state delayed
         enforcement of the statute until a federal district
         court rules on its constitutionality; and

          Louisiana's 1991 law is the most restrictive in
         the country, outlawing abortion except in cases of
         rape, incest, or to save the woman's life. Any doctor
         who performs an illegal abortion may be imprisoned for
         up to 10 years and liable for a $100,000 fine. Trial
         in district court is scheduled for August; many predict
         that the case will be quickly shepherded through the
         appeals process to come before the Supreme Court next
         term.

               Another case that the Court will hear in the coming term
directly affects women's ability to challenge sex discrimination
by educational institutions. In Franklin v. Gwinnett County
Public Schools. 911 F.2d 617 (11th Cir. 1990), cert, granted. 59
U.S.L.W. 3823 (U.S. June 10, 1991) (No. 90-918), the Court will
decide whether victims of sex discrimination in education can
recover damages for those violations under Title IX.

            Presaging a willingness to reject the constitutional right
to an abortion, the Court this year upheld a ban on abortion
counseling at federally-funded health clinics in Rust v.
Sullivan.16 Justices Rehnquist, White, Scalia, and Kennedy
appear prepared to overrule Roe. It is less clear how Justice
O'Connor or Justice Souter would vote. With Justice Marshall's
departure, only two Justices remain who fully support the Roe
decision -- Justice Stevens and its author, Justice Blackmun.
Perhaps no other area of the law will be as significantly shaped
by the next Justice as the constitutional right to privacy.

         Clearly, millions of women will be affected by the next
Court's rulings in this and other areas critical to women's
lives, opportunities, and autonomy. The Rehnquist Court's
unbridled willingness -- indeed eagerness -- to overturn
precedent in the area of personal liberties will either be
encouraged or restrained by the next appointment to the Court.

         In the remainder of this report, we review Judge Thomas'
record on these questions. Unfortunately, as this review shows,
his record suggests a nominee who is actively hostile to the
law's guarantees of "liberty and justice" for all.

                                 EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
         In 1982, President Reagan appointed Clarence Thomas as chair
of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the agency
charged with enforcing federal laws that prohibit employment
discrimination on the basis of sex, race, national origin,
religion, and age. The EEOC also coordinates all equal
employment programs in the federal workplace.
         Judge Thomas1 overall record at the EEOC casts doubt on his
commitment to broad interpretations and aggressive enforcement of
legal protections against employment discrimination, including
those proven extremely effective in translating the dream of
equal opportunity into reality for women, especially women of
color.
         Throughout his eight-year tenure as EEOC chair, Judge Thomas
frequently attempted to narrow basic principles and mechanisms of
anti-discrimination law. And he too often allowed his opinions
to override his obligation to adhere to established law and legal
doctrine. Further, Judge Thomas stripped or attempted to strip
the agency of several of its most effective tools for enforcing
federal anti-discrimination law:
          As EEOC chair, Judge Thomas retreated from the proven

                  and effective enforcement strategy of systemic
                  litigation, while individual victims of discrimination
                  too often received no remedy at all;
          Judge Thomas attacked the use of affirmative action as
                  a strategy in battling on-the-job discrimination,
                 despite its proven effectiveness and repeated
                 affirmation by the Supreme Court; and

          Judge Thomas proposed to weaken federal guidelines that
                  set standards for employee selection practices in
                  contravention of prevailing law.

         As EEOC chair, Judge Thomas also:
          refused to perform his duty as required by law to

                  enforce and evaluate anti-discrimination efforts by the
                  federal government;
          failed to enforce the law against sex discrimination to
                  ban employment practices that exclude all women of
                  child-bearing age from certain high-paying jobs;
          failed to challenge gender-based wage discrimination
                  under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act; and
          failed to enforce federal age discrimination law --
                  letting the claims of thousands of older workers
                  lapse -- and took policy positions against the
                  interests of the older workers he was sworn to protect.
Each of these concerns is discussed more fully below.

As EEOC chair. Judge Thomas retreated from the proven and
effective enforcement strategy of systemic litigation, while
individual victims of discrimination too often received no remedy
at all.

           In many contexts, discrimination is system-wide,
infiltrating an entire institution or industry. Strategic class-
based legal action is thus required to attack effectively
practices that harm large numbers of women, especially women of
color, and disadvantaged people. Systemic litigation not only
provides meaningful remedies for the victims of discrimination,
but also deters continued discrimination by employers. Because
systemic litigation is often beyond the resources of most private
individuals and attorneys, Congress has authorized the EEOC to

                                                         13
                                     397

attack broad institutional patterns and practices of
discrimination through systemic litigation.17

         The extraordinary effectiveness of "systemic," or "class
action," litigation was demonstrated by the recent settlement
agreement between the EEOC and AT&T. Filed in 1978, EEOC's
lawsuit challenged the pregnancy leave policies of Western
Electric (the manufacturing arm of AT&T until the 1980s) and
covered the thousands of employees who became pregnant between
1965 and 1977. The employer's policies discriminated against
women by requiring pregnant women to take unpaid leave at the end
of their sixth or seventh month of pregnancy, regardless of their
ability and willingness to continue working; by providing
pregnant workers on leave only limited credit towards seniority
while male employees on disability leave received full credit;
and by offering no guarantee of a job upon return from leave.
The 1991 settlement provided $66 million to compensate 13,000
women; the size and scope of the settlement no doubt sends a
clear warning to employers across the country. It is nearly
impossible to imagine each of these 13,000 victims of
discrimination successfully pursuing her claim individually.

         Despite the proven effectiveness of class action litigation,
Judge Thomas criticized the EEOC's historic reliance on it and
reduced the resources devoted to it, apparently causing a drastic
reduction in the number of such cases brought by the agency.

Since 1982, the number of attorneys in the litigation unit
created to challenge systemic discrimination was reduced by about
half. And the "early litigation identification" system, which
had been instituted to identify potential systemic cases for
litigation, was eliminated.18

         It is thus not surprising that, while the EEOC filed a total
of 218 class action lawsuits in fiscal year 1980, the number of
such suits plummeted under Judge Thomas1 leadership. During
fiscal year 1989, the last full year of Judge Thomas1
chairmanship, the EEOC filed only 129 class action suits.19

         Judge Thomas justified this dramatic reduction by claiming ^
that an "emphasis on 'systemic' suits led the Commission [prior
to his appointment] to overlook many of the individuals who came
to our offices to file charges and seek assistance."20 He
expressed preference for enforcing individual discrimination
claims over attacking systemic discrimination. However, he
failed to acknowledge that individual victims of discrimination
-- such as the 13,000 victims of pregnancy discrimination at AT&T
who were awarded $66 million -- are the beneficiaries of class

action litigation.21 And, while any effective enforcement

effort must naturally address both systemic and individual claims

of discrimination, the EEOC under Judge Thomas did little of

either.

          Despite Judge Thomas' strong rhetoric, individual victims of

discrimination were unlikely to receive any remedy during his

tenure as EEOC chair. In fact, the EEOC under his leadership saw

a sharp decline in the rate of remedies for individual

claimants -- settlement rates plunged from 32.1 percent in fiscal
year 1980 to 13.9 percent in fiscal year 1989.22

          Moreover, the percentage of cases where the individual

claimant received no remedy at all (classified as "no cause")

nearly doubled under Judge Thomas, from 28.5 percent in 1980 to
54.2 percent in 1989.23 Research shows that this sharp

increase was due not to an increase in unsubstantiated charges
filed, but rather to inadequate investigation.24 In other

          2 1 It is true that the agency steadily increased the number
of cases it filed in court to 486 in FY 1989, up from 326 in FY
1980. The number includes class action and individual lawsuits
filed. Women Employed Institute, EEOC Enforcement Statistics
(1991). Thus the number of cases filed on behalf of individual
claimants increased under Judge Thomas, but at the expense of
class action litigation that can potentially compensate hundreds
and even thousands of individual victims per suit -- as the AT&T
case illustrates.

words, more than half of those workers who took the not

inconsiderable "time, effort, and risk to file charges against an

employer they believe[d] to be discriminatory" saw their claims

dismissed by the EEOC under Judge Thomas' leadership -- generally

without adequate investigation.25

         Indeed, Judge Thomas' EEOC policies all too often created

barriers to claims of discrimination by individuals. For

example, as will be discussed in greater detail below, thousands

of individual claims of age discrimination, including those made

by working women, lapsed during Judge Thomas' tenure at the EEOC,

so that individual workers were stripped of their right to pursue

their claims in court. Coupled with the retreat from systemic

agencies between January and March 1987. The GAO study revealed
that 41 to 82 percent of the charges closed by the EEOC offices
were not fully investigated, and 40 to 87 percent' of those closed
by state agencies were not fully investigated. The GAO
identified several factors contributing to the incomplete
investigations: a perception by staff investigators that the
Commission was more interested in reducing the backlog than full
investigation; disagreement as to full investigation
requirements; and inadequate monitoring of state investigations.

litigation, the EEOC's poor record in responding to the claims of
individual victims of discrimination drastically reduced the
prevalence of meaningful remedies for discrimination under Judge
Thomas. If Judge Thomas is elevated to the Supreme Court, this
record augurs poorly for the claims of discrimination victims
that will be considered by the Court in the future.

Judge Thomas attacked the use off affirmative action as a strategy
in battling on-the-iob discrimination, despite its proven
effectiveness and repeated affirmation bv the Supreme Court.

         Without question, strong and effective remedies are
necessary to eradicate the long legacy of discriminatory
workplace practices that deny employment opportunities to women,
especially women of color, and disadvantaged people. Affirmative
action is among the most effective of the various strategies
designed to remedy unlawful discrimination and expand equal
opportunity. For this reason, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 specifically authorizes courts to order affirmative
action as a remedy when employers have violated the law.26

        Although a variety of measures could be considered
"affirmative action," the term most often refers to court-ordered
or voluntary action that takes gender or race into account to
provide meaningful opportunities for qualified women and people
of color. Generally, these criteria are numerical "goals and

timetables" -- goals for training, hiring, assigning, or

promoting qualified women and people of color; and timetables for
achieving these goals.27 The concept of "goals and timetables"

was first introduced by the Department of Labor's Office of
Federal Contract Compliance in the 1960s.28 Goals and

timetables were further incorporated into the affirmative action

required of federal contractors by the Department of Labor under
President Richard Nixon.29

         Courts have repeatedly taken gender and/or race into account

when fashioning remedies for unlawful discrimination. On many

occasions, they have also approved voluntary efforts to correct

historical imbalances in education, employment, and access to

business opportunities. These efforts have played a crucial role

in eliminating the effects of discrimination.

         For example, the affirmative action required of federal

contractors -- when effectively enforced -- provides a tremendous

tool for expanding employment opportunities for women and people

of color. In the late 1970s, the Office of Federal Contract

         27 These goals are set with reference to the availability
of qualified women or people of color in the relevant labor pool.
Affirmative action programs with goals and timetables never
require the hiring or promotion of unqualified people. To the
contrary, hiring or promoting unqualified people is an abuse of
affirmative action principles.

Compliance Programs (OFCCP) targeted the coal mining industry for

enforcement focus, achieving dramatic gains in women's

employment. Although no women were employed in the coal mining

industry in 1973, by December 1980, 3,295 women were so
employed.30 Similarly, the OFCCP's targeting of the banking

industry encouraged steady improvement in hiring and promotion

practices. In 1970, 17.6 percent of bank officials and financial

managers were women; by 1981 that had more than doubled to 38
percent.31

          Despite the proven effectiveness of this affirmative action

program, in 1985 EEOC Chair Thomas joined Edwin Meese, William

Bradford Reynolds, and other White House officials in attempting
to eliminate these affirmative action requirements.32 Though

ultimately unsuccessful, Judge Thomas' efforts to undermine this

program demonstrate the degree to which he was willing to
sacrifice effective enforcement tools.33

          33 Interestingly, at the beginning of his tenure at the
EEOC, Judge Thomas seemed to recognize the importance of
affirmative action as a tool in achieving equal employment
opportunity. An example of this support appears in his answer to
an interviewer's question:

                                                                20
                                      404

         On other occasions, Judge Thomas expressed his opposition to
affirmative action as a remedy. For example, Judge Thomas-
announced in November 1984 that the EEOC would be "moving away
from goals and proportional representation in both its

         Q. Do you plan to free small firms from the obligation
         of filing affirmative-action plans?
         A. The regulations on that proposal are still out for
         comment and they would apply only to firms that do
         business with government agencies and are monitored by
         the Office of Federal Contract Compliance. I can't
         speak for the other commissioners, but my own view is
         that the government should be careful in taking any
         steps that would lessen civil-rights enforcement or
         give the impression of doing so." (emphasis added)
"Job Discrimination is Still Very, Very Serious," U.S. News and
World Report. March 14, 1983, at 67.
         Judge Thomas also expressed support for affirmative action
in an October, 1982 speech to the National Conference on Equal
Employment Opportunity in the Federal Sector. He noted that
"affirmative action was not created in a vacuum...affirmative
action has been put in place because of fsic] minorities and
women have been discriminated against in the past."
         As discussed in the text, this attitude soon gave way to
outright opposition to such affirmative action plans.

                                                         21

conciliation efforts and court-approved settlements."34 In

1985, he wrote:

         The federal enforcement agencies. . .turned the
         statutes on their heads by requiring discrimination in
         the form of hiring and promotion quotas, so-called
         goals and timetables. . . . As Chairman of the EEOC, I
         hope to reverse this fundamentally flawed approach to
         enforcement of the anti-discrimination statutes.35

         Indeed, Judge Thomas made good on his promise. In the fall

of 1985, the EEOC acting general counsel, with Judge Thomas'

support, ordered EEOC regional attorneys not to include goals and

timetables in settlement proposals or other actions in which the

EEOC had intervened. The general counsel also ordered legal

staff not to seek enforcement of goals and timetables in existing

Term at EEOC, Thomas Says," 222 Daily Lab. Rep. (BNA) at A-6
(November 15, 1984). Judge Thomas' basis for that policy change
was the Supreme Court's June, 1984, decision in Firefighters
Local Union No. 1784 v. Stotts. 467 U.S. 561, in which the Court
invalidated a court-ordered affirmative action plan that
interfered with an established seniority system in determining
the order of layoffs. But Stotts did not require the abandonment
of all race- and gender-conscious relief by the EEOC. Indeed,
Judge Thomas himself had, in August, 1984, interpreted Stotts as
"not requir[ing] the EEOC to reconsider its stated policies with
respect to the availability of numerical goals and similar forms
of affirmative, prospective relief in Title VII cases." Letter

consent decrees.36 In short, Judge Thomas deliberately chose
not to seek all remedies available to victims of employment
discrimination.

            After a series of 1986 Supreme Court decisions reaffirmed
the use of goals and timetables,37 Judge Thomas pledged to
abide by those rulings in seeking all available remedies in the
future. Indeed, at hearings on his reconfirmation as EEOC chair,
Judge Thomas promised to withdraw the policy eliminating the use
of goals and timetables as a remedy.38 Nonetheless, even after
the Supreme Court reaffirmation, he continued publicly to express
his objections to affirmative action. Indeed, Judge Thomas
attacked virtually the entire body of Supreme Court jurisprudence
in this area in various published articles, speeches, and
interviews.

County,39 a case that specifically dealt with measures that
expand equal employment opportunity for women. There the Court
considered a county's voluntary affirmative action plan that was
instituted in response to evidence that women were under-
represented in the county's workforce in certain, generally well-
paying, job categories. The Court upheld the county's plan,
which authorized the consideration of gender or ethnicity as a
factor when choosing among qualified candidates for jobs in which
members of such groups were poorly represented. Despite the
clear implications of such plans for ensuring equal opportunity
to qualified women, Judge Thomas criticized the Court's decision:

         It's just social engineering, and we ought to see it
         for what it is. I don't think the ends justify the
         means, and we're standing the principle of
         nondiscrimination on its head -- it's simple as that --
         and we're standing the legislative history of Title VII
         on its head.40

The "ends" here, of course, are simply to create opportunity for
women and people of color where none before existed. And, as
noted earlier, Title VII explicitly authorizes the use of
affirmative action.

          Judge Thomas also criticized the Court's 1980 decision in
Fullilove v. Klutznick.41 which held that Congress has the

discrimination. In Fullilove. the Court considered the
constitutionality of a congressionally enacted set-aside program
designed to remedy historic racial disparities in the
construction industries. The Court upheld Congress1 legislative
response to evidence that minority business enterprises were
denied effective participation in public contracting
opportunities by procurement practices that perpetuated the
effects of prior discrimination. Nonetheless, Judge Thomas
criticized the decision, claiming that "the Court reinterpret[ed]
civil rights laws to create schemes of racial preference where
none was ever contemplated."42

         Judge Thomas also attacked as "egregious"43 the Court's
decision in United Steel Workers v. Weber.44 There the Court
upheld a voluntary affirmative action plan collectively bargained
to correct "traditional patterns of racial segregation and
hierarchy"45 in apprenticeship programs that denied equal
opportunity in the form of well-paid, skilled jobs to people of
color. Judge Thomas further expressed his "personal

International v. EEOC.47 which affirmed court-ordered
affirmative action as a remedy for long-standing discrimination;
and with United States v. Paradise.48~which approved a one-
black-for-one-white promotion requirement for state troopers in
Alabama after the state was found guilty of blatant resistance to
a court order to integrate.

         By expressing opposition to affirmative action -- even when
upheld by the Supreme Court as a remedy for egregious
discrimination -- Judge Thomas1 statements as head of the EEOC
undermined the agency's credibility and effectiveness in
enforcing the law. Moreover, his willingness to reject and
undercut those legal principles leaves little reason to hope that
he would afford them any more respect from the Supreme Court.

As EEOC chair. Judge Thomas proposed to weaken federal guidelines
that set standards for employee selection practices in
contravention of prevailing law.

         In 1984 and 1985, Judge Thomas proposed significant changes
that would have weakened key federal employment rules -- the
Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. The
Guidelines are designed to help employers in the public and
private sectors comply with federal anti-discrimination laws when
implementing tests and selection procedures for hiring and

promotion. Jointly drafted and issued in 1978 by the EEOC,
Department of Justice, Department of Labor, and Civil Service
Commission (now the Office of Personnel Management),49 the
Guidelines play a key role in articulating standards for
employment decisions and guide employers' decisions in
implementing those standards.50

        The Guidelines are based on Griaas v. Duke Power Co..51 a
unanimous 1971 decision by the Supreme Court. Under Griaas.
employment criteria that have a significantly disparate impact on
women or people of color are prohibited -- even in the absence of
discriminatory intent -- unless the employment criteria are shown
to be job-reiated. This ruling has been critical in removing
artificial barriers that have historically limited job
opportunities for women and people of color. For example,
minimum height and weight requirements for years excluded women
from nontraditional occupations such as police officers,
firefighters, and truck drivers. Because such practices have a
demonstrably discriminatory impact on women, they are invalid
under Griaas unless shown to be job-related. Although a recent
Supreme Court decision has shifted the burden of proving job-
relatedness from the employer to the employee,52 another key

Griqqs holding -- that statistical evidence may be used to show
the discriminatory effects of employment practices -- remains
intact.

          As EEOC chair, Judge Thomas repeatedly argued that Griqqs
places undue reliance on statistical evidence as proof of
discrimination and that disparate impact theory was "conceptually
unsound."53 According to Judge Thomas, the Guidelines'
adherence to Griqqs encourages "too much reliance on statistical
disparities as evidence of employment discrimination"54 -- this
despite years of experience that proved the Grigqs principle both
workable and successful.

          In late 1984 and 1985, Judge Thomas took his disagreement
with Griqqs a step further. He proposed altering the Guidelines
to de-emphasize the use of statistical evidence, despite the fact
that there had been no change in Griqqs or in any statutory or
case law upon which the Guidelines were based. Judge Thomas told
one interviewer that changing the Guidelines was the "first thing
on my agenda."55 After key Members of Congress criticized the

Commission for failing to follow Title VII precedent,56 Judge
Thomas withdrew his proposal to weaken the Guidelines.57

         Though never implemented, Judge Thomas' proposal provides
yet another example of his preference for restricting equal
opportunity laws and his willingness to permit his opinions about
prevailing law to override his obligation to enforce that law.
This behavior gives us little reason to entrust the
interpretation of these vital legal principles to him as a member
of the Supreme Court.

As EEOC chair. Judge Thomas refused to perform his duties as
required by lav to enforce and evaluate the anti-discrimination
efforts of federal agencies.

         Judge Thomas' disagreement with affirmative action programs
influenced EEOC policy in other areas as well. Under his
leadership, the EEOC abdicated its responsibility to evaluate and
ensure effective anti-discrimination efforts by other federal
agencies.

         With over three million civilian employees, the federal
government is the nation's largest employer. Nearly half of the
government's workers are women and more than a quarter are people

of color.58 The government's employment policies -- and its

willingness to police its own efforts to ensure equal employment

opportunity -- set standards that affect the attitudes and

practices of employers nationwide.
           Indeed, all federal agencies are required by law59 to

provide the EEOC with goals and timetables for hiring and

promoting women and people of color. These plans must contain a

profile of the current agency workforce, an analysis of any

barriers to employment opportunities, and a plan for removing the

barriers so the agency can better achieve equal employment

opportunity. The EEOC is required to review these plans to

ensure that the agencies adopt effective anti-discrimination

programs.

          However, when several agencies, including the Departments of

Justice and Education, refused to comply with this directive,

Judge Thomas acquiesced in their noncompliance, claiming that he
did not have the power necessary to enforce them.60 But when

          59 Section 717(b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, 42 U.S.C. S 2000e-16(b), requires each federal agency to
prepare national and regional equal employment opportunity plans
in order to "maintain an affirmative program of equal employment
opportunity for all such employees and applicants for
employment." The regulations promulgated pursuant to Section

Humanities (NEH) and the Department of Justice to submit goals

that I can do to NEH or to anyone who does not obey." Hearings

Congress introduced legislation to provide the EEOC with just
such authority, Judge Thomas declined to support it. He said he
preferred the flexibility of the current arrangement.61

          Then, in 1987, Judge Thomas issued a management directive
that shifted the major responsibility for implementing
affirmative action plans to individual agency heads, leaving EEOC
with only nominal oversight responsibilities.62 By stripping
the EEOC of its role as the lead enforcement agency, Judge Thomas
diminished the scope of his official responsibilities in a way
that undermined the enforcement of equal employment opportunity
laws in federal agencies.

          This provides yet another example of Judge Thomas'
predilection for restrictive interpretation of equal employment
opportunity law. Such an approach is disturbing indeed in a
nominee to the Supreme Court who will be called upon to uphold
and interpret legal protections for women, especially women of
color, and disadvantaged people.

Judge Thomas failed to enforce the law against sex discrimination
to ban employment practices that exclude all women of child-
bearing aae from certain high-paying jobs.

         One of the most important issues of sex discrimination
arises from policies that exclude all women of child-bearing age
from certain high-paying jobs unless they can prove that they are
infertile. These policies are based on fears that those jobs1
occupational hazards would harm women and the fetuses they might
carry. Because a number of women have been sterilized to keep
their hard-won jobs, these policies have been referred to as
"forced-sterilization" policies; others call them "fetal
protection" policies. It has been estimated that

         ... as many as 20 million jobs in the United States expose
         workers to reproductive or fetal health hazards, and
         employers increasingly exclude women from such jobs based on
         this new gender stereotype.63

         For example, in 1978, the American Cyanamid Company began to
exclude all women age 16 to 50 from jobs involving exposure to
lead and other hazardous substances unless they could prove that
they were sterile. As a result, five women in the lead pigment
department obtained sterilizations to keep their jobs.

         The company justified its policy by arguing that the fetuses
of women exposed to lead could be harmed. Despite the company's
laudable goal of protecting its employees' health, its draconian

response -- excluding all fertile women because anv fertile women

could- be pregnant at any time -- was blatant sex discrimination
that did not protect employees1 health. To the contrary, the

policy ignored two other major health risks: the serious health

problems that lead exposure causes in adult workers -- men and

women; and the reproductive or genetic damage to fetuses that
paternal lead exposure may cause.64

         The American Cvanamid case and others like it involving

intentional sex discrimination under Title VII posed a problem
for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to resolve.65
In response, .the EEOC (prior to Judge Thomas1 appointment) and

the Department of Labor in 1980 proposed a guideline interpreting

Title VII, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of

1978, to prohibit gender-based "fetal protection" policies. This

proposal rejected the argument that such policies were saved by

the statutory "BFOQ" defense -- the claim that not being a

fertile woman was a "bona fide occupational qualification" for

jobs involving lead exposure. Instead, the EEOC proposal

provided that intentional sex-based discrimination is legal only

         64 Id., at 5.
         65 It also implicated occupational health and safety law.
Indeed, the Department of Labor, which enforces the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA"), challenged American
Cyanamid's practice as a violation of that Act as well. Judge
Robert Bork, then on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit, joined by then Judge Antonin Scalia, held that American
Cyanamid's adoption of an exclusionary policy that forced five
women employees to become sterilized did not violate OSHA's
provision that employers have a general duty to maintain hazard-
free workplaces. Oil. Chemical, and Atomic Workers International
Union v. American Cyanamid Co.. 741 F.2d 444 (D.C. Cir. 1984).

                                                         33

when sex or pregnancy is shown to interfere with the worker's
ability to perform the actual tasks of the job. Because neither
fertility nor gender affects an employee's ability to perform
those tasks, such forced sterilization policies would be
illegal.66

          Though it would have ruled that gender-based exclusionary
policies are per se sex discrimination, the proposal also made
clear that an employer could institute gender-neutral policies to
protect all its employees from reproductive hazards.67 Thus,
the proposal would have encouraged employers to eliminate
workplace hazards for all employees, rather than selectively and
discriminatorily eliminate workers who might be susceptible to
those hazards.

          After receiving extensive comments on the proposal, the
Commission withdrew it in 1981, preferring instead to rely on
"investigation and enforcement of the law on a case by case
basis" to resolve complaints of sex discrimination based on
exclusionary policies involving reproductive hazards.68

          Rather than resolving such complaints, however, the EEOC
warehoused them. In 1982, the EEOC, under Judge Thomas,
instructed its staff to forward those charges to a central
Washington, D.C., office, because it had not developed a

          66 As will be discussed, the Supreme Court ultimately
endorsed this analysis in United Auto Workers v. Johnson

comprehensive policy to deal with them.69 For the next seven
years, the EEOC took no action on at least 60 charges of
intentional sex discrimination.70

         Some of the charges that languished involved examples of
discrimination that did not depend on development of a
comprehensive theory for their resolution. For example, in one
case in which a woman was denied a lead-exposure job, other
evidence of intentional sex discrimination (including the
personnel manager's observation that he "could use a pretty face
in the office") established that the lead exposure was a pretext
for discrimination. This case, which was filed in 1981,
languished for years and was closed in 1989 because the
Commission could no longer locate the charging party.71 For
this woman and the others who were denied or lost jobs or chose
sterilization to keep them, Judge Thomas' EEOC abdicated its
statutory responsibility to address their complaints of sex
discrimination. And employers were left without the guidance to
know which of their practices would be interpreted to violate
Title VII.

         In 1988, the Thomas EEOC finally issued a policy directive
on the application of Title VII to policies excluding fertile

women-72 But that policy was plainly inconsistent with Title

VII. In it, the EEOC allowed employers to rely on Title VIIs

BFOQ defense, even though fertile women are capable of performing
the jobs from which they are excluded by such policies.73 In

other words,

           ... the EEOC watered down [discrimination] theory so that
          employers could successfully defend their fetal protection
          policies without establishing any link between such policies
          and job performance.74

Rather than interpreting Title VII to discourage employers from

solving the problem of reproductive hazards in their workplaces

by excluding women, the EEOC's 1988 policy permitted employers

both to limit women's employment opportunities and to maintain

workplaces in which men's exposure to health hazards continued

unabated.

          That Title VII interpretation was, ultimately, soundly

rejected by the Supreme Court in United Auto Workers v. Johnson
Controls. Inc.75 All nine Justices concluded that Johnson

Hazards," Daily Lab. Report (BNA), No. 193 at D-l (October 5,

          73 The policy also expressly sanctioned sex discrimination
in the evaluation of evidence of health risks: for men,
inconclusive evidence would be presumed not to show a risk to
them. But for women, inconclusive evidence of health risk would
be presumed to show "substantial risk" to them that justified
sex-based discrimination. "EEOC Policy Guidance on Reproductive

 Controls1 "fetal-protection policy explicitly discriminate[d]
 against women on the basis of their sex,"76 and that Johnson
 Controls had failed to establish the BFOQ defense. A majority
 held that the BFOQ defense is not available because "[f]ertile
women...participate in the manufacture of batteries [the task of
 the jobs from which fertile women were excluded] as efficiently
as anyone else."77 The Thomas EEOC's 1988 interpretation of
Title VII in this area was narrower than even the interpretation
of Justices Rehnguist and Scalia.

           The EEOC did begin to improve its record in this area in
1989, after inquiries by the House Education and Labor Committee.
It began to resolve charges (although as of April, 1990, not all
of the warehoused charges had been resolved, and many had to be
closed because they were too o l d ) . 7 8 And it revised its policy
interpretation to be more consistent with the language and intent
of Title VII.79 Nevertheless, the years of EEOC inactivity and
inconsistency in such an important area of sex discrimination law
-- on Judge Thomas' watch -- again demonstrate his preference for

          7 9 In fact, in 1990 the EEOC issued a new policy directive
that interpreted Title VII more faithfully than its 1988 policy
had done, and was much more in line with the Supreme Court's
ultimate interpretation. The EEOC also urged the Department of
Justice not to file a brief on the side of the employer in the

restrictive applications of the laws that protect women,
 including women of color, from unlawful discrimination.

Judge Thomas failed to challenge gender-based wage discrimination
under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.

          Although the status of women in the labor market has
improved in some ways, they remain clustered in predominantly
"female jobs" -- secretaries, file clerks, teachers, and nurses.
These jobs are invariably less well compensated than jobs held by
white males. Women of color -- in particular, black women --
tend to be "crowded" in the lower paying jobs within female-
dominated jobs.80 Even where women perform the same jobs as
men, they may be paid less.

          The federal civil rights laws provide ample tools for the
redress of discrimination in compensation. The Equal Pay Act of
196381 prohibits gender-based pay differentials in jobs that
are equal or substantially equal. And, the Supreme Court in
Gunther v. County of Washington82 held that Title VII forbids
intentional gender-based wage discrimination in jobs that may not
be substantially equal.

          Before 1981, the EEOC took the initiative in the area of

wage discrimination by filing amicus briefs in important

cases,83 by conducting hearings on wage discrimination in the

workplace, and by commissioning a National Academy of Sciences

study.84 However, the EEOC under Judge Thomas did little in

this area of equal employment opportunity law. On September 15,

1981, the Commission began on a relatively positive note by

issuing a 90-day notice to provide "interim guidance" in the

processing of gender-based wage claims under Title VII and the

Equal Pay Act. This "interim policy" was renewed regularly until

1985.85 While the policy was in effect, there was evidence

          83 The EEOC was amicus curiae to the plaintiffs in Gunther.
and w a s also amicus in IUE v. Westinahouse. 631 F. 2d 1094 (3d
Cir. 1980), cert, denied. 452 U.S. 967 (1981). In IUE. the Third
Circuit found that, even though job classifications were not
substantially equal, women in predominantly female job
classifications could still compare their wages to wages paid to
males in predominantly male job classifications. The employer in
this case had relied on a job evaluation system to determine the
relative worth of jobs at its facilities. Even though male and
female job classifications received the same point rating, wage
rates for predominantly female job classifications were
deliberately set lower than wage rates for predominantly male job
classifications.

charges were to be investigated thoroughly. Investigators were
directed to seek out evidence concerning a variety of factors,
including: 1) a breakdown of the employer's workforce by gender;
2) information about wage schedules; 3) where relevant, copies of
any available analyses of job evaluations systems; and 4) where
the market was the basis for the gender-based disparity,
information about how the employer determined the market rate.

that wage discrimination charges were mishandled or were not

investigated at all. Wage discrimination charges forwarded to

Washington, D.C., languished there.86 At one of several

oversight hearings on wage discrimination, Judge Thomas testified

that approximately 266 such charges were pending without

resolution.87

         The EEOC issued an official policy on gender-based wage

discrimination under Title VII in the summer of 1985.88 The

charge involved claims by female employees of the Rockford,

Illinois, Housing Authority that the employer paid its

administrative staff (85 percent female) less than its

maintenance staff (88 percent male), even though the duties

         The policy identified several issues which were to be
considered "non-CDP" (non-Commission Decision Precedent); that
is, cases involving those issues were to be sent to Washington.
Among the issues were "claims of sex-based wage discrimination
brought under Title VII that may be based on the concept
sometimes referred to as 'comparable worth.1"

performed by the women required equal or more skill, effort, and
responsibility than those performed by men. The female employees
also charged that the employer intentionally set wage increases
for female-dominated jobs at lower levels than the prevailing
rate of increase for such jobs in local municipal agencies, while
giving men wage increases that equaled the prevailing rate for
their jobs.

         The Commission found that the complainants did not have a
Title VII claim because they had not alleged or provided any
evidence that women's access to jobs in the higher paid male job
classifications was limited, or that the classifications compared
involved work that was similar in skill, effort, responsibility,
and working conditions. The Commission noted that "the mere
predominance of individuals of one sex in a job classification is
not sufficient to create an inference of sex discrimination in
wage setting." The claim appeared to be a "comparable worth"
claim, according to the Commission.89 The Commission relied on
the Gunther definition of "comparable worth" claims as those
involving "increased compensation on the basis of a comparison of
the intrinsic worth or difficulty of their job with that of other
jobs in the same organization or community."90

         The Commission followed Gunther in its determination that
Title VII covers gender-based wage discrimination cases where
there is evidence of intentional discrimination. That was no

surprise. What is troubling is the Commission's decision to

interpret Gunther as restrictively as it did -- to designate all

charges where there appears to be no evidence of intentional

discrimination as "comparable worth" claims not within the

jurisdiction of the EEOC without investigating them. Such a

designation is circular and guarantees that many potential wage

discrimination cases never get investigated.

         Of equal concern are the statistics indicating the reduction

of Commission filings of straightforward Equal Pay Act cases.

These statistics indicate that the Commission paid scant

attention to a viable and undisputed avenue for challenging

discrimination in compensation. Fifty Equal Pay Act cases were

filed in fiscal year 1980. While Judge Thomas chaired the

Commission, the number of Equal Pay Act cases filed by the agency

dropped: in fiscal year 1984, 9 cases were filed; in FY 1985,

10; FY 1986, 12; FY 1987, 12; FY 1988, 5, and in FY 1989, 7
cases.91 These figures, coupled with the restrictive

         91 Women Employed Institute, EEOC Enforcement Statistics
(1991). We note that these statistics also include a line in the
section on litigation labelled "concurrent," after listings for
Title VII, Equal Pay, and Age Discrimination cases. We can
assume that those numbers may reflect cases filed concurrently
under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act. Thus the number of Equal
Pay cases filed increased as follows (for the years for which
there are "concurrent" statistics): in fiscal year 1984, there
were 17 concurrent cases filed, for a possible total of 26 Equal
Pay cases for that year; in FY 1985, 8 concurrent cases filed,
for a total of 18 Equal Pay cases; in FY 1986, 17 concurrent
cases filed, for a total of 29 Equal Pay cases; in FY 1987, 29
concurrent cases filed, for a total of 41 Equal Pay cases; in FY
1988, 24 concurrent cases filed, for a total of 29 Equal Pay
cases for that year; and in fiscal year 1989, 27 concurrent cases
filed, for a total of 34 Equal Pay cases filed the final year

interpretation given by the Commission to Title VII wage

discrimination lawsuits, give rise to serious concerns regarding

Judge Thomas' commitment to securing equal employment opportunity

for women.

Judge Thomas failed to enforce federal age discrimination lav and
consistently took policy positions against the interests of the
older workers he was sworn to protect.

             Due to dramatic demographic shifts in the American

population, older Americans represent the fastest growing segment

of the population. Our labor force relies more and more upon the
labor of its older workers, many of whom are women.92 To

ensure fairness for these workers, Congress in 1967 enacted the

Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), which prohibits

discrimination against older workers.

"concurrent" cases filed are Title VII/Equal Pay cases, the
totals reflect a drop in litigation which remains cause for
concern.

         92 By the year 2000, approximately one in three working
women will be midlife or older. Older women workers are
especially vulnerable to both age and sex discrimination. For
example, the median earnings of midlife and older women who work
full time year-round are less than two-thirds that.of men; women
over 64 earn only 58 percent of the wages paid to men of the same
age. Older women in particular are segregated into low-paying
jobs. Fifty-eight percent of all employed women over age 45 work
in sales, clerical, or service occupations; 62 percent of women
over 55 work in these fields. Older black women feel the
discriminatory effects of race as well: black women over 55 are
three times more likely than white women to work in service
occupations, while nearly one-third of those over 65 work as
private household workers. Older Women's League, Paving for
Prejudice: A Report on Midlife and Older Women in America's Labor
Force (1991).

         Under Judge Thomas' leadership, the EEOC allowed thousands
of ADEA charges filed by older workers to exceed the two-year
statute of limitations. Once this statute is exceeded, the
charges "lapse" and the workers lose their right to pursue their
claims in court and to receive remedies for proven
discrimination.

         In response to congressional inquiry about the severity of
the problem, Judge Thomas consistently underestimated the number
of charges that had lapsed. At first, he reported that only 78
cases had lapsed; later he revised that figure to approximately
900, then to 1,600, and then to over 9,000. On May 1, 1989,
Judge Thomas informed the Senate Committee on Aging that
approximately 13,000 age discrimination claims had been allowed
to expire.93

         To remedy this crisis and to protect the older workers
involved, in 1988 Congress enacted the Age Discrimination Claims
Assistance Act (ADCAA) to extend temporarily the filing period
for these workers and to require the EEOC to notify those
affected. Yet even after the problem was publicly identified and
corrective legislation enacted, the EEOC continued to let age
discrimination charges lapse. At his confirmation hearings for
the D.C. Circuit, Judge Thomas admitted that thousands of
additional claims had lapsed since enactment of the ADCAA --
claims that were not covered by the filing extension created by

        93 Letter from People for the American Way to Senator Biden
(February 1, 1990).

the ADCAA because they occurred after April 1, 1988.94      When

asked to explain the continuation of this problem, Judge Thomas

blamed the state and local fair employment agencies with which

the EEOC contracts to handle processing of many federal
employment claims.95 Remarkably, he further asserted that the

lapsing of the federal claims was not significant because the

workers involved were still left with state claims, which are not
subject to the two-year statute of limitations.96 He further

claimed that the EEOC was not necessarily involved with or

responsible for ADEA claims filed with state or local enforcement

agencies.

Judge Thomas1 testimony on this issue is enormously

troubling. As any lawyer should be well aware, the loss of a

federal claim because the statute of limitations has expired is a

very serious matter. A state law claim in no way substitutes for

federal rights. Congress enacted the ADEA to provide older

workers with a federal cause of action in federal court; state

age discrimination laws often provide more limited relief than

that available under federal law.97  ^

         Furthermore, the existence of a state claim in no way
diminishes the EEOC's obligation to enforce older workers' rights
under federal law. As the head of the EEOC should well know, the
EEOC may contract with a state or local agency to serve as its
agent in receiving and processing complaints. The EEOC remains
responsible for ensuring that federal charges are handled and
investigated in a timely manner, including monitoring its agents'
work in handling such matters.

         Not only did Judge Thomas fail to enforce age discrimination
law, he also often took policy positions that were damaging to
the economic interests of older workers. While the EEOC during
Judge Thomas' early years did in fact take some positions
supportive of older women workers, as in Norris v. Arizona

injuries.

         For example, the EEOC under Judge Thomas' leadership failed

to rescind regulations that allowed employers to stop

contributions to employees' pension accounts when employees

continued to work past age 65, despite the EEOC's own
determination that such regulations violated the ADEA.100 The

EEOC's failure to rescind the unlawful regulations was estimated

to cost older workers $450 billion in lost pension benefits
annually.101 Congress was finally forced in 1986 to pass

legislation that explicitly prohibited employers from cutting off

pension accruals, contributions, and credits for workers who
reach age 65.102

         Second, Judge Thomas promulgated regulations that increased

older workers' vulnerability to coercion by employers to

relinquish their legal rights. Prior to 1987, an employer could

ask an employee to waive her rights under the ADEA only with the

approval of the EEOC. The EEOC under Judge Thomas promulgated

regulations that allowed employers to solicit such waivers

without the supervision of the EEOC. Even though Congress

          CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS AGAINST SEX DISCRIMINATION

        For the last 20 years, the Supreme Court has consistently

held that sex-based distinctions in the law require careful

scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection
Clause.104 The Court has recognized that such scrutiny is

necessary since "statutory distinctions between the sexes often

have the effect of invidiously relegating the entire class of

females to inferior legal status without regard to the actual
capabilities of its individual members."105

        Without question, the Court's commitment to equal protection

analysis has proved critically important in battling sex

discrimination. As New York University School of Law professor

Sylvia Law has testified:

        The Supreme Court's recognition that gender
        discrimination is presumptively wrong has had a
        tremendously positive impact on the lives of women in
        this country. Under the Court's direction, the federal
        courts have invalidated dozens of laws excluding women
        from wage work and public life and devaluing the wages
        and benefits they receive.106

Indeed, the Equal Protection Clause provides the primary

constitutional protection against laws that discriminate on the

basis of gender. At a minimum, any nominee to the Supreme Court

must demonstrate his or her adherence to these most basic
guarantees against invidious sex-based discrimination.

         o Judge Thomas1 seeming indifference to the Equal
                  Protection Clause is troubling, as the Equal Protection
                  Clause has been interpreted as the primary source of
                  constitutional protections against sex discrimination;

         o Judge Thomas has not stated how or whether he would
                  apply a natural rights analysis to sex discrimination;
                  historically, though, natural law principles have been
                  used to limit the lives and opportunities of women; and

         o Judge Thomas himself has embraced an analysis of the
                  status of working women that denies the reality of
                  discrimination in women's lives and its effects on
                  their economic security and individual opportunity.

Each concern is discussed in greater detail below.

Judge Thomas' seeming indifference to the Equal Protection Clause
is troubling, as the Equal Protection Clause has been interpreted
as the primary source of constitutional protections against sex
discrimination.

         Judge Thomas' public record on constitutional issues of
bedrock importance to women is surprisingly thin. He has not
issued any opinions that touch upon equal protection issues
during his short tenure on the federal bench. Nor, it seems,
during almost eight years as head of the EEOC, did Judge Thomas
comment on constitutional protections against sex discrimination.

        Judge Thomas' analysis of sex-based constitutional claims
received only a passing mention at his confirmation hearings for
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. When asked by Senator Kohl
about an equal protection challenge to a publicly-funded military
academy's policy of excluding women from admission, Judge Thomas

                                                        50
                                    434

declined to answer on the grounds that he might have to rule on

such a case as an appellate judge. In responding, however, Judge

Thomas failed to mention the constitutional implications of the

case. Instead, he discussed it only as a possible violation of

statutory law -- inaccurately identifying Title VI of the Civil

Rights Act as the legal standard to be applied107 -- and not as

an equal protection challenge.108 Judge Thomas1 apparent

        107 In fact, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race -- but not sex -- by any
program that receives federal funds, including educational
institutions. In light of his experience as Assistant Secretary
for Civil Rights in the Department of Education, Judge Thomas1
misapplication of Title VI to the case at hand is surprising, to
say the least.

        108 Senator Kohl: I would like to ask you about a
        controversy that has been in the newspapers recently.
        In Virginia, there is a military academy known as VMI;
        which educates young men but admits no women. Without
        commenting on the specific case, I would like to know
        your views in this kind of situation.

       Mr. Thomas: Well, that is exactly the kind of case,
        Senator, or similar case that could come before a
        circuit court at some point, since I would assume that
        the alleged violation is of title VI of the Civil
       Rights Act of 1964. And having been the Assistant
        Secretary for Civil Rights in the Department of
        Education, I know that it would take some time for
       those kinds of cases to find their way through courts
        and I think it would be inappropriate for me to
       prejudge it at any point, but certainly in the context
        of a confirmation hearing to sit on the court of
        appeals.

        Senator Kohl: In general, do you think that a publicly
        funded military academy should be allowed to exclude
       women?

       Mr. Thomas: Again, the allegation there in that matter is
        in court, even as we speak, is that this is a violation
       of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which I
       enforced as the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights.
       I abhor discrimination. The constraint that I am

                                                  51
                                    435

failure to recognize the fundamental constitutional implications

of the case -- regardless of his judgment as to how it should be

decided -- raises serious concern about his understanding of and

commitment to well-established constitutional protections against

sex discrimination.

         Judge Thomas had another opportunity to articulate his

commitment to the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantees against sex

discrimination when asked by Senator DeConcini to discuss his

views "of the proper application of the constitutional doctrine

of equal protection." Judge Thomas replied:

         As an appellate court judge, I am duty bound to follow
         and apply Supreme Court precedent to cases which might
         come before me. In interpreting the equal protection
         clause, the Supreme Court has set out essentially three
         standards of review, strict scrutiny, intermediate
         review, and rational review. Though I do not have a
         fully developed Constitutional philosophy, I have no
         personal reservations about applying these standards as
         an appellate court judge in cases which might come
         before me.109

Judge Thomas' recitation that he would be bound to follow Supreme

Court precedent as an appellate court judge provides little

insight into how he would evaluate equal protection cases as a

Supreme Court Justice -- a position that would enable him to

deviate from established precedent and create new case law. Nor

         operating under is that we are looking at an alleged
         statutory violation which will wind its way through the
         courts and could eventually, not necessarily the D.C.
        circuit, but could eventually be before a court of
         appeals, if I understand the intensity of that battle.

does his disclaimer that he does "not have a fully developed

Constitutional philosophy" (reiterated at least one other time

during his confirmation hearings)110 offer any reassurances as

to his commitment to equal protection. Indeed, his long-standing

support for "natural rights" analysis suggests that he does

indeed have a constitutional philosophy, one that could threaten

women's constitutional rights.

         Although Judge Thomas has written several articles that

discuss constitutional protections against race-based

discrimination, none address the standards and analysis to be

applied in evaluating gender-based claims. In fact, Judge Thomas

has at times downplayed the use of the Equal Protection Clause as

a tool for eradicating invidious discrimination.111

         1 1 0 Id., at 56.

         111 For example, Judge Thomas agrees with the result in the
Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education -- that
state-imposed school segregation is constitutionally repugnant --
but takes issue with the Court's equal protection analysis in
reaching that result. Judge Thomas asserts that Brown was a
"missed opportunity" to apply higher law analysis, identifying
Brown's "great flaw" as its reliance on empirical evidence of the
effects of segregation without recognizing that segregation was a
derivative of slavery and thus "at fundamental odds with the
founding principles." Thomas, "Toward a 'Plain Reading1 of the
Constitution," 30 Howard Law Journal 691, 698-99 (1987).

         In particular, Judge Thomas has argued that the Brown case
would have been better decided had it relied on the analysis used
by Justice Harlan in dissent in Plessv v. Ferguson, the 19th-
century case which upheld the doctrine of "separate but equal."
In praising Harlan's analysis, he concludes that Harlan "relied
on the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than on either the
Equal Protection or the Due Process Clause." Thomas, "The Higher
Law Background of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment," 12 Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy
63, 66-68 (1989). Judge Thomas' seeming indifference to the
Equal Protection Clause provides cause for concern, since the

                                                         53
                                    437

         Hence, the resultant uncertainty as to his views on
constitutional protections against sex discrimination, coupled
with his expressed support for jurisprudence based on "natural '
rights" theory, raises substantial concern about his adherence to
the Constitution's most basic guarantees against invidious sex
discrimination.

Judge Thomas has not stated how or whether he would apply a
natural rights analysis to sex discrimination? historically,
though, natural law principles have been used to limit the lives
and opportunities off women.

         Judge Thomas has consistently reiterated in writings and
speeches his support for a "higher law" or "natural rights"
theory of constitutional law. This theory argues that legal
principles must be measured against the standards of a natural
law that reflects humankind's highest values and
aspirations.112

Equal Protection Clause has been interpreted as the primary
source of constitutional protections against sex-based
discrimination.

        112 This higher law is often -- but not always -- informed
by reference to religious values. For example, in articulating
natural law theory, Judge Thomas, quoting John Quincy Adams, has
asserted:

        "Our political way of life is by the laws of nature of
        nature's God, and of course presupposes the existence
        of God, the moral ruler of the universe, and is a rule
        of right and wrong, of just and unjust, binding upon
        man, preceding all institutions of human society and of
        government."

                                                        54
                                     438

         As a theory of jurisprudence to be applied by the Supreme

Court, natural rights analysis provides cause for serious

concern. Its reliance on "higher" moral principles leaves open

the dangerous possibility that cases will be decided on the basis

of individual judges' musings, intuitions, or religious beliefs.

These personal conclusions are bound to vary unpredictably from
Justice to Justice.113 As one Supreme Court Justice wrote in

dissenting from the Court's natural rights analysis in a 1798

probate case: "The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no

fixed standard: the ablest and the purest men have differed upon
the subject..."114 Then, as now, the notion that personal

moral beliefs can trump bedrock legal principles is cause for

alarm among members of a diverse, democratic society.

Conservative Policies," The Heritage Foundation (June 18, 1987)

         Judge Thomas, paraphrasing St. Thomas Aquinas, has further
explained that "an unjust law is a human law that is not rooted
in eternal law and natural law" and that "a just law is a man-
made code that squares with the moral law or the law of God."
Thomas, "Affirmative Action: Cure or Contradiction?" The Center
Magazine. November/December 1987, at 21.

         113 To the extent that these values are informed by a
Justice's religious beliefs, the use of natural rights theory
raises critical questions about the separation of church and
state. And, since religions vary tremendously in identifying
life's fundamental values -- as do even varying denominations of
the same religion or church -- the application of natural rigl-sts
theory will similarly vary depending upon the religious
affiliation of the Justice involved.

         In numerous articles and speeches, Judge Thomas has applied
natural rights theory to conclude that state-imposed racial
discrimination is constitutionally prohibited, not necessarily by
the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, but by the
"higher law" principles articulated in the Declaration of
Independence.115 Indeed, his application of natural rights
theory leads him to a powerful condemnation of race-based
segregation. However, since his natural rights analyses have
been directed almost exclusively to race-based discrimination, it
is not clear whether Judge Thomas would apply this analysis to
claims of discrimination against women, including women of color.

         Judge Thomas' support for natural rights analysis raises
substantial questions about the theory's application to gender
discrimination.116 Historically, the language of natural
rights and higher law has been used to limit women's lives and
opportunities. For example, an 1873 Supreme Court decision
denied a woman a license to practice law, arguing that

         115 More specifically, Judge Thomas has argued that racial
segregation is unconstitutional because the Constitution is
intimately linked to the Declaration of Independence, which makes
clear that the United States is premised "the promise of equality
of rights." Thomas, "Toward a 'Plain Reading' of the
Constitution -- The Declaration of Independence in Constitutional
Interpretation," 30 Howard Law Journal 691, 692 (1987).

         116 For example, Judge Thomas has urged that constitutional
interpretation return to a "'plain reading' of the Constitution -
- which puts the fitly spoken words of the Declaration of
Independence in the center of the frame formed by the
Constitution." Thomas, "Toward a 'Plain Reading* of the
Constitution -- The Declaration of Independence in Constitutional
Interpretation," 30 Howard Law Journal 691, 703 (1987). The
Declaration, of course, fails explicitly to mention the rights of
women in its pronouncement that "all men are created equal."

         recognized a wide difference in the respective spheres
         and destinies of man and woman. . . . The natural and
         proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the
         female sex evidently unfits it for many of the
         occupations of civil life. . . . The paramount destiny
         and mission of woman is to fulfil the noble and benign
         offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the
         Creator.117

         The Court relied upon similar principles in Muller v.
Oregon.118 when it upheld a state statute that limited the
number of hours women could work. The Muller Court held that
legislation restricting women's employment was permissible
because "healthy mothers are essential to vigorous offspring,
[and] the physical well-being of woman becomes an object of
public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and
vigor of the race."119 It justified its limitations on women's
opportunities by noting that "woman has always been dependent
upon man it 1 2 0

        Reliance on "natural law" thus threatens to limit women's
freedom and equality by introducing outdated notions of women's
"natural" roles and capabilities into constitutional
interpretation. For these reasons alone, Judge Thomas' support
for natural rights theory generates considerable discomfort as to

his willingness to uphold constitutional protections against sex
discrimination.

Judge Thomas has embraced an analysis of working women's status
that denies the reality of discrimination in women's lives and
its effects on their economic security and individual
opportunity.

           Judge Thomas1 approval of an analysis that rejects the role
that discrimination plays in limiting women's lives further fuels
concern as to his willingness to abide by constitutional
prohibitions against invidious sex-based discrimination.
Specifically, Judge Thomas has written approvingly of academic
Thomas Sowell's analysis of working women in Civil Rights;
Rhetoric or Reality?121 Judge Thomas praised Mr. Sowell's work

         ... a useful, concise discussion of discrimination
         faced by women. We will not here attempt to summarize
         it except to note that by analyzing all the statistics
         and examining the role of marriage on wage-earning for
         both men and women, Sowell presents a much-needed
         antidote to cliches about women's earnings and
         professional status.122

         Mr. Sowell's analysis is so outrageous that Judge Thomas'
support for it requires discussion in some detail. In short, at

no point in his chapter devoted to women does Mr. Sowell
acknowledge any "discrimination faced by women." Rather, he
concludes that inequities in pay and career advancement stem
merely from women's own behavior and choices, claiming that women
prefer jobs and careers with greater flexibility -- yet lower pay
-- to accommodate their roles as wives and mothers.

         In attempting to justify the historic pay inequities between
men and women, Mr. Sowell goes so far as to claim that:

         Women are typically not educated as often in such
         highly paid fields as mathematics, science, and
         engineering, nor attracted to physically taxing and
         well-paid fields such as construction work,
         lumberjacking, coal-mining, and the like.123

Mr. Sowell makes no mention of data that show that a substantial
portion of the wage gap between men and women (even after
considering factors like experience, education, training, and
length of workforce attachment) is attributable to
discrimination.124

         Nor does Mr. Sowell acknowledge the impact of pregnancy
discrimination in limiting women's employment opportunities --
even as he gives credence to stereotypes that suggest that
working mothers are "not willing to work overtime as often as

         123 Sowell, Civil Rights at 92. Mr. Sowell is demonstrably
wrong. For example, as discussed earlier, thousands of women
have entered the "physically taxing and well-paid" field of coal
mining, enabled in large part by affirmative action efforts that
overcame many of the barriers to women's participation in the
industry.

some other workers (male or female), or need more time off for
personal emergencies" and may thus be "less valuable as an
employee or less promotable to jobs with heavier
responsibilities."125 Mr. Sowell instead asserts that "the
physical consequences of pregnancy and childbirth alone are
enough to limit a woman's economic options,"126 without
recognizing the role that employers play in transforming a
woman's pregnancy disability into an excuse for her termination,
reassignment, or demotion.

         Mr. Sowell even argues that treating women fairly is too
costly: employers, he claims, won't hire women who cost them
more because of the legal protections against sex
discrimination127 (yet Mr. Sowell refused to recognize this as
"discrimination").

         And, while Mr. Sowell gives a nod to racial differences
between women by recognizing that black women's labor force
participation rates were historically higher than white women's,
he asserts incorrectly that black women -- who suffer from

         125 Sowell, Civil Rights at 97-98. Mr. Sowell writes that
"[b]ecause of domestic responsibilities and the rearing of
children, women also tend to drop out of the labor force
completely more often than men do." He suggests that these women
"drop out" voluntarily; he makes no mention of the thousands of
women who are forced from their jobs for want of supportive and
efficient workplace policies and standards, such as job-
guaranteed family and medical leave.

discrimination based on gender and race -- fare better in the
labor market than white women.128

         In short, Thomas Sowell's "much-needed antidote[s] to

cliches about women's earnings and professional status," as Judge

Thomas puts it, are themselves stereotypical and unsupportable

assumptions that perpetuate discrimination in the workplace.

Judge Thomas' praise for this analysis -- especially in light of

his experience as head of the agency charged with fighting

workplace sex discrimination -- is, at the very least, alarming.

Certainly it fuels fears that he will not strike down invidious
sex-based distinctions as constitutionally impermissible.129

         Mr. Sowell's analysis leads Judge Thomas to conclude that

"[i]n any event, women cannot be understood as though they were a

         1 2 9 Judge Thomas expressed support for a similar analysis
in another context as well. In an interview published in The
Atlantic Monthly. Juan Williams writes of Thomas,

         But people who argue that they are victimized in
         corporate life as part of historical, across-the-board
         discrimination against a group find little sympathy at
         [Judge Thomas'] agency. It could be, Thomas says, that
         blacks and women are generally unprepared to do certain
         kinds of work by their own choice. It could be that
         blacks choose not to study chemical engineering and
         that women choose to have babies instead of going to
         medical school.

in original).130 This statement carries significant
implications for any analysis of women's equality under the Equal
Protection Clause (which has been interpreted to provide
protections against gender-based discrimination that are modelled
after those provided against racial discrimination). It suggests
that Judge Thomas is less likely to view sex-based distinctions
as presumptively discriminatory, as they are treated under equal
protection analysis, but rather as the acceptable result of
women's choices, behavior, or social roles.

                                        REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM
         A woman's ability to enjoy the full range of personal
liberties guaranteed by the Constitution -- herprivacy and her
equality before the law -- is integrally related to her freedom
to control herreproductive life. Judge Thomas, through
published writings and one speech, has notonly questioned the
constitutional basis of the right of privacy articulated in
Griswold v. State of Connecticut131 and Roev. Wade.132but
has also expressed approval of theextreme view that the
Constitution affirmatively protects a fetus1 "right to life."
In particular:
          Judge Thomas offered oneof thefewspecific examples

                  of how he would apply natural law in a speech praising
                  as a "splendid example of applying natural law" an
                  article arguing not only that Roe v. Wade was wrongly
                  decided butthat theConstitution affirmatively
                  protects the fetus1 "right to life";
          Judge Thomas served on the 1986 White House Working
                  Group on the Family, which authored a report that
                  sharply criticized Roe and other Supreme Court
                  decisions protecting theright of privacy;and
          In other writings, Judge Thomas criticized Roe and even
                  Griswold v. Connecticut, thecase protecting as
                  fundamental theright of married couples to use
                  contraceptives.

Griswold. Roe and the Right to Privacy
         The landmark case of Griswold v. State of Connecticut

involved a constitutional challenge to a state criminal law
banning the use of contraceptives. The lawsuit was brought by a
physician and family planning clinic director who were convicted
as accessories for providing a married couple with medical
information and advice about contraceptives. The Supreme Court
struck down the statute as violating the constitutional right of
privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.

         In Griswold. the Court concluded that a "zone of privacy
created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees"
rendered the law unconstitutional.133 In the majority opinion,
Justice Douglas cited various provisions of the Bill of Rights:
the right of association contained in the First Amendment; the
prohibition against housing soldiers in people's homes contained
in the Third Amendment; the right to be "secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects" contained in the Fourth Amendment;
the prohibition against self-incrimination contained in the Fifth
Amendment; and the Ninth Amendment, which states:

         The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
         shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained
         by the people.
         Justice Goldberg, in a separate and famous concurring
opinion, wrote "to emphasize the relevance of [the Ninth]
Amendment to the Court's holding."134 Drawing on the

legislative history and language of the Ninth Amendment, Justice
Goldberg stated:

         [T]he Framers of the Constitution believed that there are
         additional fundamental rights, protected from governmental
         infringement, which exist alongside those fundamental rights
         specifically mentioned in the first eight constitutional
         amendments.135 ...To hold that a right so basic and
         fundamental and so deep-rooted in our society as the right
         of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right
         is not guaranteed in so many words by the first eight
         amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth
        Amendment and to give it no effect whatsoever.136

Justice Goldberg stated that the Ninth Amendment did not
constitute an "independent source of rights," but rather
reflected "a belief ... that fundamental constitutional rights
exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight
amendments."137 He further stated that this did not mean that
judges should decide cases based on "their personal and private
notions":

        Rather, they must look to the "traditions and [collective]
         conscience of our people" to determine whether a principle
         is "so rooted [there]...as to be ranked as
         fundamental."138

         Eight years later, in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court
concluded that the fundamental right of personal privacy
recognized in a long line of cases, including Griswold. included
a woman's decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy.

                                     449

While acknowledging that the district court had rooted this right
"in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people,"
the Court concluded that this fundamental right of privacy is
"founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal
liberty."139 The Court, noting that "prevailing legal abortion
practices were far freer" during the 19th century, also rejected
unequivocally the argument that a fetus is a "person" within the
meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.140

In his writings. Judge Thomas has criticized Roe and even
Grisvold v. Connecticut* the case protecting as fundamental the
right of married couples to use contraceptives.

         In two articles published in 1988 and 1989, Judge Thomas
criticized Roe v. Wade and the majority and concurring opinions
in Griswold.141 In a footnote in the context of a critique of
judicial activism, unenumerated rights and "run-amok judges,"
Judge Thomas stated:

                  The current case provoking the most protest from
         conservatives is Roe v. Wade. 410 U.S. 113 (1973), in which
         the Supreme Court found a woman's decision to end her
         pregnancy to be part of her unenumerated right to privacy
         established in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965).

         use of the Ninth Amendment in Thomas, "Civil Rights as a
         Principle Versus Civil Rights as an Interest," Assessing the
         Reagan Years 398-99 (D. Boaz ed. 1988).142

Viewed in context, these remarks clearly criticize the

unenumerated right of privacy articulated in Roe and Griswold.

         In the article referred to in the above-quoted text, Judge

Thomas discusses the Ninth Amendment at some length. He

interprets Justice Goldberg's view of the Ninth Amendment as

giving the Supreme Court "a blank check" to "strike down

legislation."

         Unbounded by notions of obligation and justice, the desire
         to protect rights simply plays into the hands of those who
         advocate a total state. The rhetoric of freedom (license,
         really) encourages the expansion of bureaucratic
         government.143

Judge Thomas argues that the Ninth Amendment should instead be

seen as a reminder that "the Constitution is a document of
limited government."144 What Judge Thomas fails to appreciate

is that devaluing constitutional rights of individuals, and the

Court's role in protecting them, expands the power of the other

Immunities Clause oi the Fourteenth Amendment," 12 Harvard

branches of government to interfere with those rights. This is
hardly consistent with a professed desire for limited government.

         Although one could disagree with Justice Goldberg's view of
the Ninth Amendment and yet agree with the analysis of the
fundamental right of privacy in Roe and in the Griswold majority
opinion, Judge Thomas' explicit criticism of the unenumerated
right of privacy again shows that he does not support the
constitutional analysis in Griswold and Roe.

Judge Thomas served on the 1986 White House WorXina Group on the
Family* which authored a report that sharply criticized Roe and
other Supreme Court decisions protecting the right of privacy.

         In 1986, Judge Thomas, then chair of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, served on the White House Working Group
on the Family. The report submitted by that group to President
Reagan in December 1986 attributes authorship of the report to
"the White House Working Group on the Family," and Judge Thomas
is listed as a member of that group.145

         The Working Group's report includes explicit criticism of a
series of Supreme Court decisions affirming the fundamental right
to privacy: Roe v. Wade. Eisenstadt v. Baird.146 and Planned

Parenthood v. Danforth.147 In Eisenstadt. the Court
invalidated a Massachusetts law that banned distribution of
contraceptives to unmarried individuals. The Court's plurality
opinion extended the reasoning of Griswold. which was based on a
right of marital privacy, and concluded that the right of
privacy, to mean anything, must mean the right of the individual.
married or unmarried, to be free from unwarranted government
intrusion into such personal matters. In Danforth. the Court
held unconstitutional a Missouri statute requiring the written
consent of a woman's spouse or the written consent of a young
woman's parent or guardian before an abortion could be performed;
both provisions gave others (a spouse or a parent) absolute veto
power over a woman's decision to terminate a pregnancy.

         In the context of a discussion of the legal status of the
family, the Working Group criticizes Roe, stating that the Court
"struck down State attempts to protect the life of children in
utero," and Danforth. stating that the Court invalidated state
attempts "to protect paternal interest in the life of the child
before birth, and to respect parental authority over minor
children in abortion decisions."148 The Working Group's
criticism of Eisenstadt appears to be based on its view that the
decision denigrates the status of the marital relationship and
thus the family.

         Rather than giving any consideration to constitutionally-
based privacy interests in analyzing Roe. Eisenstadt. and
Danforthf the White House Working Group simply describes these
cases as decisions made by the Supreme Court "on a philosophical
basis which left little room for legal recognition of the
family."149 The Working Group states that these and other
decisions from the Court "have crippled the potential of public
policy to enforce familial obligations, demand family
responsibility, protect family rights, or enhance family
identity.1*150 Sex education classes and school-based clinics
are similarly criticized in the report, described not as
providing information about constitutionally protected rights as
decided in Griswold and Eisenstadt. but rather as "the abdication
of moral authority."151

         Of particular concern is the Working Group's position that
state legislatures and Congress, not the courts, should decide
these issues. Such a view of the Supreme Court would eviscerate
the Court's historic role in safeguarding constitutional rights.
Despite the Working Group's objection to judicial action in this
arena, the report lists various options to "correct" such "a
fatally flawed line of court decisions," including "the

Judge Thomas offered one of the few specific examples of how he
would apply natural law in a speech praising as a "splendid
example of applying natural law" an article arguing not only that
Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided but that the Constitution
affirmatively protects the fetus' "right to life."

         In 1987 Judge Thomas delivered a speech entitled "Why Black
Americans Should Look to Conservative Policies" at The Heritage
Foundation. In this speech, which includes a discussion of the
need "to reexamine the natural law," Judge Thomas described an
essay as follows:

         Heritage Foundation Trustee Lewis Lehrman's recent essay in
         The American Spectator on the Declaration of Independence
         and the meaning of the right to life is a splendid example
         of applying natural law.1"

         The Lehrman essay, published in April, 1987, is entitled
"The Declaration of Independence and the Right to Life: One
Leads Unmistakably From the Other."154 In this short, three-
page article, Mr. Lehrman discusses:

         1) "the 'durable1 moral issue of our age," which he
         describes as "the struggle for the inalienable right to life

         of the child-in-the-womb -- and thus the right to life of
         all future generations";
         2) "the conjured right to abortion in Roe v. Wade, a
         spurious right born exclusively of judicial supremacy with
         not a single trace of lawful authority, implicit or
         explicit, in the actual text or history of the Constitution
         itself"; and
         3) "the right to life of the child-about-to-be-born -- an
         inalienable right, the first in the sequence of God-given
         rights warranted in the Declaration of Independence and also
         enumerated first among the basic positive rights to life,
         liberty, and property stipulated in the Fifth and Fourteenth
         Amendments of the Constitution" (emphasis added).155

Mr. Lehrman also refers to the Court's "overreaching" decision in
Roe as a "coup" against the Constitution leading to a
"holocaust."156 Through the application of "natural law"
theory, Mr. Lehrman concludes that the Constitution affirmatively
protects a fetus1 "right to life." This view goes far beyond
disputing whether there is a constitutional right of privacy and
whether such a privacy right encompasses a woman's decision to
terminate a pregnancy.

         Should the Supreme Court ultimately conclude that the
Constitution does not protect privacy or the right to terminate a
pregnancy, abortion would not automatically be banned unless the
states affirmatively decided to enact restrictive laws.
Moreover, Congress and the states, through state constitutions
and statutes, could protect the right to choose.

         But if Mr. Lehman's extreme view of the Constitution were
adopted by the Supreme Court, neither the federal government nor
the states could enact laws to protect the right to choose, and
state constitutional provisions that protect the right to choose
would be voided. To protect a woman's reproductive choices would
require a federal constitutional amendment.

         In short, Judge Thomas has on several occasions criticized
the line of privacy cases beginning with Griswold and ending with
Roe v. Wade and its progeny -- cases that protect as fundamental
the right of personal privacy in decisions relating to
contraception and abortion. Judge Thomas' views go beyond
opposition to a constitutional right of privacy to an affirmative
belief that the fetus has enforceable legal rights under the
Constitution, a view that would lead not merely to the overruling
of Griswold and Roe, but also to state control over all aspects
of women's reproductive lives.

                                                 CONCLUSION
         In our system of constitutional government, the Supreme
Court functions as the last bastion of justice. It is the
Court's duty to safeguard individual rights and liberties for all
Americans -- especially those who are most vulnerable to
invidious discrimination and the deprivation of their rights. In
a Court with nine members that has just lost a forceful
counterweight to prevailing majority opinion, and in an era of
widespread racism and sexism, the stakes in replacing Justice
Thurgood Marshall are very high.
         Our review of Judge Clarence Thomas' record reveals a
complex, extensive pattern of disturbing actions and statements
that makes us unwilling to entrust our constitutional future to
his care. We fear Judge Thomas approaches the law via a prism
clouded by an ideology that misinterprets and ignores legal
principles of the greatest importance.
         Indeed, this report highlights issues that will have life-
shaping impact on millions of Americans, particularly our
society's most disadvantaged individuals.
         The Thomas record on these issues casts grave doubt upon his
commitment to equal employment opportunity that could enable
working women and their families to achieve and maintain economic
security -- in ways similar, perhaps, to Judge Thomas' own
admirable climb out of poverty. His record on constitutional
protections against gender discrimination for women -- including
women of color who are vulnerable to double discrimination based

                                                        74
                                     458

on gender and race -- is deeply troubling. And we are
extraordinarily concerned by evidence that Judge Thomas will
endorse extreme limitations on every woman's most fundamentally
important right, the right to make her own reproductive choices.

        Our report raises many tough questions that must be answered
during the confirmation process. Indeed, considering that this
is a lifetime appointment, the Senate is duty-bound to conduct
the most thorough interview Judge Thomas has ever faced. The
Senators must thoroughly probe, and Judge Thomas must fully
address, each disturbing question raised in this report. If
Judge Thomas does not affirmatively endorse equal employment
opportunity, constitutional protections against gender
discrimination, and reproductive freedom and the right to privacy
for all American women, the nation cannot afford to place him on
the bench of the Supreme Court.

                                                               75

  The CHAIRMAN. Before we start the questioning, from this point
on, anyone who goes over 5 minutes, I am cutting them off, except
if my mother comes to testify.

  Senator SIMPSON. Or my mother.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, your mother, she wouldn't want you to hear
her that long. [Laughter.]
  Seriously, please, I say to all witnesses who follow, because if we
do not, you are going to be testifying until 11 or 12 o'clock at night.
I will be here, but no one else will be. I do not mean my colleagues,
I mean no one else out there who you will want to hear will be, I
suspect.
  Let me get right to it. Ms. Lichtman, you indicated that the
Judge is either running away from his record or he did not think it
through. How about the possibility he changed his mind?
  Ms. LICHTMAN. I will tell you why I have trouble with that as a
theory, and it is that he had spoken so often and so completely and
so recently into the 1988's and 1989's and 1990 about so many of
the issues about which he either refused to respond or tried to dis-
tinguish his remarks, and I fear that just really is not believable.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Senator, if I might just jump in, I tried to
listen to most of the hearings. I certainly did not hear every single
word, but I do not recall his ever saying he changed his mind or
that what he had said before was wrong. I think he said he did not
mean to imply certain things that seemed very clear from the
record, or he said that he had not read what he had signed.
  But I do not recall, on these key principles that are of such con-
cern to us, his coming in a straightforward way and saying, yes, I
had said the following things about Thomas Sowell, but upon re-
flection, I have changed my mind about some of his theories, or,
yes, I had praised the Lehrman article, but now that I have
thought it through, as a judge, I see things differently. That is not
what Clarence Thomas presented in the hearings, so far as I know.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask you, since you mentioned equal pro-
tection--you all did, but I mean you have spoken to it more than
anyone else--Judge Thomas seemed to go further than Judge
Souter had gone. He said in his testimony that heightened scrutiny
should be the standard reply in equal protection cases affecting
women. This is where the Court is, but Justice Souter would not
acknowledge that standard.

  Mr. GREENBERGER. I want to say that I listened very, very care-
fully and did try to look through the written transcript on this
issue, because it is obviously of such central concern, and I think
that there is real ambiguity about what Judge Thomas said.

  In answer to a number of questions, he prefaced his remarks
with "I have no reason to doubt or to question the standard," and
that was as formulation that was similar to what Judge Souter
used. But he later also said, in answer to a question to Senator
DeConcini at the end of the hearings, when Senator DeConcini, in
another context, asked him were those qualifying words meant as
qualifying words, "I have no reason to believe," but he said yes, he
did intend, in fact, to qualify his answer by that kind of preface. I
do not know
                                         460

  The CHAIRMAN. I will dig up the record, I may be mistaken, but
my recollection is that he specifically said he accepts the Court's
middle-tier scrutiny.

  Ms. GREENBERGER. I just want to finish one point, because the
gravamen of our objection, even if one assumes he did unequivocal-
ly accept it, which I think is ambiguous, is that the basis of his
other testimony and his record called into question what he meant
when he said he accepted the heightened scrutiny test.

  Part of the heightened scrutiny test that he articulated was
  The CHAIRMAN. In other words, it called into question his credi-
bility, whether he was telling you the truth that he accepts it?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, I do not know whether I would say his
credibility on that particular point, but what his understanding
was of the heightened scrutiny test, because an aspect of it is that,
when the Government comes forward to try to justify some dis-
crimination that they must show an important governmental inter-
est, but that is not enough. It cannot be an important governmen-
tal interest that is based on stereotypes, that is based on fixed no-
tions of what women and men
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that. So you-
  Ms. GREENBERGER [continuing]. And that is part of the height-
ened scrutiny test.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, it is part of the way this Court without
saying they are changing the test, in effect, has changed the result
by redefining what constitutes meeting the test.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Precisely, and we saw that
  The CHAIRMAN. I just want to be clear whether my recollection is
correct about his accepting, the present test.
  Let me yield to my friend from Wyoming.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it.
  Thank you for your testimony, which I read. I know that is
shocking, but I did. I had a little time. We have so many witnesses
and there is so much to do, I hope that we can have access to the
testimony of the witnesses. I know you are trying very hard to do
that, too, but that makes it easier for us to be able to ask questions
and do our work, and I appreciate that.
  If I might direct these remarks to Ms. Greenberger, because you
were speaking of this issue of the intermediate scrutiny test, and
you stated in your written testimony that you fear for women's
protection and that there are only four members with this height-
ened awareness or heightened protection, and I think you specifi-
cally did say that Chief Justice Rehnquist does not apply that level
of scrutiny to gender-based statutes.
  But in the questioning by Senator DeConcini, Judge Thomas
stated that he supported the intermediate scrutiny test for gender-
based statutes. In fact, he said and the record shows that he said,
"One could consider and be open to ratcheting up or applying a
more exacting standard."
  My question is this: Based on his answer there to Senator DeCon-
cini, why do you persist in being critical of Judge Thomas' position
on the protection of women under the equal protection clause?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Senator Simpson, I have two basic concerns:
One, that this is a statement that is not as clearcut as some of the
statements he has made in other areas, certainly, one could consid-
                                         461

er, and I am very glad that he was open to the possibility, but I
think there was some ambiguity about the clarity, but that is only
one point.

  The second is what his understanding is at the heart of the
heightened scrutiny test, assuming that he did embrace it, and the
heart of the heightened scrutiny test is the stereotyped notions
about what women and men can do cannot serve as a justification
for sex discrimination by the Government. And when he has en-
dorsed stereotyped notions again and again, his idea of what that
heightened scrutiny test really means is far different than what it
has been applied to mean and the way it has been used to strike
down discrimination against women in this country, and that
really is at the heart of my concern.

  Ms. LICHTMAN. Senator, may I jump in for a second?
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes.
  Ms. LICHTMAN. YOU know, constitutional protections for women
against sex discrimination are really rather new. They are some 20
years old. Modern constitutional protections date back only to 1971.
And therefore, the protections against providing, for instance,
Social Security to Mr. Weisenfeld when his wife died in childbirth
for their child, which the Social Security Administration had only
provided for moms, but not dads, before the mid-1970s, is some-
thing that we, are extraordinarily sensitive.
  Those rights are fragile. They are newly won, and they are ones
that we can't take risks with. And so when someone says, "I have
no quarrel with that," and then later says in response to a later
question, late Friday afternoon, to Senator DeConcinci, "I think
that it's important that when I don't know where I stand on some-
thing or I haven't reviewed it in detail that it's best for me to take
a step back and say I have no reason to disagree with it, rather
than saying I adopt it as mine." And that is what gives rise, it is
that kind of statement that gives rise to the uncertainty, the fear
of taking a risk.
  We can't afford to have unknowns about these important individ-
ual rights.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I understand that, and I happen to--well,
I could never address the issue as a woman could, ever. But I do
believe that, certainly my position on choice is very clear. I have
said that before and I won't get into it. But, because I do deeply
believe in it. It is not based on Constitution and stuff like that at
all, just real life. That is the only touchstone I put that on.
  But he did make--he has made some remarkable responses to
questions here about his compassion and his sensitivity, and when
you are quoting these things, and we are doing this a lot--we do
this here, I do it and the witnesses do it--but Judge Thomas said
that discrimination is a cancer on our society, and I am quoting
right from, you know, where we were talking about ratcheting up
to or applying a more exacting standard.
  I would be concerned if we were to see a movement down toward
the rational basis test, but I think discrimination and classifica-
tions based on race or sex are so damaging to our society and to
individuals in particular. And he goes on in that vein to speak of
those things, and he has all the while he was here before us.
                                         462

  And I think it was Professor King who was talking about your
terrible anguish about the sexual issues, no understanding of the
imperative to provide opportunities and choices, and then you
make some, I think, hard comments about him with regard to his
sister, who sat right here with him all the days of his testimony.

  But I think that, you know, the record clearly contradicts that
point of yours, if I may respectfully say. He played this key role at
the EEOC in convincing the Government to intervene in favor of
the plaintiffs in the Meritor Savings Bank case. That was ultimate-
ly decided that sex harassment on the job was covered by title VII
of the Civil Rights Act, and many women in this country have
greatly benefited by that decision.

  Wouldn't you think that that would show his understanding of
the plight of women in general and black women in particular?

  Ms. KING. Senator, with due respect for Judge Thomas when he
was testifying here, his words were wonderful to a large degree.
For me he was testifying. I think his record and what he has done,
his conduct, what life represents in actions, not words, suggests to
me that he does not in fact understand the plight of women of
color in this country.

  Let me give you one example. When he was chair of the EEOC,
the EEOC did not move to deal with forced sterilization policies in
a proper speedy manner, and indeed when they responded they
adopted a standard that was most favorable to employers.

  Frankly, I am horrified. If there is one thing that means some-
thing to black women in America it is to talk about forced steriliza-
tion, because women, black women in this country have been forc-
ibly sterilized.

  I simply call.attention to the fact that his statement about his
sister, and you will notice I have the greatest respect for his
sister--in fact, I think she demonstrates the capacities, the charac-
ter of a woman who is deserving, and deserving of more respectful
remarks from her brother than she got. I think she showed a great
deal of love and compassion to come and support him in this hear-
ing.

  Nonetheless, his statements about his sister I think betray a lack
of compassion, not only for black women, but for members of his
family, and his words during his testimony did nothing to make me
feel that he is concerned about anyone other than himself and indi-
viduals like him, and lacks understanding about the lives of other
black people and what it will take to rise out of the circumstances
that he himself found himself in when he was a young man.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I--you know I think we, Ms. Lichtman,
and I am combining you all because time is, obviously, limited to
us too, and the chairman is fair about that, but, you know, you
have made critical observations about his writings and his works.
Have you read all his decisions on the circuit court? Have you read
those?

  Ms. LICHTMAN. Between the people in my office and myself, I
have indeed reviewed many of the kinds of subject areas that his
decisions addressed. And, as you probably know, Senator, most of
them, if not almost all of them, concern regulatory decisions about
the subject of which we have not talked about either in our report
or in our comments.
                                               463

  So, to the extent that we reviewed them to see the extent to
which he had spoken to any of the things we were concerned about,
we did.

  Ms. GREENBERGER. YOU know, Senator Simpson, it is a very good
question. And there is a case that is pending now that Justice
Thomas heard as a member of the panel that deals with equal pro-
tection and sex discrimination of the laws in the context of the
FCC, and it tracks the very same kind of issue that was decided by
the Supreme Court last term in the Metro Broadcasting case,
whether or not it is constitutional to make affirmative efforts to
ensure that radio stations have a diversity of ownership.

  And the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of that
policy with respect to minorities. The very same issue is pending in
the D.C. Circuit now with respect to women-owned radio stations,
and the media and press had, in fact, printed some excerpts of the
oral argument and some of the questions that Judge Thomas asked.

  It was a case that was argued in January 1991, the end of Janu-
ary. Unfortunately, we haven't seen an opinion. It is surprising be-
cause I did look and I know that there has been a lot of pride on
the D.C. Court of Appeals for the short turnaround time between
the time cases are argued and the time they are decided, and for
the last 2 years they have been between 1 and 2, at most 3 months
is an average time for a decision, and we have been waiting for this
case for 8 months.

  Justice Thomas asked some very disturbing questions during
that oral argument. Perhaps he would have resolved those ques-
tions in a way that would allay our fears if that decision had come
down. I am sorry in all this 8 months it hasn't come down.

  And I might give you some flavor of the kind of question he
asked that caused the concern. And very briefly, he wanted to
know what are women's issues.

  Senator KENNEDY. Can I just say I think the time of the Senator
has expired. But I would hope that I would be the next questioner,
and you can use the response on my time.

  Ms. GREENBERGER. OK. Thank you.
  Senator SIMPSON. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. DO you want to--I would just at the outset
want to join in welcoming this panel to the committee. I think
Marcia Greenberger and Judith Lichtman have over a period of
years been in the forefront of the fight for equal opportunity and
equal rights from the really extremely important and critical time
in the decision of the Supreme Court decision, and all of us, I cer-
tainly do, take your comments and your testimony very seriously
and we thank you for the thoughtfulness
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Thank you.
  Ms. LICHTMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY [continuing]. With which the presentation has
been made.
  Ms. King, we are delighted to have you, a distinguished scholar
and thoughtful commentator on many of these same areas.
  If you would just continue. As I understand, you are now quoting
some of the questions raised by Judge Thomas when the circuit
court was considering a particular case involving the FCC and the
                                         464

role of women in terms of the ability to acquire radio stations, I
guess.

  Ms. GREENBERGER. That is right. Thank you, Senator Kennedy.
  And, as I said, we had really hoped that that decision would
come down and, in fairness, to see what the ultimate decision was.
Right now what we have are the questions that Senator Thomas--
that Judge Thomas rather, asked. But they are questions, and he
may have just been probing, but they are questions that reflect
concern.
  He asked what are women's issues? I am at a lost as to what dif-
ference there is. He was referring to having women own stations.
He said, "But what difference does it make if a woman owns a sta-
tion, or if women owned all the stations, other than that they own
the station? Does it make a difference in programming? Does it
make a difference in content of the points of view? Does it make a
difference in the editorials?
  Congress had made a judgment that diversity of ownership does
make a difference, but he was challenging that directive by Con-
gress to try to encourage diversity of ownership both, obviously, for
the public policy of having those business opportunities open, but
also for the advantage of hearing different perspectives and hear-
ing points of view.
  So, I am sorry an answer had came up in the context of Senator
Simpson's question. I wish we would have had that decision as a
way of looking at Judge Thomas on the bench. But so far his cases
have been primarily in areas that don't deal with the great consti-
tutional questions before us in the Supreme Court.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let me ask you, how--I should know. But how
is the timing for the release of the decisions decided? Who makes
that decision?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, I think probably it is up to the panel to
decide at what point, and each of the judges has to decide at what
point the decisions are ready for release.
  The 1990 statistics were--it is about 1.6 months on average be-
tween the time of argument and the time a decision comes down.
So, unfortunately, this one has been about 8 months so far.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let me ask you, are there other--do you con-
sider significant and important issues that are now working their
way to the circuit or the Supreme Court that you believe will be
extremely important in terms of equal opportunity for women?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, there are several key cases that involve
certainly constitutional protections under the equal protection
clause. This SEC case is a case in point, certainly, at some point I
suspect will work its way up to the Supreme Court, and whether
women have the same rights of diversity of ownership of the air-
waves as minorities do.
  There is the Virginia Military Institute case, the VMI case that
has gotten a lot of publicity. It deals with a school that gets large
sums of money from the State of Virginia, but allows no women,
and the lower court upheld the exclusion of women from the State
sponsored school, and the reasoning of the court really demon-
strates what I think is at the heart of our concern. It takes stereo-
type notions of women, it says that this is a rigorous, in fact, a very
punishing kind of atmosphere at VMI, and the women need more
                                         465

nurturing, and we have to change the whole kind of educational
setting, if we allowed women.

  That kind of broad-based stereotyping I do not think would sit
well with any on this panel here, and I know that the Justice De-
partment is appealing the case. I am hopeful ultimately it will be
overturned. But it is that kind of reasoning that we see with
Thomas Sowell, it is that kind of stereotyping that we saw, frankly,
with Justice Scalia in the opinion that Judge Thomas so praised
and said he hoped would form the majority opinion some day on
the Court.

  When he dealt with the Johnson v. Santa Clara County case and
said, well, women basically are not interested in these nontradi-
tional jobs, that is why we do not see them there, that is part of
Judge Scalia's opinion that Judge Thomas praised.

  We have cases coming up where women have been preempted
from juries under different standards than men. The Supreme
Court decided last term that is unacceptable on the basis of race,
but we have different conflicting lower court decisions, so we know
that issue is coming up. Women's basic ability to serve on juries is
at stake. So, there are really central issues before the Court.

  Senator KENNEDY. Let me ask, Ms. Lichtman, if Judge Thomas'
views had been the majority views on the Supreme Court in the
last 25 years, how would the society be different with regards to
women, based upon his writings, speeches, as well, I suppose, as the
extent of his testimony here would shed some light?

  Ms. LICHTMAN. Well, I think it is just the fragility of our new-
found 20-year-old, if you will, constitutional protections that make
us most worried. Marsha Greenberger a minute ago talked about
the case of Diane Joyce in Johnson v. Santa Clara County, a county
that had not ever had women in management positions, 258 jobs.
What Ms. Joyce wanted was the opportunity to compete, albeit in a
non-traditional job, and what Judge Thomas talked about was Jus-
tice Scalia's dissent, I fear, really, that that case could have been
decided differently.

  His criticism of Roe v. Wade, of cases like Griswold and Eisen-
statt, albeit some time before this hearing and not making very
clear exactly where he was on those decisions at all at this hearing,
I fear, as many of you have raised, for the most fundamental rights
of privacy, both marital privacy and privacy for single people.

  The rights of working women, the rights of family to social secu-
rity benefits, I could go on and on. When one endorses stereotypic
notions, as he has, in endorsing the works of Sowell and even in
offhand remarks as serious as I would suggest to you those offhand
remarks in the Lehrman piece, cause women's advocates and advo-
cates for working families and working people a great deal of con-
cern, and I fear that there was nothing that he did in the hearing
that allayed that concern.

  Senator KENNEDY. Let me ask Ms. King, the Judge talked I think
really quite eloquently and movingly, when he described the view
outside of his courtroom about the young blacks in buses on their
way to the court system, and even mentioned that it is only a small
difference between where he sat and he might have sat, in terms of
his own life's experience. He also talked about those people who
were sort of left out and left behind.
                                               466

  What insight can you provide, based upon your own understand-
ing of his actions, both in government speeches, in terms of the
poor, those that are left out and left behind, if his views were to
become a majority view on the Supreme Court? Would their inter-
ests, based upon his statements and his actions, be advanced or
threatened?

  Ms. KING. Senator, he has spoken quite eloquently about poor
people and about black people. I listened carefully at one point in
this hearing, when he was asked about preferences and he was
asked about his admission to Yale Law School. And he was asked, I
believe by Senator Specter, would he be willing to use that same
rationale with respect to a person who had a 10th grade education,
and the issue was employment.

  I listened very carefully for the Judge's answer, because it had
been quite clear about his admission to Yale, and I did not hear the
same statement about what the needs of a person with a 10th
grade education, the needs of the poor person or minority person
who was seeking employment. Employment is critical to many
other aspects of life, and I listened carefully and I did not hear an
answer, I must say, and that leads me to conclude or fear that,
while Judge Thomas is eloquent in talking about poor and minority
people, that when it comes to policies that are designed to make it
easier for people to have opportunities and to advance, then he
would suggest the policies that have been followed with success to
date, are the policies that he has difficulty with, affirmative action,
class action litigation, so I am at a loss to try to explain the differ-
ence between his words and his actions.

  Senator KENNEDY. My time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  The Senator from Utah.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to welcome all of you here today. I have appreciated lis-
tening to your testimony. Ms. King, the only thing that I saw dif-
ferently from Judge Thomas was that he just plain rejects the idea
of preferences, and there is a legitimate strong argument on his
side to do that. In fact, I think the majority of American people
would agree with him.
  The question is from there, if you do not have preferences, what
do you do to right these wrongs, and I think there is a legitimate
argument on both sides, a very good argument on both sides as to
what you should do.
  I happen to come down on the side that nobody should be dis-
criminated against, that literally we ought to right those wrongs in
the best way we can, but we should not do so by discriminating
against innocent people. But that to me is the only difference. I
think he will be, from my experience with Clarence Thomas and
watching him on the EEOC, I think he will be very much for
women's rights and other rights.
  Ms. Greenberger, let me just make one comment. I do not mean
to take the full 10 minutes, because I think you folks have had
enough questions asked of you. You know, having been before the
appellate courts, I would never read into what the Judge is asking
to determine in advance what he is thinking, because they ask
these puckish questions all the time and sometimes just to see
                                               467

what your answer is going to be and to see just what--you know,
they may be a little fuzzy on it and they may just want to have
some better answer than what presently exists in their mind.

  That reminds me a little bit of last year with Justice Souter,
why, even one of our eminent members of this committee used his
briefs against him. You know, when you start using the briefs of an
advocate against him when he comes up for a position like Justice
Souter came up for, Judge Souter then, you know, that I think is
the wrong thing.

  Advocates may put forth the best foot that they can for their cli-
ents, and they may not please us with some of their advocacy, but
nevertheless they do. The same thing, when the judge asks ques-
tions, that does not necessarily mean he is going to rule against
women or rule against the position that you think is right.

  I just point that out, because my whole experience with Judge
Thomas has been that he is really a very fair person, who really
does want to make the right decisions. Then again, maybe people
like Professor Carter, who has just written this recent book on af-
firmative action, Shelby Steele, who has written a wonderful book
that both sides have to admit is an intellectually compelling book. I
think Carter's is, as well, a wonderful book.

  Certainly, I would not discount Tom Sowell or any number of
other less liberal thinkers, less liberal African-American thinkers,
if you will, because they are creating a debate that is viable, be-
cause they are--like I say, there are arguments on both sides and
we are all working on it to see if we can come to good conclusions
to resolve them.

  You know, I really question, I think it is dubious to think that
because a judge asks questions from the bench that look like he is
going in one area or going in one direction, that that means he is. I
do not necessarily think it is. I think it means

  Ms. GREENBERGER. Senator Hatch, I just want to respond quickly
to your two points.

  Senator HATCH. Surely.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. First, I think there is much more at stake
than the differences on preferences, as important as that difference
may be.
  Senator HATCH. OK.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. When Judge Thomas, for example, was at the
head of the office for civil rights, he took the position that title IX
and other anti-discrimination laws didn't cover employment dis-
crimination. Ultimately, the Supreme Court rejected that position
and said employees were protected against discrimination in the
statutes. That has nothing to do with preference that would have
hurt individual employees who were intentionally discriminated
against from getting remedies from the Department of Education
and schools.
  As another example that we talked about on this panel, Judge
Thomas, when he was at the EEOC, took a very restrictive position
with respect to employer policies which intentionally and purpose-
ly excluded individual women of child-bearing years from high-
paying jobs. That has nothing to do with preferences.
  There is a pretty extensive report that we prepared and the
Women's Legal Defense Fund prepared of example after example--
                                          468

and I know time is short--of problems of narrow interpretations
with what our laws mean that have nothing to do with preferences,
but have to do with defining out of the law purposeful and inten-
tional discrimination, and that is of major concern.

  Senator HATCH. I understand, but I remember, you know, these
are very intricate difficult questions of law that have been debated
pro and con by the very best minds on both sides of the equation,
sometimes liberals arguing for what the EEOC did and sometimes
arguing on the other side.

  I think we brought out yesterday that the Supreme Court basi-
cally adopted what he was saying, but it did go a little bit further.

  Ms. GREENBERGER. NO, it was not basic at all.
  Senator HATCH. Well
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Maybe some others want to talk about that,
but there was as fundamental and critical difference between
  Senator HATCH. Yes, there was, it went farther than what Judge
Thomas
  Ms. GREENBERGER [continuing]. Between what the Supreme
Court in nine votes accepted and the position that Judge Thomas
advocated when he was at the EEOC. He was rejected by nine Jus-
tices in the most critical of issues that have enormous importance
for women's employment rights.
  Senator HATCH. My point is that does not necessarily make it
wrong. He did the best he could. He was not as far as you were or
the Court would be, but that does not mean that he is anti-women
or anti-anything. My goodness, people differ on these very intricate
difficult issues. Now, if he is wrong, I think he would be the first to
admit that he was wrong and that the Court overruled him.
  On the other hand, I have seen him fight very, very hard to try
and enforce the equal employment laws of this country, and he did
a job better than anybody I have seen at the EEOC in the whole
almost 16 years I have been in the Congress and even before then.
  Now, is it perfect, are there not things you can criticize? Of
course there are, but, then again, that is true of you, it is true of
me, it is true of everybody. Well, I do not want to keep you, but I
am just saying that I think it is not as cut and dried or as black
and white or as difficult as we tend to make it. There are differ-
ences, there are legitimate differences, there are well-reasoned dif-
ferences, there are honest differences, and sometimes he will be
right and you will be wrong, and sometimes you will be right and
he will be wrong. I mean that is just the way it is.
  Ms. KING. Senator, if I might. I think that one of the major
points is that when given an opportunity, Judge Thomas has adopt-
ed cramped or pinched views, and let me give you an example.
  I was the Deputy Director of the Office of Civil Rights in the
Nixon administration, and at that time in which we administered
title IX--it was actually passed during that period--and we admin-
istered title VI, it was our view that employment was, in fact, cov-
ered. This precedes Judge Thomas.
  What I think that we have to worry about is does he--and we do
worry about it--does he seek opportunities, the way it almost
comes down, does he seek opportunities to adopt these very pinched
and cramped statutory interpretations? Is he indeed reversing or
                                         469

going backward, rather than forward, in providing opportunities?
And I think that is what we are stressing.

  We are not just talking about stereotypes of women, at least I
am not. I am also talking about the fact that a good portion of the
minority community in this country are women, and we women
benefit from, and suffer, because we are both minority and because
we are female. So we suffer from the stereotypes, but we also suffer
from the fact that we too get caught by the lack of opportunities.

  And I think that the point here is that some of us at least feel
that he seems to reach for the opportunity to adopt a more pinched
version. Now, that is not to say that within the African American
community that we cannot have multiple views, multiple strate-
gies, and indeed we shouldn't have a vigorous debate about what
some of the remedies should be.

  But, as some of the professors pointed out on the panel this
morning, Judge Thomas doesn't seem to be in the mainstream, and
I think that is worthy of note. I mean, there are some point at
which, not by himself, but I certainly wouldn't put him in the
center, and I think that that is worthy of note, even though I quite
agree with you that there is room on all sides of this debate for
different views and different strategies.

  I would also point out that we are waiting to get a clearer view
of Judge Thomas' strategy because the only thing that we have
been able to infer is either that he lacks one or that he wants to
cut back on those remedies that have proven effective in the past.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I respect all three of you, and you are all
three very intelligent lawyers and thinkers, and I have had enough
experience to know that I don't want to really get in a tough
debate with any of you. You are very, very good.

  But let me just say that that has not been my experience with
Judge Thomas, and I think Guido Calabresi, the Yale Law School
dean, said that he is definitely in the mainstream. You may not
agree with him on everything, but he is definitely within the main-
stream, and within the legitimate mainstream. And I agree with
that.

  But there are differences and I am glad that--we will keep work-
ing on them and see what we can do to bring people together.

  But thank you for being here.
  Ms. KING. Thank you.
  Senator HATCH. I enjoyed listening to you and appreciate your
testimony.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, I don't believe I have any ques-
tions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have no questions for this
panel.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. I have no questions. I have read all three state-
ments. They are excellent. I think, Professor King, your statement
was more than excellent, it was eloquent, and I thank you.
  Ms. KING. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Brown.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                         470

  Ms. Greenberger, you had mentioned earlier in helping us with
some background on the Judge that he hadn't read what he had
signed, and I was wondering if that was testimony that you had
heard or what the source of that was.

  Ms. GREENBERGER. Yes. In the White House working group paper
on the family, there were a number of very troublesome statements
that that report contained, including a challenge to the appropri-
ateness of a Supreme Court decision, the Moore case that dealt
with the right to privacy, protecting a family, of a grandmother
living with her two grandsons who were cousins.

  Senator BROWN. I am familiar with that case.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. And that that violated the zoning ordinance.
And that particular White House report among other things chal-
lenged that case as being wrongly decided, and Judge Thomas had
been part of the group that signed onto that report.
  His response was that he wrote only one section of the report
and had never read the rest of the report that had contained a lot
of very troublesome and controversial positions.
  Senator BROWN. Your view of it is that he signed that report?

   Ms. GREENBERGER. Yes.

  Senator BROWN. He physically signed the report.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, I don't--he was indicated as one of the
preparers and supporters of the report, and there was nothing on
the basis of that document when we certainly looked at it to give
us any indication that when his name was on the report as part of
the Working Group there was anything in the report that he dis-
agreed with.
  He said in his testimony he didn't read many sections of the
report, and only read the one section on low income families that
he prepared, and that was how he distinguished what some of the
troublesome statements were in the report from what he said his
views were.
  Senator BROWN. I think it is important to get the facts on the
record. First of all, he never signed anything, by your own admis-
sion. That report was not signed.
  Second
  Ms. GREENBERGER. I think I said signed off on.
  Senator BROWN. Perhaps I took the notes incorrectly.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. But certainly I think for the public reading it,
and I think we did try to be as careful as we could, it was certainly
our impression that as part of the Working Group it was a report
that he endorsed and supported. There were no dissenting views
that he signed off on or indicated.
  Senator BROWN. Well, I--on the contrary, the folks who helped
put that report together very clearly indicated that he had not au-
thored the section that you found objectionable, that there was no
attempt to link him to that section that you found objectionable,
that his involvement, indeed, was limited to a working paper that
he presented.
  I find that concerning. To suggest that you are responsible for
something someone else has put together, obviously, does not get us
to a good judgment of that candidate.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Senator Brown, I just do want to stop and say,
if someone else put a report together and he had no connection to
                                         471

it, I wouldn't ever suggest that he had a responsibility for it. This
was a report that had his name on it, and it was a very natural
and honest expectation that since his name was on it it was a
report that he supported. It had no--it didn't, there were no dis-
senting views indicated.

  And certainly in the general debate about that report, it was
very controversial, there were no public statements he had ever
issued after it was released disavowing any of its positions. It was
only during the confirmation hearings when the question was
raised that he said that there were aspects of the report that he
had nothing to do with it in terms of drafting, but also had never
read.

  And that may have been his method of operation
  Senator BROWN. YOU know, the drafters--it may not have been
that you had a chance to listen to that, but the people that put
that report together had indicated that he had not seen that por-
tion of the report that you are concerned about. It had not been
circulated to him. That he did not contribute it--to it. And he does
not claim it.
  Your own report, on page 45, makes I think a very significant
charge and, obviously, a very serious one. It says, "In Judge
Thomas' view the Court may not rely on the constitutional right to
privacy to prevent a legislature from, for example, limiting the
number of children a family may have or require, or requiring the
sterilization of certain individuals so long as the State could articu-
late a rational reason for the policy."
  Obviously, that is a very extreme view and a great seriousness.
May I inquire where that information came from?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. When we prepared this report, we took Judge
Thomas' written record and statements at face value, and there
has been a lot of discussion since that time about the fact that
when he came to testify he had said that he didn't mean to imply
certain things that many people have said.
  Senator BROWN. Well, no. No. My question is where is it you got
that from?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, then let me go back and be very specif-
ic. He did, for example, refer to Griswold and the right to privacy
as an invented right. He did have his name on this working group
paper which challenged the Moore case and challenged the right to
privacy.
  Senator BROWN. I am sorry. The question that I asked, you have
given a description of the Judge's view.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. That we took based on what he himself had
endorsed, in our view, and which many people assumed he had en-
dorsed and meant. What he has come in and
  Senator BROWN. Well, the fact that he specifically states that he
had never seen that
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Well, we, of course, didn't
  Senator BROWN [continuing]. Did not author it.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Right.
  Senator BROWN. Does this mean that this portion of your report
is no longer valid?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. NO. I think that part of what our testimony
today does is take what we had looked at, at the written record,

        56-271 0--93 16
                                          472

and when this report was prepared it was on the basis of his en-
forcement record, his statement, his writings, and compare those to
his testimony and see if some of our concerns that were reflected
from his record were allayed by his testimony.

  Unfortunately, and I do mean that, rather than our fears being
allayed, they were heightened. In the area of privacy, he did say at
the hearings that he did agree with the Moore case, and what he
said at the hearings, as I understand it, was he hadn't read the sec-
tion of the report that criticized the Moore case.

  So it was
  Senator BROWN. But specifically here
  Ms. GREENBERGER. It was some moment that he said that he
agreed with
  Senator BROWN. Excuse me. I am trying to get the source. I am
hoping you can say we got this statement from somewhere. To say
that someone would allow forced sterilization is a very serious
charge. I would hope you would be willing to share with us where
you found that information.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. The right to privacy has been used to prohibit
the government from forcing individuals to be sterilized. It is the
right to privacy as it applies to procreation for married persons
and for single people. That the text thereof
  Senator BROWN. Didn't the Judge specifically state
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, can the witness be permitted
to answer the question without interruption?
  Senator BROWN. Well, I would like to have the witness answer
the question.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, maybe they can answer it whatever way
that they like.
  Senator BROWN. I believe this is my time, Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY. Can they answer it the way that they--they
are witnesses. We have followed--it has been very orderly. I would
like to hear the witness respond to the question.
  Senator BROWN. Well, I believe it is my time, Senator.
  Senator KENNEDY. But the committee, the Chair is entitled to
ensure that the witnesses are going to be treated courteously.
  The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen? You are OK, aren't you?
  Ms. GREENBERGER. I would appreciate being able to finish be-
cause I think I can respond to your concerns.
  Senator BROWN. Sure. I would appreciate it.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. Thank you, Senator Kennedy. I am happy to
go forward.
  The right of privacy is of such enormous concern as it affects
procreation. Because of the right to contraception and the right to
abortion, but also so that women have a right not to be sterilized
and have a right to have children. It is both sides of the equation,
as Justice O'Connor herself recognized in questions that she has
asked on this issue.
  If there is not a strong right to privacy that protects not only
married individuals but single people too, we in this country do not
have a strong right to protect against sterilization, against being
forced not to have children or to have abortions against our will, as
well as the right to have them.
                                               473

  When Judge Thomas came, and we know there have been so
many questions on his views on the right to privacy, he was ques-
tioned again and again about the right to procreation, including
sterilization, I would assume implicitly. And what his views were,
he said that he thought there was a marital right to privacy.

  But when he was questioned, for example, by Senator Biden, does
that apply to single people, I think there was a real ambiguity and
there was a grave moment where it seemed as if he said yes. But
then there was the break, and Judge Thomas came back and start-
ed talking about equal protection. That if there was a right for
married persons there would be a right for single people on equal
protection, not on right to privacy grounds, and that is so central
in terms of whether we as individuals have these rights.

  And, unfortunately, and I cannot underscore how unfortunate I
think it is, I didn't hear what I hoped to hear. That Judge Thomas
would allay some of these concerns that apply far more broadly
than abortion, even more broadly than contraception, but to the
very right to have a child, not to be sterilized, for all Americans in
this country.

  Senator BROWN. Let me just observe, because the time has run
out, the question was what the source of this very serious charge
was. The report that makes this very serious charge was written
and published before the hearings that have been referred to, not
afterwards.

  Ms. GREENBERGER. That is right.
  Senator BROWN. SO it does not appear what was said in the hear-
ings could be the source of
  Ms. GREENBERGER. I was responding, Senator Brown, to your
question to me of whether there was something in the hearings
that allayed the concerns that were in the report.
  Senator BROWN. I guess my question throughout this has been
the source of this very serious charge where he said that he would
allow sterilization.
  Ms. GREENBERGER. The source again--and it is a 75-page report,
and there are a lot of footnotes and a lot of references in the report
to the written record, but based on that record before the hearings.
The sources included that White House Working Group, which he
later disavowed in the hearings, the sources included his question-
ing of Griswold and the right to privacy is an invented right. The
sources included his footnote questioning of the validity of Roe v.
Wade from conservatives, of which he included himself as one. The
source included some references in political statements and other
places he had made with respect to abortion and right to privacy.
  So, there are a number of sources that are cited that were the
basis of our concerns when the report was written, and, as we dis-
cussed, those concerns were only heightened after the testimony.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. AS I understand, Judge Thomas was as part of
the working group and the report was a working group report. I
think the record speaks for itself.
  I have no further questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from South Carolina.
                                          474

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like to welcome the distinguished ladies here testifying.
At this time, I have no questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. There are a few questions that I may submit in
writing. You have answered my questions already.
  I am as concerned as you are about issues raised--privacy, the
answers on Eisenstadt and others. I am not certain that he was as
equivocal or supportive as you think he was, but I acknowledge
that I had to keep coming back to the issue, because his answers
were not always to the point. I am going to have to rely on the
record to make that judgment myself, and I have not yet reviewed
it at this point. But I do truly appreciate your testimony. It was
informative and articulate, as usual.
  Professor King, your opening statement was as illuminating as it
was moving, and I want to thank you for sharing it with us. Thank
you very much.
  Ms. KING. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. With that, we will thank this panel and move to
our last panel for today, but not least important, by any stretch of
the imagination.
  Our next panel will be Ms. Emily Holifield, a member of the
Compton, California Chapter of the NAACP; Ms. Evelyn Bryant,
president of the Liberty County, Georgia Chapter of the NAACP;
and Ms. Diane Frazier, commissioner, from the Chatham County,
GA.
  I welcome all three of you. I see a fourth person making his way
here and I do not have a name. I did not have Reverend Haygood's
name on this list.
  Reverend, have you been invited to testify?
  Reverend HAYGOOD. I believe so, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am just curious. We are trying to find out who
you are, that is all.
  Reverend HAYGOOD. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Rev. Lawrence F. Haygood, from Tuskegee, AL. Welcome, Rever-
end. Please have a seat.
  Reverend HAYGOOD. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Reverend, I was not in any way implying that
you should not testify, I would just like to know who is testifying,
so I can properly introduce them. Welcome. Did you drive all the
way up from Alabama today?
  Reverend HAYGOOD. AS a matter of fact, I got the train, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU got the train, Amtrak. God Bless Amtrak.
Were it not for Amtrak, some of us would not be here, myself in-
cluded. I hope you enjoyed your trip.
  Now, I thank you all. This is late in the day, I am delighted to
have you all here. I am anxious to hear what you have to say. Has
the panel concluded how they would like to start and who should
speak first, or should we go in the order that you were called. We
will go in the order called.
  Ms. Holifield, thank you very much for coming, and please let us
hear what you have to say, and please keep it to 5 minutes.

STATEMENT OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF EMILY HART-HOLI-
  FIELD, COMPTON, CA; EVELYN BRYANT, LIBERTY COUNTY, GA;
  DEANIE FRAZIER, COMMISSIONER, CHATHAM COUNTY, GA;
  AND REV. LAWRENCE F. HAYGOOD, TUSKEGEE, AL

  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Senator, just for the record, in order to try to con-
form with the 5 minutes, I would like to have my whole testimony
entered into the record, but I am going to skip through the state-
ment.

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be.
  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. We appreciate the difficulty in cutting it to 5
minutes. I am not sure it is true, but someone once told me that
Thomas Jefferson said, "I would have written you a shorter letter,
except I did not have the time," I am paraphrasing it. So, it is
hard, and I appreciate that. Thank you for trying.
  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Thank you very much.
  Honorable Chairman Biden and honorable Senators of this great
Senate committee, I am Emily Hart-Holifield, an educator em-
ployed by the Compton Unified School District. I am a Compton
Community College senior trustee member. Further, I am the
person who seconded the famous motion on Saturday, July 20,
1991, at a regular meeting of the Compton Branch of the NAACP,
to support Judge Clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee for
appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Mr. Chairman, little did I know that this action taken by the
NAACP Compton, CA branch, would echo all around this Nation,
waking people up and causing them to really think. I have named
this motion, Mr. Chairman, "A candle, a flame for mankind."

  Mr. Chairman, I am supporting Judge Clarence Thomas, because
I feel that he will make an excellent judge, a judge that will repre-
sent all of the people throughout this Nation. Judge Clarence
Thomas is qualified, is a role model and has developed a philosophy
of self-help and self-reliance, and I do not see anything wrong with
that.

  Senators at this time, I cannot think of a more timely cycle than
now for the self-help and self-reliance program that U.S. Supreme
Court Judge Clarence Thomas will be able to implement as soon as
you honorable Senators have confirmed him to this appointment.

  Honorable Senator Kennedy, whom I have had and still do have
a lot of respect for, I would like for these pictures to enter into the
record as a beautiful school in Compton, CA, that bears his name-
sake and carries the legacy for his name and his family name in
Compton, CA.

  I live about IV2 miles from Robert F. Kennedy Elementary
School, in Compton, CA, and I wanted to say for the record, Sena-
tor Kennedy--he is not here now, but I want the record to reflect--
when I go through this area each morning on my way to work, I
am reminded of the respectful work that the Kennedy family car-
ried out during the civil rights movement. I am reminded, Senator,
that you gave so much, your precious sacrifices can never be
bought, paid for or forgotten.

  I am reminded that you and your family are winners, and I am
also reminded that when Judge Clarence Thomas is confirmed, he
                                         476

will also be a winner in the 1990's, and he too will have a legacy,
one that he so well deserves.

  All of the Senators here today, I would like to say to you, I do
not believe that Judge Clarence Thomas could have come from his
impoverished background and forget his background now. I do not
believe that Judge Clarence Thomas will forget his mother or his
sister or any unfortunate group. I do not believe that he will forget
the struggles that he has experienced to get him where he is today,
soon to be a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, when you confirm him.
Senators, I do not believe that Judge Clarence Thomas will forget
the trust that each of you put in him.

  With these points in mind, I believe that Judge Clarence Thomas
will be the judge to help guide us through the U.S. Supreme Court
and to the next century and far beyond the year 2000.

  Honorable Senators, when I seconded the motion on Saturday,
July 20, 1991, to support Judge Clarence Thomas, at the regular
Compton, CA Branch NAACP meeting, I never dreamed that this
seconded motion would be unanimously supported by all members
present, with a 32-to-0 vote. I never dreamed that the echoes that
would go around this Nation would be so widespread all over this
great Nation. I never dreamed that this action on behalf of Judge
Clarence Thomas by the NAACP Compton Branch would cause so
many people to reactivate their critical thinking skills.

  Honorable Senators, I never dreamed that this little cotton-
picker from the plantations of Louisiana would ever be able to
present herself on behalf of anyone, and especially in front of the
great Members of the U.S. Senate.

  Honorable members, I want to thank you for the golden opportu-
nity, for listening to me today, Tuesday, September 17, 1991. Sena-
tors, I am proud of each of you, and I am proud of Judge Clarence
Thomas, and I am thankful to President George Bush for nominat-
ing him.

  As I have previously stated, Senators, the NAACP Compton
Branch, in July, on July 20, 1991, voted to support Judge Clarence
Thomas for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, and this
action sparked a very positive interest in people thinking all over
the Nation, regardless of color, regardless of ethnic background,
and even regardless of gender.

  There was an article that I wish you to read and to remember,
presented by Mrs. Margaret-Bush Wilson. As you note for the
record, Senators, Mrs. Margaret-Bush Wilson was the executive di-
rector of the NAACP, and she is on record not supporting the
present position of the NAACP.

  Honorable Senators, you are important and you mean so much to
me and the people around these United States. Your votes will be
counted for confirming Judge Clarence Thomas' successful appoint-
ment to the U.S. Supreme Court, making it possible for him to
move with his work on and helping to strengthen affirmative
action programs, and thus making it possible for affirmative action
programs to work, so everyone in this Nation can prosper. He has
stated that affirmative action programs are not working now for
everyone, and I certainly agree.
                                        477

  Honorable Senators, I would like to remind you of a brief state-
ment made by Judge Thomas at a National Institute for Employ-
ment Equity, on May 26, 1984, where he stated:

  I have heard it stated over and over again that we as a Nation have done enough
and that the doors of opportunity for women, blacks, Hispanics, and those of other
national origin and religion have been opened, that the laws against injustice are on
the books, and the people are tired of the plight of the minorities. Well, no one is
more tired of the plight than the Nation's minorities. No one is more worn out by
the fight to stay decent and respectful, to stand in the midst of the squalor of East
Harlem and look out toward the towering spires of power in Manhattan, less than
30 or 40 blocks away, and say there the doors of opportunity are opened to say noth-
ing. The question is how do I get there. Those 40 blocks, those short 40 blocks are,
for many, a lifetime.

  I want to thank you. If I do have some time, I will come back.
Thank you very much, Senator.

seconded the Famous Motion on Saturday July 20, 1991 at a regular
meeting cf the Compton Branch of the NAACP to support Judge
clarence Thomas, President Bush's nominee for appointment to the
United States Supreme Court.

         Mr. Chairman, little did I know that this action taken by

i I have named this motion, Mr. Chairman, "A candle, a Flame
for Mankind".
                                      479

          Mr. Chairman, I am supporting Judge Clarence Thomas because

 he will make an excellent United States Supreme

 Court Justice who will represent all the people of these United

 states. Judge Clarence Thomas is qualified, is a role model and

 has developed a philosophy of self help and self reliance.

          Senators, at this time, I cannot think of a more timely

 cycle than now, for the Self Help and Self Reliance Program that

United States Supreme Court Judge Clarence Thomas will be able to

 implement as Boon as you, Honorable Senators here confirm him to

  i

    t

this appointment.

  > Honorable senator Xennedy, I would like to say to you that

 i

your namesake has a legacy in Compton. I live about a mile and a

 ; Senator Kennedy, when I go through this area each morning

on my way to work, I am reminded, Senator, of the respectable

work that your family carried out during the civil Rights

Movement. I am reminded, Senator, that you gave so much and that

  your precious sacrifices can never be bought, paid for or

  forgotten.. I am reminded Senator, that you and your family are

 winners, and I am also reminded that when Judge Clarence Thomas

 is confirmed, he too will also be a winner in the nineties, and

 he too, will also have a legacy, one that he so well deserves.

      i

          To all Senators here today, I would like to say to you - I

 do not believe that Judge Clarence Thomas could have come from

 his impoverished background, and forget his background. I do not

 believe that Judge Clarence Thomas will forget his Mother or his
  ;

sister arid other unfortunate groups. I do not believe that he

will forcret the struggles that he has experienced to get him

where he is today, soon to be a United States Supreme Court

Justice when you confirm him, and Senators, I do not believe that

 i

Judge clarence Thomas will forget the trust that you put in him.

 j Witi these points in mind, I believe that Judge Clarence

Thomas will be the Judge to help guide us through the United

 Branch in July voted to support Judge Clarence Thomas for
 appointment to the United States supreme Court, and this action
 sparked a very positive interest in people thinking all over the
 nation, regardless of color, regardless of ethnic background, or
 even regardless of gender.

          I weuld like to say, Honorable Senators, that I am in the
 process of writing the transcript for a book, and that because of

   i
 this issue of Judge Clarence Thomas' appointment to the United
states Supreme Court, which is symbolic of "a candle, a flame for
nankind" that was sparked out of Compton, California, this book
is estimated to sell at least thirty-two million copies based

 i

upon the 32 votes counted on July 20, 1991 for Judge Clarence
Thomas at our NAACP meeting.

         Honarable members of this great Senate, I have read
articles and speeches by others and by Judge clarence Thomas. I
am particularly impressed by an article written by Margaret Bush-
Wilson, who is an Attorney in St. Louis, whoi phaired the National

                                                       .5 .
   483

Board of Directors of the National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People from 1975 to 1984. This article

    i

appeared in the Washington Post news on Tuesday, August 6, 1991.
   i

  i The article provides the opportunity for persons to know

   i

that Mrs. Bush-Wilson is acquainted with Judge Clarence

Thomas. She moves forward to tell the warm hearted story of how

she first heard of a bright young nan from Yale University, who

was about. 20 years old at the time. She heard of Judge Clarence
 I

Thomas from his employer, Senator to-be John Danforth from

Missouri who was Attorney General at the time. Mrs. Bush-Wilson

ajtated that Mr. Danforth hired young Clarence Thomas, and asked

   i
   i

if she knew of a place that this young nan could live for the

  i

 I

summer while studying for the Missouri State Bar.

Mrs. Bush-Wilson indicated that her son Robert, was a law student

 j

tfith plains to work that summer in Washington. She invited young

Clarence Thomas to stay in her son's eapty room. Mrs. Bush-

wiison said that she did not recall seeing another young person

as disciplined as Clarence Thomas. First thing- everyday, he

:  6'
                                   484

 would exercise with her son's weights, and then went off to his

 studies. She said that she asked of him only one thing -- that

 she prepare his dinner, and that he show up on tine. She went on
   !

 tp describe how they would eat together every night, often with

 on or two friends or relatives and talk about any and all the
   I

 problems of the world.
   !
  I Mrs. Bush-Wilson further stated the Judge Clarence Thomas

    i

wsas a conservative even then, but was impressed, Hrs. Bush-

    i
    i

Wilson wont on to say, with one so young, whose reasoning was so

Hound. " must also admit, she states, that his arguments, both

legal and logical, forced her to rethink some of her own views1

She said that Judge clarence Thomas knew how to listen as well as

talk. Even when they disagreed, she said she found him to be a

i

siensitivi and compassionate person trying to do what is right,

and working to make the world a better place. She went on to say

that back then she sensed that he would one day be in a position

to have a larger impact, but had no way of knowing that this
                                      485

 determine*! young man might one day have the chance to tackle some

 of our country's problems on this nation's highest Court.

 Mrs. Bush-Wilson states as a Supreme Court Justice, Clarence

 I

 Thomas will continue to defend and protect the rights of the
   I

     i

 needy, that he does not permit anyone to think for him and he is

 intellectually honest.

         Honorable Chairman, the record must reflect that the former

NAACP National Board Chair respectfully disagrees with the

M^ACP's present position.
  I

         Honorable senators, I do not know Judge clarence Thomas

  i

personally, but I feel that I do, based not upon his color, but

  i

father focusing upon his qualifications as a Judge who is

uniquely qualified to represent everyone as a United States

Supreme Court Judge, a man of quality, who happens to be black

and who Mill represent all people regardless of their ethnic

 i

origin.
                                       486

          Honorable Senators, you cannot afford to select a Judge to

 represent only black citizens in these United States. The United

 States Supreme Court Judge must represent all the people.

          Honorable Senators, I believe, and I feel, that Judge

 Clarence Thomas should not be prevented from serving his country

 as a Supreme Court Justice just because he is obviously black,

 president. George Bush's nominee, and is forty three years old.

         At 21 General Meeting of "Women Employed" on March 30, 1983,

Judge Clarence Thomas on his stand of Affirmative Action stated
  i
"But with the exception of quotas, I support Affirmative Action
 I
remedies because the remedies which are truly necessary to make
 i
individual rights a meaningful reality are either not yet on the

books, or have not been traditionally used.11

i

1 Judye Clarence Thomas has indicated that Affirmative Action
i
should be revised and his appointment to the United states

supreme Court will give Affirmative Action a plan and a new

directicn for this nation.
                                      487

          Honorable Senators, you are important, and you mean so much
 to millions of people across the United States. Your votes will
 be counted for confirming Judge Clarence Thomas' successful
 appointment to the United States Supreme Court, making it
 possible for him to move with his work, help straighten out
 Affirmative Action, and thus making it possible for Affirmative
 Action to work in these United States across the board, and in
 order for everyone to have a chance to prosper.

         Honorable Senators, I would like to remind you of a brief
:?ew statements made by Judge Thomas at the Kational Institute for
 I
Employment Equity on Kay 26, 1984, where he stated "I have heard
it said over and over again, that we as a nation, have dona
enough, and that the doors of opportunity for women, blacks,
hispanics, and those of other National Origins and religion have
been opened. That the laws against injustice are on the books,
and the people are tired of the plight of minorities. Well no
one is wore tired of the plight than the nation's minorities. No
one is nore worn out by the fight to stay decent and respectful.

                                                       10 .
                                      488

 To stand in the midst of the squalor of East Harlem and look out
 toward the towering spires of power in Manhattan, less than
 thirty, or forty blocks away, and say there the doors of
 opportunity are opened to say nothing. The question is how do I
 get there? Those forty blocks, those short forty blocks are for
 many a life time journey".

         Honorable senators, you have the answer in your hands for
Judge Clarence Thomas to become a United States Supreme Court
justice. All the Honorable members of this great Senate have to
do is juiit push him, and Judge Thomas will fall through the door,
He is close enough. Yes it would be nioe when you hold his hand
and walk him through that door, but I bag of you Senators, just

 i

^ush him, he will fall through the door, he is willing to fall
inside the door. I personally would like to sea him walk through
the door with dignity and pride but I will also challenge a push

i

with the same magnitude of pride.

i

i I am further impressed by Tony Brown's Comments July 25,
1991 in the Nationally syndicated column by an article titled
                                       489

 "Clarence Thomas Could Save Black Colleges if Blacks Don't Get
 Him First". In vowing to destroy Judge Clarence Thomas' career
 and deny a black man a seat on the United States Supreme Court.
 Somewhere I learned, or read, that the "Congressional Black
 Caucus" consisting basically of all one party flopped its wings
 like EagleB, and flew into the shadows of partisan color lines,
 stood up, and proudly denounced our able Judge clarence Thomas
 for appointment to the United Sates Supreme court. By the nature
 of this fiction, the Black Caucus members are declaring themselves
 out in space and out of touch with the problems and issues as
they relate to Black Americans today. Honorable Senators/ twenty
ilix blades in Congress do not represent 30 million people anymore
than 26 whites in Congress who represent 200 million white
people, not ignoring every other ethnic group.

i

        During a speech at Compton Community College on February 14,
1986, Judge Thomas stated "Do not become obsessed with all that
is wrong with our race. We are not beggars or objects of
Charity. Rather, become obsessed with looking for solutions to

                                                       12,
                 490

   our problems." "Be tolerant", Judge Thomas stated, "of all the

   positive .ideas, their numbers is smaller that the countless

   number of problems to be solved. We need all the hope and help

   w can get."

   Honorable Senators, I wholeheartedly agree with Judge

   Thomas' statements, senator, I hope that you will become more

   tolerant of a man who has been appointed by the united States
     i

   Senate to serve, and he has on the Equal Employment Opportunity
    i

   commission, and also to serve as Jude, United States Court of

   Appeals 1'or the District of Columbia circuit Court from 1990 to
    i

   the present.

    j Honorable Chairman, Judge Thomas is a role model for our

    I
   youth, a:.id our country. He will be a good United State Supreme

   Court Judge, representing everyone throughout these United states
   i
   pn scales of fairness with Justice.

   i

   I Honorable Senators, I cannot believe that in the wee hours

pt the right Judge clarence Thomas will not remember his path

from poverty as he climbed the hills from Pinpoint, Georgia. I

                                      491

 cannot believe that judge Clarence Thomas' successful appointment
 that you will make happen by your votes for him will become a
 vote that ia outside Americas's future, and outside the trust
 that you put in him. I cannot believe that Judge Thomas will
 forget in the quietness of the night, that he was born an Afro-
 Aiaerican, a man whose family is black. I do believe that Judge
 Clarence Thomas will carry the banner in these United Sates, for
 motivation and inspiration for our youth, the banner of dreams
 and hard work are realities for youth, and the banner of hope,
 faith, fairness and justice for all for everyone throughout this
nation. He will carry the banner for fairness and justice for
erne and i'or all as a Judge of the United States Supreme Court.
 ; Honorable Senators, I see Judge Clarence Thomas holding his
position that you will appoint him to as Judge of the United
States Supreme court. Honorable Chairman, we are closer to our
 i
Supreme Court Judge now, and I know that his Self Help and Self
i
Reliance philosophy will not serve as a negative that will hinder

                                                       14

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. We are proud of your tes-
timony. I realize that this is an imposing room, and with everyone
watching us on television, it is not necessarily an easy thing to pop
in and say, by the way, I have got a few words I want to say.

   Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes.

   The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate it. You have done it well.
   Ms. Bryant, take your time, be at ease, do not worry about it, but
when that little red light goes out, the seat will reject you into the

   I am only teasing you, but try to keep it close to 5 minutes.
  Ms. BRYANT. I will.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.

                     STATEMENT OF EVELYN BRYANT

  Ms. BRYANT. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my
name is Evelyn Bryant, and I would like to thank the committee
for this opportunity to speak in support of my friend Judge Clar-
ence Thomas.

  I live in Liberty County, GA, and serve as president of the Liber-
ty County NAACP chapter. I appear here today not in my capacity
as president of our local chapter, but as a friend of Clarence
Thomas. I do believe that my comments reflect the opinion of the
vast majority of black Americans, including my friends and my
neighbors.

  While Judge Thomas grew up in Pin Point, near Savannah, his
grandparents owned a farm near Sunbury, in eastern Liberty
County. He spent much of his youth on that farm developing the
values which have become a hallmark of his life and achievements.
I have not had the pleasure of knowing Judge Thomas for a long
period of time, but have developed a great respect for him during
the short time we have been friends.

  It was a proud day for the citizens of southeast Georgia, black
and white, when President Bush nominated Judge Thomas to the
Supreme Court. This man, a product of the marshlands of the
Georgia coast, the son of a section of the country rich in colonial
history, at age 43, has accomplished so much.

  Clarence Thomas was born into and grew up in a segregated soci-
ety. His early years were spent in poverty. He lived his early life in
an environment that exposed daily to the abuses of social and eco-
nomic systems based upon the separation of black and white citi-
zens in all aspects of life.

  He is a person who has lived the black experience to the ulti-
mate, yet, rather than blaming the system for any stumbling
blocks to personal achievement, has, through hard work, discipline,
commitment to strong values and his belief in our system of gov-
ernment, risen from his humble beginnings to the nomination by
our President to the Nation's highest court. His sense of values
were born and nurtured in a strong home and religious environ-
ment. Truly, this is an extraordinary man who conquered depriva-
tion, without self-pity or complaint.

  Judge Thomas has acknowledged that he has received a helping
hand up from time to time in his educational and professional jour-
ney. He has graciously acknowledged this help and has expressed
                                         495

appreciation to those who have befriended him along the way. But
isn't it reasonable to believe that the availability and accessibility
to those helping hands have been influenced by the character traits
demonstrated by Clarence Thomas. If we will only acknowledge it,
haven't all of us achieved much in this life, received help and as-
sistance from others? Few of us can truthfully take credit for all
success that we may enjoy.

  Young black males in our society are increasingly finding them-
selves unemployed, displaced from a family environment and re-
sorting to drug use and sales for physical and economic gratifica-
tion. Young people, possibly as never before, need positive role
models as beacons for their lifestyle. It seems to me that Clarence
Thomas, his life and accomplishment exemplify the role model that
we seek for our young people.

  Let me submit that, even though during the last three decades
vast strides have been made toward reducing discriminatory prac-
tices and expanding opportunities for blacks and other minorities,
we are not where we need to be in eliminating bigotry as a bar to
opportunity in America.

  But, as the economic and educational plight of blacks and other
minorities improve, have we also not grown in our ability to think,
develop ideas, question fast approaches and articulate concerns
with the directions we are going in attacking the ills of society?

  Who is to tell all blacks that we are not compelled to join in a
lock-step mentality toward the best approaches to improve the life
of blacks and other minorities? Who is to tell us that we cannot
and should not exercise our right to demonstrate an ability for in-
dependent thinking as to future avenues which should be taken to
maximize the improvement of the quality of life for our people?

  Clarence Thomas has demonstrated that he is an independent
thinker, maybe too independent for some self-appointed spokesmen
against his confirmation. It is for this very independence of intel-
lect that Clarence Thomas has been criticized by certain black
leaders and white liberals. While some may disagree with his ap-
proach, no person who knows Clarence Thomas, his caring attitude
or his willingness to help others, could ever question his motives
and his dedication to improving the life of American blacks.

  In contrast with the other members of the current Supreme
Court, Judge Thomas alone has firsthand knowledge of the plight
of minorities in the United States. Isn't it reasonable to expect him
to show understanding and compassion toward those who have suf-
fered discrimination?

  Judge Thomas' public statements make clear that he is heartily
committed to equal justice and equal opportunity. What sets him
apart from the self-appointed spokesmen, however, is his conviction
that some old methods have not worked to improve the lot of the
great mass of minorities. Judge Thomas agrees with the goals, but
sometimes disagrees with the methods because of failed results.

  If we are to realize our ultimate goal of total equality, it will not
be the result of a single voice coming from black America. Judge
Thomas himself said that little progress has been made in the field
of civil rights until a mentality and willingness was developed to
attack the status quo. Maybe the time has come for all of us to
take inventory of the success and the failures of past policies and,
                                         496

at the very least, open a dialog on where we should be going to
maximize the opportunities for all Americans.

  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, the confirmation
of Judge Thomas will be a testimonial to what America is about. It
will send a loud and clear message to our young people that any-
thing is possible in this country for those willing to make the nec-
essary sacrifices and commitments to hard work and discipline.

  The life of Judge Thomas is a perfect example of the promise of
equality and opportunity in America. Judge Thomas and his rise
from humble beginnings fit like a glove the profile of the American
dream. I respectfully urge you and your colleagues to confirm his
nomination.

  Thank you again for this opportunity to share with you my
thoughts on my friend Judge Thomas.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Obviously, I am not a very fierce Chairman. You have gone twice
the time, as well.
  Please try to surprise me, Ms. Frazier, and get it in in 5 minutes.

                   STATEMENT OF DEANIE FRAZIER
  Ms. FRAZIER. I will. My name is Deanie Frazier.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry, I said Diane. I am very sorry. For
that, you can go 6 minutes, but not 7. [Laughter.]
  Ms. FRAZIER. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I
wish to thank you for the distinct privilege to participate in one of
America's finest expressions of democracy.
  As the attention of our great country is focused on the possibility
of our having the second African-American on the Nation's highest
court, the kind Senators of these hearings show that there is an ab-
solute atmosphere of racelessness, which shows how great our
country is. To watch hours on end the superior legal, minds dealing
on an elevated level, which we the common people never think in
terms of, is indeed educational.
  Senators, as a member of the Chatham County Commissioners, I
stand in awe of this august body and humbled, indeed, that you
would permit me even to come before you to make a brief state-
ment in behalf of Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
  Clarence Thomas represents the kind of person that lets the
down and out know that they can rise above the basic social, eco-
nomic, and educational levels to the pinnacle of American life.
  Help make these visions manifested. Help lift the curtain that
blocks the light of expectation, which many are blinded because of
various considerations and situations. Help make a dream real, a
contribution possible, a greatness of national pride even greater.
Make a decision to help our national image become just a little
more representative of what we know the world sees in our efforts.
Help now by voting for Judge Thomas to become an Associate Jus-
tice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Mr. Chairman and honorable Senators, it may cause a debate,
should the flow of events that brought Judge Thomas to this point
be referred to as miraculous. Yet, the debate can be shut off. If we
consider the fact that this very nomination is beyond the natural,
                                      497

our willingness to maintain the desired condition of separation of
church and state is firm, but I have a feeling there is a strange ac-
tivity taking place right here between these hallowed walls, that it
may be generally accustomed to experience.

  The Central Georgia Conference of the Christian Methodist Epis-
copal Church, with Rev. Joseph C. Cole, as Bishop, highly recom-
mends Judge Thomas, because the more than 9,000 members feel
that justice would be served, should you favorably consider Judge
Thomas.

  The St. Paul Christian Episcopal Church, the largest black Meth-
odist church in Savannah, with Rev. Dr. Henry R. Delaney, pastor,
prayerfully recommends to this committee Judge Clarence Thomas,
because there is hope in his nomination, and confirmation will rep-
resent to our children and future generations that a poor black
man can rise to the highest court in this land.

  The historical effectiveness of this confirmation will foster good
will between mankind in many ways that we can never fully
fathom. Your accountability for making this mammoth contribu-
tion will long be remembered as the Senators who were the epito-
me of those who search for quality beyond pigmentation, beyond
former barriers, and reveal that a major change has become a part
of democracy's efforts at the declarations now in progress.

  The way in which the hearings have been conducted make the
whole Nation resound with the melody "America, the Beautiful."
The majority of the population, those without private agendas but
with a public thirst for fairness and justice are supportive of Judge
Thomas, and we respectfully urge your worthy consideration of the
nomination.

  In closing, I would like to note that the Board of Commissioners
of Chatham County, GA, on September 13, 1991,.unanimously en-
dorsed Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination. And because time will
not permit me to read it, I would like to enter it into the record,
sir.

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be.
  Ms. FRAZIER. Thank you very kindly.
  [The resolution follows:]
                                   498

                          IN SUPPORT OF CLAKLNCt IHOMAS
WHEREAS. Clarence Thomas, a native son from Chatham County, has
been nominated by President George Bush as a nominee for Justice on
the U.S. Supreme Court; and
WHEREAS, Judge Thomas has proved worthy of the nomination with his
service as director of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission and mostly recently as a Judge on the United States
Court of Appeals, the immediate appellate court to the United
States Supreme Court; and
WHEREAS, Judge Thomas' confirmation would not only recognize his
judicial qualities but also continue the inspiration for Black
America that Justice Thurgood Marshall help to establish; and
WHEREAS, while it appears that Judge Thomas must stand a different
test--judgment of his beliefs because of his race--his judicial
demeanor and integrity remain above reproach.
NOW, THEREFORE, the Board of Commissioners of Chatham County, do
hereby resolve its support for Clarence Thomas' nomination to the
highest court in the land and request that our U.S. Senators from
Georgia, the Honorable Sam Nunn and the Honorable Wyche Fowler, to
not only promote his nomination but champion it as well.
ADOPTED THIS 13TH DAY OF SEPTEMBER, 1991.

                                         499

  The CHAIRMAN. Congratulations. I want to thank you. You are
the only one in 27 days that has come in in 5 minutes.

  As a county commissioner, you are an elected official, a member
of the county commission?

   Ms. FRAZIER. Yes, sir.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is a job I had before this job. Be careful or
you may get sent here. But thank you very--seriously, thank you
very much for your testimony.

  Reverend Haygood.
  Reverend HAYGOOD. Yes.

            STATEMENT OF REV. LAWRENCE F. HAYGOOD

  Reverend HAYGOOD. Mr. Chairman, my Senator from the State of
Alabama, Howell Heflin, we wish to thank you for the superbly ex-
cellent leadership you are providing to the people of our great
State and for what you have done for us through the years.

  Senator HEFLIN. I believe you ought to be allowed a little more
than 5 minutes. [Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I can tell you when he does I will hand you
the gavel.

  Reverend HAYGOOD. And so we thank you, and we certainly we
are proud of you. And we thank also your very able assistant, Dr.
Long. And I would be remiss if I did not say thank you to my
southern brother from North Carolina, Senator Thurmond.

  Senator THURMOND. South Carolina.
  Reverend HAYGOOD. South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, for your
excellent performance.
  And to the rest of the members of this Committee
  The CHAIRMAN. I must say to you, Reverend Haygood, if you are
looking for extra time you better think of something nice to say
about the Chairman. [Laughter.]
  I mean, you can look down to either end of this table, you go this
Republican from South Carolina and say good things about him,
talk about him and you don't say anything about me. You have got
3 minutes, Reverend, and make it quick.
   Reverend HAYGOOD. And that is exactly what I was getting ready
to do, Senator Biden. [Laughter.]
  To really commend you for the superbly excellent manner in
which you have conducted these hearings. We thank you so much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Fine. Now we will start the clock. [Laughter.]
   Reverend HAYGOOD. It was Edward R. Murrow who reminded us
that no nation has ever achieved greatness without being called to
greatness by its leaders.
   During the past decade, Judge Clarence Thomas has called
America to greatness. Regarded as the rejected stone by the black
leadership establishment Judge Clarence Thomas has now become
the chief cornerstone of brotherhood, human equality, and individ-
ual liberty, in the land of the free and the home of the grave.
   Judge Thomas has carved out a pathway for the new black lead-
ership of the future, and he has left it a legacy that is firm, work-
able, excellent, compassionate, sagacious, and competitive. Judge
Clarence Thomas has proven that he possesses those attributes of
                                         500

judicial prudence, integrity, and ability essential to serve as an As-
sociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  His character, energy, compassion, and intellect have positively
excited the American public, and the public is demanding his expe-
ditious confirmation. Frederick Douglas has reminded us that
"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never has and it
never will."

  Kind, genteel, and urbane, Judge Thomas has emptied his life
into the lives of the oppressed, the downtrodden, the poor, the for-
gotten, and the less change people of the times. He has been faith-
ful to the Biblical injunction: "Undo the heavy burdens of the poor
and let the oppressed go free."

  Impartial, honest, and caring, Judge Thomas, during the past 10
years, has implemented action that is affirmative based on self-
help, hard work, discipline, empowerment, excellent of perform-
ance, individual rights, personal responsibility, and credible en-
forcement of civil rights in behalf of all Americans.

  Judge Thomas believes that the Constitution is colorblind and
that it serves as a basis for diligently working toward a colorblind
society. The Constitution, he believes, is a safe harbor that protects
individual rights, inherent equality, human dignity, and equal op-
portunity for all.

  Judge Thomas has indicated that welfare dependency has served
as a narcotic to those who have been enslaved by it. Our task as
leaders is to empower those who are dependent upon public assist-
ance to move from a cycle of dependency to a cycle of self-sufficien-
cy. This can best be done, according to the nominee, through educa-
tion and training. Education and training is the key which unlocks
the door to success and achievement.

  The poor, themselves, have the responsibility of ushering in a
new culture of character and a rebirth of good manners by reject-
ing crime, drugs, violence, apathy, and illiteracy. The poor must re-
member the words of Mr. Myers Anderson: "Mr. Can't is dead. I
buried him."

  Judge Thomas is a firm advocate of preparation. Recalling Presi-
dent Lincoln, he said, "I will prepare myself and when the time
comes I will be ready." Judge Thomas prepared himself, the time
has come, and he is ready to serve as an Associate Justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court.

  Judge Thomas cares enough to make a difference and to change
the world for many people so that they may enjoy a more refined
quality of life and thereby insure that this Nation, under God,
shall not perish from the Earth.

  Thank you, and we urge your confirmation of Senator and Judge
Clarence Thomas.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Reverend.
  Let me out of respect yield to your senior Senator for questions
first.
  Senator HEFLIN. I don't believe I have any questions. The only
thing is that I see we have a Holifield and a Frazier on the panel.
Is there any pugilistic influence in regard to this? You know, we
got Evander Holifield from Alabama.
                                         501

  Ms. HOLJFIELD. Yes, Senator. My name is spelled H-o-l-i-f-i-e-l-d,
but my husband's father's name is spelled H-o-l-y-f-i-e-l-d. He
changed it when he went to California.

  Senator HEFLIN. All right. I don't believe I have any questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Thurmond?
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to welcome all of you here. I was just thinking about the
contrast in testimony, three professors testified earlier this after-
noon and now hearing your testimony. This panel talks like hu-
manitarians. You sound like you love people. And that you look for
the good in people. And I am so glad to have you here.
  I am not going to take up a lot of time. I would just ask two ques-
tions from all of you. If you will just answer them starting with
Ms.--is it Holifield? Then Ms. Bryant. Then Ms. Frazier. And then
Reverend Haygood.
  Is it your opinion that Judge Thomas is highly qualified and pos-
sesses the necessary integrity, professional competence and judicial
temperament to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court? If so, answer yes. If not, no.
  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. Your answer is yes. And Ms. Bryant?
  Ms. BRYANT. Yes, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. Your answer is yes. Ms. Frazier?
  Ms. FRAZIER. I would like the Senator to read one part of the res-
olution that my fellow Commissioners signed, and I think that
would speak for itself, if I may.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right. Go ahead.
  Ms. FRAZIER. Whereas, Judge Thomas has proved worthy of the
nomination with his service as Director of U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and mostly recently as a judge on the
U.S. Court of Appeals, the immediate appellate court to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Judge Thomas' confirmation would not only recog-
nize his judicial qualifies but also continue the inspiration for black
Americans that Justice Thurgood Marshall helped to establish, and
whereas it appears that Judge Thomas must stand a different
test--judgement of his beliefs because of his race--his judicial de-
meanor and integrity remain about reproach.
  Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of Chatham County to
hereby resolve its support for Clarence Thomas.
  And that is a diverse board, I would like you to know. We have
four Republicans, five Democrats, three females.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, what organization is that? Repeat that
for the record.
  Ms. FRAZIER. That is the Chatham County Board of Commission-
ers, Savannah, GA.
  Senator THURMOND. IS that county?
  Ms. FRAZIER. County. That is correct.
  Senator THURMOND. County council in Chatham County.
  Ms. FRAZIER. That is correct.
  Senator THURMOND. And that is composed how many people?
  Ms. FRAZIER. Nine.
  Senator THURMOND. HOW many Democrats and how many Re-
publicans?
  Ms. FRAZIER. We have five Democrats and four Republicans.
                                         502

   Senator THURMOND. I see.
   Ms. FRAZIER. Three females.
   Senator THURMOND. And this is action by them?
   Ms. FRAZIER. Pardon me?
   Senator THURMOND. And this is action that they took?
   Ms. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. On last Friday.
   Senator THURMOND. SO I presume your answer then is yes to the
question I propounded.
   Ms. FRAZIER. Yes, sir. Unanimous.
   Senator THURMOND. Reverend Haygood?
   Reverend HAYGOOD. Yes, sir, Senator.
   Senator THURMOND. Second question. Do you know of any reason
why Clarence Thomas should not be made a member of the Su-
preme Court?
   Ms. HOLIFIELD. The answer is no, Senator.
   Senator THURMOND. MS. Holifield, no. Ms. Bryant?
   Ms. BRYANT. NO, Senator.
   Senator THURMOND. NO. MS. Frazier?

   Ms. FRAZIER. NO, sir.

   Senator THURMOND. Reverend Haygood?
   Reverend HAYGOOD. NO, sir, Senator.
   Senator THURMOND. That is all the questions I have. I want to
thank you for coming, participating in this hearing and adding, I
think, greatly to the outcome of the hearing. Thank you very much
for your presence.
   Reverend HAYGOOD. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  The Senator from Wyoming?
   Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank you, and I am very
pleased that I was here to hear these remarks from these fine
people because you have a way of cutting through the fog that
sometimes envelopes us here as we get into very highly technical
stuff.
   And it is fascinating sometimes. I learn from it too, but I am
sure that the American public, and the vast majority of them, don't
have the slightest idea what we are talking about. And nor do they
care.
  They want to know who this man is that is going to sit and
judge, and that is what we are going to do with them--he will be
appointed to judge--and who is he. And when you find people like
you who, who some earlier ones have known him, and as I said
before, I have never seen a more extraordinary outpouring of sup-
port by people who know him intimately, and then people who do
not. And I believe that you, Ms. Holifield, do not--you had never
known him before your, personally that is, before your action in
California.
   Ms. HOLIFIELD. That is correct, Senator.
   Senator SIMPSON. And you have praised his philosophy of self-
help and self-reliance, and certain witnesses at this hearing and
during these proceedings have described Judge Thomas as being
"outside the mainstream," which is a sinister, supposed to be a sin-
ister thing, and I haven't found that at all.
                                               503

  Now you are an educator, a college trustee. I served as a trustee
of a small college in Wyoming for 8 years, found it absolutely fasci-
nating. I am sure you do too. And an activist.

  And so you have--there you are, and all of you are active in your
community, and so you have an opportunity to learn what real
people are thinking about this nomination process.

   Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes.

  Senator SIMPSON. What do they think about Judge Thomas,
whether he is in the mainstream or not, and how he feels about
the things that are so critical to them, like self-help and coming
from nothing and self-reliance and doing the job?

  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Senator, all the people that I talk to on an every-
day basis, they are very proud of Judge Clarence Thomas and they
feel that this philosophy that he has developed on self-help and
self-reliance really needs to be implemented. We need to go back to
our roots where we came from. Self-help and self-reliance is no new
programs for minorities. Somewhere down the line, we got away
from it, so we need to back to that.

  Senator SIMPSON. YOU have placed your entire statement in the
record, but you did not get to give it all and it is powerful stuff. I
loved what you said about those in the Congress who are black who
have judged him.

   Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes.

  Senator SIMPSON. YOU left that out and that is a powerful state-
ment, because I know many members of the Black Caucus and I
honestly know some of them who are embarrassed, because they
came out too fast, too sure, speaking for their people.

   Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes.

  Senator SIMPSON. I loved what you said--I will not go into it all,
it is right there in the record

  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Senator, I put my whole heart into writing this. I
just skip back and forth, trying to give you as much as I could, but
it took me about 3 weeks to write that speech.

  Senator SIMPSON. Let me tell you, it is one that everyone ought
to read, because it is powerful.

  I loved your statement, where you said, "Honorable Senators, 26
blacks in Congress do not represent 30 million people, any more
than 26 whites in Congress who represent 200 million white people,
not ignoring every other ethnic group."

   Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes.

  Senator SIMPSON. That is a powerful and realistic statement.
There is no monolithic white vote that any white Senator can
speak for, but you see there has been one for blacks, and that is
falling apart.

  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. IS that the way you see it?

   Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes, I do.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, that is sure the way I see it, too, and it is
a frightening prospect for people who are not used to that. That is
the way countries grow and groups grow.

  Apparently, Clarence Thomas came to your college and spoke in
1986.

   Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes, he did.

  Senator SIMPSON. And you heard him then?
                                          504

   Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes.

  Senator SIMPSON. And he said, "Do not become obsessed with all
that is wrong with our race, we are not beggars or objects of char-
ity, rather, become obsessed with looking for solutions to our prob-
lems. Be tolerant," Judge Thomas stated, "of all the positive ideas,
their numbers are smaller, that there are countless numbers of
problems to be solved and we need all the hope and help we can
get."

  So, that must have been quite a stirring talk he gave then.

   Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, he is a role model and he proved that in
his testimony here. But this entire thing, I do not know how long it
took you, but that is really beautifully done, and I appreciated
reading it.

  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Thank you. Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. I appreciated hearing from another elected offi-
cial, Deanie Frazier, from the Countv Commissioners, and you
talked about--did you use the phrase highfalutin legal experts"?
 -MSJFRAZIER. That is not quite
  Senator SIMPSON. YOU did, didn't you? I loved that. It struck a
chord in me. [Laughter.]
  Testifying about things that ordinary people do not know about
nor care about. You not only stayed within the time limits, and the
Chairman is very tough on us when we go against, but he was
pretty good and he is very fair.
  But you have said some important things about the nomination
and the process that we use to carry out this process. What we do,
we have our very best legal and constitutional scholars and experts
and authorities pass on these nominations that we receive. I be-
lieve that is important, but as you point out, we hear a lot of high-
falutin testimony, much of which is not understood by some of the
people who might catch these proceedings on a busy day of doing
their work and going to their jobs and raising their babies.
  You have testified as to Judge Thomas' character, and some of
these experts have said that character is the most important of the
qualities we seek in this job.
  Some have said today that what Judge Clarence Thomas has said
is not believable. I find that quite offensive, frankly. And some
have said that words are wonderful, but no action in his whole life
is a pattern of action. I think that your comment, Ms. Holifield,
that some of those folks should reactivate their creative thinking
skills--you used capital letters on each one of those words, and I
love it.
  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes, because that is important.
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes, it is.
  Obviously, you find that one who is obviously pleased with what
you are saying, but, more importantly than that, I would ask
Evelyn Bryant, yours was as very moving statement and you men-
tioned his accomplishments.
  Some have suggested, including those in leadership positions in
the black community here in Washington principally, that "Clar-
ence Thomas has forgotten his roots"--that is a phrase now in quo-
tation marks--"forgotten his roots, forgotten how he got to where
he is today." How would you respond to those charges?
                                        505

  Ms. BRYANT. Well, I do not know where they got the idea from. If
you recall in my statement, his relatives, a lot of his relatives still
live in Eastern Liberty County, and one person in particularly, his
first cousin, Mr. Fuller, who is 91 years old, he is in constant con-
tact with Clarence.

  In fact, he came up with us on the bus last month when we came
here. He is 91 years old and he is in close contact and he loves
Clarence to the point where he took a 10-hour bus trip just to sup-
port him. So, if there is that type of family closeness with a 91-
year-old to come this far just to support a first cousin, who calls
him on a weekly or every 2 week basis, that is not forgetting your
roots, because he is 91 and he is not forgotten. They are very close.

  Senator SIMPSON. Reverend Haygood, finally, what would it
mean to people in your congregation and your church--how many
are in your congregation?

  Reverend HAYGOOD. We simply have about 300 right now.
  Senator SIMPSON. What would it mean to them to have a role
model like Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court?
  Reverend HAYGOOD. It would really make the difference. Just
before I came here, I shared it with one of the young people in our
group, and he said that "Clarence Thomas is a person that I trust,
he's someone I can look up to, for me he is a role model."
  I think in terms of today's communities, particularly in the black
community, where there is crime, where drugs are moving on a
daily basis, where there is violence, we need role models who have
achieved, who can reach back from whence they have come and lift
up those who are farthest down. Indeed, the real purpose of leader-
ship is to lift up persons who are farthest down.
  The whole debate between Booker T. Washington and W.B.
DuBois was a debate concerning methodology. The goal essentially
was the same, but they adhered to the philosophy that we must lift
up persons who are farthest down, because as we lift up persons
who are farthest down, everybody above them will be lifted up, as
well.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I thank you.
  Mr. Chairman, if I may enter into the record just as brief portion
of the results of a poll recently released just yesterday by ABC
News--I am not much on polling, but I think it surely shows that
these groups within the beltway, the views of the special interest
groups who oppose this nomination are met nowhere out in the
United States, in any part of the United States, in any region of
the United States, and so there is going to be a great retooling
going on within those groups, as I see it, within these next months.
  I ask unanimous consent that be included in the record, and I
thank you very much for the stirring testimony.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.

    ABC NEWS POLL: THOMAS, ISRAEL AND THE PRESIDENT

    FOR RELEASE AFTER 6:30 P.M. MONDAY SEPT. 16

     BUSH BACKED ON THOMAS & ISRAEL
    BUT FAULTED ON DOMESTIC AGENDA

    Most Americans support George Bush on Clarence Thomas' nomination and the issue of loan
    guarantees for Israel. But a large majority faults the president for a lack of attention to
    domestic issues, an ABC News poll has found.

    On Thomas, 61 percent approve of the Supreme Court nominee's testimony before the Senate
    Judiciary Committee, including his refusal to take a position on abortion. Sixty-three percent
    favor Thomas' confirmation as a Supreme Court justice.

    On Israel, respondents overwhelmingly supported Bush's call for a delay in Congress'
    consideration of loan guarantees for Israel. A majority was inclined to oppose the guarantees,
    probably reflecting a general antipathy toward foreign aid.

    But while the public supports Bush on Thomas and Israel, a sizable majority faults him for a
    lack of attention to domestic issues: Sixty-six percent said he spends too much time on foreign
    affairs and not enough time on domestic problems.

    The charge that Bush lacks a domestic agenda is the main criticism of the president that
    resonates with the public as the 1992 election year approaches. Concern about his overall
    domestic performance was even higher than criticism specifically of his handling of the
    economy (53 percent disapproved).

    A strong majority, 73 percent, continued to approve of Bush's handling of foreign affairs. His
    overall job approval rating is 69 percent, down from his postwar peak of 90 percent six
    months ago but still high, particularly in troubled economic times.

    ON THE THOMAS NOMINATION - The poll reached these findings on Thomas:

//   Opposition to Thomas, from such groups as the NAACP, the National Organization for

    Women and the AFL-CIO, has had little impact on the public. Overall, 59 percent approve of

    his nomination, including 58 percent of blacks and 58 percent of women. Those numbers are

    basically unchanged from an ABC poll in late July.

     While the NAACP has charged that Thomas is out of touch with issues of importance to
    blacks, 61 percent of all respondents - and 55 percent of black respondents - said he does
    understand.the concerns of most black Americans. However, 41 percent of blacks said ne does
    not understand most blacks' concerns. The survey included an oversample of 319 black
    respondents.

 Support for Thomas' confirmation similarly crossed demographic lines. Among all
respondents, 63 percent said he should be confirmed. Among blacks, 61 percent favored his
confirmation; among women, an identical 61 percent favored it. Even among Democrats a
majority, 54 percent, supported confirmation.

 Sixty percent of respondents supported Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision

legalizing abort on. But an overwhelming 85 percent said Thomas' position on__abortion

should not be the deciding factor in his nomination. And 61 percent said he was right not to

discuss his views on abortion at last week's Senate hearings.     '             -

 Most Americans have paid little attention to the Thomas hearings: Only 43 percent followed

them "very" or "somewhat" closely, while 57 percent followed them "not too closely" or "not

closely at all." Qvgra]], 61 p^r^nt appmvpri of Thomas' performance as a witness; among
those who watched closely, even more approved_^76_pftr(Sftnt-
                                                               "

 Thirty-one percent said the Supreme Court tends to be too conservative, nearly twice the
number who called it too liberal - and a plurality. 41 percent, said Thomas would make the
court more conservative. Six in 10 called it appropriate for the Senate to consider his political
views as well as his judicial qualifications.

 The one negative for Thomas is a 14-point increase in the number of Americans who think
Bush could have found a more qualified candidate - from 23 percent in early July to 37
percent now. But 45 percent still say Thomas was among the best candidates available.
Eighteen percent remain unsure.

ON ISRAEL - Despite current tensions between the United States and Israel, most
Americans (68 percent) favor maintaining current ties between the two nations rather than
weakening or strengthening them. Most (59 percent) also support the current level of U.S.
economic and military aid to Israel.

Bush's call for delays in Congress' consideration of loan guarantees for Israel won the
approval of 86 percent of respondents. A majority, 58 percent, said Israel should not be given
the loan guaranties, but this is an unfamiliar issue on which opinions may be lightly heldThe
finding m a y reflect general public opposition to foreign aid, particularly during economic
difficulties at home, rather than any specific opposition to aid to Israel.

Indeed a majority of respondents, 57 percent, said their sympathies are more with Israel than
with the Arab nations in the Middle East conflict: just 20 percent said their sympathies are
more with the Arab nations. And the number of Americans who think Israel has too much
influence with the U.S. government remains a minority, 37 percent.

BUSH & POLITICS - While Bush's vulnerability on his domestic performance has a
partisan tinge, the concerns do cross party lines. Even a slim, majority of Republicans (51
percent) say he upends too much time on foreign problems and not enough time on domestic
problems; so do 68 percent of independents and 77 percent of Democrats.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to thank you all for most of you coming so far and prob-
ably under difficult circumstances to come and testify in support of
Clarence Thomas. I appreciate very much your testimony. I almost
felt, when Reverend Haygood got done, we ought to call for a vote.
[Laughter.]
  Also, I want to tell Ms. Frazier, I am not one of those "highfalu-
tin legal types" that you are talking about, because I am not a
lawyer, so I hope you will feel some affinity toward at least one
member of the committee.
  I want to ask in a serious vein, I think maybe just a little bit
different approach some of my colleagues have taken, but it is to
get people like you, who I would like to think are the ordinary
American people who look at things differently than are looked at
here inside the beltway, the people who are my constituents back
home, do you have any question about Clarence Thomas' commit-
ment to civil rights and equal opportunity and all of the concepts
that civil rights and equal opportunity mean in 1991?
  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Yes, I do, Senator. As far as civil rights in 1991, I
think we are going to have to stop focusing on progress that we
have made--continue to focus on it, but stop looking back and let's
move on with our people, teaching them about economic empower-
ment.
  We have been able to move from the back of the bus to the front
of the bus, but there is no use of us keep using that for an excuse.
We have to move on with the work ethics for our people, teach
them about economics, teach them about arriving early in the
morning and going out to a job. If they do not want a job, creating
a job. This is the work of the 1990's for us, as far as civil rights is
concerned.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I do not disagree with anything you have said.
I think, though, that my question was not clear. It is just whether
or not you have any question, if Clarence Thomas is on the Su-
preme Court, that he will adequately look out for civil rights and
equal opportunity and protect the constitutional rights in that
area?
  Ms. HOLIFIELD. I do. I do believe that he will.
  Senator GRASSLEY. OK. Ms. Bryant?
  Ms. BRYANT. I believe he will.
  Senator GRASSLEY. MS. Frazier?
  Ms. FRAZIER. I believe, from past history, those people who we
thought are not supportive of us as a race, I think history will
show that those persons made some of the best decisions that af-
fected our lives.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Reverend Haygood?
  Reverend HAYGOOD. I have no reservations.
  Senator GRASSLEY. OK. If Clarence Thomas is unquestionably
committed to civil rights, and he has made that statement--and
you have said you believe that he is sincere in that and will follow
that out--why do you think that your national leadership opposes
his nomination? By your national leadership, I suppose I speak
mostly to you, Ms. Holifield, because of your association with the
local chapter there, but also for Ms. Bryant, as well, as a spokes-
                                         509

person, primarily you two on that point. The other two can answer,
if they want to.

  Ms. HOLIFIELD. Well, as of July 30, the national took its stand
and the Compton chapter was already on record supporting Judge
Clarence Thomas on July 20, so that cannot be taken away from
us. But I think the national based their point not to support him
based upon some Washington bureau report that was put out, and I
have not read it.

  Ms. BRYANT. I think that perhaps they could possibly be out of
touch with the mainstream of minorities.

  Senator GRASSLEY. DO you have anything you want to add, Ms.
Frazier or Reverend Haygood, in response to my question of why
you think that the national leadership in the civil rights movement
opposes his nomination?

  Ms. FRAZIER. That question is too formal. First of all, I do not
believe that the leadership, as you call it, I think maybe those who
are called leadership have a different view, but I think that it is a
mixture of things and I think that we see it thrusted so often, indi-
viduals who probably speak out, and you term those as leaders, and
I do not think that is always the case and I think it kind of gets
sidetracked. I think our focus, as Ms. Holifield said, our focus
should be put more on economics.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, you are suggesting that maybe the
spokesmen in Washington, DC, for civil rights are not necessarily
the real leadership of the organizations, but from our standpoint
here, those are the people who come and represent the organiza-
tions and testify at hearings, not only on nominations, but at lots
of different hearings. You know, they are the people that have the
high focus in Washington, DC.

  I am not finding fault with your
  Ms. FRAZIER. Senator, I am not trying to challenge you, but I
think that sometimes, me being an elected official myself, I think
sometimes we put buffers between us and people. I think if you
would go, just as Joe Blow, I think if you would go to those people,
I think that you would get a pretty different prospect of that and I
think those people who come, come because you expect them to
come.
  Senator GRASSLEY. OK.
  Ms. FRAZIER. But I think people, the J.Q. Public, the middle
class, I do not think it is the down and out people. I think anybody
who works for it, be it blue collar, if they are contributing to the
tax base of this country, are important, and I think we see more of
us reaching out to those people, and I think you would get a differ-
ent view of what the mainstream minority community is all about.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I think you give a very legitimate answer and
I do not find fault with it.
  Reverend Haygood.
  Reverend HAYGOOD. Yes, Senator, I believe that the dichotomy
that exists between the traditional black leadership and Judge
Clarence Thomas is that, during the last 10 years, Judge Thomas
has been within the mainstream of America. He has worked within
the system of this country. He has worked with blacks and he has
worked with whites and he has worked with Hispanics.
                                          510

  As you know, it was the tradition of black leadership establish-
ment that did not return the telephone calls of Judge Thomas.
Judge Thomas went out to them to get their assistance, but we are
told that they did not even respect him enough to return a tele-
phone call.

  You remember when they had the Fairmont Conference in Cali-
fornia. Judge Thomas came back, and the Washington Post noted
him as having the thinking that was slightly right of center, and
that is when he was appointed to the Reagan administration.

  The whole United States of America has seen this difference
during this hearing, is that here is one black leader who seriously
accomplished what he set out to accomplish. The gentleman from
Fairmont said we are excited, because we are going to be a part of
changing the world. Senators, that is what Clarence Thomas has
done during the last 10 years in America. He has changed the
world. He has changed a world so that we can see the majority of
the people in this country adhere to his philosophy.

  Not only that, but we have seen that the Berlin Wall has been
knocked down, we see the torch of freedom being carried to the
Soviet Union and to Poland and the Baltic States. Here for the
first time in the United States, freedom that we have so dearly ar-
ticulated and that we find expressed in the Declaration of Inde-
pendence, flourishing at home and around the world.

  Judge Thomas has had a leadership in that. So, I say that when
the leadership of the left decides to come and sit down at the table
and engage in authentic debate that he has asked for, then there
will be some union, there will be some togetherness, and perhaps
in our diversity we shall indeed find our strength.

  We may differ. The important thing is that our differences do
not continue to divide us, that somehow we can sit around a
common table, and they can disagree with one another, without
saying that he is liberal or he is conservative or he is moderate.
But we are Americans. We are neither black or white, brown nor
yellow, but we are all Americans and we hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed
by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these
are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I have one question that will require a no or a
yes. I know my time is up. I did have a lot of other questions, but I
think through the course of our discussion here you have covered
most of the other ones.

  But a very specific question to Ms. Holifield and to Ms. Bryant:
Did the national leadership of the NAACP ask your chapters not to
support Clarence Thomas, or, in your case, where you announced
before they did, did they ask you to reverse your decision?

  Ms. HOLIFIELD. In my case, Senator, on July 20, the Compton
NAACP Chapter voted to support Judge Clarence Thomas unani-
mously, and I wanted to say to you that there are far more Demo-
crats than there are Republicans in the chapter. As a matter of
fact, I think there are about two or three Republicans in the whole
chapter.

  On July 30 or 31, the national came down with its decision, and
the way they came down on our chapter is they said to retract,
resign or we are going to take your charter. There was a reporter
                                         511

from California, the Wave Newspaper, I understand, called them
and said did you know that your Compton Chapter had went on
record supporting Judge Clarence Thomas. Little did we know
when we voted to support Judge Clarence Thomas even how to get
the message to him to let him know that we were supporting him
and what we could do to help him. This is what we were trying to
wiggle on.

  Finally, the news broke and the news spread from State to State,
and they said, OK, we are going to give you until high noon,
August 10, a Friday, to retract, resign or we will take your charter.
Of course, coming up to high noon, we were really talking to the
reporters. We had forgotten about high noon, and the national
called us and said we will not take your charter, you will not have
to resign, you may keep your charter, but come on and let us com-
promise.

  So, we did compromise, and the compromise was that the chapter
would not support Judge Clarence Thomas as a chapter, but as in-
dividuals we were free to do what we wanted to, which is contradic-
tory. We are on record supporting Judge Clarence Thomas as of
July 20. They could not take that away from us.

  Senator GRASSLEY. MS. Bryant?
  Ms. BRYANT. Well, my chapter was quite different. They told us
that we could support the Judge individually, but not as a chapter,
and that is what we have done.
  Senator GRASSLEY. DO they have that authority to take your
charter away from you?
  Ms. BRYANT. Yes, but according to the national constitutional by-
laws, the charter can be revoked.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, you probably ought to get that changed
so they cannot do that.
  I am done, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Make sure he pays, like the rest of us, his dues. I
pay mine, $100. Get his dues, and then he can vote, tell him.
[Laughter.]
  Senator Hatch can something, if he takes the chair, because I am
catching the 6 o'clock train.
  Senator HATCH. I just want to welcome them for being here.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry, I thought you already asked ques-
tions.
  Senator HATCH. I want to welcome you and thank you for your
testimony. We have appreciated it very much and we compliment
you for it. I want the Chairman to make his AMTRAK train.
  The CHAIRMAN. I yield to my friend from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent
that a letter to Hon. Hank Brown, U.S. Senate, Committee on the
Judiciary, from Gary L. Bauer, president, Family Research Council,
be placed in the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.

 Dear Senator Brown:

 As the former Undersecretary of Education, I would like to' respond
 to the Washington Post's report regarding Judge Clarence Thomas'
 involvement with the White House Working Group on the Family. I
 chaired the group and was tasked by President Reagan to write a
 report on the state of the American family.

 In order to accomplish the project, a group of Reagan appointees
 representing various government agencies was enlisted to offer
 advice, material and direction. The group in no way represented a
 monolithic consensus of opinion, but in reality, was composed of 'fC
 individuals with diverse ideas, views and goals. Among those was
 Clarence Thomas who at the time was the Chairman of the Equal
 Employment Opportunity Commission.
*^
 Judge Thomas provided advice and insight on the issue of Black
 self-help. Meetings occurred after hours at the Department of
 Education with discussions centering only around the topics
 assigned to the participants present. In fact, due to the
 diversity of its membership, individuals disagreed with various
 aspects of the report.

 To my best recollection. Judge Thomas was not consulted about the
 sections regarding abortion or the Roe v. Wade decision, nor were
 they relevant to the sections of the report for which he was
 responsible.

 It is my belief that the Washington Post article was in error.
 Judge Thomas's role with the Working Group was exemplary, offering
 advice and perspective on the issues for which he is known.

 Thank you for your concern and I trust that this issue can be laid
 to rest.

respect for all of the members of the staff and others on the com-

              OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN BIDEN

  The CHAIRMAN. Good morning, everyone. The hearing will come
to order.

  Let me say at the outset we have a very ambitious schedule
today. We have a total of 44 witnesses today that we want to hear
from and we will hear from; 23 are opposed to Judge Thomas and
21 are supporting him. There will be a total of 12 panels of wit-
nesses today.

  Today we start off with what I consider to be one of the most
distinguished panels to speak before this committee or, quite frank-
ly, any committee. The array of talent on this panel is enviable.

  Let me begin by introducing the panel, and I am told they will
speak not in the order of introduction but in reverse order.

  Let me begin by introducing the Hon. Madeleine Kunin, former
Governor of the State of Vermont and currently a Distinguished
visitor for public policy at the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe Col-
lege. She is also president of the Institute for Sustainable Commu-
nities at the Vermont Law School.

  Is it the University of Vermont Law School, Governor?
  Ms. KUNIN. It is separate.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is separate from, just as it is in Delaware, the
Delaware Law School.
  And Ms. Kate Michelman, executive director of the National
Abortion Rights Action League and probably the most outspoken
and most articulate spokesperson for that position in the country.
  And Ms. Faye Wattleton who is president of Planned Parenthood
Federation of American and, again, probably the best known leader
that organization has had and extremely available, I note, over the

                                                        (515)
                                          516

years to not only this committee but to major news and talk shows
in America making the position of Planned Parenthood known.

   And Ms. Sarah Weddington, an attorney in private practice in
Austin, TX, who has done a number of very significant things, but
one of the things that maybe is most poignant for the purposes of
this hearing is that she was the attorney in Roe v. Wade.

  With that, let me begin with you, Ms. Weddington. I am told the
panel would like to move that way. Then we are going to move
across, and we will go to Ms. Michelman, Ms. Wattleton, and the
Governor will conclude.

  Welcome, again, and please, if you can help us, try to keep your
comments to 5 minutes. There will be questions. You will have
more than 5 minutes to speak, I assure you. Any longer statement
that you may have, we will at your request be delighted and anx-
ious to put it in the record for the record.

  Good morning, welcome, and the floor is yours.

STATEMENTS OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF SARAH WEDDINGTON,
  ATTORNEY, AUSTIN, TX; KATE MICHELMAN, EXECUTIVE DIREC-
  TOR, NATIONAL ABORTION RIGHTS ACTION LEAGUE; FAYE
  WATTLETON, PRESIDENT, PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERA-
  TION OF AMERICA; AND MADELEINE MAY KUNIN, FORMER
  GOVERNOR, STATE OF VERMONT, AND DISTINGUISHED VISI-
  TOR FOR PUBLIC POLICY, BUNTING INSTITUTE, RADCLIFFE
  COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, MA, AND PRESIDENT, INSTITUTE FOR
  SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES, VERMONT LAW SCHOOL, SOUTH
  ROYALTON, VT

  Ms. WEDDINGTON. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond,
I want to express appreciation for the opportunity to be part of this
distinguished panel and to contribute, even if only for a few min-
utes, to the importance of this deliberation. My name is Sarah
Weddington. I am the attorney who litigated and won Roe v. Wade.

  In 1969, abortion was illegal in my home State of Texas and, in
fact, outlawed except to save the life of the woman. However,
women did find a way to get abortions--those with money who flew
to California and New York, those without resources who often
went to Mexico, where it was illegal, or back alleys. And the result
was women who died or were seriously injured. It is not a day I
ever want to go back to.

  A group of women then were trying to provide information about
the safest places to go and were afraid they would be prosecuted as
accomplices to the crime of abortion. They asked me to look it up. I
was the only woman lawyer they knew, and they needed someone
who would do it for free. And so I ended up being the person whose
research led to Roe v. Wade.

  It will soon now be 20 years since that decision, and yet I am
fearful for its health and well-being because I believe, if the Senate
confirms Judge Thomas, that he will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade
and that laws as extreme as those in Texas will once again be en-
forced in this land.

  I have tried to watch these hearings very carefully. They have
been frustrating, not very enlightening, and I tried to find a way to
express my frustration. In the attorney general's office in Texas,
                                      517

there are posters in our child support and paternity section whose
caption is, "Would you be more careful if it was you that got preg-
nant?" The headlines in the Austin paper said Judge Thomas had
a sense of humor, and so I thought he would not mind if I altered
the poster a little bit to ask if he wouldn't have been more careful
about what he has been saying if he were the one who could have
gotten pregnant.

  Saying things like, "Oh, I just wrote that about Lehrman's arti-
cle, it was a throw-away line"; or "I have never really thought
about this issue. I have never discussed it with anyone although I
was in law school when Roe v. Wade was decided"; "I really don't
have an opinion"--you see, I find that very hard to believe, and I
think you should, too.

  In fact, his record provides clear indication of the opposite. I
think, for example, that when he talked about Lehrman's article,
the "right to life" of the fetus as a "splendid example of applying
natural law," and other things that the article said that were so
extreme that it would require abortion to be outlawed in every
State, we have to take that seriously.

  I think if he had said something like that about a Supreme Court
opinion, Plessy v. Ferguson, separate but equal, we would not
accept it. And so right now all I can see is he has had wonderful
coaching from that great Texan over in the White House. I think
he has learned to say very little. Newsweek this week said he has
been "a master of evasion." But I am worried about that because I
believe that the women of this country deserve a fundamental
right. I think there is a constitutional right of privacy. I do not
want to see it endangered.

  He has avoided saying even that an individual has a fundamen-
tal right to privacy based on the Due Process Clause of the 14th
amendment. I ask you to say no to his nomination.

                                    Attorney/ Austin, Texas

                         Before the snat Judiciary Committee
            On the Nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to be an
           Associate Justio* of tha United Statas Supreme Court

                                          September 19, 1991

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee, thank you for the
opportunity to address you today. My name is Sarah Weddington
and I am the attorney who litigated Roe v. Wade.

In 1969, abortion was illegal in Texas, my home state. But that
did not change the determination of women in Texas -- like women
all across the nation -- to choose for themselves the appropriate
response to a pregnancy. Some chose abortion. Those who could
somehow get together the necessary money went to states like
California or New York for legal abortions. Those who could not
had illegal abortions, often in Mexico. Many women died because
of that Texas law, and more suffered permanent physical injury.

That year a group of women formed to provide free information
about the safest places to go. They were concerned about whether
they could be charged as accomplices to the crime of abortion.
They asked me, the only woman lawyer they knew, for advice. My
offer to do some research led to the case of Roe v. Wade.

Soon it will be twenty years since we celebrated the Roe v. Wade
decision, January 22, 1973. Now I fear that Roe will not survive
                                     519

-- even in its currently weakened state -- until that twentieth
anniversary.

I believe that if the Senate confirms Judge Thomas he will vote
to overrule Roe and uphold laws as extreme as the Texas law that
the Supreme Court struck down in 1973.

I have followed these hearings with great interest, but Judge
Thomas's testimony here has been frustrating and unenlightening.
What we have learned is that he had wonderful, careful coaching
about how to avoid political pitfalls. What we have seen is a
nominee who was willing to answer questions only on issues that
are politically safe and who was deliberately evasive on the
critical issue of a woman's fundamental right to privacy.

Judge Thomas' record, however, does provide clear indications of
the views he was unwilling to share during these hearings. I
know that this Committee is very familiar with Judge Thomas'
record, but I wish to address two specific concerns that I
believe members of this Committee have expressed.

First, I would like to address the attempts during the last few
days to dismiss concerns about Judge Thomas' record as unfairly
based on a single sentence. Of course, I am referring to Judge
Thomas' startling praise of an article by Lewis Lehrman on the
"right to life" of the fetus as a "splendid example of applying
                                     520

natural law." One line can be of enormous importance. Few would
dispute that the phrase "All men are created equal" in the
Declaration of Independence is significant. The true issue is
the content of the sentence. The terrifying significance of
Thomas' praise for Lehrman's article lies in the extreme position
the article takes: the article compares abortion to a
"holocaust" and argues that the Constitutution requires abortion
to be outlawed in every state, under all circumstances.

Imagine if Lehrman had taken a different extreme position in
opposition to a basic constitutional principle. What if, for
example, Lehrman had said that natural law required the "separate
but equal" ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson, and Judge Thomas had
praised Lehrman's article calling for racial segregation as "a
splendid example of applying natural law." Would anyone on this
panel even consider confirming a nominee who had made such a
statement unless he had established with both certainty and
clarity that he would find unconstitutional a law that would
force school children to go to segregated schools? This panel
should demand the same certainty and clarity of Judge Thomas
given his endorsement of an extreme position that would abolish
the fundamental right to choose. To vote to confirm Judge Thomas
when he has responded with only evasion would be to treat the
right to choose abortion as a second-class right.
                                     521

Moreover, the endorsement of the Lehrman article is not an
anomaly, but is part of a pattern that appears throughout Judge
Thomas' speeches and writings. For example, Judge Thomas
criticized Roe v. Wade in an article in the Harvard Journal of
Law and Public Policy. In the context of exhorting his
"conservative allies" to embrace natural law as a tool against
"judicial activism," Judge Thomas identified Roe v. Wade as the
case "provoking the most protest from conservatives." In another
article, Judge Thomas criticized protection of the right to
privacy under the Ninth Amendment as an "invention." Judge
Thomas also participated on a White House Working Group that
called for the overruling of Roe v. Wade. Never, until these
confirmation hearings, did Judge Thomas seek to clarify his views
or to distance himself from that highly publicized, controversial
report. Judge Thomas also referred to the Republican Party's
opposition to abortion as likely to attract African Americans to
the Republican Party.

Every sign from his record points in one direction -- Judge
Thomas, if confirmed, would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Judge
Thomas' repeated references to the issue of abortion at a minimum
undercuts the credibility of his statement, that he has no
opinion on Roe v. Wade and has never debated the contents.
                                   522

Second, I would like to respond to the suggestion by some that
Judge Thomas' testimony somehow addressed the grave concerns
raised by this record. Far from being reassuring, Judge Thomas'
carefully crafted and evasive answers raised new, very serious
issues of credibility.

In particular, a careful reading of the transcript reveals that
in his responses to Senator Biden's deliberate and repeated
questions, Judge Thomas avoided saying even that an individual
has any fundamental right to privacy including the right to use
contraception, that is based on the liberty/due process clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. Judge Thomas struggled to give the
same answer that Justice Souter gave last year, by referring to
the Equal Protection Clause basis for the Court's holding in
Eisenstadt v. Baird. In response to a question by Senator
Heflin, Judge Thomas summarized his responses to Senator Biden's
first round of questions concerning Eisenstadt as follows: "the
right of privacy that applied to non-married individuals in the
intimate relationship was established using equal protection
analysis under Eisenstadt v. Baird." Even during Senator Biden's
second round of questioning on this point, when pressed hard for
a simple yes or no answer, Judge Thomas qualified his affirmative
response by saying, "I have expressed on what I base that, and I
would leave it at that." I do not believe that Judge Thomas'
responses can fairly be interpreted to provide any meaningful
reassurance that he recognizes a fundamental right of individual
                                     523

privacy independent of the equal protection analysis in
Eisenstadt.

At a minimum, Judge Thomas1 testimony provides absolutely no
reassurance on the one aspect of the right to privacy which he
repeatedly refused to discuss: the fundamental right to choose
abortion. Moreover, although his testimony in many respects
echoes the testimony given by Judge David Souter, Judge Thomas'
record is strikingly different and clearly indicates his
hostility to the right to choose. While some Senators may have
given Judge Souter the benefit of every doubt, Judge Thomas'
record leaves no room for ambiguity.

I was not a likely candidate to be the lawyer in a very
controversial case. I am the daughter of a Methodist preacher;
was raised in small Texas towns like Munday, Canyon and Vernon;
and in high school was President of our Future Homemakers of
America chapter.

But I, like most women of my generation, questioned the limits
placed on women and reacted with conviction when faced by
discrimination. I played high school basketball at a time women
were allowed only two dribbles and had to stop at half court. I
did my practice teaching at a time pregnant teachers had to quit
work. My college dean told me I shouldn't consider law school
because no woman from McMurry College ever had and it would be
                                     524

too difficult. After law school, I had a similar experience to
that of now-Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and was unable to get a
legal job with a law firm, when I applied for credit, the store
manager told me I had to get my husband's signature even though I
was putting him through law school. I discovered just before I
argued Roe that there were no restroom facilities for women in
the lawyer's lounge in the Supreme Court building.

As we worked to end blatant discrimination against women based on
out-dated and false stereotypes, we realized that women could not
truly make the decisions that most affect their lives -- about
education, employment, family size, finances, and physical and
emotional health -- unless they were able to decide when and
under what circumstances to bear a child.

We did not fight anti-abortion laws because we were "for"
abortion. We did so because we believed it was individuals --
and not the government -- who should make the most fundamental
decisions of their lives.

We all know that if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, the affluent
and people like us will find the money to travel and be able to
obtain safe procedures. The poor and women of color will be
those most adversely affected, just as was true pre-Roe as my
University of Texas colleague Professor Mark Graber points out in
his paper, "The Ghost of Abortion Past."
                                  525

I would like to see the diversity of Americans reflected by those
who serve as Justices, but how sad and ironic it would be if
Justice Marshall, a champion for all who suffered unequal
treatment, were to be replaced by a man whose presence on the
Court helped to end the principles for which Justice Marshall
fought.

  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much. I must tell you it is obvi-
ous you argued before the Supreme Court. You are the only one in
the last 74 days that came in under the 5 minutes. Thank you very,
very much.

  Ms. Michelman.

                    STATEMENT OF KATE MICHELMAN
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond.
I very much appreciate the opportunity to talk with you today.
  Senator THURMOND. Speak into your machine, if you could, just a
little bit louder.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. My machine. I always have an aversion to ma-
chines.
  I thought very long and hard about the focus of my testimony
today. During this process, I think we must remember a very
simple truth: What is decided here will profoundly affect the lives
of millions of Americans outside this hearing room--Americans
who depend on you to protect their most cherished rights and liber-
ties. Among them are the countless desperate women who, prior to
Roe v. Wade, were deprived of their privacy, their dignity, and
even their health and their lives. Millions of Americans know first-
hand that when we get past constitutional theory, legal precedent,
and Court rulings, this confirmation process will determine wheth-
er millions of women will be forced, terrified and alone, to face one
of the most difficult crises of their lives.
  Mr. Chairman, today I must tell you that I was one of those
women. I was relatively lucky. I was, able to avoid resorting to the
back alleys. But I suffered the shame, degradation, and humiliation
of being deprived of my right to make one of the most important
decisions of my life.
  Like most women in this Nation, I never expected to need an
abortion. Most women do not. But before Roe, I faced the trauma of
a crisis pregnancy. I was raised Catholic, married young, and as a
young woman I had three wonderful daughters in 3 years. But in
1970, my husband suddenly announced that he was leaving me and
the children.
  I was devastated. Without money, a job, or a car, I was even
unable to get a charge account at the local five-and-dime because I
was not married any longer. I was also very ill at the time. My self-
esteem was destroyed. My entire world was shattered, and my
family was forced onto welfare.
  Almost immediately after my husband left me, I learned that I
was pregnant. With three children under the age of six, I alone had
to meet their every need--financial, emotional, and physical. The
very survival of my family was at stake. Indeed, my family was at
risk of being split apart.
  Because abortion was largely illegal at the time, I had to struggle
with this decision all by myself, all alone. Deciding whether or not
to have this abortion was probably one of the most difficult and
complex decisions of my life. It challenged every religious, moral,
and ethical belief I had. But I looked into the eyes of my three
daughters and made what I think was one of the most moral deci-
sions I have ever made.
                                             527

  It was at this point that I became painfully aware that having
another child would have made it absolutely impossible to cope
with an already desperate situation. I am certain that my family
would not have survived intact.

  But in 1970, you know, the Government did not allow me to
make this decision for myself. I was forced to appear before a hos-
pital-appointed panel of four men. These complete strangers cross-
examined me about the most intimate and personal details of my
life. It was humiliating. I was an adult woman, a mother of three,
and yet I had to win their permission to make a decision about my
family, my life, and my future. And I alone would have to live with
the consequences of their decision.

  But, finally, they granted me their permission. I was admitted to
the hospital. Yet as I awaited the procedure, I was told by a nurse
that they had forgotten one more legal requirement.

  I would not be able to have the abortion without written permis-
sion from the man who had just deserted me and my children. I
literally had to leave the hospital and find the man who had reject-
ed me and ask his permission. It was a degrading, dehumanizing
experience, an assault to my integrity, my dignity, and my very
sense of self.

  At all times during this process, I carried with me the phone
number of an illegal abortionist. And if at any juncture I was
thwarted in my attempt to have a hospital abortion, I was pre-
pared to break the law and risk my life because my family's surviv-
al depended on it.

  Mr. Chairman, Senators, perhaps now you can begin to under-
stand the pain and anger I feel when I hear the right to choose dis-
missed as a mere single issue. This right is absolutely fundamen-
tal--fundamental to our dignity, to our power to shape our own
lives, to our ability to act in the best interests of our families. No
issue--none--has a greater impact on the lives and futures of
American women and their families.

  The record shows that, if confirmed, Judge Thomas would indeed
vote to take away this fundamental right--to take this Nation back
to the days when women had no alternative but the back alleys for
health care. What happens in the halls of Congress must reflect
what is in the hearts of the American people. This may be one of
the last opportunities you have to stand up for a woman's funda-
mental right to choose before Roe v. Wade is ultimately over-
turned. I urge you to refuse to confirm Judge Thomas.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Ms. Michelman.
  Ms. Wattleton.

                    STATEMENT OF FA YE WATTLETON

  Ms. WATTLETON. Mr. Chairman and members of the Judiciary
Committee, I am indeed honored and I appreciate the opportunity
to appear before you today in my role as president of Planned Par-
enthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood
Action Fund. For 75 years, as advocates and providers of reproduc-
tive health care, Planned Parenthood has empowered tens of mil-
lions of men, women, and their families to have control of their
lives--enabling individuals to make informed decisions about re-
production and to obtain quality medical services to prevent un-
wanted pregnancies.

  Precisely 1 year ago, this committee heard Kate Michelman and
I ask you solemnly to reject now-Justice David H. Souter, and we
heard him in the introduction to his appearance before you indi-
cate that he believed in making the "promises of the Constitution a
reality for our time, and to preserve that Constitution for the gen-
erations that will follow us." We too believe that such a living doc-
ument as the Constitution must be nurtured and preserved. And
yet with Mr. Souter's ascension to the Court, we do stand at the
precipice of the reversal of one of the most important rights that
American women have attained and have had recognized in this
century.

  Mr. Souter refused to answer questions on the substance of the
right to privacy in the Supreme Court rulings that have flowed
from the right to privacy. In his first opportunity on the Court, he
expressed himself in a way that many of us thought unimaginable.
In Rust v. Sullivan, he voted with the majority in upholding the
Federal bureaucracy's power to enforce speech censorship between
a woman and her doctor.

  In permitting the Government to prohibit any discussion of abor-
tion in family clinics, the Court in Rust struck at one of the most
sacred tenets of our liberties--the right to free speech.

  The Senate, like the American public, has responded with out-
rage to the Rust decision and has acted boldly to overturn it. But I
must say that had the Senate been as bold in insisting that Judge
Souter explain his philosophy on reproductive rights, it might have
rejected his candidacy instead of leaving American women to hope
for the best, and we might not have had the gag rule today.

  This year, Americans watched and listened to learn of Judge
Thomas' views on the right to privacy. The committee did not hesi-
tate to press him on other "unsettled" doctrinal questions, nor did
he refuse to express his philosophy on those matters. He did not
even refuse to answer questions on the full range of privacy. What
he did refuse to acknowledge, however, was that privacy extends to
my right as a woman to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.

  There are those who argue that Judge Thomas should not be
forced to answer questions about abortion because other candidates
have not been required to do so. But the fact that this committee
did not press other candidates on this issue is not a reason to fail
to press this candidate on this issue.
                                                   532

  A high Court nominees's views on the constitutional right to
choose abortion have never been more critical than they are today.
The Supreme Court is now heavily weighted toward rightwing ex-
tremism, and an upcoming reconsideration of Roe v. Wade is virtu-
ally guaranteed. If Judge Thomas fully accepts the natural law doc-
trine as regards fetuses, it would make him more strongly anti-
abortion than any other sitting Justice because that doctrine holds
that abortion is constitutionally outlawed rather than subject to
State regulation.

  We fear that if Mr. Thomas is confirmed he will join the others
on the Court who have signaled their willingness to dismantle Roe.
This is the first time in constitutional history that a fundamental
right recognized is in danger of being denied.

  Prior to these hearings, much has been written about the clear
objections that Mr. Thomas spoke on with respect to Roe v. Wade,
and with his failure to answer the questions on this matter, we
have to ask ourselves why.

  Mr. Thomas also signed a report that you questioned him about,
and he has given his excuse as one that he did not read the report
carefully. Well, he had an opportunity to comment on that report,
and why did he fail to comment on whether he supported Roe v.
Wadeor the doctrine underlying Roe v. Wade?

  But even if we give Mr. Thomas the benefit of the doubt, there is
absolutely nothing in his record that indicates that he supports
Griswold, which gave the Americans the right to practice contra-
ception.

  Finally, it strains logic that this man who has boldly spoken out
on controversial issues also claims that he has never read or
thought about the historical Roe v. Wade decision, even though he
was in law school when it was handed down. His testimony leaves
all of us as Americans in a difficult position, both in evaluating his
disposition toward the constitutional privacy protection and in
evaluating his overall credibility and integrity.

  Any Supreme Court nominee who fails to reveal his or her judi-
cial philosophy in this area of established constitutional law or who
rejects the fundamental nature of Americans' reproductive rights
must likewise be rejected by those who represent us. We urge you
to refuse to confirm Clarence Thomas.

 Mr. Chairman:

 I appreciate the opportunity to appear today in my role as
 president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the
 Planned Parenthood Action Fund. For 75 years, as advocates and
providers of reproductive health care, Planned Parenthood has
promoted greater liberty in individual decision making about
pregnancy and childbearing. Planned Parenthood has empowered tens
of millions of women and their families to take control of their --
lives -- enabling individuals to make informed decisions about
reproduction and to obtain quality medical services to prevent
unwanted pregnancies. Each year more than 2.4 million Americans --
mostly young, mostly low income -- come to our 911 clinics
nationwide for the information and support they need to make the
most basic and private decisions about their reproductive lives.

Precisely one year ago this committee heard Judge David H. Souter
solemnly proclaim that a Supreme Court justice holds the
responsibility "to make the promises of the Constitution a reality
for our time, and to preserve that Constitution for the generations
that will follow us." We too believe in the Constitution as a
living document that must be nurtured and preserved through each
generation. Such is its enduring quality. Yet the reality of our
generation is that the process of nurturing and preserving our
rights and freedoms is being abandoned. For the first time,

                                                                        P04

 established eonetitutional rights  specifically reproductive
 rights -- are in danger of being reversed at the hands of the
 highest constitutional arbiters of our nation.

 It i the constitutional vision and methodology of those potential
 arbiters that this committee is charged with discerning -- as well
 as ensuring that the court retains a meaningful diversity of
 judicial philosophy. There are no guarantees that what a nominee
 says will govern how he or she will rule on the court; but that in
no way obviates the Senate's obligation to determine the
candidate's position.

While Mr. souter last year acknowledged that the Constitution
protects narital privacy, he stubbornly refused to answer questions
on the substance of that right and the landmark Supreme Court
rulings that have flowed from it. Reproductive rights was the only
area of questioning in which Mr. Souter demurred.

In Justice Souter's first opportunity to express himself on the
issue of reproductive rights as a member of the Supreme Court, he
became the fifth vote forming a majority in Rust v. Sullivan,
holding that the federal bureaucracy can enforce speech censorship
between a woman and her doctor. Rust v. Sullivan upheld the right
of the Bush administration to direct what a medical professional
can say in a family planning clinic for low-income women. In
permitting the government to prohibit any discussion of abortion,

                                      536

                                                                                       P05

 the court struck at one of the sacred tenets of our liberties --
 freedom of speech.

 The Senate, like the American people it represents, has responded -
 with shock and outrage to the Rust decision, and has acted boldly
 to overturn it. But I must say to you that had the Senate been as
 bold in insisting that Judge Souter come forward with more candor
 in explaining his philosophy on the right to reproductive control,
 it night have rejected his candidacy instead of leaving American
women to hope and pray for the best.

I refer to last year's confirmation hearing to underscore the
real-life consequences that flow out of this process. A nominee
who systematically evades questions on this fundamental issue
arrives at the court as a blank slate on an issue of profound
importance to women. If he conducted himself similarly on other
Issues of constitutional law, Americans would be compelled to ask
what is the meaning of the confirmation process.

Americans watched and listened to learn of Judge Thomas's views
about the constitutional right to privacy. The committee did not
hesitate to press Mr. Thomas on other "unsettled" doctrinal
questions that are likely to be brought before the Supreme Court,
ranging from discrimination law to capital punishment. Nor has he
refused to express his philosophy on these matters. He didn't even
refuse to answer all questions on privacy. What he did refuse to
                                   537

                                                                                      P06

 acknowledge was that the right to privacy extends to the right of
 a woman to terminate a pregnancy. What we have seen is another
 Souter-type performance.

 There are those who argue that Judge Thomas should not be forced to
 answer questiona about abortion because to do so would alienate one
 side or another in Congress -- and that other candidates for the
court have not been required to do so. We believe that the
committee should have pressed those other candidates to answer -- o r
should have rejected them for failing to do so.

But the fact that it did not take those actions does not justify
excusing Judge Thomas from responding, and the reason should be
obvious: A high court nominee's views on the constitutional right
to choose abortion have never been more critical than they are
today. The supreme Court is now heavily weighted toward right-wing
extremism, as evidenced by numerous recent rulings, and an upcoming
reconsideration of Roe v. Wade is virtually guaranteed. If Judge
Thomas fully accepts the "natural law" doctrine as regards fetuses,
it would make him more strongly anti-abortion than any of the
sitting justices, because that doctrine holds that abortion is
constitutionally outlawed rather than a subject for each state to
regulate. We fear that if Mr. Thomas is confirmed, he will join
the ranks of others on the court who have signaled their
willingness to dismantle Roe v. Wade. This process began with the
Webster decision in 1989 and moved forward last May with Rust. This
                                      538

                                                                                       P07

 is the first tina in constitutional history that a right recognized
 as fundamental is in danger of being denied. Women's lives hang in
 the balance.

 Mr. Thomas has acknowledged a general right to marital privacy.
 But Justice souter and Justice Kennedy embraced that same vague
 view. Before these hearings began, however/ it seemed very clear
 that this nominee had very clear objectlone to Roe v. Wade and the
constitutional principles underpinning it. Why else would he have
praised Lewis Lehrman's essay, titled "The Declaration of
Independence and the Right to Life," with its references to "the
struggle for the Inalienable right to life of the
child-in-the-womb.. . and "the conjured right to abortion in Roe v.
Wade"? His explanation to the committee about political coalition-
building is insufficient, particularly when such coalition-building
takes the form of condemning a decision that has done more than any
other of the 20th century to improve the condition of women's
lives.

Mr. Thomas went on to sign a report on the family to President
Reagan, which sharply attacks a series of supreme Court decisions -
that -- according to the report -- "abruptly strip the family of
its legal protections." The decisions specifically cited in this
report, in addition to Roe, were Planned Parenthood of Central
Missouri v. Danforth -- which struck down a state law giving
husbands and parents veto powers over their wives' and daughters'
                                     539

                                                                                      P08

 abortions, and Eisenstadt v. Baird -- which held that unmarried
 people have a right to use contraceptives. Judge Thomas has stated
 that he signed that report without reading it. So be it. Many of
 us have been guilty of signing documents without paying sufficient
 attention to then. But when we discover a mistake or a public
misstatement, a correction or clarifying statement is the minimal
 norm. Judge Thomas insists, several years later/ that he never got
around to reading the report, even though it was highly
controversial and well-publicized at the time.

Although he seems to have positioned himself otherwise for this
hearing by his general embrace of Griswold v. Connecticut. Judge
Thomas has previously criticized Justice Goldberg's use of the
Ninth Amendment in reaching that decision. This seeming
contradiction -- taken in light of his praise for the Lehrman
article -- should be fully explained before this body. But even if
we give Mr. Thomas the benefit of the doubt, there is absolutely
nothing in his record -- in his writings and speeches and court
cases -- to indicate support for Griswold. Neither is there
anything anywhere, prior to his statements before this committee,
to indicate that he is sensitive to, concerned about, or respectful
of the privacy right for all individuals to make reproductive
decisions, including the choice of abortion.

Finally, it strains logic and stretches the imagination when this
man -- who has boldly spoken out on many controversial, cutting-
                                      540

 edge issues -- also claims that he has never read about, discussed,
 or thought about the historic Roe decision -- even when he has
 spoken and written about it. Judge Thomas was studying at Yale
 University Law School when Roe was decided. Is it possible that
 such a distinguished law school would have failed to foster
 discussion and broad debate among its students on a major
 constitutional landmark? His testimony leaves the American people
 in a difficult position, both in evaluating Judge Thomas'
disposition toward the constitutional privacy protection and in
evaluating his overall credibility and integrity.

There is no doubt in my mind that if this committee had reason to
suspect that a nominee were prepared to overrule Brown v. Board of
Education, or New York Times v. Sullivan, it would insist upon
answers to clarify the nominee's beliefs and intentions. As an
African-American, I fully appreciate the significance that you and
the American people attach to the court's decision in Brown. As an
American who cherishes the right to free speech, I appreciate as
well the significance attached to New York Times v. Sullivan. As
a Woman, Griswold and Roe are no less important. The right to
reproductive privacy -- to determine whether and when to bear
children -- is as fundamentally important to the wellbeing of
American women and families as we enter the 21st century, as Brown
or Sullivan were at the mid-point of the 20th century. All
Americans, regardless of gender or race, are beneficiaries of these
landmark decisions that have recognized inalienable human rights.

It la unfortunate that he Is unwilling to acknowledge their
universality, their constitutional soundness, and the rights and
freedoms that emanate from them.

Planned Parenthood opposes Judge Thomas's confirmation for the sane
reasons that we opposed that of Judge Souter. As I testified to
this committee last year, our fundamental reproductive rights, as
well as the health and wellbeing of American women, are on the
line. Any Supreme Court nominee who fails to reveal his or her
judicial philosophy in this area of established constitutional law,
or who rejects the fundamental nature of Americans' reproductive
rights, must likewise be rejected by those who represent us. we
urge you to refuse to confirm clarence Thomas.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
   Governor.

                STATEMENT OF MADELEINE MAY KUNIN

   Ms. KUNIN. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I
thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to join this
panel and testify in regard to the confirmation of Judge Thomas as
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

   My political experience has taught me that in our quest to make
just laws, we must constantly remind ourselves of the nexus be-
tween the orderly world of public policy and the real world of
human beings. It is their faces, as we have just heard from Kate
Michelman, and their circumstances which we must bear in mind.

  This is particularly true in regard to the ability of a woman to
make a personal moral decision on the difficult question of wheth-
er to continue or terminate a pregnancy. It is essential to human-
ize this question, to visualize the anguish, the confusion, the inequi-
ty that will result if we continue to erode Roe v. Wade.

  As a former Governor, I am acutely aware of the unequal bur-
dens that would be born by States if this fundamental right is de-
termined on a State-by-State basis, and I am equally cognizant of
the unequal rights that would be meted out to women, dependent
on where they happen to live, their access to information, money,
and transportation.

  It is Judge Thomas' silence on this question that causes such
anxiety for so many women, who fear that his ascendancy to the
Court will inaugurate a most painful era for American families, in
contrast to the post-ifoe v. Wade era where each has made a deci-
sion according to her conscience.

  Judge Thomas has indicated that he is sensitive to the effect that
the law can have on individual lives when he movingly described
the impact of Jim Crow laws on his grandmother and on his grand-
father.

  What many Americans are asking is: Can he bring this same
sensitivity to the contemporary question of reproductive freedom?

   Can he understand the humiliation, embarrassment, and fear
felt today by a woman who is escorted into a health clinic, past a
yelling and threatening mob? Can he understand what it means to
be patronized, to be dependent on charity and chance, instead of
the equal protection of the law?

   As a former elected official, I know that my constituency--you
know this as well--would not tolerate any candidate for public
office who would not make his or her position clear on this ques-
tion.

   We acknowledge the judiciary is different. We need not exact a
pledge on how a judge would vote on a specific case. But neither
should we absolve him of all accountability.

   I cannot accept the premise that underlies what I have heard,
that there is some objective legal truth that will naturally reveal
itself, that the answers to the most divisive social questions of our
time will emerge if our judges purge themselves of all ambiguity,
opinion, and feeling, and focus, without blinking, on the facts.
                                      543

Frankly, if that were the case, these cases would have been decided
long ago.

  There are many judges who have a knowledge of the law. That is
the easy part. It is the contradictions within the human condition,
the agony of ambiguous moral choices, the pain of weighing one
truth against another. That is what is hard. And those are the
heavy burdens that we ask the highest judges of our land to carry.

  I must tell you the very fact that Judge Thomas has succeeded in
not clarifying his philosophy on this issue creates a quiet fury in
many women. Once again, when it comes to our issues, we find our-
selves repeating the ancient cycle of helplessness that women have
experienced throughout history. The sense of powerlessness is pain-
ful. It is apparent right here in this room where women are not
equally represented in the decisionmaking process of this country.
We are put in the position of pleaders, asking you to ask our ques-
tions for us, to be our standins, to intercede on our behalf.

  Once again, our question, central to our lives, the one that
women all over this country are asking is not being answered. We
have to take our chances. We have to live on hope. We have to be-
lieve that silence equals fairness when, in fact, we fear that silence
equals just the opposite.

  I believe I speak for many women when I say we have a right to
a forthright answer on this most wrenching moral issue. And the
American people, regardless of their view on this issue, have a
right to expect any nominee to the Supreme Court of the United
States to describe his or her record and philosophy.

  In a democracy, it is a sad day, indeed, when silence assures vic-
tory.

  I respect that each Senator, after a great deal of thought, will
reach his decision on whether or not Judge Thomas has met the
basic standard for the Supreme Court.

  My conclusion is that Judge Thomas has not provided sufficient
information to earn confirmation.

  After 2 weeks of hearings, the question remains unanswered:
Who is Judge Thomas?

  Any nominee to the Supreme Court has the obligation to give
that answer to the American people.

  Thank you kindly for permitting me to share my views.

CLARENCE THOMAS.

                                          SEPTEMBER 19, 1991

Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. I thank you for
giving me the opportunity to testify regarding the confirmation
of Judge Clarence Thomas as an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court.

You have spent months pouring over his record, marshaled
squadrons of researchers, and he in turn, engaged his supporters
to help him edit that record. You have each done your job
exceedingly well, but something has been overlooked.

It is we, the people, who have lost out.

The message is that there is a direct correlation between the
amount of information a nominee reveals and the likelihood of his
confirmation. Less, in fact, is more.
                                     545

By stripping himself of past opinions and emotion, particularly
in the area of privacy, Judge Thomas hopes to be impartial.

I do not believe it can work.

It is our emotions which give us our humanity, which enable us to
empathize with others. That is the essential quality of justice.

I cannot accept the premise that there is some objective legal
truth which all naturally reveal itself; that the answers to the
most divisive social questions of our time now before the court,
will emerge if our Judges purge themselves of all ambiguity,
opinion, and feeling, and focus, without blinking, on the facts.

If that were the case, these questions would have been decided
long ago. There are many competent Judge who could determine
questions of law. That is the easy part.

If is the contradictions within the human condition, the agony of
ambiguous moral choices, the pain of weighing one truth against
another, that is what is hard and those are the heavy burdens
that we ask the highest Judges of our land to carry.

My political experience has taught me that in our quest to make
just laws, we must constantly remind ourselves of the nexus
between the orderly world of public policy and the real world of
human beings. It is their faces, their circumstances which we
                                     546

must bear in mind.

This is particularly true in regard to the ability of a woman to
make a personal moral decision on the difficult question of
whether to continue or terminate a pregnancy. It is essential to
humanize this question, to visualize the anguish, the confusion,
the inequity that will result if we continue to erode Roe v.

As a former Governor I am acutely aware of the unequal burdens
that would be born by states, if this fundamental right is
determine on a state by state basis, and I am equally cognizant
of the unequal rights that would be meted out to women, heavily
dependent on which state they resided in, their access to
information, money, and transportation.

It is Judge Thomas' silence on this question that causes anxiety
for so many women, who fear that his ascendancy to the Court will
inaugurate a most painful era for American families, in contrast
to the post Roe v. Wade period, when women have made this
decision, each according to her own conscience.

Judge Thomas has indicated that he is sensitive to the effect
that the law can have on individual lives when he movingly
described the impact of Jim Crow Laws on his grandmother, and the
effect of those laws, on the humiliating reference to his
grandfather as "boy."
                                      547

What many Americans are asking is, can he bring the same
sensitivity to the contemporary question of reproductive freedom?

Can he understand the humiliation, embarrassment, and fear felt
today by a woman escorted into a health clinic, past a yelling,
threatening mob? Can he understand what it means to be
patronized, to be dependent on charity and chance, instead of the
equal protection of the law?

I do not ask Judge Thomas to tell the American people how he
would rule on a particular case. I do, however, ask that Judge
Thomas share with us his general outlook criteria and approach to
this divisive American dilemma.

As a former elected official, like you, I know that my
constituency would not tolerate any candidate for public office
who would not make her or his position clear on this question.

The Judiciary is different. We need not exact a pledge on how he
would vote on a specific case. But neither should we absolve him
of all accountability.

I must tell you, the very fact that he has succeeded in not
clarifying his views on this issue which is of such great
importance to all Americans, creates a quiet fury in many women.

Once again, when it comes to our issues, we find ourselves
                                     548

repeating the ancient cycle of helplessness that women have

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Governor. Every time I hear you
speak, I am reminded why you were the Governor and why I wish
you still were Governor or Senator. I keep trying to convince Leahy
of that, but I have not worked it out yet. But, seriously, I am
always impressed when I hear you speak.

  Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to join in welcoming an extraordinary, distinguished
panel of witnesses and to commend them for brief, but very moving
and compelling testimony. It really says something, I think, when
we have distinguished individuals who have lives of accomplish-
ment and achievement have to come before the committee and talk
about very personal aspects of their lives. People do not do that
very willingly, because privacy is something which is highly re-
garded and protected. In order to make a point to have to describe
that, I think all of us are very moved by that presentation.

  Now, Judge Thomas had indicated that he had no agenda, that
he was going to be openminded, that he had a regard for precedent.
I think when he was being pressed on, I think it was probably on
the Griggs case, indicated that something that was in law for 17 or
18 years had a very important precedent in his own mind, that he
was reluctant to see unsettled law.

  I would think that perhaps people that were not looking for the
overruling of Roe could find different wisps during the course of
the period of his testimony to get some degree of belief that maybe
he would not, and yet there are a series of both the Lehrman
speech that he made in reference to Lehrman's presentation and
other comments that he made prior to these hearings on privacy
and other issues that would lead people to believe that he would.
So, as was pointed out by virtually all the panelists, it really is
very much an open question.

  Tell me, just to the extent that you can--I think probably a few
people could do a better job--if that decision is overturned, what
really does that mean in terms of the lives of women and families
in this country?

  Ms. WEDDINGTON. There is an article by one of my colleagues at
the University of Texas, Mark Graver, called "The Ghost of Abor-
tion Past," and what he really tries to do is point out what it was
like before Roe v. Wade was decided, in terms of its impact, par-
ticularly on the poor and women of color.

  I think if Roe v. Wade was overturned or seriously damaged, that
what you end up with is a situation much like those days of old,
where women of means will be able to travel to States or countries
where it is legal, but those who are younger, those who are poor,
those who are less sophisticated are going to return to some of the
illegal and very unsafe methods of abortion. It does not solve the
abortion issue.

  The second thing is I think it does away with the right of priva-
cy. I think that is important to many Americans, because of the
developing nature of intrusion, not just by government, but by
other methods, as well, through computers and a lot of other
things. We want a sense that we are safe in making those decisions
most fundamental to us.
                                      551
  If the right of privacy is overturned, I think that basic sense of
safety and who we are in our homes and our own lives in our deci-
sionmaking ability is threatened.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, Senator, I think it is difficult for most
people to really envision a world without Roe. I think most people
do not understand what havoc is going to come into play, when or
if Roe is overturned. It is, as I said in my testimony, the right to
choose is so profoundly fundamental to every other aspect of a
woman's life, her family's life, that if it is destroyed, her life is de-
stroyed. And I am not trying to be overly dramatic here.
  It is just hard to describe how it feels to be utterly powerless to
make a decision that has such a profoundly all-encompassing effect
ont not only the woman's life itself, whether she is able to have a
job, whether she is able to continue her education, whether she is
able to support the children she already has, but that decision af-
fects her economic well-being, her physical and emotional well-
being, her family's privacy.
  One of the untold stories prior to Roe is the story of the numbers
of children who were left motherless, because of the deaths of
women from illegal abortions or self-induced abortions. It is a
world that we do not want to contemplate, honestly.
  People say sometimes to me, oh, you are exaggerating, there
won't be a back alley abortion industry like there was before Roe.
Well, they are wrong. The same people who push drugs on our chil-
dren and our society are the same people who are going to try and
take advantage of the desperation of women who face crisis preg-
nancies.
  I think that there will be nothing but chaos in this Nation, when
Roe is overturned, and I think that is why this right is so funda-
mental and we must require that Judge Thomas acknowledge that
right, or he should not sit on the highest Court of the land.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I am a nurse and I am, by profession, a nurse
midwife and I was trained in the years when abortions were illegal
in this country. I can never forget the desperate faces of healthy
young women who suffered from the injury of illegal abortion. I
can never forget the odor of infection as these women entered the
hospital as a result of various objects being inserted into their vagi-
nas and into their uteri to effect an abortion.
  It is for that reason that I do not want to see women face that
kind of degradation again. Mostly, I know that those were poor
women and that those were my sisters, African-American women,
and so I have a very personal and passionate interest in preserving
the right for women to have safe, legal abortions that do not kill
them.
  There is much that is given to romancing the notion that abor-
tion, if given to the States, will not be illegal, and that, anyway,
States are involved in a reform process that the Supreme Court de-
cision in 1973 took away from them.
  A closer reading of the history will reveal no such evidence. In
fact, after a few States in the early 1970's legalized their repressive
legals, no other States were able to move, repeal, or reform legisla-
tion, and even in those States where there had been some reform,
the rules for a woman to get through in order to have a legal abor-
tion were formidable.
                                      552
  So, the notion that States will somehow allow women to have
reasonable access to safe abortion is really fantasy and is not re-
flected by the evidence of history. I think it will once again be a
time in which abortion will largely be unavailable to women and
that the first to suffer will be poor women and minority women,
and affluent women will face the humiliation of engaging in under-
ground and illegal activities, but perhaps they will escape with
their lives and their bodies intact.
  Ms. KUNIN. Senator, as I try to envision a post-itoe v. Wade
world, I think the clock would not just go back to pre-Roev. Wade,
because before Roe v. Wade, while there were many courageous
people who had to seek abortions by whatever ways they could, ba-
sically, the law of the land did not permit it.
  What we have had for the last almost 20 years is that the law
within the limited guidelines of Roe v. Wade make abortion legal
and safe, so you have really had to see change in our society that is
very, very profound and has affected women's lives in every possi-
ble way, with a true ability to decide when and how many children
to have. Women could make other decisions as to their economic
standing, their equality as human beings in general, and by erod-
ing or reversing Roe v. Wade, I think it will create a kind of ten-
sion, a kind of anger, a kind of explosion that we do not fully ap-
preciate.
  I do not think this country has in the past taken away rights
that it has once previously granted, and to push the clock back I
think will create an internal battlefield that will be very, very
painful.
  Now, in addition to that, I believe the practical impact from the
States level will be that you will probably have violence of opportu-
nity to have illegal abortion and you will have islands where it is
impossible to have an abortion.
  Vermont, I am quite confident, would maintain that right. In
fact, we had a case even before Roe v. Wade,that Senator Leahy is
very familiar with, that made abortion within certain limitations
legal.
  Louisiana we certainly know today would not. Massachusetts
might or might not. Pennsylvania will not, as indicated by the laws
they have passed. So, you are going to have tremendous confusion,
you are going to have a tremendous distraction in this country
from some of the other issues that we should be dealing with, the
poverty issues, the housing issues, the other domestic issues. I
think there will be a very wrenching and unfair time.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. My
time is up.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. I welcome the distinguished ladies here
today. I have no questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I was not here when the testimony began. I was at another
matter involving Senate duties and was unable to be here, but I lis-
tened to every word of the testimony right up to seconds of the
time I came through, the door, and I was quite moved by it.

  Ms. Weddington and Ms. Wattleton, you spoke of the various an-
swers Judge Thomas gave, and I believe you referred to a couple of
answers he gave to questions of mine, including his incredible
answer, when I asked him whether he had ever discussed the land-
mark case of Roe v. Wade, and he said he had no recollection of
ever discussing it. I reminded him that this came down when he
was a law student, and he said, as a married, working law student,
he did not have time to hang around after class and discuss things.

  I reminded him that I, like most members of my class at George-
town, were also married, working, holding down several jobs, in
fact, but at least between classes we discussed cases. But be that as
it may, I found it even more incredible that he had never discussed
it, according to his testimony, in the 17 years since the case came
down. He is probably the only lawyer in the whole country that
could make that claim.

  I then found it even more amazing, because of his statements on
the Lehrman article, and that bothered me, but he talked in his
testimony about the hushed whispers of illegal abortions that he
heard as a child.

  Ms. Michelman, that brings me to your testimony, which was
among the most powerful testimony we have heard before this
committee, I suspect not testimony that you gave easily or without
some significant emotion and consideration, both for yourself and
for your daughters.

  It reminds me of the days before either Governor Kunin or I
were really involved in politics, when I was a prosecutor in Ver-
mont, and at that time it was before the case of Bartlett v. Leahy
and Roe v. Wade--not Bartlett v. Leahy, but Beechan v. Leahy and
Roe v. Wade,which made clear that it would be a woman's choice
in this most difficult choice, and not a legislative body or prosecu-
tors or anything else.

  I had occasion to prosecute, as I have told some of you before, in
fact, mentioned at Judge Souter's hearing, occasion to prosecute
abortion. There was a case where I got called in the middle of the
night to come to a medical center then called the Mary Fletcher
Hospital, where a young woman had nearly died. She was in the
emergency room hemorrhaging from a botched abortion. The abor-
tion had been performed by a woman in Montreal. She had learned
how to perform these abortions while working as a nurse for the
S.S. at the Auschwitz Prison Camp in World War II.

  But she was brought there by a man in Burlington who would
arrange these abortions, then blackmail the women subsequently,
either for money or for sex. This was the first time that we had
been able to get a witness who would testify about him, testify to
what some of us had heard as rumors before. I successfully pros-
ecuted him and he went to prison. I do not remember what his
prison term was. Whatever it was, it was not enough, as far as I
was concerned. There is no prison term that would be long enough.

  I wonder sometimes--and this is not a question for any of you,
because I know the answer and all four of you have stated elo-
quently your feelings--I wonder, as I sit here this morning, we talk
about this being a single issue thing, and it has been said it is not,
it is an overriding, very major issue to all the women of this coun-
try--I wonder if sometimes when we are here, we deal with this as
                                                554

such an abstraction, you on this side or you on that side, which
banner do you march under.

  That is why I was concerned with Judge Thomas' answers. I told
him in my opening statement and during this hearing that he
could decide whether to answer or not answer, that is his decision,
but that it would be my decision on the advise and consent powers
that I have.

  I do not expect someone to agree with me on every issue, by any
means, but an issue like this, I cannot imagine any man or woman
in this country that would not have serious and deep-felt concerns,
and I cannot imagine any lawyer or anybody with an understand-
ing of the law who would not realize the consequences of going
back to the days of the backroom artist.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  The Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I have no questions of this panel.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Illinois.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I was not able
to be here for Ms. Michelman's testimony. I have read it and it is
powerful. I do not mean any disrespect to the statements of the
other three, but it is a personal experience and it says where we
may be going back to.
  As all of you have testified, the nominee has been evasive on this
question, but when we put the Lehrman testimony there and the
fact that he has been nominated by a President who has made a
pledge in this regard, when you take the tone of the writings--and
I think it is not unfair not that a conclusion can be drawn on this
basis, but just as one small piece of the mosaic, the Episcopal
Church generally has taken a pro-choice stand. He attends an Epis-
copal church that has made a crusade out of the opposite stand.
  And yet I ran into a woman in the hallway coming down here.
She said, "you are going to the hearings." And I said, "Yes." I said,
"How would you vote?" and she said, "I would vote for him unless
I thought he would be against Roe v. Wade, but I think he will sup-
port Roe v. Wade." Obviously, different people are drawing differ-
ent conclusions.
  On a scale of one to ten, ten being you are certain that he would
overturn Roe v. Wade,one being that he would be supportive--and
this is, I know, just pulling numbers out of a hat, but where would
you put him on a scale of 1 to 10, if I may ask each of you?
  Ms. WEDDINGTON. Senator, what bothers me is something he in-
advertently said in answer to some of this panel's questions. When
he said on the Lehrman article, I simply did it to appeal to the au-
dience, he was willing to mislead them about what his true feelings
were in order to appeal to them to do something else he wanted.
And so it really bothers me because I think he is trying to mislead
the people of this country.
  I think of so many criminal trials I have sat in on--I have not
tried any myself--where all the evidence led you in one direction
and then the defendant gets on the stand and has an entirely dif-
ferent story to tell and it is up to the judge and jury to decide
which is true.
                                                    555

  All of the evidence before he wanted your confirmation was that
he was opposed to abortion. I cannot believe what he says here. He
has never said, I believe Roe v. Wade should be the law; I believe in
the right of privacy; it applies to people under the Roe v. Wade doc-
trine. He has evaded and skirted.

  I say 10; he will not vote to uphold Roe v. Wade.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. I would have to agree with Sarah, Senator. I
think the evidence is very clear; his record is clear. In all the years
he was a policy official, as he describes himself, and was, he spoke
out on many issues, and when he spoke about the right to privacy
it was always a critical comment, you know, suggesting that the
right was an invented right, criticizing Roe v. Wade, applying natu-
ral law saying it was a splendid example, choosing that one article
that is an extreme attack on the right to choose as a splendid ex-
ample.
  He had many opportunities during the years to say something
positive. Now, he comes before this committee and he says he has
only skimmed the article. He says he signed a report, but he did
not read it. He says that, you know, he took an extreme position,
but he did not mean it. It is very hard to believe; it just raises seri-
ous questions of credibility.
  I just do not have any doubt in my mind that if he is on the
Court, he will join the others, Rehnquist and Scalia, in moving this
Court to overturn Roe, and my fear is that he will go much further
than any sitting Justice. That Lehrman article suggests that States
would have no right to even legislate in the area of abortion; that
it would require States to outlaw all abortions even in the cases of
life endangerment.
  I just do not think he would uphold this fundamental right, and I
think this right is so basic and so fundamental, just like the right
to free speech, that unless he is acknowledging that right and that
it exists in the Constitution--you know, protects that right just like
free speech--I just don't think he should sit on this Court.
  Senator SIMON. SO you give him

   Ms. MICHELMAN. I am a 10.

  Senator SIMON. Ten. Ms. Wattleton?
  Ms. WATTLETON. I would add to that. My view is that this is not
a candidate that would uphold the doctrine that recognized
women's rights to the integrity of our bodies. And since Mr. Souter,
whom you all expressed your hope would find such privacy residing
in the Constitution, has joined the Court and has voted not only
to--well, has not been asked to vote on Roe, but has voted on some-
thing even more extreme, and that is whether Americans' freedom
of speech will be restricted by the Government.
  And a candidate whom you had high hopes for just a year ago
has gone on to say that with respect to Government policy and the
intervention of Government, our very thoughts can be controlled
and the words that we say can be restricted. It seems to me to
leave this in a very unusually charged environment.
  So it is within the context of a failure to answer those questions
that we are opposing him, and I would add that I believe that he is
a 10 and that he would vote with the majority, as he has voted
with his political benefactors and has spoken philosophically in
their behalf.
                                              556

   I would only ask whether this committee would be willing to
trust a candidate if, as Kate has indicated, it was a matter of free
speech and he had said one thing before confirmation and left the
slate quite blank during confirmation.

   One of the points that Mr. Thomas has made which I find very
curious is that to decline or to give you some sense of his philo-
sophical views with respect to constitutional protections for repro-
duction would somehow disqualify him as an unbiased and impar-
tial Justice. If we applied that reasoning, we would have to say
that all of the sitting Justices have given us their views on this
issue and so therefore they are unqualified to consider future cases
in an impartial fashion. It really begs the imagination.

  Finally, I would oppose him because he has been so willing to ex-
pound on every other subject, including capital punishment, cases
that are before the Court right now. So why fail to answer the
question on this most important constitutional issue that is so im-
portant to my integrity as a woman?

  So, as a woman, I would vote against him as a ten, and as repre-
sentative of an organization that is firmly committed to preserving
this right for all women, we would hold that he should not be con-
firmed.

  Senator SIMON. Governor.
  Ms. KUNIN. Senator, technically, what we are asked to believe is
that silence equals impartiality; that the fact that he has said noth-
ing and declared nothing really asks us to believe that this is a
blank slate and that the facts as they appear to him will determine
how he will rule.
  In effect, that presumes that there is sort of an equal struggle.
Both sides are vying to fill up that blank page, but in reality one
side has gotten a head start because there is a record and there is
evidence of his past beliefs. So what looks like a totally even tug of
war for the opinion of this judge really is not. It is already weight-
ed on one side, unless one believes that he totally dismisses every-
thing he has said and written before, and I think few human
beings change as much as that.
  So in that sense, while one could say, yes, he has not said and we
should not presume his conclusion, when we look at the larger pic-
ture a conclusion really pushes forth from at least a reasonable
perspective.
  What bothers me, in addition, is that there is not an acknowl-
edgement that this is a divisive issue that everybody is struggling
with on one side or the other, and that the best way to deal with
such wrenching issues is to be straightforward with your own views
and say, all right, I am going to put them in perspective, but this is
generally what I believe, and as a judge I know cannot just act on
my beliefs. But at least I think you deal with controversy by ac-
knowledging where you stand to begin with and then try to find an
equitable solution.
  Senator SIMON. And give me a numerical
  Ms. KUNIN. I guess I would put it at nine; I would give him one
line that he might have some other perspective, but all the evi-
dence is certainly weighted the other way.
  Senator SIMON. And I see my time is about up, Mr. Chairman. I
would like to put into the record an article that appeared in the
                                                  557

New York Times about 4 weeks ago, about the experience in Brazil.
Brazil outlaws all abortions. The second leading cause for women
coming into the hospitals of Brazil--the second leading cause of
anyone coming in, men and women, is botched abortions in Brazil.

  And if I had additional time, I would have asked the witnesses if
they believe, if we overturn Roe v. Wade, we are going to reduce
the number of abortions in our country. I think the evidence is
pretty overwhelming from Brazil, as well as in the United States,
prior to Roe v. Wade.England, Scotland and Wales had much more
liberal abortion laws than we did, had far fewer abortions per thou-
sand people.

  The evidence is that the culture and other things determine the
number of abortions rather than the law, and the question we face
in part in this nomination, not the sole question, obviously, is
whether abortions will be safe or not safe.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

HEADLINE: Brazil Abortions: Illegal in Name Only

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 20

 BODY:
    In a hillside shantytown here, Selma, a 46-year-old cleaner, has a personal

reproductive history that seems out of character for Brazil -- three
children and 13 abortions.

    On paper, abortion is illegal in Brazil, Latin America's most populous
country. In March, a Brasilia jury convicted a woman of having an abortion. In
June, the Sao Paulo police raided a succession of underground clinics.

     Yet in a startling example of a gulf between law and reality, new
estimates indicate that Brazilian women have abortions at a rate equal to or
greater than women in the United States, where abortion is legal.

    Each year, the United States records roughly 3.9 million live births and
1.6 million abortions. Brazil records about four million births annually and
somewhere between 1.4 million and 2.4 million abortions, researchers for the
Alan Guttmacher Institute say.

    "Although abortion is illegal in every Latin American country except Cuba,
induced abortion is being widely practiced throughout the region," Susheela
Singh and Deirdre Wulf wrote recently in International Family Planning
Perspectives, a publication of the New York-based institute. "For every 10
women giving birth, three to four in Colombia and Brazil and two in Peru
terminate their pregnancies."

    On a recent afternoon at a state hospital serving Rio's shantytowns, a
third of the women in the maternity ward were admitted for complications
resulting from abortions.

    "The poor woman is alone, and she sees herself as without a way to avoid
pregnancy," said the director, who asked not to be identified by name. "When
she gets pregnant, she resorts to what she sees as the easiest way to solve
her problem: abortion."

    Even with underreporting of complication casess by hospitals, an estimated
400,000 women are admitted each year to recuperate from abortion attempts. Of
these, hundreds die. In contrast, in the United States, about 10,000 women are
admitted each year because of abortion complications.
                                     559

    "Complications from abortion are identified as the second largest cause for
admission in state hospitals -- and yet society pretends it doesn't happen,"
said Jose Genoino, a member of the Brazilian Congress from the left-wing
Workers Party. Seeking to break the silence, Mr. Genoino has proposed a bill
that would allow abortion on request in Brazil during the first 90 days of
pregnancy -- the first trimester.

   But in a nation that claims to have the world's largest population of Roman
Catholics, few politicians are willing to risk the wrath of the church
hierarchy by advocating expanded access to abortion.

   Technically, abortion is permitted in Brazil in cases of rape or danger
to the mother's health.

    But judges usually delay issuing orders until it is too late. At the Rainha
Silvia Maternity in nearby Itaborai, a 12-year-old who asked to be identified
only as Renata recently became a mother. First, she was raped by her
stepfather. Then, she was a victim of the slow-moving court system.

    In interviews, health professionals here could only recall two legal
abortions performed in this city of six million in the last three years.

    "Doctors are terrified of performing an abortion without written judicial
permission -- no one will do it," said a prosecutor, Branca Moreira Alves.

    Jaqueline Pitanguy, a feminist leader, said, "In the case of rape, the
great majority of women have clandestine abortions."

    Until a recession hit last year, surveys showed that abortions in Brazil
were divided roughly evenly between back-alley abortions and clinic
procedures.

    "Less women are using clinic services now; more are using the dangerous
self-induced methods," said Sarah Hawker Costa, who researches women's health
issues at the National School of Public Health.

   Although there are sporadic crackdowns, like the one in Sao Paulo last
month, Rio's affluent beachfront neighborhoods have an estimated 100 full-time
abortion clinics.

    "There is a silent acceptance of these clinics, and everyone knows where
they are located," said Katherine D. LaGuardia, who studied complications from
illegal abortions in Rio de Janeiro in 1988.

    "It appears that part of the population uses abortion as a means of
fertility regulation," said Ms. LaGuardia, who noted that the women she
surveyed in the middle-class clinics had had an average of four to five
abortions. Presenting a barrier to poor Brazilian women, the cost of clinical
abortions is around $150 -- roughly double the nation's minimum monthly
salary.
                                     560

    Traditionally, poor women turned to neighborhood midwives who attempted to
induce abortions with knitting needles, coat hangers or sticks. Rosangela
Novaes dos Santos, the Brasilia woman convicted of having an abortion in
March, was admitted to a hospital suffering from a hemmorrhage caused by a
piece of wire left in her uterus.

    Without any action expected to allow safe, legal abortions, health experts
predict that the abortion rate will remain high until birth-control
information and supplies are universally accessible.

    Surveys show that 90 percent of Brazilian women who use birth-control pills
buy them over the counter at pharmacies, with little or no instruction. Ms.
Costa's surveys of women recovering from abortion complications found that 40
percent became pregnant while trying to use some form of contraception,
largely the pill.

Some Can't Afford Condoms

     In addition, condoms sell for 50 cents apiece -- a luxury item for poor
people in this country. A new study by the Population Crisis Committee, a
private Washington group, says that condoms in Brazil are six times as
expensive as in the United States, as a percentage of per-capita income.

   A Government family-planning effort, the Program of Integral Assistance to
Women's Health, suffers from national budget constraints. Still, Education
Minister Carlos Chiarelli recently announced that sex education would start
next year in primary schools.

    But at the state-run slum clinic where Selma works as a cleaner, neither
birth-control devices nor counseling are available.

    "Women don't abort because they don't love their children; they do it
because of necessity," said Selma, who underwent a sterilization operation
after her 13th abortion.
                                         561

  Ms. WATTLETON. Mr. Simon, I would just like to add one piece. I
do not know whether that article also mentioned that in all of
Latin America illegal abortion is the leading cause of death in
women of reproductive age.

  Ms. MICHELMAN. One quick addition to Faye's comment. I think
the way to reduce abortion is not by taking away the right to
choose, but to reduce the need for, to make abortion less necessary
through sex education, family planning, contraceptive research. It
does not work to take away the right to choose; it just makes
women die.

  Senator SIMON. And I know my time is up, but we have a million
teenage pregnancies each year.

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Yes, we do, the highest rate
  Senator SIMON. About 300- or 400,000 of those end up in abor-
tions. We know that if we work on the drop-out rate, we reduce
teenage abortions.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. That is right.
  Senator SIMON. SO that there are things that we can do in a con-
structive way to reduce abortions.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. That is right.
  Senator SIMON. The difficulty is that many of the people who
take the anti-choice stand are the very people who are working
against the kind of social programs that would reduce the school
drop-outs and that sort of thing.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. The need for--that is right.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I think the points that you all raised are valid. I
would like to raise another one and then yield. I am not going to
ask any questions, but just make a point. I have heard it often
mentioned what Judge Thomas' religious beliefs were and are and
what church he attends, and whether that sheds any light on his
views.
  I want to make it abundantly clear, I think that is absolutely,
totally, completely irrelevant as a matter of principle, and I also
think it is irrelevant as a matter of fact. There are four practicing
Roman Catholics on this committee, three of whom support choice.
I would hate to be in the position of, because I am practicing
Catholic, someone assuming that I was unwilling to sustain Roe v.
Wade, were I on the bench. It would be an unfair argument. I
think people should be clear about that. It is totally irrelevant, in
my humble opinion.
  Now, I will yield to my friend from Philadelphia.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Ms. Michelman, your statement of your own personal experience
is very powerful. Let me ask you if you believe that a firm commit-
ment by a nominee to uphold Roe v. Wade is an indispensable
factor for confirmation.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Senator, I think a firm commitment to uphold
this fundamental right is as indispensable as a firm commitment to
uphold the right to free speech, the right to religious freedom--
basic, fundamental rights. And Faye, I think, and I both have said
a couple of times that this right is as basic as any of the other fun-
damental rights that our Founding Fathers elaborated upon, so I
do think it is.
                                                562

  Senator SPECTER. I had understood that to be your position. The
follow-up question to that is, given the political realities of where
the President stands on the issue, and he has had two nominees he
has put forward, Judge Souter and Judge Thomas, do you think it
is realistic for the President to do more than submit a nominee
who, at least on the record, is not committed one way or another?
Do you think it is politically realistic to expect the President to
submit a nominee who is committed to uphold Roe v.Wade?

  Ms. MICHELMAN. There is no question that the President, the last
two Presidents have adhered to the platform which says that judi-
cial nominations will be used to attain the goal of overturning Roe.
The last four or five nominations I think have showed us that is
true.

  What I do think, Senator, is this, that if this committee and the
Senate as a whole were to deny confirmation to this man, to Judge
Thomas, because he, among things--I think it is not the only
reason, but, among other things, he does not acknowledge the fun-
damental right to choose, it would be sending such a powerful mes-
sage to President Bush, that we could very likely get a nomination
that is a much more moderate person.

  Remember when President Nixon nominated Carswell and
Haynsworth, we got Justice Blackmun. So, I think it is possible
that we could get someone who does not hold such extreme views. I
mean the question here is--and this is the way I view Judge
Thomas--that maybe the difference between having a Justice on
the Court who would uphold the Louisiana and Utah laws, which
outlaw all abortions, as opposed to someone like Justice O'Connor,
who is much more judicious, if I could use that word, in her ap-
proach.

  I do think there is a degree of how far this Court is going to go in
assaulting our rights. For years to come, as you know, Senator,
there are many cases on the right to choose, abortion cases work-
ing their way through the judicial pipeline as we speak. You know,
whether we are going to have laws that require women to get per-
mission from their husbands or whether we are going to have out-
right bans on abortion, how far the right to privacy will be cut
back is really an issue here.

  I think we have to stand up, and even if another nominee does
come before us who does not acknowledge the right to choose, then
we must not confirm that nominee. This right is so fundamental, so
we just have to keep at it.

  Senator SPECTER. MS. Wattleton, you have expressed concern
over Justice Souter, and he voted with the majority in Rust v. Sul-
livan, an opinion that I have already disagreed with on a number
of grounds in the course of the hearings, and the Congress is
moving to change that in terms of a regulation which existed for 17
years which allowed for freedom of speech and counseling as being
consistent with the prohibition against the use of abortion as a
method of family planning.

  Why do you think that Justice Souter is committed to overturn
Roe v. Wade, because of that decision, in light of the fact that there
are many other considerations there, administrative procedure, the
regulation process, and so forth?
                                         563

  Ms. WATTLETON. Mr. Specter, I think it does not take a wild
imagination to think of a view of a judge who can find no protec-
tion in the Constitution for freedom of speech and a family plan-
ning clinic on abortion, to not find any protection in the Constitu-
tion for the exercise of the decision to have an abortion. It is the
extremism with respect to restricting speech that leaves us very
concerned, if not doubtful, about that Justice's vote to uphold Roe
v. Wade, when it is once again tested before the Court.

  We were hopeful that Mr. Souter would find that, in all matters,
the Government must not restrict American speech, must not gag
us, must not allow the Government to impose certain propaganda
in family planning clinics, and this particular decision was of the
most extreme, because it also encroached upon our right to free
speech, and that is why we are very concerned about Mr. Souter's
position on the continuing recognition of the right to abortion.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you may be right or you may not be
right. I would not conclude that he is necessarily on the other side
of the issue. I do not know, but in the event he is watching, and I
think there is some interest across the street in these hearings, I
would like to say that I think the issue is still open there.

  One other brief question, Ms. Wattleton. You commented about
the special concern of African-Americans and the plight of the poor
women. Would you have some expectation, at least, of Judge
Thomas, given his own roots and his concern for African-Ameri-
cans, would have some special sensitivity to that kind of African-
American concern among the poor people of this country?

  Ms. WATTLETON. I would hope so, but I am not comforted by this
candidate's steadfast refusal to acknowledge them. I, as an African-
American, have similar roots to Judge Thomas'. Most African-
Americans who have achieved and grew up in the 1950's and 1960's
of the South know the pain of discrimination. It was not my grand-
mother who was refused a toilet in a service station, it was I who
was refused a toilet and told to go behind the service station and to
excuse myself in a hole, because that is what I was expected to do,
as a child traveling through the South with my parents.

  So, it brings with me a certain level of sensitivity and commit-
ment, that if I were ever to sit before you for confirmation for any
purpose, I would not be able to say that I have not thought about
this issue, that I do not know about it, one that has divided the
country, that has taken over a city in this country in the State of
Kansas for several months now. It really does beg reality to suggest
that this candidate is sensitive, truly sensitive to what I feel, as an
African-American woman, when I see my life threatened.

  I come from similar roots. He is not unique. But the ascension to
the Supreme Court of the United States should not be on the basis
of our roots, but on the philosophy in which we want to keep and
see this country moving. That is really what is at issue here.

  Senator SPECTER. Governor Kunin, your testimony has been sig-
nificantly different from the other three women here today, in that
you have specifically stated that you would not ask Judge Thomas
for a statement as to how he would decide a specific case. I infer
from that that you mean that you would not ask him to decide if
he would uphold or reject Roe v. Wade.
                                              564

   Ms. KUNIN. I would ask, if I may interject, Senator, what his
general views are, not on a specific case that comes before the
Court, because I understand that.

   Senator SPECTER. I understood you in your statement to look to
his general views, and that was to be my next inquiry, and it is
this: He has said that he thinks there is as right of privacy in the
Constitution, and he has testified that he agrees with Eisenstadt v.
Baird, that there is a right on unmarried people for contraception,
and he has gone some distance, although not as far as some would
like, in accepting the right of privacy in contraception for unmar-
ried people. How far would he have to go, short of a commitment to
uphold Roe v. Wade, to satisfy you?

  Ms. KUNIN. I think he could go a great distance, without com-
menting on a specific case. For example, even on the death penalty,
he used the words "I don't think I would have trouble deciding or
dealing with the death penalty," which even in those few words in-
dicated to some degree what his views were.

  I think what is most disturbing is that he claims to have abso-
lutely no opinion in terms of the criteria he would use to judge
such a case, in terms of his overall philosophy, his values, and ac-
knowledging that this is a very divisive question in this country.
So, I am not satisfied that he has come anywhere near giving us an
indication of what his values are, what his general criteria are, and
that would give us some indication of which general direction he is
moving.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, he has not stated what he would do with
Roe v. Wade, and you agree that is acceptable. He has stated that
he accepts the right of privacy and he has gone down the road on
accepting the right for contraceptives for unmarried people, as well
as married people.

  The questioning has taken him on quite a number of steps, and,
speaking for myself, I would be interested to know just how far,
how many of those questions he has to answer to give you the
sense of assurance that you are looking for. I understand what the
other witnesses have said.

  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Ms. WEDDINGTON. Mr. Chairman, since I did not use all of my
original time, could I make just a few comments?
  The CHAIRMAN. Surely.
  Ms. WEDDINGTON. First, you see, I think one of the things that is
bothering me is that when Thomas was asked what are the most
important cases decided by the Supreme Court in the last 20 years,
one of them was an employment case and the other was Roe v.
Wade. How does a person nominated for the Supreme Court say
the two most important cases of the last 20 years he has no
thoughts about, at least one of them?
  The second thing is, while he did mention Eisenstadt, he did so
only in terms of the Due Process Clause, not in terms of
  The CHAIRMAN. That is not true.
   Ms. WEDDINGTON. We can go back and look and, Senator, I will
bow to your expertise
  The CHAIRMAN. I have it right here.
                                      565
  Ms. WEDDINGTON [continuing]. But I think we can double-check
that.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU can read the record, if you like, but that is
not true.
  Ms. WEDDINGTON. He did mention right of privacy, but there are
people who would say that simply stops with contraception or other
kinds of things, and he has not given us any indication. Now, I do
not think you should ask him in the Pennsylvania case, here are
the specific three provisions and what do you think about those. I
do not think you ought to ask him, Louisiana has these provisions
and what do you expressly think about that.
  But there is an overarching legal framework that he has given
no response to, and, meanwhile, I think women in this country are
feeling, as Governor Kunin masterfully capsulized, such a feeling
of being in limbo, such a feeling of being Murphy Brown-ed. TV
sometimes to me expresses the uncertainties, and if you saw her,
her friend came to her and said, "Well, if you're pregnant, I will go
with you to that back alley, I'll be there when you re butchered."
And Murphy Brown said, "Oh, no, you don't understand, abortion
is still legal--I haven't seen the paper today." But it is that sense
of hanging by such a slender thread and this is the slender thread.
  Ms. KUNIN. I would just like to add one final comment. I would
not want you to overly distinguish my testimony from the three
other women here. My intent--and maybe I did not state this as
clearly--was on a specific case, I think it is appropriate that any
nominee to the Supreme Court or to any court, for that matter, not
be asked his or her specific views, and that is how I dealt with my
appointees when I made judicial appointments, but I was very cer-
tain to figure out and ask that they tell me what their fundamen-
tal values were and what their thoughts were on the most divisive
issues facing our State and facing the Nation. And there is as big
difference there. I do not think we should make that into a gray
area, that if you do not ask about a specific point of law, that then
you can be silent on that enormous space between a specific case
and knowing who this person is.
  Thank you very much, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Weddington, when I said that is not true, I
was not questioning your integrity in making the statement. I
could understand how anyone would be confused by his answers,
but I asked my staff and I personally went back and got every
statement he made on the record relative to Eisenstadt, and be-
cause I was confused by what appeared to be his initial acceptance
of the right of privacy, not equal protection, enunciated in Eisen-
stadt, I asked him after he had been asked questions by my friends
on my right about the issue, and he said, on page 48 of the testimo-
ny on September 12, "That the Court has found such a right of pri-
vacy to exist in Eisenstadt v. Baird, and I do not have a quarrel
with that decision."
  I then pressed him, because I had read from the explicit para-
graph, which I do not have in front of me, enunciated in the major-
ity opinion saying that this was as right of privacy. I said, now,
comment on that paragraph. I said, "I'm asking you whether the
principle that I read to you, which has, in fact, been pointed to and
relied upon in other cases, is a constitutional principle with which
                                      566
you agree, which is that a single person has a right to privacy, not
equal protection, privacy, the same right of privacy as married
people on the issue of procreation." Answer, "I think that the
Court has so found, and I agree with that."

  Ms. WEDDINGTON. The language that I was looking at was on the
13th, where he said, "Senator, I think I answered earlier yes, based
on the precedent of Eisenstadt, which was an equal protection
case." Then he comes back and he says, "The question, then,
became was there a right of privacy that applied to non-married
individuals, and the point I was making"--I am quoting him--"was
that the right of privacy in the intimate relationship was estab-
lished using equal protection analysis under Eisenstadt v. Baird,"
and I think that is where we left it. So, that is what is causing me
concern, although I know you have tried very hard and with great
dexterity to try to ascertain that.

  The CHAIRMAN. If on the Court--if he gets on the Court>--he con-
cludes there is no such right, I would have to conclude he is a liar.
And they are very strong words. Because I do not know how
anyone could read specifically what he just said, what he said to
me, as anything else. And I specifically read the quote to Justice
Brennan: "A marital couple is not an independent entity with a
mind and heart of its own but an association of two individuals,
each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the
right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual,
married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental in-
trusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as a deci-
sion whether to bear or beget a child.'

  Now, what I am going to do is I am going to submit to him a
question in writing and ask him to answer me in writing for the
record that specific issue once and for all before I vote on his con-
firmation.

  Now I yield to my friend from Alabama who came in.
  Senator HEFLIN. I want to ask you maybe just academic ques-
tions, but it has been raised and I think some thought should be
given to what would be the state of the law, the status of legisla-
tive bodies' enforcement, and the general condition of society,
under a situation which could arise out of the theory espoused by
Lewis Lehrman, in his speech on "The Declaration of Independence
and the Right to Life," which has become a part of this issue in
answers that Judge Thomas has given pertaining to speeches and
positions on this issue. Basically Mr. Lehrman, as I understand it,
would advocate that the life of a child about to be born would
become an inalienable right under the concept of the right to life.
If that were to be constitutionally declared, then what regulations
could legislative bodies consider and pass under such a constitu-
tionally declared right by the Supreme Court?
  Ms. WATTLETON. Well, I commented on that, and then my col-
leagues can certainly speak on it. But if you extend Mr. Lehrman's
doctrine that Mr. Thomas so enthusiastically supported before his
appearance before this committee, Mr. Lehrman's views suggest
that there is an inalienable right to life after concept, not just at
the time of birth when the Constitution recognizes the protections
as such but from the moment of conception. In that case, it would
render all State permissibles as unacceptable and unpermissible.
                                               567

  Let me just say that it would not allow any abortions to be per-
formed even at the State level under restricted conditions. So that
this doctrine really is the most extreme position with respect to the
restriction on the right of a woman to choose abortion and goes far
beyond even the current State legislation that places very severe
restrictions but does make allowances for certain conditions.

  Kate, you may want to comment.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. I think Faye said it very well, Senator. That
doctrine that is espoused in the Lehrman article goes beyond any
holding that any current sitting Justice has articulated. It is, as
Faye says, the most extreme view, and it would require that all
abortions be outlawed. No State would have any right under that
doctrine to even legislate in the area of abortion. It would com-
pletely annihilate every woman's right to choose.
  It is such an extreme doctrine that it--that is why, by the way--
you know, it is not acceptable just to hear him say, well, I just used
that article to advance my views on civil rights. That article is
nothing but an extreme attack on our right to privacy and our
right to choose. And if Lehrman had written that article about nat-
ural law to apply to another fundamental right, like freedom of
speech, and he had chosen that article as a "splendid example" of
the application of natural law, I don't think any of you would allow
him to be confirmed unless he were to speak to the issue of the
fundamental right to free speech.
  You just do not choose an article of such an extreme nature as a
throw-away line in a speech and not be held accountable for it. It
just does not square. It is really a radical, radical doctrine. It is a
very scary doctrine.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, let me ask you this now, just hypothetical-
ly: If such a decision were to come down and then legislative bodies
did not set forth any punitive sanctions in support of that position,
how would it be enforced?
  Ms. WATTLETON. It would be enforced because many providers of
abortion services would decline to provide them. Doctors would
refuse to do them.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I am assuming that. But, I mean, suppose
there was a person that would do it. I think it falls in the sort of a
category as school prayer. In effect, in the absence of a legislative
body in a State taking any actions to reinforce that position by
passing criminal laws or putting some punitive sanction on it, and
someone attempted to punish a person who had had an abortion, or
punish the doctor or the nurse that are doing it, other than injunc-
tive relief, where would you be? What I am trying to find out is
where the status of society and law would be under such a concept.
  Ms. KUNIN. Senator, if I may just try to envision such a world, I
think you would have the worst of all possible worlds, and that is
disrespect for the Constitution itself, because the interpretation of
the Constitution would be so out of kilter with the majority view.
And to have such a situation where disrespect for the law, disobey-
ing the law, not enforcing the law becomes the law of the land, I
think would be a very chaotic period for this country.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Senator, just a quick thought. I am not a
lawyer, but I think that this doctrine would say that the Constitu-
tion requires treating abortion as murder, under the murder stat-

        56-271 O--93 19
                                                568

utes, and that is how the laws would be enforced. If that doctrine is
established as law, then abortion would be murder. And murder,
then doctors, women, and all who were deemed accomplices would,
could be then charged with the crime of murder. Maybe a lawyer
here can

  Ms. WATTLETON. I guess the point, however, is that the question
raises in my mind, What would it mean in the real-life circum-
stances of women, and what would it mean for poor women? I
think it really begs the imagination to think that there would be
States who would not enforce--or legislate restrictions and attempt
to enforce them since we now have such activities going on in
States even though Roe v. Wade has not been overturned. And
there would be a tremendous amount of pain and suffering for
women in this country.

  We could debate it, but I respectfully submit to you, Mr. Heflin,
that the right to control my body is, indeed, really central and fun-
damental to my integrity. It is not quite the same as praying in
school. It really is more central to my very being than those issues,
and I think that is why we are arguing so passionately on behalf of
preserving this right this morning.

  Senator HEFLIN. Thank you. That is all the questions I have.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Brown.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to commend this panel. It has been one of the most
thoughtful and rational and helpful presentations I think we have
had in the course of this hearing. You all have shared not only
your knowledge but your personal experiences, and I think, it has
been most helpful to all of us.
  Ms. Weddington, I particularly appreciated your relating your
personal experiences. I think there are a good many Americans
who simply are not familiar with the struggles women have had to
go through. And your sharing your personal experiences I think is
most helpful. My mother had law school professors tell her that
she was not welcome in their class and women were not welcome
in the legal profession. That has been some years ago, but she has
never forgotten it. I think it is helpful for Americans to understand
what it was like.
  Ms. Michelman, I particularly appreciate your sharing your per-
sonal, very personal experience. I think it is helpful because it
speaks more clearly than I would ever know how to explain how
this issue is really one about individual rights and human liberty,
that it really relates to the question of whether or not as citizens of
society we have our rights protected, whether the individual's
rights are paramount.
  That does not address the question of whether you like or dislike
abortions. It relates to what our Constitution envisions as individ-
ual freedoms and liberties, and I think your sharing that personal
example is very helpful to people to understand the issue.
  I, as I go through the record, am concerned in this area. Through
the chairman and others, I think you have shared some very rele-
vant testimony. One thing that has not been mentioned that I did
think was of interest, though, was a question and response by Sen-
ator Metzenbaum.
                                      569
  Senator Metzenbaum said, "Frankly, I am terrified that if we
turn the clock back on legal abortion services women will once
again be forced to resort to brutal and illegal abortions, the kind of
abortions where coat hangers are substitutes for surgical instru-
ments."
  In response, at least in part, Judge Thomas said, "It would, of
course--if a woman is subject to the agony of an environment like
that, on a personal level certainly I am very pained by that. I think
any of us would be. I would not want to see people subject to tor-
ture of that nature." And he goes on.
  I must say I agree with you the record is less than clear and is of
concern, and I think your testimony is very helpful in bringing it
out.
  Mr. Chairman, you were, I think, kind enough to share with us
an observation as a practicing Catholic that Catholics should not be
prejudged on this issue; that, indeed, a significant portion of the
Catholics that are members of this committee are pro-choice. And I
think that is a relevant and a fair observation. I just wanted to
assure you that as a practicing Republican the same is true. It is
true that our platform is not perfect.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are pro-choice? Is that what you are saying?
  Senator BROWN. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. I was not being facetious. I did not know what
you meant.
  Senator BROWN. But the vast majority of Republicans are pro-
choice as well, as I read the polls.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. If you could move your President, it would be
wonderful. [Laughter.]
  Senator BROWN. We are working on it.
  I yield back.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. I am about to yield to my friend
from Wisconsin, not only for the opportunity to question but to
chair because he has been kind enough to suggest he would sit in
for an hour while I go up and attempt to meet some of my duties
as chairman of the European Affairs Subcommittee of the Foreign
Relations Committee. I will be back shortly.
  Let me, with his permission, before I yield to him for both the
opportunity to question and to chair, just make one observation. I
think if one were to just read about these hearings and observe the
cartoons and others about the hearings, one might think that I un-
derstood the Governor's comments to possibly not be accurate as it
relates to the requirement, the role, the expectation and the func-
tion of this committee. I was interested to see--and I do not know
enough about this polling organization, but there is a thing called
the Polling Report that is published here in this city, and subscrib-
ers pay a certain amount of money for it every year, like other
newsletters.
  In the CBS-New York Times poll conducted, it reports the poll
conducted from September 3 to September 5--and I do not know
whether it has changed since then. But when asked "Who do you
trust to make the right decision about who should sit on the U.S.
Supreme Court, the President or the United States Senate?" All
people answering, 55 percent of the people said the Senate and 31
percent said the President.
                                              570

  When asked, when the Senate votes on a Supreme Court nomi-
nee--I raise these only because these are issues raised by witnesses
as well, and we will hear it later today as well. When the Senate
votes on a Supreme Court nominee, should it consider only the per-
son's legal qualifications and background, or along with legal back-
ground should the Senate also consider how the nominee might
vote on a major issue the Supreme Court decides? On legal only, 39
percent of the American people; issues as well, 49 percent. Roughly
half the American people think we should consider the nominee's
views on the major issues of the day.

  That is my quote. To be more precise, "Consider the nominee
might vote on major issues the Supreme Court decides." Lastly, the
same poll, CBS-New York Times Poll, when the Senate votes on a
Supreme Court nominee, should it consider, along with the nomi-
nee's legal qualifications, the person's personal history and charac-
ter? Seventy-three percent of the Americans said it should, and 21
percent of the American people say it should not.

  I think the American people have it pretty right, pretty on the
mark across the board on these things, and I think not for the rea-
sons they think Senators are any better qualified to pick a nomi-
nee, but I suspect because they understand that it is more likely to
be representative of what the American people are thinking about.

  I just raise that, and I have one question. The Philadelphia In-
quirer, a first-rate newspaper in this country, in my view and I
think in everyone else's view, not known for its being a conserva-
tive newspaper or a radical newspaper, left or right, in its editorial
today, endorsed Judge Thomas, and it says in two of the last three
paragraphs, and I would like you to comment on this, if you would:

  But our support for his elevation to the Supreme Court doesn't spring from an
analysis of his resume or from an awareness that his rejection would be followed by
a nomination of another conservative Republican. In part, it is a leap of faith, but
we believe Judge Thomas can rise to the occasion. We recommend the Senate go
with their hopes and confirm him.

  Now, as I ask you to comment on it, keep in mind, I have heard
several of you say something I have not found in the record, and I
think I sat here for almost every word that Judge Thomas uttered.
If I was not here, I walked to the back to go to the restroom or to
get a cup of coffee and could watch it on television in the room in
there while getting the coffee. I doubt whether there are very
many Americans who have been more attentive to what he said
than me.

  The phrase has been used a number of times that he has ex-
treme views and that he has explicitly endorsed the Lehrman con-
clusion, when he mentioned the Lehrman article. I, like my friend
from Colorado, find his position on this area ambiguous, at best,
but I did not find anywhere in the record, and I spent a hundred
hours on this, researching every word he ever wrote that I could
find before the hearing and listening to every word he said after-
wards, where he did anything that remotely approached endorsing
the Lehrman article.

  I agree, you could go to the issue of whether or not he was being
candid, whether or not one should believe him or not believe him,
but I did not find anywhere in the record on that issue where he
                                         571

evidenced extreme views, where, on the face of what he said, was
anything extreme or an explicit endorsement.

  The only thing I could find was what appeared to be the closest
thing to an explicit rejection of the conclusion, and I am trying to
find that part of the record I had here a moment ago, with regard
to a long discussion about the Lehrman article, which was raised a
number of times.

  In response to Senator Leahy, on the 13th, on Friday, he said,
the last sentence, Senator Leahy, "Do you agree with his"--mean-
ing Lehrman--"his conclusion that all abortion is unconstitution-
al?"

  "Judge THOMAS. The point that I am making is that I have not,
nor have I ever, endorsed this conclusion or supported this conclu-
sion."

  Ms. WATTLETON. Mr. Biden, the facts do not substantiate his
statement, because he did in fact acknowledge the wisdom of Mr.
Lehrman's conclusions in his speech.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let's be precise.
  Ms. WATTLETON. NOW, we have not
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me interrupt you, now, because this is very
important.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I know it is, and I will clarify what I have got to
say.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, he did not--what he specifically said was,
"It was a splendid application of the principle of natural law."
  Ms. WATTLETON. But that "splendid application" was that the
fetus has an inalienable right to life from the moment of concep-
tion, and if that is not at odds or in contradiction to the concept of
the woman to make the right and to have the right to make the
decision, I fail to understand what is. What I am saying is that he
did say that "it was a splendid application." If he did not think
that the fetus had an inalienable right to law, then why didn't he
select another example in which to build the conservative coalition
for civil rights?
  We find it highly curious that he would select this particular
issue, one that is so contentious in this country, that is so central
to women's integrity, to expand on the virtues of Mr. Lehrman's
vision of natural law, that in the face of his refusing to answer this
committee's questions, not our questions, but your questions about
whether he believed that the constitutional protections extended to
the right not to procreate can leave us with no other conclusion.
He had an opportunity before you to clarify that.
  I find no comfort in his desire not to see a woman go through the
torture of illegal abortion, because he may believe that she doesn't
have to face illegal abortion, but to carry a pregnancy against her
will to term, so that was not expounded upon, either.
  So, I think that all of these things together force us to reach the
conclusions that we have expressed here today.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am not questioning your right to make the
judgment or your judgment.
   Ms. WATTLETON. NO, I am not saying that you are.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am saying that you are raising the issue of how
you arrive at that
  Ms. WATTLETON. I am just giving you the reasoning for why.
                                                572

  Ms. WEDDINGTON. Senator Biden, let me call to your attention
the Heritage Lectures publication, "Why Black Americans Should
Look to Conservative Policies," and I am reading exactly from it.
Mr. Thomas said, "But the Heritage Foundation Trustee Lewis
Lehrman's recent essay in the American Spectator, on the Declara-
tion of Independence and the meaning of the right to life, is a
splendid example of applying natural law."

  The CHAIRMAN. That is exactly "a splendid example"--I mean if
it didn't have the sentence "a splendid example of applying the
right to life," I would acknowledge

  Ms. WEDDINGTON. But it does, it says "and the meaning of"
  Ms. WATTLETON. NO, that is what he is saying, he is saying
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. "Of the meaning of the right to life
is a splendid example of applying the"--just to make the point,
let's assume he explicitly rejected the notion of natural law, which
he has not, in my view, but let's assume he had. I could make the
same exact statement he made and it be completely consistent with
my support of Roe. I could say I oppose natural law, it's a bad way
to use the Constitution, to interpret the Constitution, but Mr. Lehr-
man's article expounding on the right to life, it occurring at the
moment of conception, it being et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, is a
splendid example of applying natural law, and you would, nor no
reasonable person could possibly or would possibly draw the conclu-
sion that that meant I supported Lehrman s position.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. But you would, Senator
  Ms. WATTLETON. I would?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU would?
  Ms. WATTLETON. Because the adjective "splendid" places a value
on the wisdom of that application.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Ms. WATTLETON. I think we are not taking issue with the doc-
trine of natural law, it is how that doctrine is applied that is at
issue here.

  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that. I don't want to belabor this.
  Ms. WATTLETON. It is a splendid example and I think it can only
be viewed as very complimentary and supportive.
  The CHAIRMAN. I see. If I were trying to make a point that com-
munism is a perfect formula for implementing totalitarian dictator-
ships, and I said in a lecture, "And Joseph Stalin's application of
Marxist-Leninist theories was a splendid example of how they
result in totalitarian government," would that be an endorsement?
  Ms. WATTLETON. That would be a recognition of the wisdom of
Mr. Stalin's application of that theory for that particular outcome.
  The CHAIRMAN. I want to make it clear. I don't
  Ms. WATTLETON. And there is no way that we can avoid the word
"splendid" is what it means
  The CHAIRMAN. I completely, fundamentally
  Ms. WATTLETON [continuing]. Is that it is an excellent example.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. Totally use the word we use here, I
disagree with that, I think that is a failure in logic, but I will not
pursue it, because I think it comes down to the credibility
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Could I
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. Not to whether or not one could say
that.
                                      573

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Could I just say one little thought here about

  The CHAIRMAN. Sure, you can.
  Ms. MICHELMAN [continuing]. And then I am going to be quiet. I
think the
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU don't have to be quiet.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. The key issue here is how he used it. He used it
in the context of urging conservatives to use natural law, and he
chose a very specific
  The CHAIRMAN. I don't disagree with that.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Senator, could I ask you a question?
  The CHAIRMAN. Sure, you can.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. If Lehrman had written an article, and as I sug-
gested earlier, criticizing another fundamental right like the right
to free speech, using natural law, and he had said the same thing,
trying to use the example of natural law to make an argument to
win conservatives
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, he did.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. NO, but what I am saying is if it were an-
other
  The CHAIRMAN. It didn't help any.
  Ms. MICHELMAN [continuing]. If it were another fundamental
right, would you dismiss it so easily.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, no, no. Look, I just want to make sure we
are precise here.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Okay, maybe you're not dismissing it, but
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are the most informed panel we have had
testify.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. I'm not sure about that.

   The CHAIRMAN. I am.

  Ms. MICHELMAN. I think you have had some wonderful
  The CHAIRMAN. That it, in fact, has been on this specific issue,
and I think we are slipping from precision. That is the only point I
am making. That is the only point I am making. I am not dismiss-
ing it lightly. I would not have spent so much time questioning him
on it. I would not have spent so much time going back through the
record. I don't dismiss it lightly at all, not at all.
  Ms. WEDDINGTON. Senator, what bothered me was when he said,
you know, I didn't mean to endorse everything he said, I was just
trying to win a point with my audience. It seems to me that he was
essentially saying I'm willing to mislead people sometimes or kind
of try to nudge them in one direction in a way that isn't really ac-
curate, if it gets me what I want.
  So, Senator Heflin, I know you have the article in front of you,
what bothers me is that Lehrman comment that says human life
endowed by the creator commences in the second or third trimes-
ter, not at the very beginning of the child in the womb, saying that
is what we adopt. Or on page 2 of his article, where he ques-
tions
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are talking about Lehrman's article.
  Ms. WEDDINGTON. Yes, the Lehrman article--that the right of
the sovereign, even if voted by the people to take some other posi-
tion.
                                              574

   Now, I think your comment, saying what would happen, I do
think there will be some States where abortion will remain legal. I
think in those States women will have access. But I have difficulty
thinking of our country as a place where women, if they live in
Louisiana, have much lesser rights than some place else.

  I appreciated Senator Brown having read my written comments
so carefully, because there were some things in there I wasn't able
to say in oral testimony, and what I was trying to point out was
the abortion issue was not for abortion. It was an issue that was so
integral, it was so inherent in all of the other things we were
trying to achieve amidst a background of discrimination, that it
was important.

  Senator Specter, I do understand his concern about what we
think Souter's position will ultimately be. I don't know what he is
going to do on the ultimate Roe v. Wade issue. What bothered me
was that when he was in the Rust hearing, he asked the Govern-
ment's attorney, "do you mean if a woman has a medical condition
that makes continuing a pregnancy unwise, the doctor can't tell
her?" and the Government said, "Yes, that's what it means, he
can't tell her."

  We thought from reading his expression that he understood how
terrible that would be, and so we were shocked when the decision
was as it was.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU know, as a lawyer, and everyone else should
know, it is still left open, if Roe is overruled, that States like Lou-
isiana may very well pass a law that not only affects--they have
passed a law--that not only affects poor women, but the wealthiest
of women, because it may very well say, we in the State of Louisi-
ana conclude that anyone domiciled in the State of Louisiana
cannot have an abortion anywhere in the world, without breaking
the law

  Ms. WEDDINGTON. That is right.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. Which I think would be a horrible
step. At any rate, let me yield to my friend from Wisconsin, and I
am going to yield him the Chair, as well, so after he questions,
maybe he could come up here and take the Chair.
  Senator KOHL [presiding]. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like to be certain that I understand where you are on
this issue in a fairly conclusive manner. Are you all saying that,
with respect to this person or somebody coming after this person, if
they do not have a clear expressed position on choice which is posi-
tive, that person should not be on the Supreme Court; and that it
should be the responsibility of this committee to clearly, without
ambiguity, ascertain that position and vote--among other things,
but vote particularly on that issue?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. We are saying that, Senator.
  Senator KOHL. Anybody disagreeing on that?
  Ms. MICHELMAN. NO, because that
  Senator KOHL. SO you don't--I respect your position--but you
don't take any inconclusiveness as satisfactory?
  Ms. WATTLETON. That is correct.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. That is correct.
  Senator KOHL. SO you are saying that trying to figure out what
he did or didn't say when he endorsed Lehrman is almost beside
                                             575

the point? You want to know particularly and clearly that the
person believes in a woman's right to choice? Otherwise, in today's
United States of America, that person does not belong on the Su-
preme Court?

  Ms. WATTLETON. That is correct.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. That is correct. It is whether he believes or ac-
knowledges, recognizes that there is a fundamental right to choose
and that that right is equal in its nature to other fundamental
rights, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, other funda-
mental rights.
  We don't think that you would confirm someone who might sug-
gest there is not a fundamental right to free speech. This is that
kind of right, Senator, and we think the area of law--Roe v. Wade
is 18 years old now. We think it is as settled an area of law as
Brown v. Board of Education. And I think Faye and I, last year
when we sat here before you with Justice Souter's nomination, said
that we believed very strongly that if you had any question that
Justice Souter would have any difficulty with the Brown v. Board
of Education ruling, you would be very concerned about confirming
him. We believe that this right is as fundamental and as settled as
that case was.
  The risk to women's lives is so enormous. It is so enormous. If
you take this right away, you take away the very foundation of
women's lives and their families' lives. There is nothing left. Every-
thing crumbles around it. It is so fundamental.
  And, yes, we think it is absolutely appropriate and fair for him
to be judged on this issue, and he has singled out--and Faye again
said it very eloquently. He has singled out this one area of law to
refuse to talk about. He has talked about other areas of law that
are controversial, are before the Court. He has singled out this one.
You have to ask why. Is it because if he did speak about it he
would not be confirmed?
  I mean, he can't--it is no longer acceptable. The Court has
moved. The President has really made these nominations based on
his commitment to overturn Roe, and the last four nominees have
shown us that they, indeed, are voting with the others to take
away this right.
  We have no chance anymore. This may be the last opportunity
we have to protect Roe v. Wade, that you have, the last opportunity
you have in your co-equal role with the President in preserving
fundamental rights.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I guess I would ask the committee to consider
what it would do if a candidate sitting before it held that almost
every question that you put to him or her could be found to be con-
stitutional or divisive or in other ways politically laden and decline
to give you his or her views on those subjects across the board. It
would make a mockery of the whole process of advice and consent.
And that is why we do not find it as excusable that he chose this
and this question alone, singularly, to decline to comment, but to
extend it throughout the process and ask ourselves what would
that make of the very process of governance that is set forth by the
Framers with respect to the selection and the seeding of the other
branch of government at the highest levels people who are selected
for the rest of their lives.
                                                576

  Ms. KUNIN. Let me just add, Senator, it is not only the desire to
know his views on this question, but the explicit effort he has made
to not state his views, that leaves us with a real--we are the only--
this is the only question on which you have to live on hope or that
you have to have a "maybe yes, maybe no, but most likely no"
answer. And I think the fact that this is acceptable or apparently
acceptable thus far just seems unfair when, as the other panelists
have so eloquently stated, this is as fundamental as other rights.

  And it is so easy to take this issue and say, well, you are just
interested in a single issue and we shouldn't base this confirmation
process on a single issue. And I can understand that. But by calling
it a single issue, it diminishes it, and it takes away from its true
fundamental worth.

  So that is an easy trap, I think, to fall into because we are talk-
ing about self-respect here. We are talking about equality under
the law. We are really talking about very fundamental principles
that are encapsulated in Roe v. Wade.

  Ms. WEDDINGTON. Senator, just very briefly. I know what we
would prefer is not what all the committee members would come
out in the same place. But there is a sense in which I think your
own constituents hold you accountable for what you know when
you cast that vote.

  On Souter, I think people could have said he had no record, I
looked at the record, I voted based on that, it was a reasonable
guess. On Thomas, I think if women--and I don't think it is a con-
servative or liberal issue. Former Senator Barry Goldwater has
said the true conservative position is it is not the Government's
business. And no one ever accused him of being liberal. There are
certainly a lot of Republican Senators, Republican women, the
Young Republicans nationally who have said, "We differ with our
official party on that position." It is not a liberal-conservative, it is
not a Democratic-Republican issue. But I think it is an issue that
strikes at the heart of who has the right to make certain decisions
and that women who feel in jeopardy feel particularly strong
about.

  And so if they come to you and say you voted for this man and
look what he did, what are you going to say back to them?

  Ms. MICHELMAN. And his record is more than the Lehrman arti-
cle that we have been focusing on here, Senator. I know you know
that. There is much more to his record. As a public person--and I
think Faye and Madeleine, the Governor, would agree--if I were to
sign on to a report that I hadn't read, I am not sure how--I would
have to be held accountable for that. I just wouldn't.

  He has to be held accountable, and his testimony has not been
credible in his answers in response to his extensive record. And I
said earlier, I think before you came in, he has had many years to
comment on many things. And every time he has commented on
the right to privacy or the right to choose, it has been derogatory.
It has been an assault on the right. It has been hostile to the right.
He has never once said anything good.

  He has come to the committee now, and he has tried to distance
himself somewhat from his record. But I don't think he has done
that credibly.

  Senator KOHL. DO you want to say something else on this issue?
                                      577

   Ms. WATTLETON. NO.

  Senator KOHL. I would like to ask you about the constitution of
the committee and the constitution of our Senate. As you know,
the committee is all male, and the Senate is 98-2 male. What
would be the result of this deliberation if this committee were 14
women instead of 14 men?

  Ms. MICHELMAN. I think obviously we would love to see more
women in elective office, and I think women bring a particular sen-
sitivity to and understanding about the issues. But men do also un-
derstand how important this issue is, and many of you sitting here
before us have been important supporters in preventing the erosion
of the right. And we expect you to continue in that mold. We would
love to see half women on this panel.

  Ms. KUNIN. I would like to see seven and seven.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Right.
  Ms. WATTLETON. I think if this panel represented the American
people in its diversity, not only among women but also among
ethnic groups and African-Americans, we might have a very differ-
ent conversation with respect to certain insights and understand-
ings about the nexus of a constitutional law with everyday lives of
Americans of all persuasions, including gender.
  Ms. KUNIN. Let me just say also, Senator, that not all women ob-
viously agree on this issue.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. Right. That is right.
  Ms. KUNIN. Not all men agree on this issue. I think the particu-
lar perspective that women bring is one that Kate Michelman de-
scribed earlier; that there is still nothing like personal experience.
And so I guess my hope would be that someday, regardless of this
issue but on all issues, that we can look forward to a U.S. Congress
that is truly representative in terms of both minorities and gender
of the people of this country. But in the meanwhile, I certainly
commend you for your efforts to be sensitive to these concerns.
  Ms. WEDDINGTON. When the President said he had nominated
"the best man" he could find for the job, I think that is somewhat
questionable. But I thought to myself, he certainly didn't take the
best person he could, and I hope he will widen his scope of consid-
eration if there is another vacancy.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  We have 44 witnesses today and bring a light lunch tonight.
[Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. I thank you. I don't even believe I will take the
full time. But I think you know--you who work so hard for the
cause of choice--that I agree with you on that issue and have all of
my public life. And I vote rather faithfully on your side on most of
those issues that arise in this area. Always have, and it has never
been formed since I got here and wasn't formed because of political
campaigns. It was formed from life.
  But it has been interesting. We went back and did some research
on all of us on this committee who have asked Court appointees of
a different administration questions. And every single one of us
has just stepped into the dark and said, Do you mean to tell me
you won't answer this question on what you would do? Go look at
what Eastland said and Ervin when they were trying desperately
                                      578

to pry out of Thurgood Marshall what he was going to do with the
Miranda decision, which they didn't like one whit, and Thurgood
Marshall was just exactly the same in his response as Clarence
Thomas. He said, "It is not appropriate for me to address that
issue. It would undermine my ability to decide it."

  I think if we can just get through that part of this and just know
that that is the way it is. And no matter how important the issue, I
just do not believe an issue as broad in scope as a Supreme Court
nominee position, where a man or woman would deal with thou-
sands of issues in their lifetime on the Court, should have this test
on a single issue, no matter how important that issue is.

  I guess, in short, despite the fact that I am certainly pro-choice,
Judge Thomas has told me personally that he is undecided on that
issue, and I am ready to believe him. Nothing has come before us
to show us he is a liar or that he doesn't have integrity and credi-
bility. And I believe his many other qualifications make him
worthy of the confirmation.

  I do not doubt one whit the sincerity or the intensity of your con-
cern about the issue of abortion. As a practicing lawyer for 18
years, I attempted to assist women who were involved in that terri-
ble personal decision. And I think I can understand how tragic a
choice it is, to the extent that any man can. But he told us he was
undecided. He explained to us he was not endorsing Lew Lehr-
man's contention that natural law would prohibit abortion. I think
our chairman described that rather thoroughly. Certainly the
nominee did. I believe we should trust him on that question. He is
clearly undecided.

  But let me direct a question to Ms. Michelman and Ms. Wattle-
ton. Why did you not express, you know--there was recently a
leadership election in the House of Representatives, Representative
Dave Bonior, a very able man, and Steny Hoyer, an equally able
man, and here came the issue of abortion. Every time. And it will
never go away. It doesn't matter who you put on the Court. This
issue will be there for the end of time in its various nuances, but
no one is going to allow it to occur where we go to the back alley
abortions. That is not what sensible legislators are going to do.

  But anyway, David Bonior was elected majority whip, and he
was also very much pro-life. Now, that's a position that has a lot to
do with your position, and I noticed you said nothing. Was there
any reason for that?

  Ms. MICHELMAN. Well, Senator, first of all, I did say something.
  Senator SIMPSON. Oh, I see. I'm sorry.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. I did. I expressed very serious concern about a
leadership position being assumed by someone--a key leadership
position--assumed by someone who has an anti-choice record and
what that would do to moving legislation that would protect our
right to choose.
  But also, Senator, I was very sensitive to the fact that leadership
elections within a congressional--in Congress--is a process inside
the Congress, and I am very sensitive to that, and I don't think we
should, short of making our views known--and I did make my
views known, and they were publicly known--and talked to some
Members, I think there is a respect for the right of Members of
Congress to elect one of their one, and you know, there is only so
                                      579

far one should go but there was no question about my view and the
importance of that leadership role in the advancement of legisla-
tion that would protect our rights. And I made that view known,
but I did it, I thought, within the parameters that I felt were re-
spectful of the process.

  I would like to comment, Senator, on one thing that you said
about "I have been very pro-choice", and you have been. You have
been there for us in the past, and recently, and we appreciate that
very much. But Senator, everything that you have voted for over
the past years is going to be undone and will be undone, and you
can't make light of it when you continually confirm nominees to
the court who are selected on the basis of their hostility to Roe and
those nominees get onto this Court and move deliberately to over-
turn this right. And every one of the nominees at the last five con-
firmation hearings have shown that that selection was indeed
based on the hostility to Roe because they have voted to restrict
and to limit the right.

  So that if you confirm Judge Thomas, then while this right is
hanging by a thread, all the work you have done in voting to
uphold the right in Congress is a moot point. I mean, he has a
record, and your vote is very critical here. You can't dismiss the
Supreme Court from what Congress does, and he is going to move
to overturn this right, and-

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, you see, here is the problem-
  Ms. MICHELMAN [continuing]. And we disagree on that. I realize
that you think he has an open mind, and Senator, I submit to you
that I don't think he has credibly established that he has an open
mind. He has a record. You might have been able to say that more
firmly about Justice Souter because he didn't have the record, al-
though Faye and I did
  Ms. WATTLETON. Mr. Simpson, in response to your question to
me
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes.
  Ms. WATTLETON [continuing]. We also spoke to the leadership
about our strong concern and opposition to the appointment of a
Member of Congress to a leadership position in the House that was
so staunchly anti-choice, but again we respected the prerogatives of
the House with respect to our role in that process.
  I would only comment on your characterizing our concerns
around it being a single issue, this single issue. Well, for us it is
more than this single issue. We see this as a fundamental issue to
our integrity, and that is why it carries with it a much larger di-
mension than a single issue. We can't say that no reasonable legis-
lator or respectable legislator is going to legislate women to the
back alley. Louisiana has already done it.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. That's right.
  Ms. WATTLETON. And we have examples waiting in the wings to
be implemented. We have the evidence before us. We are not pre-
pared to go on a leap of faith with someone who is undecided about
my right as a woman to control my body and my life. That should
be decided, and a candidate who is undecided is insufficient to sit
at the highest Court of the land.
  Senator SIMPSON. Let me say that I do hear that, but I certainly
would disagree with the statement that these people were placed
                                      580

on the Court because of a hostility to Roe, and that was your exact
quote, and that is just not so. No President is just sitting there to
pick a person for a lifetime appointment based on one thing that is
going to come before the Court. That's a disservice to any President
of any party, of both parties. And I personally think that the
House Democrats made the same decision that a lot of us will
make here--a good person who is qualified for high Government
position should not be rejected simply because his or her views on
one topic are not in line with one's own.

  I guess the real thing is--do you really want to know what
makes it all flop around and not work with this issue? It is because
of the high drama on both sides. When will somebody cut the high
drama that this is the end of the Earth if this happens one way? I
get called "murderer" in town meetings. How perpetually absurd.
And then you talk in high drama and almost obsessive conduct of
the word "murder". These things do a disservice to the debate. And
that is why politicians don't grapple with it very well at all, and
Governor Kunin, you are a politician. I know what you do. I know
of you. I admire your perseverance. You are the politician on this
panel--the only one. And boy, there is a lot of difference between
advocacy groups and politicians, I can tell you that. But a Septem-
ber poll, just a week ago, showed us that 85 percent of 1,233 people
polled thought abortion should not be a deciding factor in Judge
Thomas' nomination--85 percent. Now, we happen to fall prey to
those things; polls mean a lot to those of us in this line of work.
Another 61 percent felt that Judge Thomas was right not to
answer questions on abortion.

  I would ask the Governor, the politician, why the American
public appears to feel that way about Judge Thomas and the abor-
tion issue itself.

  Ms. KUNIN. Well, Senator, let me just, before I answer your ques-
tion, comment on the question of high drama. I think those of us
who have been entrusted with making public policy know that we
have to create a rational process and a fair process and that that
removes it from some of the drama of life. But I think we cannot
for a moment forget that the consequences of our decisions in the
public arena are very dramatic and very personal for the people af-
fected--and I am sure you appreciate that yourself in your own
views.

  But I do not think that this drama has been exaggerated. I think
that it is an honest expression of deep apprehension. And I think
that women as a group often feel that you can deal with every
other issue and give it its full weight, but when it comes to these
issues of personal choice over reproductive rights, they are put in a
different category. That is why I think you see the debate intensify-
ing on this issue. And the idea that this is only one issue out of
many--I agree with you if it were simply a small question, we
should not say this is the only thing, and this will determine
whether or not you merit our confirmation. But this is a very, very
sweeping issue that really addresses women's respect and equality
in society as a whole. Whether a woman is treated as a rational,
moral person who can make her individual choice, or whether the
State has to be the parent and say, "No. We make your choice for
                                      581
us." On very few issues does the State intervene in an agonizing
decision quite in this way.

  Why the American public responded in that poll, as you know, it
depends how the question is asked. Senator Biden earlier quoted
another poll from the Philadelphia Inquirer which indicated, one,
which is good news for the Senate, that the country feels by 55 per-
cent that the Senate should have more say than the President over
this question, and that issues in fact are important. Now, maybe it
was the wording that was different in these polls, but I also think
there is a resignation in the American public, and there is a grow-
ing cynicism that believes that the process is so orchestrated that
their individual voices are not going to count and that both sides
are so armed and so skilled in maneuvering this thing that it is
already a done deal, and I think some of that is reflected in that
answer.

  Senator SIMPSON. I think so, and I thank you very much.
  Ms. WATTLETON. Senator Simpson, I'd just like to comment on
the high drama
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes.
  Ms. WATTLETON [continuing]. Because from a personal point of
view, when I can forget the high drama of women dying whom I
tried to help save and to live, then perhaps I will feel less passion-
ate about this issue. I think that you have had among the most ra-
tional discussions and commentary on this issue that have taken
place in this country in a long time here this morning, but it is the
Court of the land that this committee has selected over the last few
years that has opened the political debate of this issue to new
heights; the Court that stepped back from Roe and Webster that
has now highly politicized this issue.
  Would I prefer to be here talking to you about this today? I'd
rather talk to you about how we can get birth control and contra-
ception better organized in this country; how we can get new meth-
ods so that women don't have to face unwanted pregnancy--I think
that is a more rational discussion--and to leave the moral, ethical
and individual situations to American women to try to orchestrate.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think that is an extraordinary state-
ment when you leave off those on the other side who talk about the
murder of a baby. So there you are. Now, come on, let's be reasona-
ble.
  Ms. WATTLETON. Mr. Simpson, I'd very much like to preserve
their right not to have an abortion, and the very system that they
are fighting against is the system that will destroy their right to
practice their religious views as they see fit. And that is the
common ground here; we have basic, fundamental disagreements.
We are decent, reasonable, American people, and we must be al-
lowed to continue to live in a society in which we can exercise our
personal and private morality as we see necessary in our lives.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, everybody gets that right. That's the cu-
rious part of it.
  Ms. WATTLETON. We want to keep it up.
  Ms. MICHELMAN. But we want to keep it, Senator
  Senator SIMPSON. SO do they.
  Ms. MICHELMAN [continuing]. And I am afraid that this nominee
will be the nail in the coffin for this fundamental right.
                                          582

   Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think that's overly dramatic and
untrue, based on his testimony.

   So I have no further questions.
   Senator KOHL. Thank you, and thank you very much. We appre-
ciate your being here this morning.
   Senator KOHL. Our next panel is composed of Gail Norton, who is
the attorney general of Colorado; Larry Thompson of Atlanta's
King and Spaulding; Judge John Kern, representing the Judiciary
Leadership Development Council; Barbara K. Bracher of Wilmer,
Cutler & Pickering, and Sadako Holmes, of the National Black
Nurses Association.
   We'd like to have each of you come up here and take a seat at
the table. Senator Brown would like to introduce our first panelist
this morning.
   Senator Brown.
   Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I am particularly pleased that Colorado's attorney general has
been able to come and testify before us today. Gail Norton is the
first woman attorney general in Colorado's 115-year history. She
has a distinguished legal background--both her bachelor's and
juris doctorate degrees are from the University of Denver. She has
extensive years of practice. She was a national fellow for Stanford
University's Hoover Institute and in addition has a distinguished
career here in Washington in previous years as Assistant to the
Deputy Secretary of Agriculture and then later on as Associate So-
licitor of the Interior.
   She is well-known in Colorado as a person of great integrity and
exceptional brilliance, and I particularly appreciate her coming
back to share with us her thoughts today.
   Senator KOHL. Thank you very much.
  Ms. Norton.

STATEMENTS OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF HON. GAIL NORTON,
  ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF COLORADO; LARRY THOMP-
  SON, KING & SPAULDING, ATLANTA, GA; HON. JOHN W. KERN,
  III, JUDICIARY LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL; BAR-
  BARA K. BRACHER, WILMER-CUTLER & PICKERING; AND
  SADAKO HOLMES, NATIONAL BLACK NURSES ASSOCIATION

   Ms. NORTON. Thank you.
   Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, and Senator
Brown, it is an honor to be here today and personally urge you to
confirm Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the
United States.
   State attorneys general like myself have a vital interest in who
sits upon the U.S. Supreme Court because we are involved in
almost one-third of the cases that are handled in front of that
Court. We litigate issues as diverse as taxation, antitrust, super-
fund hazardous waste cleanups, and business regulation.
   Furthermore, my office is responsible for most of the criminal
appeals handled in the State of Colorado, and it is from that per-
spective that I wish to comment on today's nomination.
   Perhaps this is somewhat surprising, but as a prosecutor, I do
not desire a pro-prosecution judge. I would like to see a fair one. I
                                         583

do not advocate unfettered freedom to use coerced confessions, arbi-
trary and intrusive searches, or draconian punishments. That is, I
value justice--not simply securing convictions.

  As Attorney General, I am very concerned that we achieve an
adequate balance between the rights of the accused and society's
interest in effective law enforcement. This balance is critical in a
society facing devastating issues of law and order, a drug war, a
murder rate of epidemic proportion, and an alarming decline of the
respect for property and persons.

  The promise of Judge Thomas is that he brings a realistic and
balanced perspective on law enforcement. He has expressed his
deep concern about crime. Today, we face a world where crime is a
constant concern. In an average lifetime, 72 percent of us will see
our homes burglarized, and 83 percent of us will suffer a violent
crime of either assault, rape or robbery. Crime's most tragic and
enduring legacy is the pain, suffering and mental scars of its vic-
tims.

  The Supreme Court has recently shown a willingness to reconsid-
er the broad sweep of some of its previous holdings. While critics
have attacked this trend in apocalyptic terms, it is often simply a
return to common sense criminal jurisprudence.

  While Judge Thomas has not extensively explained his approach
to criminal law jurisprudence, nor certainly should we expect him
to reach his conclusions before he becomes a member of the Court.
The possibility that he would join with the new Court majority
should not be viewed with alarm.

  Judge Thomas began his distinguished career as a criminal pros-
ecutor, arguing cases for the Missouri Attorney General's Office.
One concern that has been raised about Judge Thomas is his rela-
tively short time on the Federal bench. But of the 105 people who
have served on the U.S. Supreme Court, 40 had no prior judicial
experience whatsoever. That included John Marshall, Earl Warren,
Felix Frankfurter, William O. Douglas, and Byron White. If that
list is any indication, Judge Thomas is in superb company.

  Judge Thomas' appellate decisions are strikingly careful, thor-
ough and evenhanded. He has adhered to the proper role of a
judge, enforcing the requirements of the Constitution and statutes,
rather than his own views. All seven of the criminal decisions au-
thored by Judge Thomas dealt with drug offenses. Two of those
cases provide an interesting contrast and illustrate the care with
which Judge Thomas reviews the decisions and evaluates evidence.

   In United States v. Harrison, police arrested three men in a van
with a substantial quantity of drugs. Two of the men carried guns.
The third, defendant Butler, was seated next to some ammunition
and wore a bullet-proof vest. All three were convicted of the drug
offense and of using or carrying a firearm in committing a drug
trafficking crime. Butler challenged his firearm conviction, saying
he was not carrying a gun. A unanimous panel of the Appeals
Court joined Judge Thomas in ruling that Butler constructively
used the firearms of his companions.

   In United States v. Long, Judge Thomas faced a similar situation.
The defendant was apprehended in an apartment that "brimmed
with evidence" of drug activity. In that apartment was a firearm
unloaded in the seat of the sofa. In that case, Judge Thomas re-
                                      584
fused to infer that the defendant had constructively or actually
used the revolver. This illustrates the way in which he carefully
evaluates the difference between the circumstances that he is faced
with. He faces cases with unbiased integrity.

  I strongly believe he would be fair to both prosecutor and defend-
ant alike. Therefore, I urge this committee to vote favorably on the
nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas.

  Thank you.

                     TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                                              September 1991

         It is an honor to appear before this committee and urge you to
confirm Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. State
Attorneys General have a vital interest in who sits upon the
Supreme Court because we are involved in almost a third of all
cases that come before the Court. We litigate issues as diverse as
antitrust exemptions, Superfund hazardous waste cleanups, taxation,
water quality regulation, sovereign immunity, and interstate water
compacts. My office is responsible for most of the criminal
appeals in Colorado, and it is from that perspective that I wisji to
comment on the nomination.

        As a prosecutor, I do not seek a pro-prosecution justice, but
a fair one. I do not advocate unfettered prosecutorial freedom to
use coerced confessions, arbitrary and intrusive searches, or
draconian punishments. I do welcome a return to a judicial
environment that fosters effective law enforcement, dispenses
appropriate punishment, and listens to the innocent victims of
crime. That is, I value justice, not simply securing convictions.
The promise of Judge Thomas is that he brings a realistic and
balanced perspective on law enforcement issues.

         Judge Thomas expressed his deep concern about the effect of
crime on inner cities in a moving statement:

         The first priority is to control the crime. The sections
         where the poorest people live aren't really livable. If
         people can't go to school, or rear their families, or go
         to church without being mugged, how much progress can you
         expect in a community? Would you do business in a
         community that looks like an armed camp, where the only
         people who inhabit the streets after dark are the
                                    586

         criminals?1

Yet Judge Thomas also demonstrates a respect for the rights of the
criminally accused, as I will discuss below.

                 TRENDS IN SUPREME COURT CRIMINAL LAW DECISIONS

         As Attorney General, I am very concerned that we achieve an
adequate balance between the rights of the accused and society's
interest in effective law enforcement. Crime has been and* will
continue to be a central issue for the Supreme Court, and it is a
major concern of the public. Very recently the Court has shown a
willingness to narrow or reconsider the broad sweep of some
previous holdings. While some critics have attacked this trend in
apocalyptic terms, it is simply an incremental return to common-
sense criminal jurisprudence. This balance is critical in a
society facing devastating issues of law and order -- a drug war,
murder rates of epidemic proportion, and an alarming decline of the
moral spirit of respect for persons and property.

         The judicial activism of the 1960s and early 1970s Supreme
Court created an imbalance that too often benefited criminals. The
rulings of the Court in recent years have begun to rectify this
imbalance. This can be seen, for example, in areas of the law
relating the application of the exclusionary rule, the availability
of federal habeas corpus review of state convictions, and the
admissibility of victim impact evidence. Court rulings that
increase the certainty of punishment, when consistent with
constitutional principles, will help the law enforcement community
fight crime.

A. Crime Victims

         Until very recently, the Supreme Court demonstrated a strong
concern for the rights of criminals, while dismissing victims as
peripheral to the process. Recently, however, the Court has been
reawakened to the notion that the victim is an essential part of
the process. For true justice to be dispensed, the victim's
suffering and loss must be fully considered in sentencing.

        Government spending for law enforcement or corrections is not
the most important cost of crime. Crime's most tragic and enduring
legacy is the pain, suffering and mental scars borne by its
victims. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in an
average lifetime, 72% of us will see our homes burglarized, and 83%

         'C. Thomas, Black America Under the Reagan Administration: A
Symposium of Black Conservatives, Heritage Foundation Policy Review
37 (Fall 1985).
                                 587

of us will suffer a violent crime of either assault, rape, or
robbery.2

         It is against this tragic background that I voice my supiort
for the Supreme Court's recent trend toward including victims in
the criminal justice equation. The most notable example of this in
the Court's last term was Payne v. Tennessee.3 In 1987, the
Supreme Court decided in a highly controversial 5-4 decision that
most types of victim impact evidence could not be presented to the
jury in the sentencing phase of a capital case.* Two years later,
the Court reaffirmed that position in yet another highly
controversial 5-4 decision.5 Owing to the very strong dissents in
those cases, the Court once more decided to look at the issue and
this year overturned both prior decisions. The Court advised
sentencing courts that "just as the murderer should be considered
as an individual, so too the victim is an individual whose death
represents a unique loss to society and in particular to his
family."6 Justice demands that we listen to the victims. How else
can society balance the goals of deterrence and retribution that
are a part of criminal sentencing?

B. Exclusionary Rule

         In 1961 in Mapp v. Ohio,7 the Supreme Court overruled prior
precedent to conclude that evidence obtained by searches and
seizures in violation of the Fourth Amendment is inadmissible in
state court. The resulting exclusionary rule was premised upon the
need for a mechanism to control abuses in law enforcement
investigative activity.

         The rule gained considerable prominence not because of the
protection it afforded the average law-abiding citizen, but because
of the safe haven from punishment it gave many criminals. It often
freed the criminal because "the constable had blundered," and it
often prevented prosecutors from using evidence that was tainted
through even a technical violation of search and seizure
requirements. The rule thus came under severe attack for punishing

the public interest while effectively placing both the guilty
offender and the "blundering constable" beyond the reach of the
law.8

         In the mid-1970s, the Supreme Court began restricting the
application of the exclusionary rule.9 In United States v.
Leon,10 the Supreme Court weighed the competing goals of deterring
unreasonable invasions of privacy and "establishing procedures
under which criminal defendants are xacquitted or convicted on the
basis of all the evidence which exposes the truth.'"11 In pursuit
of a balance, the Court created the "good faith" exception tb the
exclusionary rule.

         The Court in Leon refused to suppress evidence obtained on the
basis of an officer's good faith and objectively reasonable
reliance on a warrant that was later found to lack probable cause
support. The exclusionary rule, the Court said, "cannot be
expected, and should not be applied, to deter objectively
reasonable law enforcement activity."12 This modification of the
exclusionary rule, the Court determined, would not jeopardize the
rule's ability to perform its intended functions.13

         The Court has continued this trend toward using the
exclusionary rule only where it serves the substantial purpose of
deterring official misconduct, while restricting its ability to
frustrate an objective search for truth.14

C. Habeas Corpus

        Another major area where the transition in criminal law has
been demonstrated is federal habeas corpus, which is invoked by
state prisoners who claim that "they are in custody in violation of
the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."15 It
often entails review by a single federal judge of rulings made by
several state trial and appellate court judges. State judges, like
federal judges, are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United
States. State authorities are naturally concerned aboutj the
finality of judgments in criminal cases and are somewhat sensitive
to being subjected to what they perceive to be the unwarranted
supervisory authority of federal courts. I hope, too, that
Congress will soon act to contribute statutorily to the necessary
balance of these issues.

         Again, it is important to understand recent developments in
this area of the law with an eye toward constitutional history.
Until World War II, habeas corpus relief was limited to
jurisdictional defects in state criminal proceedings. Federal
courts eventually expanded it to encompass all claims regarding the
constitutional rights of a prisoner." The Warren Court expanded
its reach by ruling that state prisoners could come to federal
court with claims that they had not raised in state court, unless
state authorities could show that the prisoners deliberately
bypassed state procedures.17

         In 1976, the Court began returning to its initial conclusions
about the significance of the states' interest in not having their
 judgments so easily disturbed by federal authorities. In the first
of the landmark rulings, the Court disallowed habeas review on
Fourth Amendment claims where the state prisoner had a full and
fair opportunity to litigate those claims in state court.18 The
following year, the Court barred federal review of claims that
prisoners had failed to raise at trial, unless the prisoner could
show both "cause" for the failure to timely raise the claim, and
actual, substantial "prejudice" resulting from the claimed error.19

         In 1986, the Court made it clear that, absent the
extraordinary case where it was probable that an innocent person
was convicted, a showing of actual prejudice arising from the

         1528 U.S.C.  2254.

         16See Walev v . Johnson. 316 U . S . 101 (1942).

         17Fav v . Noia. 372 U . S . 391 (1963).

         18Stone v . Powell. 428 U.S. 365 (1976).

                                   590

alleged error is not sufficient. To permit federal review,
defendants must make a showing of cause to excuse the procedural
default.20 Just this year, the Court required state prisoners to
meet the exacting "cause" and "prejudice" standards regardless of
the type or timing of the procedural default involved.21 Also this
year, the Court restricted the right of state prisoners to seek
habeas relief on grounds that they failed to assert in a prior
habeas petition. The Court barred consideration of these new
claims unless the prisoners were able to show sufficient cause for
the failure to raise them earlier, and actual and substantial
prejudice suffered as a result of the claimed error.22 ThisJrule
requires prisoners to raise their claims early, at an appropriate
point in the proceedings, rather than encouraging repetitious,
dilatory tactics of filing endless petitions based upon every
conceivable permutation of the record.

         The Court's recent decisions recognize that the states can be
entrusted with the great responsibility of protecting
constitutional rights. The Framers recognized this in creating a
system of government that made federalism a core value.

         In summary, it is appropriate for the Court to adopt
practical, common-sense approaches to law enforcement, such as
these examples. They are based on traditional constitutional
interpretation, and they provide defendants with adequate
constitutional safeguards. Thus, while Judge Thomas has not
extensively explained his approach to criminal law jurisprudence,
the possibility that he would join with the new Court majority
should not be viewed with alarm.

                          ANALYSIS OF JUDGE THOMAS' DECISIONS

         Judge Thomas began his distinguished legal career as a
criminal prosecutor, arguing criminal appeals for the Missouri
Attorney General's office. Judge Thomas' strong law enforcement
philosophy was also much in evidence during his tenure at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). Specifically, as
Chairman he implemented a fundamental shift of focus in enforcement
philosophy. The previous "rapid charge" approach emphasized
negotiated no-fault settlements, wherein the EEOC made no effort to
determine the merits of discrimination charges. Both frivolous and
meritorious claims received the same treatment. Judge Thomas
required the EEOC to investigate each discrimination charge and, if

necessary, to litigate.23 This shifted the focus from generating
statistics to credible, effective enforcement of the civil rights
laws.

        As a federal appellate judge, Clarence Thomas has demonstrated
objectivity, restraint, and an innate sense of fundamental
fairness. His relatively short time on the federal bench is not
especially consequential. It is a nominee's overall character and
experience, rather than tenure as a judge, that should be
determinative. Of the 105 people who have thus far served oil the
Supreme Court, 40 had no prior judicial experience whatsoever,
including John Marshall, Earl Warren, Charles Evans Hughes, Joseph
Story, Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, William 0. Douglas, and
Byron white. Nine other Justices had less than two years'
experience, including the senior Justice John Marshall Harlan, who
dissented in Plessy v. Ferguson,2* his namesake grandson who
concurred in Griswold v. Connecticut,23 and the great Justice Hugo
Black, who early in his career spent 18 months as a police court
judge. If the preceding list is any indication, Judge Thomas is in
superb company.

         Judge Thomas' appellate decisions are strikingly careful,
thorough, and even-handed. He has implicitly displayed an
understanding of the societal tension created by the need of people
to be secure against arbitrary intrusion by the government, on one
hand, and the need to be secure from the devastating impact crime
can have on their lives, on the other hand. Above all, he has
adhered to the proper role of a judge: enforcing the requirements
of the Constitution and statutes, rather than his own
predilections. His decisions tread neither into the province of
legislators on policy issues nor of district courts on evidentiary
issues.

         All seven of the criminal decisions authored by Judge Thomas
involved drug offenses.26 For example, last year Judge Thomas

         23As a result, the number of discrimination charges considered
for litigation authorization rose from 401 in fiscal year 1982 to
764 in 1988 and approximately 800 in 1989. The number of cases
granted such authorization likewise grew from 241 in fiscal year
1982 to 554 in 1988.

treatment) .

United States v. Whoie, 925 F.2d 1481 (D.C. Cir. 1991); United
States v. Shabazz, 933 F.2d 1929 (D.C. Cir. 1991); United States v.

faced a case27 involving narcotics dealers who conducted their
illegal trade out of several rooms in a hotel. He rejected the
argument that a warrantless search of one of the rooms was
unlawful. Judge Thomas held that, although "the police carefully
investigated the suspicious hotel guests for more than a week and
sought warrants for all the rooms that they could link to
[defendant]," the defendant "tried to frustrate the warrant process
by hopping from room to room."28 Following recent Supreme Court
precedent2*, he further ruled that evidence seen by the police
during an unlawful search was nonetheless admissible at ^trial
because it was subsequently acquired on the basis of an independent
source.

         In another case30, a unanimous panel upheld the conviction of
a defendant who said he merely gave a drug dealer a ride to the
scene of a drug transaction. Judge Thomas applied the appropriate
standards of appellate review and concluded that the jury
reasonably could have found that Poston was a lookout, not an
innocent chauffeur. Thus he could be found guilty of aiding and
abetting possession with intent to sell.

         Judge Thomas also correctly anticipated a recent Supreme Court
ruling31 by finding that sentences for certain drug offenses could
be calculated according to the gross weight of the pills containing
the illegal drug.32

         Two cases provide an interesting contrast and illustrate the
care with which Judge Thomas evaluates evidence and interprets
statutes. In United States v. Harrison,33 police arrested three
men in a van with a substantial quantity of drugs. Two of the men
carried guns. The third, defendant Butler, was seated next to some
ammunition and wore a bullet-proof vest. All three were convicted

of both a drug offense and using or carrying a firearm in
committing a drug trafficking crime. Butler challenged his firearm
conviction. A unanimous panel of the appeals court joined Judge
Thomas' ruling that Butler constructively possessed the firearms.34

         In United States v. Long," Judge Thomas confirmed his concern
for the rights of the defendant when he reversed a conviction under
the same firearms statute. The defendant had been arrested in a
co-defendant's apartment that "brimmed with evidence" of drug-
related activity. Police found a functional but unloaded revolver
between the cushions of a sofa. Judge Thomas ruled that the
government had provided no evidence from which to infer that the
defendant constructively or actually used the revolver:

         Upholding the conviction of a defendant in the absence of
         any indicia of possession would stretch the meaning of
         vuse' beyond the breaking point. . . . To affirm Long's
         conviction for xusing' the revolver in the sofa would be
         to concede that the word 'use' has no discernible
         boundaries. That prospect is particularly troubling
         where, as here, we are construing a criminal statute.36

Taken together, these two cases illustrate the unbiased integrity
with which Judge Thomas approaches criminal adjudication.

         As a further indication that Judge Thomas does not reflexively
rule for the government in criminal cases, I note that he joined an
opinion by Judge Silberman overturning a conviction for wire fraud
on the ground that the trial court had excluded admissible
exculpatory evidence.37 Judge Thomas also severely criticized
government attorneys for attempting to block the defendant from
raising an issue,38 and expressed his "dismay" at learning that the
government could not give the court certain information.39 Rather
than entirely dismiss an untimely appeal, he remanded it to the
district court to consider an extension of time.''0

         Judge Thomas' opinions reveal a highly analytical and
well-organized mind. They also confirm his commitment to judicial
restraint, as he tended to resolve issues on appropriately narrow
grounds, and continually confined his analysis to whether the
language of the rule or statute under consideration could be given
its normal and common-sense meaning. In my view, these qualities
will serve him and the public well as a member of the United States
Supreme Court. I would not expect him to reach out to consider
issues that were not adequately raised or presented to the Court;
nor would I expect him to resolve issues based on considerations
unrelated to the text and history of the applicable law. He would
not intrude upon those areas reserved to either the concomitant
branches of the federal government or state governments. I
strongly believe he would be fair to both prosecutor and defendant
alike.

         Judge Thomas' concern for the rights of the individual
strongly commends him as someone who is especially suited to serve
as a Justice of the Supreme Court. When we speak of judicial
"temperament," what we are really talking about is a person's
ability to decide cases objectively, according to the rule of law,
without regard for his or her own personal preconceptions or
preferences.

         Law, as we commonly understand the term, can have little
meaning if it is not based upon neutral, readily discernible
principles. If law is not based upon neutral principles, it ceases
to be law but rather becomes an invitation for legislation by the
judiciary. Therefore, the cornerstone of any assessment of
judicial temperament must be an evaluation of the nominee's
commitment to the rule of law. Not law as the judge would wish it
to be, or thinks it ought to be, but the law as expressed by those
who wrote the words and consistent with what they intended those
words to mean.

         As Judge Thomas has written, "the founders purposely insulated
the courts from popular pressures, on the assumption that they
should not make policy decisions. . . . [I]t was unthinkable that
courts would take the side of particular groups in the policymaking
arena."'- There is nothing in Judge Thomas' record that suggests
he would suddenly abandon his careful judicial approach in favor of
expediency. Rather, there is every indication that he will
consider each case before him on its own merits, and give
appropriate deference to precedent.

   Senator KOHL. Thank you, Ms. Norton.

   Mr. Thompson, I hope you will respect the 5-minute limitation.

                    STATEMENT OF LARRY THOMPSON

   Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee.

   I am pleased to appear before you today in support of the nomi-
nation of Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  I practiced law with Judge Thomas some 14 years ago in Mon-
santo Co., in St. Louis, MO. I knew Judge Thomas then as a bright
young lawyer who was highly respected by his peers and superiors
in a demanding corporate law environment. I know Judge Thomas
today as a legal scholar, with valuable hands-on experience in the
public policy arena. He now serves as a distinguished lecturer at
the Emory University Law School in Atlanta.

  Now, while Judge Thomas could have become quite comfortable
financially by entering the private practice of law or continuing in
a corporate law department, he chose not to do so. His entire
career since leaving St. Louis to work with Senator Danforth, your
colleague, has been dedicated to public service. As Chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, he led the agency in
removing a backlog of discrimination cases that served unfairly to
deny relief to individuals who suffered employment discrimination.

  Now, I have talked with several career EEOC professionals in At-
lanta and from other parts of the country. These individuals praise
and respect Judge Thomas for the job he did at the EEOC. They
will tell you that the EEOC is in much better shape now, because
of Judge Thomas, than it was when Judge Thomas took over.

  One such person in Atlanta told me this past weekend that if
Judge Thomas' critics do not want to change their views of him,
then they should avoid getting to know him, and I agree. While
some may disagree with Judge Thomas' views on several issues, I
do not believe that many who may differ with him on these issues,
but who have had an opportunity to know him will oppose his nom-
ination to the United States Supreme Court.

  Now, while Judge Thomas sharpened the focus of the EEOC in
protecting individual victims of employment discrimination, he did
not arbitrarily ignore larger class cases. In fact, the former General
Counsel of the EEOC has noted that Judge Thomas himself initiat-
ed a race discrimination class complaint against a large foreign-
based automobile manufacturer, which eventually led to a multi-
million-dollar settlement.

  As a black American, I am somewhat puzzled by the opposition
to Judge Thomas' nomination from some of the organizations dedi-
cated to the interest of black Americans. As a former U.S. Attor-
ney in Atlanta, I believe that Judge Thomas' values and views on a
number of subjects, including education, the need for self-esteem
and a strong work ethic and the influence of a stable family and
the church are not out of step with those of most black Americans
who are, in fact, hard-working and law-abiding people.

  Much of the good-faith and nonpartisan opposition to Judge
Thomas from some of these organizations appears to center on his
views on affirmative action. But Judge Thomas has stated that,
                                         597

with the exception of quotas, he supports many affirmative action
remedies, because these remedies are truly necessary and fair.

  Both Judge Thomas and I have seen the pernicious effects of
quotas. We both know many outstanding, highly trained and capa-
ble black American professionals and business people who are frus-
trated, because they are viewed only as members of a group who
got their positions through quotas, rather than because of their
qualifications as individuals. Their true achievements are being de-
valued and obscured.

  Like the leaders of the organizations who oppose him, Judge
Thomas understands that, unfortunately, many black Americans
still suffer race discrimination and other forms of basic unfairness,
but he differs with these leaders only as to how to attack the prob-
lems that face black Americans. But this difference, I submit,
should not affect this body's decision as to whether to confirm
Judge Thomas' nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Black Americans need not and should not all think alike, and
this diversity of opinion within the black community on how black
Americans should advance is deeply rooted in our history and has
served black Americans and this Nation well over the years.

  Any distinguished American lawyer, with solid public policy ex-
perience, especially one like Judge Thomas, with his background,
his intellect, his character, and his integrity, is needed not only on
the United States Supreme Court, but inside the Court in its delib-
erations on a variety of issues, and not just on affirmative action.

  For these reasons, I respectfully urge you to confirm the nomina-
tion of Judge Thomas to the United States Supreme Court.

  Thank you.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Thompson.
  Mr. Kern.

                     STATEMENT OF JOHN W. KERN III

  Mr. KERN. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here this morning
to testify on behalf of myself and not the Judiciary Leadership De-
velopment Council, which I serve as President. I am here to attest
to Judge Thomas' combination of open-mindedness and an inner
strength and a compassion which I have found in working with
him in connection with the continuing judicial education efforts of
the Judiciary Leadership Development Council.

  President Lyndon Johnson appointed me to the District of Co-
lumbia Court of Appeals in 1968. In 1984, I took senior status and
became the Dean of the National Judicial College, in Reno, NV,
and I know a number of Wisconsin judges who came to our college
in seeking continual judicial education. I came to have a great in-
terest in the concept of judges continuing to keep open minds and
express a willingness to learn new ideas and to pursue continuing
judicial education.

   I returned to Washington, DC, and I perform judicial services
part-time for my court, but I also direct the Judiciary Leadership
Development Council in providing continuing education of judges.

  Judge Thomas is one of a number of judges, judicial educators,
and State court administrators that are on our advisory committee.
I have had a number of conversations with him and I have been
                                         598

very impressed with his open-mindedness, his interest in maintain-
ing readings, discussions, involving himself in the life of the mind,
which I think is extremely important, based upon my experience
with judges in judicial education.

   I have also been struck by his combination of strength and deter-
mination that have caused him to rise above the serious obstacles
that he faced in his early life and with his sensitivity and his com-
passion. I have had a number of conversations of an informal
nature about life, about education of children, the kinds of things
that judges frequently talk about in the cafeteria across the street
from the courthouse over coffee and a roll, and I have found him
always to be a person of keen intellect, very good humored, very
approachable and very open-minded.

   In many ways, he reminds me of my own father, who was a State
trial judge in Indiana and then a Federal trial judge for almost 35
years. My father was stricken with polio very early in his life, and
I found that rising above that early disaffection that occurred to
him, he had unusual strength and determination, but he also had
unusual sensitivity and compassion. I see that in Judge Thomas
and I heartily recommend him for your approval.

  Thank you.
   Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Kern.
  Ms. Bracher.

                  STATEMENT OF BARBARA K. BRACHER

  Ms. BRACHER. I am honored to speak before the committee on
behalf of the confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas. The report I
submitted on Judge Thomas' criminal law and procedure opinions
to this committee last week includes a comprehensive review of
Judge Thomas' judicial opinions while serving on the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals. This report was distributed last week to members
of this committee, but I would like to request that it be submitted
to the record of these hearings.

  I want to highlight three major points from the report that I
hope will be helpful to this committee in assessing Judge Thomas'
judicial philosophy: first, Judge Thomas has demonstrated his
strict adherence to the rule of law; second, his observance of con-
trolling precedent and accepted principles of statutory construc-
tion; and, third, his faithfulness to prudential limitations on the
scope and standard of review of the Court.

   I have chosen these three principles because they are premised
on the first ideals from the Preamble of our Constitution: to estab-
lish justice and ensure domestic tranquility. Judge Thomas' opin-
ions reflect a true understanding of these words.

   It is in this context that Judge Thomas faithfully construed the
law to preserve the rights of individuals and the rights of society to
be safe in their own homes. Judge Thomas interpreted many stat-
utes in his opinions: the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, Rules of
Evidence, Rules of Appellate Procedure, Criminal Procedure,
among others.

   When construing statutes, Judge Thomas utilizes accepted princi-
ples of statutory construction as established by Supreme Court
precedent to first look to the actual text and the specific terms of
                                      599
the statute. He has refused to read statutes in a textually awkward
manner, interpreting the statutes to rely upon inferences and loose
transitive implications.

  Judge Thomas reviewed lower court and circuit court precedent
to identify prior standards and assure consistency in the criminal
laws. Judge Thomas observed the rule of the Court of Appeals in
its limited scope of review while mindful of the standard of review
imposed upon the particular appeal before the Court.

  Judge Thomas has refused to go beyond the issues presented to
the Court or to decide issues not brought before the Court of Ap-
peals.

  Judge Thomas has a scrupulous regard for the rights of the ac-
cused, mindful of the sufficiency of the evidence presented by the
Government. In overturning a firearms conviction in the case Long
v. U.S., Judge Thomas found that the Government had failed to
meet its burden to properly satisfy the elements of the alleged
crime.

  I want to conclude by saying that it is crucial to look at Judge
Thomas' writings since becoming a member of the judicial branch.
The review of what Judge Thomas has actually written as a
member of the judicial branch reveals that Judge Thomas is a
thoughtful jurist with a keen intellect. He interprets statutes as
Congress has written and follows controlling precedent, mindful of
the role of the Court in its review and the cases before it.

  Judge Thomas' criminal law opinions evidence his judicial re-
straint, his commitment to established rules of law, utilizing tradi-
tional tools of statutory construction and thoughtful attention to
decide only the issues required in a particular case. These writings
affirm that he will be an outstanding addition to the Supreme
Court, one who will judge according to the law rather than to his
own personal predilections.

  Judge Thomas' nomination should receive confirmation by the
Senate to serve on the Supreme Court.

      CITIZENS FOR LAW AND ORDER

   REPORT ON THE JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY OF
JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS WITH RESPECT TO

   CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE

                                  BY

                           BARBARA K. BRACHER

                       Judge Clarence Thomas's Criminal
                           Law and Procedure Opinions

              Citizens for Law and Order ("CLO") commissioned this study
of Judge Clarence Thomas's judicial philosophy as it relates to criminal
law and procedure. A careful review of the legal opinions authored by
Judge Thomas while a member of the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit reflects a thoughtful jurist with a
restrained judicial temperament and keen intellect. Judge Thomas has
demonstrated strict adherence to the rule of law, even where his personal
beliefs differ from a legal rule. His opinions and other writings
demonstrate a fundamental understanding of the community's interest in
deterring crime and meeting the needs of its victims. While Judge
Thomas's opinions reflect an understanding that ajudge is responsible for
protecting the rights of those accused of crime, he also understands that
a judge has a duty not to reshape the law according to his personal
predilections.

              Judge Thomas has participated in over 157 cases since joining
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. He has authored 17 majority opinions,
2 concurrences, and 2 dissents. Of those seventeen opinions, seven
                                                602

                                                  3

were appeals from drug convictions. The criminal law opinions of Judge
Thomas were reviewed with reference to his approach to controlling
precedent, adherence to jurisprudential limitations on the power of the
court, compliance with accepted principles of statutory construction,
observance of settled rules concerning the standard of review, and
faithfulness to prudential limitations on the scope of review and judicial
decision-making.

                    Underlying Judge Thomas's approach to his obligation to
decide criminal law cases is a common-sense approach to questions of
criminal law and procedure, one that recognizes the practical problems
faced by law enforcement officers combatting crime on the streets.
When asked what should be done to solve the problems faced by
America's inner cities, Judge Thomas remarked:

               The first priority is to control the crime. The sections where
               the poorest people live aren't really liveable. If people can't go
               to school, or rear their families, or go to church without being
                mugged, how much progress can you expect in a community?
               Would you do business in a community that looks like an
                armed camp, where the only people who inhabit the streets
               after dark are the criminals?

              None of the speeches or statements made by Judge Thomas,
however, explains how he will rule as a justice of the United States
Supreme Court as clearly as his actual majority opinions. To borrow the
words of L. Gordon Crovitz of the Wall Street Journal, "the best way to
predict how Justice Clarence Thomas would rule is to review how Judge
Clarence Thomas has ruled." Thus, a review of Judge Thomas's criminal
law decisions follows.

                              United States v. Shabazz
                               United States v. McNeil
                1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 10579 (May 28, 1991)

              In the district court, the two defendants pleaded guilty to drug
offenses involving dilaudid pills, the active ingredient of which is
hydromorphine, a controlled substance. On appeal, the two defendants
                                                604

                                                  5

alleged that the district court erred when it calculated their sentences
under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines according to the gross weight of
the dilaudid pills rather than the lesser net weight of the hydromorphine.

               Judge Thomas's opinion for a unanimous panel of the Court
of Appeals begins with an analysis of the applicable Sentencing
Guidelines. Judge Thomas found that the Sentencing Guidelines require
sentences to be calculated according to "the entire weight of any mixture
or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled
substance." Id at * 4 (citing to United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual  2D1.1(c)n.* (Nov. 1990). Relying on analogous
decisions from the other circuits, Judge Thomas found defendants' claim
that the pills were not a "mixture or substance" to be without support.

                In an alternative argument, the defendants urged that an
interpretive note to the Sentencing Guidelines supported the position that
sentencing should be based on the weight of the controlled substance
when the weight of the substance with which it was combined is
                                        605

                                         6

unknown. Judge Thomas explained that the "interpretive notes" served
to illustrate how the guidelines were to be applied but were not intended
to be a substitute for the clear text of the Guidelines. Judge Thomas
determined that, "by its terms," defendant's reading was "textually
awkward and produces absurd results" and that "nothing in the text ...
suggestls] that limitation." id. at * 1 0 .

               Judge Thomas rejected defendants' final claim that the method
of sentencing articulated in the Sentencing Guidelines conflicted with a
federal statute that requires sentencing based upon the gross weight of
certain specified drugs. That statute did not refer to hydromorphine.
Recognizing that the Sentencing Guidelines were promulgated "by the
United States Sentencing Commission pursuant to an express grant of
rulemaking authority," Judge Thomas held that the court may set aside
the Guidelines "only if it contravenes an 'unambiguously expressed intent
of Congress' or is unreasonable." Id. at *15 (citing to Chevron U.S.A.
Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council. 467 U.S. 837, 842-45
(1984)). Judge Thomas relied on recent authority from the D.C. Circuit
                                        606

in which the court had refused to accept "an argument that the negative
implication of one provision unambiguously restricted a grant of authority
that could otherwise be read into another provision." id- at * 18. Judge
Thomas concluded that the court was "aware of no 'traditional tools of
statutory construction/ that would compel [defendant's] proposed
reading." Id. at *19 (citations omitted).

              Two days after Judge Thomas issued the opinion in this case,
the United States Supreme Court decided Chapman v. United States. 111
S. Ct. 1919 (1991). In Chapman, the Supreme Court reached the same
conclusion based on the same rationale articulated by Judge Thomas in
Shabazz. The Supreme Court held that a statute requiring the imposition
of a mandatory minimum sentence for distribution of more than one gram
of "a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount" should be
determined by the weight of the mixture rather than the net weight of the
controlled substance. Id- at 1925.

                           931 F.2d 65 (D.C. Cir. 1991)

              Writing for a unanimous court, Judge Thomas affirmed the
convictions of three defendants for possession with intent to distribute
crack cocaine base and using or carrying a firearm during a drug
trafficking offense. The three men were searched and subsequently
arrested after police stopped a van in which they were traveling that
carried a temporary license tag identified by the police as stolen. Harrison
was carrying an unregistered handgun in a holster clipped to his belt and
$595 in cash. Black had 4.5 grams of cocaine base in his pants pocket
and was also carrying an unregistered handgun. Butler was wearing a
bullet-proof vest under his clothing. Other incriminating evidence found
in the van included: 42 grams of diluted cocaine base, a temporary license
tag with a different number than the one displayed on the outside of the
van, a weapons magazine that contained pictures of the guns carried by
defendants, and two fully loaded ammunition clips. Harrison sought to
call Black to the stand.

                                      9

            At trial, Black refused to testify, invoicing his Fifth Amendment

privilege against self-incrimination. Harrison and Butler each moved

unsuccessfully to sever their trials from Black's in order to obtain his

testimony.  Harrison appealed from the district court's refusal to

sever his trial from that of his co-defendants. Black claimed that the act

of calling him as a witness violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against

self incrimination and Butler challenged the sufficiency of the evidence

underlying his firearms conviction.

               Judge Thomas examined the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure governing severance of trials. The language of the rules allows
the district court judge to determine whether to sever trials based upon
a determination that a joinder of offenses or defendants would prejudice
the defendant or the government. Supreme Court as well as D.C. Circuit
Court precedent favors joinder of trials unless it is determined that the
defendant "did not get a fair trial." The D.C. Circuit set forth its general
standard in United States v. Ford. 870 F.2d 729, 731 (D.C. Cir. 1989),
requiring that the defendant seeking a severance show: (1) a bona fide
                                            609

                                            10

need for the testimony; (2) the substance of the testimony and its
exculpatory nature and effect; and (3) the likelihood that the defendant
will testify if the cases are severed. Failure to demonstrate any one of
these elements was fatal to severance. Jd.- at 732.

              After an extensive review of the trial record, Judge Thomas
concluded that Harrison had not identified Black's allegedly exculpatory
testimony with sufficient specificity to establish that the district court's
failure to sever deprived Harrison of a fair trial. In response to Harrison's
argument that the court should be guided by an analogous decisions from
three other circuits, Judge Thomas distinguished those decisions based
on controlling precedent of the D.C. Circuit.

              Judge Thomas rejected Black's claim that his Fifth Amendment
rights were violated when Harrison announced that he intended to call
Black as a witness, reasoning that any error that may have occurred was
not sufficiently prejudicial in light of the strong case against him to permit

claims not properly preserved below.

                Finally, Judge Thomas held that there was sufficient evidence
to permit a rational jury to find Butler guilty of the firearms offense on a
"constructive possession" theory. Judge Thomas cited D.C. Circuit
precedent for the proposition that a person is in "constructive possession"
of a firearm if it is "within easy reach and available to protect [the user]
during his ongoing [drug trafficking] offense." After a thorough review
of recent circuit decisions on constructive possession, Judge Thomas
determined that the jury reasonably could have inferred (by Butler's
presence in a van containing two guns, while wearing a bulletproof vest)
that Butler constructively possessed either or both of the guns.

                                   United States v. Whoie
                            925 F.2d 1481 (D.C. Cir. 1991)

               A jury convicted the defendant of distributing crack cocaine
and of using the telephone to facilitate his drug transactions. At trial, the
                                        611

                                        12

defendant claimed entrapment. The jury rejected that defense and
convicted him on all nine counts. On appeal, Whoie argued for the first
time that the district judge had erroneously instructed the jury on the
elements of the entrapment defense. Judge Thomas examined the
contention in light of the two elements of entrapment established by the
Supreme Court: the government must have induced a defendant to
commit a crime and it must be a crime that the defendant was not
otherwise willing to commit. Whoie claimed that the district judge
improperly allowed the jury to decide whether he had produced sufficient
evidence of government inducement. Judge Thomas concluded that there
was sufficient evidence of inducement to submit that issue to the jury.

              Whoie also contended that the trial court failed to amend the
model jury instructions to make explicit the government's burden to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was predisposed to commit the
crimes. Judge Thomas relied on established D.C. Circuit precedent
requiring that the court must "always consider the whole instruction - not
just the supposedly erroneous snippet.... In deciding whether jury
                                        612
                                        13

instructions are plainly erroneous, [the court will] consider as well the
lawyers' arguments and the evidence." As a result, Judge Thomas
concluded that the district judge's numerous explanations to the jury at
trial of the defendant's presumed innocence properly evidenced that the
government carried the burden of proof to show the defendant was
"ready and willing" to commit the crime. Thus, the district court judge's
use of the model jury instructions was not plain error.

                                 United States v. Halliman
                             923 F.2d 873 (D.C. Cir. 1991)

                Defendants were convicted of possession with the intent to
distribute cocaine and crack cocaine base. The trial court rejected
defendants motion to suppress evidence the police had obtained through
searches.

               After receiving a call from the manager of a hotel, the police
conducted an investigation of a group of guests suspected of dealing
                                       613

                                                 14

drugs. The police obtained search warrants to search the three rooms
where the guests were staying. As they were leaving the station with the
warrants, the police learned that one suspect had moved to another room.
Rather than delay their search, the police decided to execute their
warrants and attempt to interview the suspect in the newly rented room.
When they knocked on the door of the newly rented room, a person
inside asked them to wait "just a minute." The officers down the hall
began to execute their searches on the other three rooms. Upon hearing
a toilet flush inside the newly rented room and fearing that the person
inside was destroying the evidence, the police officers forcibly entered the
room. They found a bag of cocaine lying on the floor of the bathroom in
plain view. They also executed a search that uncovered more cocaine in
the room. The police subsequently obtained an emergency search
warrant for this room and found certain drug paraphernalia. During the
period of the initial search, the police executed a pat-down search of two
other defendants as they returned to their hotel rooms. They discovered
seventeen bags of crack cocaine and keys to the hotel rooms.

                                        15

              Judge Thomas, writing for a unanimous panel, affirmed the
district court's denial of defendants' motion to suppress the evidence
found during these searches. The court ruled that the warrantless search
was justified by "exigent circumstances" doctrine. Judge Thomas relied
on settled D.C. Circuit standards concerning exigent circumstances and
found sufficient evidence in the trial record to satisfy that standard.

              In Murray v. United States. 108 S. Ct. 2529 (1988), the
Supreme Court had held that "evidence which is initially discovered during
an illegal search, but is subsequently acquired through an independent
and lawful source" is admissible at trial. Judge Thomas concluded that
the emergency search warrant satisfied the requirement of an
"independent source" and upheld the admission of the evidence.

              The court also found that the police had probable cause to
search the two men entering the hotel. The men had been under
observation for over a week and when they entered the hotel and went
to the rooms where the drugs were stored, the "totality of the
                                           615
                                            16

circumstances" provided probable cause to arrest the two defendants.
The court also found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in
denying the defendant's motion to sever the trials based upon the
government's introduction of "independent and substantial evidence" in
support of the defendant's individual charges.

                               United States v. Rogers
                          918 F.2d 207 (D.C. Cir. 1990)

              The defendant was convicted of possessing more than 50
grams of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of
a school.

              Police officers observed a group of men gathered on a street
known to be frequented by drug dealers. Upon seeing the officers, the
defendant grabbed a gym bag and ran. When the police pursued him, the
defendant threw the gym bag into a sewer. The defendant was arrested
and when searched, police found a telephone beeper. When the officers
                                        616

                                        17

retrieved the gym bag, it contained fifty-five grams of 82% pure crack
cocaine.

              Defendant took the stand and testified that he had been on his
way to visit a girlfriend who lived on the street. The defendant further
testified that the gym bag was not his bag but belonged to a friend. The
district court then allowed the prosecution to question the defendant
about his prior arrests as a juvenile - that he had once before distributed
crack cocaine on the same street and thrown the crack away in the same
manner when he had seen the police. The district court also allowed
testimony that he had once owned a beeper.

              The jury convicted the defendant and he appealed. Judge
Thomas, writing for a unanimous panel, rejected defendant's argument
that the Federal Rules of Evidence prohibited admission of his prior
conduct. He stated that the "Federal Rules of Evidence are creatures of
statute" and thus should be interpreted by beginning with the language
of the rules themselves using "'traditional tools'" of statutory
                                                 617

                                                 18

construction. After a review of the language, supported by Advisory
Committee notes and decisions from other circuits, Judge Thomas upheld
admission of the evidence. The testimony was not offered to prove
character and the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the
evidence.

               Finally, Judge Thomas rejected defendant's argument that the
district court should have granted his motion for acquittal or a new trial.
Based upon Supreme Court standards, Judge Thomas found that "[ajmple
and convincing evidence supported the jury's verdict under the reading of
the statute even more favorable to [defendant]." Id. at 214.

                                    United States v. Long
                                 United States v. Mayfield
                                9O5F.2d 1572 (D.C. Cir.),
                         cert, denied. 111 S. Ct. 365 (1990)

               Two defendants were convicted of possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute and of using a firearm in a drug trafficking crime. The
                                            618

                                            19

defendants were arrested in an apartment where cocaine and other drug
paraphernalia was found. The police also found an unloaded handgun
between the sofa cushions.

              One of the defendants filed her notice of appeal one day later
than the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure permits. Judge Thomas
rejected the appeal stressing that the time limit is "'mandatory and
jurisdictional,"1 citing the Supreme Court's decision in United States v.
Robinson. 361 U.S. 220 (1960). The court rejected defendant's
argument that the court's docketing of her untimely notice of appeal
should have been construed as an implicit extension of time. Judge
Thomas declined to equate the ministerial act of docketing an appeal with
an implicit grant of an extension of time finding that "the unambiguous
language of the rule forecloses this shortcut." 905 F.2d at 1574.
Although Judge Thomas's interpretation was required by precedent of the
D.C. Circuit, he also distinguished other circuit decisions that allowed
untimely appeals. He emphasized that the specified time limits "serve
vital interests of efficiency and finality in the administration of justice."
                                       619

                                        20

Id. at 1575. The court remanded the case for a determination whether
the defendant should be granted a discretionary thirty day extension
permitted in the rules based upon a showing of excusable neglect.

                As to the other defendant, the court (with Judge Sentelle
concurring separately) reversed the firearm conviction and affirmed the
drug conviction. Noting that the appellate court owes "tremendous
deference to a jury verdict" in the face of a challenge to the sufficiency
of the evidence, Judge Thomas nonetheless, found that the government
failed to produce any evidence that the defendant had "use[d] or carrie[d]
a firearm" within the meaning of the statute. Judge Thomas rejected the
government's argument that the defendant "used" the gun by committing
a drug offense facilitated by a gun. He stated that such an interpretation
would obliterate any remaining limits on the meaning and application of
the word "use," a prospect particularly troubling when construing a
criminal statute. Judge Thomas rejected "the notion that a loose,
transitive relationship of this type is sufficient to show that a person
'used' a gun." Based upon a comprehensive review of D.C. as well as
                                        620

                                                 21

other circuit court precedents, Judge Thomas explained that the
government must establish some nexus whereby the defendant actually
or constructively possessed the particular firearm in order to prove that
he "used" it.

              The narcotics charges were affirmed despite defendant's
objections that evidence of a telephone call received by the police officer
at the defendant's house should not be admissible. The statements made
by the caller were not excluded as hearsay since they were not offered
as assertions that the defendant was involved in drug dealing. Instead,
the evidence was received as a series of nonassertive questions falling
outside the scope of the hearsay rule.

              Judge Thomas upheld the district court's denial of defendant's
motion to sever his trial finding that the evidence against the defendants
failed to rise to the "gross disparity of evidence" standard as dictated by
the Supreme Court. Noting that there is a "strong and legitimate interest
in efficient and expeditious proceedings," Judge Thomas added that "this
                                        621
                                        22

interest must never be allowed to eclipse a defendant's right to a fair
trial." In holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in
denying the motion to sever, Judge Thomas found that an abundance of
evidence implicating both defendants was presented to the court.

                                  United States v. Poston
                              902 F.2d 90 (D.C. Cir. 1990)

                Knowing that his friend was carrying PCP and intended to
distribute it, the defendant drove him to the site of the drug sale. The
defendant dropped off his friend and drove around the block to the next
corner while the sale was being consummated. He was arrested while
waiting in his truck. The jury found the defendant guilty of aiding and
abetting the possession of PCP with intent to distribute but acquitted him
of the charge of aiding and abetting tho distribution. On appeal, the
defendant argued that (1) there was insufficient evidence to convict; (2)
the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a
continuance on the day before trial; (3) he was denied effective
                                           622

                                                 23

assistance of counsel because the lawyer he hired only had one day
before trial to prepare; and (4) he was denied due process when the
prosecution refused to request a downward departure from the federal
Sentencing Guidelines.

              Writing for a unanimous panel, Judge Thomas affirmed
defendant's conviction. On the aiding and abetting charge, Judge
Thomas was guided by the limited review the Supreme Court permits for
assessing the sufficiency of evidence on appeal. Judge Thomas declined
to construe the statute to require that the defendant must himself have
actually possessed the illegal drug or assisted in obtaining possession of
it. This "cramped" interpretation of the statute was rejected because of
the court's well-established, broad standards that require only that the
defendant have aided and abetted in the crime of possession of the drug.

              The court also rejected the defendant's contention that it was
an abuse of discretion to deny his motion for continuance on ground that
it was the defendant's delay in deciding to select new counsel that
                                           623

                                                 24

prompted the motion for continuance at the "eleventh hour." Judge
Thomas noted the public's "strong interest in the prompt, effective, and
efficient administration of justice," emphasizing defendant's lack of
evidence to demonstrate that the trial judge abused his discretion to deny
the continuance.

              Defendant's claim that he received ineffective assistance of
counsel was found to be without merit and unsupported by Supreme
Court precedent. Defendant failed to point to any error made by his
counsel or to show that it resulted in any prejudice to his defense. His
ineffective assistance of counsel defense was therefore inadequate as a
matter of law.

              Finally, defendant argued that he was denied due process by
the failure of the prosecution to request that his sentence be reduced
below the statutory minimum mandated under the Sentencing Guidelines.
This allegation arose from statements made by the arresting officers
concerning the defendant's cooperation. Since the police did make this
                                            624

                                            25

cooperation known, Judge Thomas held that the commitment to the
defendant to do so could not be construed to obligate the prosecution to
file a motion to depart from the sentencing guidelines.

                                       Conclusion
              Judge Thomas's criminal law opinions evidence his belief in
judicial restraint, his commitment to established rules of law and
thoughtful attention to the issues before the court in a particular case.
His opinions show scholarship and keen attention to detail with a
scrupulous regard for the rights of defendants and a concurrent concern
for victims. As shown by this analysis, Judge Thomas's observance of
controlling precedent, particularly in cases such as Whoie. Poston and
Harrison, provided the consistency and predictability we demand of
criminal laws. In Long and Hallhnan. Judge Thomas refused to expand
the jurisdiction of the court or to answer questions not properly before the
court. Judge Thomas's observance of "traditional tools" of statutory
construction in cases such as Rogers and Long, compelled the court to
construe the applicable statutes as intended by the legislature rather than
                                        625

                                        26

in accordance with the judge's own predilections. Finally, in Rogers.
Long, and Halliman for example, Judge Thomas rejected arguments that
evidence must be excluded when there is a justifiable basis for admission.
This study of Judge Thomas's criminal law and procedure majority
opinions highlights his proven judicial qualifications and suggests that he
would be an extremely able and valued member of the Supreme Court.

   Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Ms. Bracher.
   Ms. Holmes.

                     STATEMENT OF SADAKO HOLMES

   Ms. HOLMES. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I wish to
thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of President
George Bush's nominee, Judge Clarence Thomas, to the U.S Su-
preme Court. I have been asked by the National Black Nurses As-
sociation's Executive Committee to appear on their behalf for the
purpose of reading into the record a letter sent by the board to our
president. The president of my organization, Dr. Linda Bolton,
would have appeared before you, but her schedule does not permit
her attendance.

  Highlights from the letter sent to the President is as follows:

   August 16, 1991. Dear Mr. President: The Board of Directors of the 7,000-member
National Black Nurses Association, Inc., has voted to support your nomination of
Judge Clarence Thomas to be the newest Associate Justice to the United States Su-
preme Court.

  The National Black Nurses Association reaches 130,000 black nurses in the
United States, the Eastern Caribbean, and Africa. We have known Judge Thomas
since 1985 when he spoke to the National Black Nurses Association's membership.
We were impressed then by his vision. We continue to admire his strength. He is a
committed public servant and a respected jurist. We admire his personal develop-
ment from a child who lived in segregated rural Georgia to nomination to the high-
est Court in the United States. The uniqueness of his background promises to pro-
vide an important voice on the Court.

  Justice Thurgood Marshall has been a lifelong champion for the creation of equal
rights. We expect that Judge Thomas will continue this commitment. We believe
that Judge Thomas at this point in his life is prepared to accept this challenge. Sin-
cerely, C. Alicia Georges, President for the Board of Directors of the National Black
Nurses Association.

  Senators, as a private citizen, I would also like to express my
support for Judge Clarence Thomas. I have known Judge Thomas
for over 20 years, and it has been a privilege for me to witness the
development and growth of Judge Thomas whom I have observed
for so many years, starting from his college days to his nomination
to be a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Shortly after Judge Thomas was confirmed as a judge and sworn
in, I visited him in his office. On that day, he shared with me the
now famous letter from the young man in Georgia who saw Judge
Thomas as his role model. Judge Thomas was clearly moved by this
youth's struggle to overcome obstacles similar to his own, and he
enthusiastically responded to the young man's letter.

  In August 1985, Judge Thomas presented a speech at the Nation-
al Black Nurses Association's 13th National Institute and Confer-
ence. The speech, which was later published in the association's
journal, was about a troubled black community, particularly the
educational plight of black children.

  Clarence Thomas is a role model for many of us of all ages. He is
a man of impeccable integrity whose successes in life have been
achieved against all odds. As an African-American, I am particu-
larly proud of his accomplishments.

   For many of us, especially those who I know in the nursing pro-
fession, the presence of Judge Clarence Thomas on the Supreme
Court of the United States will be an assurance that someone with
                                               627

a special hard-earned sensitivity is there, providing a special di-
mension to America's highest tribunal.

  Lastly, as a nurse, I am particularly aware of the importance of
sensitivity and compassion. The people of our country face many
problems where a special understanding and patience makes an
enormous difference in whether or not we successfully meet our
challenges. I know that Judge Thomas will bring that special sensi-
tivity and compassion to the Supreme Court, and all of us will ben-
efit from his service on the Supreme Court.

  Thank you.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Ms. Holmes.
  Justice Black once observed, and I quote, "Under our constitu-
tional system, courts stand against any old winds that blow as
havens of refuge for those who might otherwise suffer because they
are helpless or weak or outnumbered, or because they are non-con-
forming victims of prejudice and public excitement."
  My question is: Was Justice Black right when he argued that
this is an important role of the courts? Or was that just rhetoric?
  Mr. KERN. Right; not rhetoric.
  Senator KOHL. He is right. Anybody disagree with that? The very
important role of the courts. Ms. Norton.
  Ms. NORTON. The role of the courts is that of something beyond
the electoral branches where each person goes into court on an
equal footing. And through that function, it allows people to have a
voice that they might not otherwise have.
  Senator KOHL. I would like to ask you all, in light of that, why
you think Judge Thomas will measure up in this respect. Is it be-
cause of his work as a policymaker, his work on the courts for the
past 16 months? What is it about Judge Thomas substantively--
what can you point to in his background and his work history that
leads you to believe that he will live up to this part of his responsi-
bility as a Supreme Court Justice?
  Mr. THOMPSON. Senator, if I may respond to your question?
  Senator KOHL. Yes, Mr. Thompson.
  Mr. THOMPSON. My response will be based somewhat on my
knowledge of Judge Thomas as a lawyer and as a friend, and that
is that in every position that he has held--in the private sector, as
the head of a large public agency for which he had to have public
policy considerations, and on to the District of Columbia Court of
Appeals--he has taken every position seriously. He has attempted
to and has discharged the duties of those positions faithfully, and I
see nothing in his background that would lead me to believe that
he would do anything less on the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Senator KOHL. Any other comment on that, Ms. Bracher?
  Ms. BRACHER. I would just like to comment. My comments come
from a review of his criminal law opinions, and I take comfort that
all of Judge Thomas' opinions are firmly grounded in law. He does
not rule on policy considerations. When you review his opinions,
you will see that he construes the statutes as written. He is very
mindful of the precedent of the court, very mindful that, especially
in criminal law decisions, there needs to be a firm ground from
which people can work.
  Senator KOHL. That isn't what I--I was referring to what Justice
Black had said, that the courts stand as a haven for those people
                                         628

who might otherwise suffer as a result of majority views or mo-
mentary public hysteria--that the court has an emotional and sym-
pathetic kind of a role to play. You didn't answer that. Maybe I
didn't make myself clear.

   Ms. BRACHER. I would say that the court is a haven for people
when they have a judge who is going to rule on the law, when they
have laws that they can determine what is required, when they
have laws that are not ruled upon a judge's personal views or
policy matters. That is a haven for people to know that a judge is
going to fairly give them their day in court, is going to follow the
law as it is written.

  Ms. NORTON. In looking at his criminal decisions, it is clear he
did not just reflexively rule in favor of the Government and, in
fact, criticized Government activities or arguments that they had
made in a few instances because he felt that they were not giving
appropriate deference to the rights of the defendant.

  Mr. KERN. I would answer your question this way, Senator: You
don't live to be more than 60, as I have, without developing a cer-
tain feel for a person based on conversations and working together.
And my feel based upon my knowledge of Clarence Thomas is that
I would be willing to trust my life and liberty and property to deci-
sions that he makes. And I am convinced on the basis of my con-
versations with him and dealings with him that he has an extraor-
dinary compassion and extraordinary sensitivity, and he would be
the right person to be on a court in the sense of being very sensi-
tive to those in the minority by one reason or another.

  Ms. HOLMES. Senator, as I spoke in my testimony, we feel that
Judge Thomas does have a compassion and sensitivity, and he has
shown that throughout the years. And he is going to bring to the
Court not only the sensitivity and the compassion, but I have found
him to be a very just and fair person. And I, too, would put my life
in the hands of the Supreme Court with he being on the Supreme
Court.

  Senator KOHL. HOW do you all square some of the things you
have said with his position as stated here numerous times as he
testified before us, which was that when he was a policymaker--
the things that he was and did, the expressions of his views, the
opinions he held, the kinds of compassions that he expressed before
he became a judge were things that he was trying to put behind
him, because being a judge was an entirely different kind of profes-
sion, requiring different disciplines? He, in fact, asked us not to
regard the things that he spoke of as necessarily descriptive of how
he felt at this time, having become a judge and wanting to go on to
the Supreme Court.

  How do you square that, particularly with what you said, Mr.
Thompson? You said you have known him and seen him in differ-
ent positions throughout his career, and you could predict, based
on all of these things you have seen in his career, what kind of a
Supreme Court Justice he is going to be. He said disregard that.

  Mr. THOMPSON. I would respond to your question this way. I
think Judge Thomas' performance as the head of the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission--which is a political appoint-
ment, we all know--showed that he still--he has integrity. He is
not a shill for anyone. He didn't even, in that position, which was a
                                      629

political appointment, he did not have any hidden agenda; he tried
to carry out the duties of that job consistent with the mandate of
that agency. And when in fact he had personal and professional
disagreements with the administration that appointed him, he
voiced those disagreements. He was critical of the Reagan adminis-
tration's stand with respect to Bob Jones University. This is a man
with integrity. This is a man who takes his job seriously, and he
has done so at every job he has had, and he is certainly going to do
so as a justice on the United States Supreme Court.

  Senator KOHL. All right.
  Ms. BRACHER. I just want to say I think that--I don't want to put
words into Judge Thomas' mouth--but I think one's views as an
advocate or as an educator or as a policymaker are very different
from when one puts on the robes and joins the judicial branch. And
I think Judge Thomas was trying to explain his recognition of the
way you approach the law when you are judging the law as op-
posed to being an advocate or as opposed to being an educator or a
policymaker within the executive branch.
  Mr. KERN. I would just add that Judge Thomas has been on the
bench for more than one year. Every opinion that he has made has
been reduced to writing and published. In effect he has put his way
of thinking and his views on the record day in and day out in the
work as an appellate judge. And I have read some of those opin-
ions, and I think they reflect a measured view, a fair statement of
the contentions on both sides, a concise statement of what the
issues are, a statement of the relevant facts and a persuasive con-
clusion. So you are not buying someone who has never done any
kind of judicial work but in fact has been a judge and has articulat-
ed his decisions with an explanation, plus the fact that I think you
realize that a judge doesn't have very much except his own integri-
ty. Until you all raised salaries, there certainly weren't much ma-
terial benefits out of serving on the court. And I think that when
you are doing appellate judging, you've got to put your views on
the line in public every time you make a decision, and nothing is
more important than to be fair. You can't shade; you can't leave
out a couple of facts in order to reach the conclusion that you want
because the parties of both sides know those major facts. So you
are called upon to tell it like it is within the framework of what
are the precise contentions.
  There is a lot of difference between being a lawyer before you go
on the bench or being an administrator of a judicial education
project and expressing viewpoints off the top of your head and
making a decision on a precise question of law with contentions
from both sides, and both sides looking at what you decide and how
you decide it.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you.
  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to take this opportunity to welcome this panel here today.
I think each of you have brought out points that are very impor-
tant. You know Judge Thomas, and you know of his activities, and
you have firm convictions as to whether he'd make a Supreme
Court Justice.
                                                630

  Now, I'm not going to take a lot of time. I just want to ask you
two questions. I think this is the essence of this hearing. The first
is--and we'll start with Ms. Norton and then on to Mr. Thompson,
Mr. Kern, Ms. Bracher and Ms. Holmes, in that order--I will ask
the same question to all of you. Is it your opinion that Judge
Thomas is highly qualified and possesses the necessary integrity,
professional competence and judicial temperament to be an Associ-
ate Justice of the United States Supreme Court?

  Ms. Norton.
  Ms. NORTON. Yes, that is certainly my view. I have looked at his
record. I am not personally acquainted with him, so I cannot speak
with the 20 years' worth of personal knowledge that other panel
members can address, but I can look at the way in which he has
functioned as a judge and the way in which he has made his deci-
sions. They are exceptional decisions in the way in which they deal
with the role of the judiciary, the role of an appeals court. He was
very careful to act within his role and to act appropriately.
  Senator THURMOND. SO your answer is "Yes"?

   Ms. NORTON. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Thompson.
  Mr. THOMPSON. Senator, my answer is yes, and my answer is
based on not only my friendship and knowledge of Judge Thomas,
but the fact that I am a lawyer, and I am a citizen, and I am very
much concerned about having quality people on the U.S. Supreme
Court.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Kern.

   Mr. KERN. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. MS. Bracher.
  Ms. BRACHER. Yes, and my knowledge is based upon his writings
in the criminal law area, and as a women and a citizen, I can say
yes.
  Senator THURMOND. MS. Holmes.
  Ms. HOLMES. Yes, definitely so. And my answer is based on
having known Judge Thomas for over 20 years and having seen
him not only in the positions that he has carried out but also in
informal meetings with him.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, my second question is this, and I will
ask it of each one of you: Do you know of any reason why Judge
Thomas should not be made a member of the Supreme Court of the
United States?
  Ms. Norton.
  Ms. NORTON. These hearings have extensively dealt with every
aspect of his record and of his approach to being a justice, and I
believe that this committee has before it the information that
would show that he will be an exceptional choice for that position.
I know of nothing that would bar him from that position.
  Senator THURMOND. SO your answer is "No".
  Ms. NORTON [nodding].
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Thompson.
  Mr. THOMPSON. Senator, I know of no reason why this body
should not confirm President Bush's choice for the U.S. Supreme
Court.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Kern.

   Mr. KERN. NO, sir.
                                         631

  Senator THURMOND. MS. Bracher.

   Ms. BRACHER. NO, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. MS. Holmes.
  Ms. HOLMES. NO, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. SO all of you have answered "Yes" to the
first question and have answered "No" to the second question. I
think that's the essence of the whole hearing, just what you have
answered in those two questions.
  Thank you very much for your appearance. This is a very intelli-
gent panel. I congratulate you on your appearance.
  I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Senator Thurmond.
  Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I too thank the witnesses for
coming. Your testimony was very moving and useful and very help-
ful and important to us, and we appreciate it, and I thank you for
it.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much.
  Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. I apologize, I didn't get to hear all of your previ-
ous testimony. As many of us do, I have many other things going
on, and we have to leave the hearing room and come back. So you
may have answered this question, but what political party do each
of you belong to?
  Ms. NORTON. I am an elected Republican.
  Mr. THOMPSON. I am a Republican, Senator.
  Mr. KERN. I was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson after
serving as an executive assistant to Attorney General Ramsey
Clark.
  Senator HEFLIN. What are you now?
  Mr. KERN. AS I have aged, Senator, my views have moved a bit
more to the center than they were when I served with Attorney
General Clark, whom I admire very, very much and have a deep
personal regard and affection for.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU still haven't answered my question. [Laugh-
ter.]
  Mr. KERN. I am registered an Independent in the District of Co-
lumbia.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right. Ms. Bracher.
  Ms. BRACHER. I am registered as a Republican in the State of
Virginia.
  Ms. HOLMES. I am registered as a Republican in Massachusetts.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right. Ms. Bracher, you seem to have read a
good deal of Judge Thomas' opinions on the Court of Appeals. Un-
fortunately, I don't have the cases before me, but two of those
cases, according to my memory, were United States v. Long and
United States v. Harrison. In regard to part of the decision in
each--there were several issues involved--but one issue was the
possession of a weapon during a drug raid where drugs were actu-
ally present, and the defendant in both these cases was convicted of
the possession of a weapon, which carries more severe penalties
with it. Both involved the constructive possession of a weapon.
Judge Thomas went one way--it seems to me that he found for the

       56-271 O--93-
                                                632

defendant in Long, and he found for the Government in the case of
U.S. v. Harrison.

  Now, in reading those cases, I was somewhat confused, and I
wanted to ask him about it, but there were other matters that I
thought were of higher priority. But are those decisions consistent
in your judgment, and if so, why?l

  Ms. BRACHER. Yes, they are consistent. As a matter of fact, they
exemplify Judge Thomas careful review of the statute. In Long, he
looked at the statute and realized that in order to establish con-
structive possession, he must find that the defendant actually--and
this is in quotes--"used the gun." To find that--he used inLong--
the gun was located in the cushions of the couch. The defendant
was coming into the room where the gun was located, and Judge
Thomas stated that the prosecution failed to offer any evidence
that he had actually or constructively used the gun or had it in his
possession.

  In contrast is the Harrison case where you had--I believe there
were three people in a van with a gun under the seat, one person
with a gun on his person, and the third person was found to have
constructively possessed the gun by means of the other two persons
in his proximity in the van.

  Senator HEFLIN. AS I recall, one of the reasons Thomas said was
that if a bullet had been fired towards the defendant, the one that
didn't have a gun, it was reasonable to assume that he could get a
gun and fire back, which seemed to be some rather nebulous think-
ing relative to that.

  Ms. BRACHER. Well, I believe you are referring to the Harrison
case where the three gentlemen were in the van. Ms. Norton spoke
on the case similarly where they were in possession of cocaine; one
had a bulletproof vest on; they had a temporary license, unregis-
tered gun; and the other gentleman actually had a gun on his
person, and they were involved in cocaine dealings. Whereas, the
other situation was a person who wasn't in the room where the
gun was, he was alone, and just entering the room, and Judge
Thomas found the fact that the gun was present in the room was
not sufficient because if he had, there would be no limits. And the
statute clearly required some boundaries and parameters to be set.

  Senator HEFLIN. SO you think that there is a factual distinction
in his analysis of whether or not the defendant in each of these
cases was in constructive possession of a gun?

  Ms. BRACHER. I don't think it is just factual. I think it is the con-
structive possession, the law as it is written in interpretation, and
the application of the precedent and the finding that it is actually
used within the precedent set by the Court and the interpretation
of the statute. It is not just on the factual ground.

  Senator HEFLIN. That is all.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Senator Heflin.
  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I appreciate very much your testimony. I think it brings a lot of
common sense to the support of Judge Thomas. Most importantly,
it doesn't seem to be a shrillness voice in support of him, as we
have had a lot of shrill voices in opposition to him. I think the lack
of shrillness will sell better with the American people who oppose
                                                    633

or, particularly those who are watching, are still showing tremen-
dous support for Judge Thomas.

  My questioning has been a little bit touched upon by my col-
league from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, but I would like to
proceed with those who have read the opinions. A couple of you re-
ferred to the fact you had read these opinions, and I want to say
thank you for doing that because I think that brings a lot of knowl-
edge to this committee, although we and our staff have had an op-
portunity to look at these opinions as well. It makes me feel good
for those of you who have read the opinions that you have based
your judgment and support of him to a considerable extent on what
he has written.

  The reason why I am glad for this is we did have some law pro-
fessors here within the last few days who said Judge Thomas was
not in the mainstream, and I asked them if that was based upon
their reading of his opinions. Quite frankly, I was astonished that
they had not read his opinions at all and they still had this judg-
ment of him.

  Ms. Norton and Ms. Bracher, is there any question, after reading
these views of Clarence Thomas expressed through his opinions,
that he is a mainstream jurist who is going to look at the written
law and precedent to construe that law and who is going to look at
the Constitution, the Framers' intent, and the precedent set by pre-
vious Supreme Courts in the interpretation of that Constitution?
Ms. Norton?

  Ms. NORTON. There seems to be a great concern that he will start
bringing policy views unrelated to the Constitution into his judicial
decision-making. I found absolutely no evidence of that in review-
ing his decisions. His decisions were very carefully written, very
carefully relied on precedent, on the exact language of statutes, on
the proper role of an appellate court as compared to a trial court,
and on the proper role of an appellate court compared to the U.S.
Supreme Court. And I found his opinions to be just exceptional in
the extent to which they were very carefully confined within the
appropriate role of a judge.

  Ms. BRACHER. I would also like to add I agree with Ms. Norton,
but he has written opinions and they are joined by the judges on
the D.C. Circuit considered to be on both sides of the political spec-
trum. And I would go one step further. Upon a reading of his opin-
ions, I believe that every Senator could take comfort that Judge
Thomas is a judge who will rule according to the law. His policy
views and the policy positions that he has taken have not come
into play when he has written his judicial opinions. He construes
statutes as they are written with the intent of Congress, and he
has ruled very narrowly on the precedent of the Court.

  He even has gone so far as when precedents in other circuits
have been to the contrary, he will review those precedents. He will
distinguish them and explain where his rulings are coming from,
and they are coming from the law.

   Senator GRASSLEY. For those of you who would want to express a
view, for those of you who support Judge Thomas--and all of you
do--I am interested in whether viewing him not just as a jurist but
as a whole person, do you think that he brings any special qualities
to the Court that may not be there in some other Justices? Or do
                                                634

you think that he is probably a duplicate in the sense of some
other qualities that are on the Court already?

  Mr. KERN. I would answer that by saying that I recall when his
nomination was announced and his mother was interviewed on tel-
evision, and she said, "He knows where he comes from, and he is
never going to forget that."

  When I would face the Supreme Court in the role of an advocate,
I would see people from a variety of backgrounds and people with a
variety of experiences, including an all-American football player
and a Harvard Law Review member and a Chicago Law School pro-
fessor.

  It seems to me that Clarence Thomas, with his background and
his life experiences that have been immeasurably different from,
let's say, the last nominee--that is not to say that one has been
better than the other, but they have been vastly different--I think
he would bring a quality to the Court, a facet to the Court that is
not now presently represented.

  Senator GRASSLEY. And you are expressing that as a positive
thing, that that ought to be present, a quality that ought to be
present on the Court?

  Mr. KERN. Absolutely. I would feel more comfortable as an advo-
cate with that kind of component added to a multi-judge Court.

  Mr. THOMPSON. Senator, I would add to what Judge Kern said,
and that is, in addition to his background, arising from his back-
ground as a black American who grew up in the 1960's and has
moved on, I think he would bring to the Court a demonstrated in-
dependence of thought, and the fact that he has valuable hands-on
experience in the public policy arena as heading a major public
agency such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. I
think those two ingredients, in addition to what Judge Kern said,
his independence of thought and his public policy experience would
be valuable additions to the Court, not only being on the Court but
inside the deliberations of the Court. I think that would be a very
positive factor.

  Ms. HOLMES. Senator, I sat here thinking about what can he
bring. To me the most important thing is you have to know who
you are and where you have come from, and he certainly knows
that, as it has been demonstrated over the past few days.

  Judge Thomas, with his integrity, his sensitivity, his compassion,
even though others on the Court have that, he still is going to
bring a different dimension to the Court.

  Ms. BRACHER. I would just like to add that beyond his experience
and keen intellect, the experience that he has from serving on the
D.C. Circuit, from serving in the executive branch, I find Judge
Thomas to be inspirational, that someone with his background has
done what he has done, and it proves to me that with hard work I
can do anything I want to do. And I think that he represents what
is best in all of America. And I think he brings that to the Court
along with his background.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions.
Thank you all very much.

  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Senator Grassley.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
                                                    635

  Senator KOHL. I am very sorry, Senator Specter. Senator Simon.
Forgive me.

  Senator SIMON. I have no questions for the panel, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.

  Senator KOHL. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Attorney General Norton, in the case of the United States v.
Lopez, Judge Thomas sat on a panel which remanded the case for
resentencing under the Uniform Guidelines, notwithstanding a pro-
vision which prohibited the consideration of socioeconomic factors,
where the argument was made by the defendant's lawyer that the
defendant should be entitled to special consideration because of his
home background, the circumstances of his mother's murder by the
father, the defendant's problems growing up, and the threats made
by the father against the young defendant. And the United States
attorney prosecuting the case made the argument that if socioeco-
nomic factors could be broadened or if those factors did not come
within the ban, that socioeconomic factors should not be consid-
ered. There would be very wide latitude for trial courts to consider
the background of individuals, and we would not have the desired
uniformity in sentencing procedures.
  What is your view of the Court's ruling in that case in the con-
text of the argument made by the prosecuting attorney?
  Ms. NORTON. I am sorry. I have seen a summary of that, but I
have not seen the entire decision that was rendered in that case,
and so I cannot comment in detail on that.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, that was a matter that I had asked Judge
Thomas about when he was testifying here, but I thought that you
might have some knowledge of it.
  Perhaps you do, Ms. Bracher. You had analyzed Judge Thomas'
opinions, and I realize this was not one of his opinions. But if you
are familiar with it, I would be interested in your observations on
the case.
  Ms. BRACHER. Unfortunately, no, I am not. I limited my research
into the opinions that he authored. The similar opinion I found
that he did author, not having read Lopez, is the Chavez decision
where he reviewed the length of the sentence under the Federal
Sentencing Guidelines. In his review of the Federal Sentencing
Guidelines, the opinion is replete with discussion on its terms of
textual analysis and construing the Sentencing Guidelines accord-
ing to the intent of Congress.
  Not having read the Lopez decision, I am not sure if that is help-
ful. But that is the philosophy he used in reviewing the decision in
that case.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Kern, where you have the uniform sen-
tencing guidelines precluding a trial judge from considering socio-
economic factors, do you think it is a fair interpretation for the
court to consider the background of an individual defendant, where
there were severe marital problems between the defendant's par-
ents, the father apparently killed the mother, the kinds of things
that I described earlier?
  Mr. KERN. I think it is obviously a judgment call, when you are
faced with what would appear to be a restrictive statutory demand
that there be a limitation, but at the same time you are confronted
                                          636

with a case in which a significant element is the extraordinarily
troubled background of the defendant. I think it is a pull and a tug,
and it would not disturb me to find--I am not familiar with the
facts of the case, but it would not disturb me to find a certain
leeway where the trial court could take that unique particular
factor into consideration.

   Senator SPECTER. YOU are not troubled by Judge Thomas' joining
in that opinion?

    Mr. KERN. NO.

   Senator SPECTER. MS. Holmes, I believe you were in the hearing
room this morning when the panel testified on the abortion issue
and opposed Judge Thomas on the concerns they have on what
might happen with Roe v. Wade and the issue of sensitivity to
women's concerns in that kind of a situation? You heard that?

   Ms. HOLMES. Yes.

   Senator SPECTER. What is your evaluation, if you care to give
one, as to how you think Judge Thomas might respond to sensitivi-
ty for women's concerns, especially for African-American women?

   Ms. HOLMES. Senator, my organization, the National Black
Nurses Association, has a great concern about the abortion issue,
but we have not come out with a position statement on abortion,
and anything that I would say here today would be construed as
coming out from the association. Therefore, I would rather not
make any comment on that.

   Senator SPECTER. Well, I respect that, Ms. Holmes. Would you
have any comment to make on your view as to his sensitivity on
women's issues, generally?

   Ms. HOLMES. He is going to be fair, he certainly is going to read
all the opinions, sit down and meditate on it and think about it,
and whatever he comes up with as his decision, I am sure that it
will be something that has taken great thought.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Thompson, I could not be present during
your testimony. I came in shortly after you finished, but I under-
stand you had testified in support of Judge Thomas, of course, but
some difference in view with Judge Thomas on affirmative action.
Do you agree with his position on affirmative action?

   Mr. THOMPSON. I did not testify with respect to any difference of
opinion, as I understand his views on affirmative action, so I do
agree. As I understand what Judge Thomas' views are on that sub-
ject, Senator, I do agree with his views, but I think that his views
on affirmative action as they have been portrayed in the media
have been misinterpreted.

   I do not view and understand Judge Thomas to take the position
that he is opposed to all forms of affirmative action. He is opposed
to quotas, as I am, but he understands that some forms of affirma-
tive action are necessary, because they are really truly needed to
make some of our individual rights and aspirations a reality, and
they are fair. But he is opposed to quotas, and so am I.

   Senator SPECTER. Well, with respect to his opposition to quotas,
he was emphatic about that, and I think there is general agree-
ment that quotas are bad. He did testify about agreeing to limited
affirmative action in an educational context, and there was consid-
erable discussion about his own experience. But he did oppose af-
firmative action in an employment context, unless the affirmative
                                                    637

action was directly remedial to a specific individual who had been
discriminated against, and that he would not favor affirmative
action if it would put the group in the place where the group had
been, but for a generalized discrimination. Do you agree with that
point on Judge Thomas' stand?

   Mr. THOMPSON. Yes, I do. But I would also like to respond beyond
that and indicate something and reiterate something I said in my
direct testimony, and that is people may differ on affirmative
action and people may differ with respect to how black Americans,
in general, need to advance and overcome some of the problems
that we face, but I do not believe that that difference of opinion
should be a reason for this body to deny Judge Thomas' confirma-
tion to the United States Supreme Court.

  As I said in my testimony, I think this difference of opinion
within the black community as to how we should advance, how we
should and can attack the problems that we face is deeply rooted in
this country's history, beginning with the differences of opinion be-
tween W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, and I believe that
this difference of opinion is a source of strength in the black com-
munity and in the Nation as a whole, and this difference, you
should not use this difference to get off track and use it as a basis
for confirming or for denying the confirmation of Judge Thomas.

   Senator SPECTER. Mr. Thompson, how long have you worked with
Judge Thomas at Monsanto?

   Mr. THOMPSON. I worked with him for approximately 2 years.
   Senator SPECTER. And you dealt with a great many legal issues
during that 2-year period?

   Mr. THOMPSON. We dealt with a great many legal issues that
many young lawyers in our corporate law department would have
to face.

   Senator SPECTER. The American Bar Association rated Judge
Thomas qualified, as opposed to being well qualified. How would
you rate him?

   Mr. THOMPSON. I would rate him well qualified, and I think, as I
understand the American Bar Association's recommendation, I
think it is unfairly tilted to the litigation experience of a lawyer,
not just Judge Thomas, but any lawyer who is being viewed for a
judicial position, and certainly discounted and did not take into
consideration his public policy experience as the head of the EEOC
or a major agency such as that. I would rate him well qualified.

   Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Judge Thompson. Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Senator Specter.
   Senator Brown.
   Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I suppose in hearings of this kind, it is natural that you would
have both proponents and opponents. I think that is the purpose of
the hearing, to allow both sides to come and speak, but one of the
phenomenons that we have had is that the people who seem to
know the Judge and have a personal contact with him all seem to
be proponents, and the opponents seem to be made up of those who
haven't had a chance to get to know him personally.
                                          638

   Senators do not always have that experience with regard to what
people form views of them, so it is somewhat refreshing to have
this phenomenon come up. It is particularly, I think, helpful to
have people who have read the Judge's decisions. We have had a
number of people testify on his judicial temperament and demean-
or and how he would rule, but, unfortunately, many of them, as
Senator Grassley has pointed out, have not had the opportunity to
read his decisions, so this panel comes particularly well prepared
and we appreciate your insights as a result of that.

   Mr. Thompson, you having worked with the Judge, I wonder if
you might share some observations about his work habits, his ap-
proach to problems, his temperament in the years you worked with
him in corporate law.

   Mr. THOMPSON. He was as very, very hard worker. He took his
job serious. We both, as young lawyers in a corporate law depart-
ment, faced many technical issues with respect to drafting long
contracts and purchase agreements, and analyzing the myriad of
regulations that a large corporation has to deal with. We both had
many problems with respect to having to deal with that.

  I recall Judge Thomas putting in many long hours, trying to
grapple with the issues and master his craft, as you havp to do as a
young lawyer, and we spent a lot of time together. While we did
have an opportunity to talk about some of the public policy issues
facing the day, much of the time that we spent together was faced
really trying to understand and grapple with the technical issues
that we both faced, as young lawyers in a corporation, and I think
that dedication to mastering his craft, his willingness to work hard,
his desire to want to do a good job, these are all qualities that will
serve him well on the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Senator BROWN. Young attorneys, particularly, although I sus-
pect attorneys generally, become advocates for their client, as
indeed they are paid to do. Some become very strong advocates in
the very competitive way. Some temper that advocacy with a sense
of justice and fair play, as the ethics require to be honest, to not
misrepresent facts, even though they are strong advocates of a
viewpoint. Are there any observations you might share with us as
to what kind of an advocate Clarence Thomas was in those early
years, even-handed, able to see both sides or simply somewhat
narrow-viewed advocate?

  Mr. THOMPSON. Senator, if I can respond to your question based
upon my knowledge of his tenure at the EEOC, and there he took
over an agency in which many of the career professionals, I would
think it is fair to say, had some strong differences of opinion with
respect to affirmative action and some issues that Judge Thomas
held strong views on.

  But, notwithstanding these differences, many of the career pro-
fessionals that I have talked with, who know Judge Thomas and
his work at the EEOC, have nothing but praise and respect for
him. They understand his fairness and his ability to see both sides,
because many times he retreated from some of the very strongly
held abstract views he had, in the face of the reality of running
this agency and trying to serve its constituents and trying to pro-
tect American citizens from unlawful employment discrimination.
                                         639

He did that and he took his job seriously, and I think that goes to
his character and that goes to his integrity.

  I don't know if you had an opportunity to hear my direct testi-
mony, but this past weekend I talked to one of those career profes-
sionals in Atlanta, he has just retired from the EEOC after many
years, and he will acknowledge that he and Judge Thomas differ
on some issues, but he has nothing but praise and respect for Judge
Thomas. He says, "I tell my friends that if they don't want to
change their views on him, those who are critical of him, if they
don't want to change their views on him, then they shouldn't get to
know him, because once they get to know this man, they will re-
spect his character, his integrity, his intellect, and all of the unfair
and unfounded criticism of him will go aside."

  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  Attorney General Norton, you have read, I take it, the criminal
cases that Judge Thomas has written on the Circuit Court of Ap-
peals?

  Ms. NORTON. That is right.
  Senator BROWN. In reviewing those decisions and opinions, have
any dissents been filed in connection with those opinions?
  Ms. NORTON. There were not dissents filed to any of those. There
was one concurring opinion in one of the cases. It is the same opin-
ion that has been discussed extensively on the interpretation of
using a firearm, and in that case the one concern was that perhaps
there had been too much of a burden placed on the Government to
show the use of a firearm, and that was one that, nevertheless, con-
curred very much in the result.

  Senator BROWN. Does the fact that there weren't dissents lead
you to an impression of whether the Judge was in the mainstream
of legal thinking or not?

  Ms. NORTON. Certainly in the cases that I have examined, he was
very much in the mainstream and very much presented a balanced
view in his treatment of those cases.

  Senator BROWN. In reviewing his opinions, do you have a view of
whether or not the Judge would be overly strict with regards to the
doctrines of standing or mootness? Would he have a tendency to
deprive individuals of access to the court?

  Ms. NORTON. I know that in some documents that have been pre-
sented by various organizations to this committee there have been
some concerns about his views on standing and access to the
courts. But having reviewed those decisions and Judge Thomas'
concurring and dissenting views in those cases, I believe his views
were very much in the mainstream on those cases. Questions of
standing are often very difficult to decide for the courts, but his
analysis was the traditional analysis.

  Senator BROWN. Thank you very much. I thank all the panel for
their testimony.

  Senator KOHL. We thank you very much for appearing here
today. You have been very helpful.

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much for your appearance.
  Senator KOHL. Our next witness today is Mr. Lane Kirkland,
President of the AFL-CIO. Mr. Kirkland has been a distinguished
spokesperson on behalf of working people of America for many,

many years, and we are honored and privileged to have him here
with us today.

   Mr. Kirkland, we would appreciate it if you could summarize
your remarks in 5 minutes or as close to 5 minutes as possible.

      STATEMENT OF LANE KIRKLAND, PRESIDENT, AFL-CIO,
     ACCOMPANIED BY LAWRENCE GOLD, GENERAL COUNSEL

   Mr. KIRKLAND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I have submitted a full statement for the record. I will give you a
summary as briefly as I can. I have with me Lawrence Gold, who is
the general counsel of the AFL-CIO, and a frequent practitioner
before the Supreme Court and knowledgeable on legal matters that
are too esoteric for me.
   Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you for the op-
portunity to testify on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas
to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States.
  In early August, the AFL-CIO, acting through its executive coun-
cil, determined to oppose Judge Thomas. Our determination was
based on a careful study of his record as a Government official and
as a participant in the ongoing public debate over the future direc-
tion of the country. What we found was deeply disturbing from the
perspective of the trade union movement and of the working men
and women who comprise trade unions.
  For most of the past 10 years in his role as EEOC Chairman and
as a writer and a speaker on issues of the day, Judge Thomas has
fervently championed the ideological agenda of the far right and
has done so without deviation. This committee has questioned
Judge Thomas regarding his extreme ideological rhetoric and his
attacks on the role of Government in defense of the least privileged
of its citizens.
  You sought the specifics behind his alarm that the Nation is---
and I quote--"careening with frightening speed toward collectiv-
ism, coercive centralized planning, and a statist-dictatorial
system". You have examined his attacks on such perceived enemies
of the right as Franklin Roosevelt and his "later-day political
heirs", and particularly the judge's scorn for their "attack on prop-
erty rights". And you have reviewed with Judge Thomas his writ-
ings that expound his view that--quoting again--"the govern-
ment's role is to assure a climate in which business can flourish
and then stand back and stay out of the way."
  These quotations on their face, and as Judge Thomas has elabo-
rated on their meaning, are sufficient to explain our opposition to
his nomination. Judge Thomas quite simply has a misunderstand-
ing, in our view, about America's historical experience, the role of
democratic government in enabling Americans to create a more
just and humane civil society, and the value of the social programs
designed to meet the legitimate needs of the average working
American.
   Our child labor laws, environmental laws, securities and banking
laws, and product safety and workplace safety laws are examples of
the kind of Government action we take for granted today and that
Judge Thomas has scorned.
                                         641

  From the building of the intercontinental railroads to the space
program, from Social Security to the GI Bill of Rights, and from
the Fair Labor Standards Act to the Occupational Safety and
Health Act, the truth of the matter is that the Government's role
has been to address social and economic problems in a way that
ameliorates the abuses and failings of the marketplace and thereby
strengthens it, and also recognizes our human needs.

  Judge Thomas does not grasp that truth. His public statements
and writings assert that this body of legislation is not merely un-
sound but repugnant. In his view, these basic statements about re-
ciprocal obligations to each other are "antithetical to freedom".

  Judge Thomas' idea that democratic government actions danger-
ously erode property rights is an absurd and dangerous one in the
modern era. Just ask the families of those 25 workers who died
behind locked doors a couple of weeks ago in an uninspected North
Carolina chicken plant. They don't believe that assuring an em-
ployer's unfettered property rights is the answer to all social prob-
lems. They just want to know why their Government did not even
attempt to protect the basic human rights of their loved ones, par-
ticularly their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

  One of the Supreme Court's primary functions is to interpret the
statutory enactments I have just enumerated. It defies reason to
believe that Judge Thomas will understand and transmit with full
and sympathetic discernment the meaning of the entire body of
economic regulation he has so passionately attacked. That, we be-
lieve, is a more than sufficient reason for rejecting the nomination.

  In light of his recent testimony before this committee, our belief
that a person of Judge Thomas' views should not ascend to the Na-
tion's highest court is now matched by a deep concern over the pos-
sibility that he will do so without having to discuss or defend those
views as part of the Senate confirmation process.

  The approach taken by Judge Thomas and the administration
threatens to turn these hearings into an empty ritual rather than
an integral part of a joint executive branch/legislative branch deci-
sion on the composition of the judicial branch.

  Judge Thomas has refused either to disavow or accept any of his
past hard right rhetoric and has sought to dismiss nearly ten years
of his public life as beside the point because he was serving in the
executive branch and not in his impartial role as a judge.

  I hope it has occurred to more than a few people in this room
that Judge Thomas' role as a judge is not the reason he was nomi-
nated to the Supreme Court. Eighteen months and 20 opinions do
not a justice make.

   Rather, Judge Thomas' accomplishments, and we believe the
basis upon which he was selected by the President, are as a gladia-
tor in the ideological arena. His pamphleteers' ability to reduce
complex questions to caricatures and to belittle those who have a
different social vision made him a hero of the right and its candi-
date for Justice Marshall's seat. But admitting that this was the
basis of his selection and will be the basis of his judicial decisions
would be a fatal blow to the nomination. Consequently, Judge
Thomas' calculated strategy--or that of his "handlers"--is to avoid
all responsibility for prior public statements and positions; tell
them as little as possible of substance; assert a sweeping and strip-
                                              642

ping mental expunging of very recent, strongly-expressed views--a
most unconvincing display of self-abnegation.

  This transparent effort to create an image of moderation and
open-mindedness out of a record that demonstrates their very oppo-
sites strongly suggests mental reservation and a purpose of evasion.

  Such manipulation of the confirmation process debases the
public discourse and denies the Senate its constitutional preroga-
tive to advise and consent on Supreme Court nominees.

  The AFL-CIO does not believe the Senate should acquiesce to the
President in his plan to make the Supreme Court--the nine per-
sons, the highest nonelected office in our land, the nine persons
who now have the virtual power by interpretation to rewrite the
Constitution for our times--the unchallenged preserve of a narrow
and privileged segment of American opinion.

  We respectfully ask that the committee reject the nomination of
Judge Clarence Thomas.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

        STATEMENT BY LANE KIRKLAND, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN
        FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL
        ORGANIZATIONS, BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, ON
        THE NOMINATION OF CLARENCE THOMAS TO BE AN ASSOCIATE
        JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                                          September 19, 1991

        The AFL-CIO appreciates the opportunity to testify before
this Committee on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to be
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

        When these confirmation hearings began, the question was
whether Judge Thomas should be entrusted with the high privilege
and responsibility of serving on the Nation's highest court. We
had studied the Judge's record as a government official and as a
participant in the on-going debate out of which the law is
formed.

         We found Judge Thomas' record wanting in two absolutely
fundamental respects. His government service was marked by an
unwillingness to fully enforce the anti-discrimination laws in
accord with congressional intent. His speeches and writings were
strident advocacy of the ideological agenda of the far Right.

         On these bases, we concluded that Judge Thomas should not be
confirmed, and we were prepared to come before this Committee to
explain our conclusion.

         Now that Judge Thomas has finished his testimony, an added
question needs to be addressed: whether the confirmation process
is being manipulated in a manner that debases the public
discourse and denies the Senate its constitutional prerogative to
                                     644

                                                   2

advise and consent on Supreme Court nominees, we believe that
this question must be answered in the affirmative and that this
answer provides a powerful additional reason for rejecting this
nomination.

                                                        I.
         Judge Thomas's nomination does not have a firm foundation in
his professional accomplishments as a lawyer, legal scholar or
judge. Unlike Justice Marshall, Judge Thomas was never at the
forefront of the practicing bar; indeed, he spent only five years
as a practitioner at a junior level. By his own admission, Judge
Thomas is not a legal scholar; his only published legal writings
are a handful of occasional essays, several of which are little
more than reprints of speeches. And unlike five of the current
members of the Court -- including the last two nominees to come
before this Committee -- Judge Thomas does not have an extensive
record as a judge; his judicial career spans just eighteen months
and has produced only twenty opinions, none of which would be of
even passing interest to students of the law were it not for
Judge Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court.
         Judge Thomas' accomplishments -- and the basis upon which he
has been selected by the President -- are as a gladiator in the
ideological arena. As others have demonstrated, this was a
substantial part of his role as EEOC Chair, and -- even more
clearly -- this was his role as a writer and speaker on the
issues of the day over the last decade. Judge Thomas was a
fixture at gatherings of the Right. His contributions were
                           645

                                                         3
consistently defined by an uncompromising advocacy of an
unbending libertarian ideology. His pamphleteer's ability to
reduce complex questions to caricatures and to belittle those who
have a different social vision made him a hero of the Right and
its candidate for the Supreme Court seat being vacated by Justice
Marshall. We submit that this ability -- although it may well be
a qualification for a place on the lawyer's side of the bar -- is
not a qualification for a seat on the Nation's highest Court.

                                                       II.
                                                        A.
         This Committee has carefully questioned Judge Thomas
regarding the extreme anti-government ideology he has repeatedly
and consistently espoused, including his attacks on compassionate
government in general, and on a host of social programs designed
to recognize the legitimate interests of the average working
American in particular.
         The Committee has probed Judge Thomas regarding his
exaggerated fear that the Nation "is careening with frightening
speed toward collectivism ... coercive centralized planning ...
[and] a statist-dictatorial system."1 Committee members have
questioned Judge Thomas regarding his statements paying homage to
the icons of the Right from Ayn Rand to Oliver North.2 And

Committee members have reviewed with Judge Thomas his attacks on
such perceived enemies of the Right as: Franklin Roosevelt and
"[h]is later day political heirs" (who Judge Thomas condemned for
their "attack on property rights")3; Congress (which Judge
Thomas attacked as "irresponsible" and "out of control")4; and
the Supreme Court (which, according to Judge Thomas, has made
"itself the national school board, parole board, health
commission, and election commission, among other titles").5

        We would add only the following point of emphasis.
Throughout the course of this century/ Congress has deemed it
appropriate from time to time to place restrictions on the
unfettered operation of market forces in order to pursue
important social goals. Our environmental laws, product safety
laws, securities laws, and banking laws, as well as the variety
of workplace regulations from the prohibition on child labor to
the mandate of workplace safety are among the examples we take
for granted today. Congress, too, has enacted a variety of
social welfare laws to assure a fairer distribution of benefits
and burdens than that which the market would otherwise produce.

         The Supreme Court is, of course, the final arbiter as to the

meaning of these laws, and much of the Court's docket is taken up
with deciding such statutory interpretation questions. Judge
Thomas' public statements make it clear that he views this corpus
of legislation as not merely unsound but morally repugnant. In
his view, these basic statements of our reciprocal obligations to
each other are "antithetical to freedom."6

         Judge Thomas' writings in this area are extreme in both
their content and their tone. In his view, "the government's
role is to assure a climate in which businesses can flourish and
then stand back and stay out of the way."7 He warns that those
who seek "such programs as income redistribution, compensatory
job training, compensatory schooling, special medical services,
and the like" have embraced "simplistic temptations" that would
create an "economically stagnant . . . social welfare regime" and
"put us on the road to serfdom."8

         Although he acknowledges that the kinds of government
actions he disdains are part of a long-standing political
tradition with "roots . . . in the Progressive Era[,] . . . the
New Deal and the Great Society, in whose aftermath we find

ourselves today,"9 he views this evolution as a "sorry tale" and
he openly scorns this tradition as resting on an "egregious
error," viz.. a failure to understand that "freedom and security
are mutually exclusive."10

         Judge Thomas1 extreme anti-government views betray a tragic
lack of understanding regarding America's historical experience.
As this Nation has proved, democratic government is not the enemy
of freedom. Neither unfettered "property rights" nor unregulated
markets answer all social problems. Democratic government is the
means whereby Americans have always joined together to create for
themselves and their posterity a more just, humane, and free
society.

         From government support of the intercontinental railroads to
its support for the space program, from Social Security to the GI
Bill and from the Fair Labor Standards Act to the Occupational
Safety and Health Act, the Government's role has been to meet our
economic needs in a way that recognizes our human needs. It is
precisely because this is so that the labor movement advocates --
and has always advocated -- an active role for Government in
this society.

         But whether the views we have just expressed -- or those
Judge Thomas has so single-mindedly advanced -- are in some
ultimate sense "correct" is, for purposes of this Committee's

work, quite beside the point. The role of a Supreme Court
Justice is not to decide social policy; rather, "his great, his
demanding, his deepest task", as the late Paul Bator so elegantly
argued, is "the art of interpretation1* which calls upon the
Justice "to understand and transmit, with full and sympathetic
discernment, enterprises and purposes not of [his] own making but
of others' making."11 The great judge -- like the great
musician -- must have an "inner ear for the music -- the true
meaning of the text, an ability to transcend personal biases and
preferences in order to ... hear and understand and transmit how
the law was meant to be."12

         Judge Thomas has not demonstrated that art. Indeed, it
defies reason to believe that Judge Thomas can "transcend
personal biases" and "understand and transmit, with full and
sympathetic discernment" the meaning of the entire body of
economic regulation he views with such contempt.

                                                        B.
         Judge Thomas' responses to this Committee's questions on his
writings and statements demonstrate that he -- or perhaps his
"handlers" -- had a strategy to avoid any and all responsibility
for his prior public statements and positions.

or accept any of his past statements -- simply dismissed his
life's work as beside the point. Time and again, when faced with
his own words, Judge Thomas sought to explain away his
inflammatory rhetoric by identifying some inoffensive commonplace
and claiming that nothing more was intended. This transparent
effort to create an image of moderation and open-mindedness out
of a record that demonstrates their very opposites strongly
suggests "mental reservation" and a "purpose of evasion."

         Thus, for example, Judge Thomas' praise of Lewis Lehman's
article arguing that the Constitution bans abortions under all
circumstances was meant, he now says, only to illustrate to
conservatives the importance of civil rights.13 His attack on
the Supreme Court's decision upholding the special prosecutor law
was meant only to remind us that "the structure of our
Government" was designed "to protect individuals."14 His
statement that age discrimination often makes economic sense was
intended to convey that the EEOC was "actually upgrading
enforcement" of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.15 His
advocacy of broad constitutional protections for "economic
rights" was meant only to recognize that "the right of [his]
grandfather to work deserves protection."16 His assertion that
government cannot be compassionate meant only that "people are

compassionate."17 And, his praise of Oliver North for defying
Congress was meant merely to express that congressional
oversight hearings "often become highly charged, politicized
publ ic events. "18

        Judge Thomas1 attempt to characterize his hard-right
rhetoric as down-home homilies cannot be squared with his own
words or with a decent respect for our civic responsibilities
when we take part in public debate. Honest, thoughtful discourse
by public officials is a basic requirement of republican self-
government. Judge Thomas1 lack of fidelity to this obligation --
indeed/ his utter lack of recognition that he has such an
obligation -- is of paramount importance in evaluating his
fitness for service on our highest court.

         Nothing in this hearing can, in any event, erase the
historical record. And the record is that for almost ten years
Judge Thomas did not choose to speak in thoughtful and balanced
terms, but, rather, as an ideological partisan. Why else has he
been nominated to the Supreme Court whereas scores of other
lawyers and judges of greater accomplishments and greater scruple
have not? It is simply too late in the day for Judge Thomas to
don a new persona and to ask to be evaluated as if his recently
adopted demeanor is a true reflection of his inner substance.

record in public life by dismissing the significance of the
entire body of his prior work. Judge Thomas asserts that his
speeches were mere "philosophic musings"19 of a "part-time
political theorist."20 And, more importantly, Judge Thomas
argues that the entire body of his pre-judicial views should be
"discount[ed]"21 because it was produced while he was "in the
executive branch" where he "tried to engage in debate and tried
to advance the ball in discussions."22 As a judge, he explains,
his role requires him "to strip down from those policy
positions,"23 so as to "secure that level of impartiality and
objectivity necessary for judging cases."24 Indeed, Judge
Thomas told the Committee that, as a judge, he no longer feels
free even to "accumulat[e] points of view" about "current events
and issues".25

         Judge Thomas is, of course, correct in recognizing that we
expect -- indeed demand -- "impartiality" from our judges. But
impartiality is not achieved, as Judge Thomas seems to think, by
"stripping away" the judge's values, opinions and the like, and
closing one's mind to the intellectual currents of his time.

       A good judge must be a restless, inquisitive and engaged
thinker who strives to understand the full complexity of the
issues that come before him. Chief Justice Rehnquist has put it
well: "[p]roof that a Justice's mind at the time he joined the
Court was a complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional
adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, not
neutrality."26 Thus, as Justice Frankfurter explained, judicial
impartiality is achieved not by "stripping down," but by the
judge's ability "to discover and suppress his prejudices,wZT and
thereby "transcend [his] experience."28

       A judge who follows Justice Frankfurter's dictum will still
be influenced by his own values, attitudes, opinions and
experiences. As Professor Stephen Carter has written, one
"cannot hope for a complete separation of judgment from judge."
Given the indeterminate nature of many of our texts -- both
statutory and constitutional -- and of our constitutional and
jurisprudential concepts, the process of judging will often rest
on the judge's understanding of the world and on his values. As
Professor Carter puts it, "in every interpretive task a moment
arises when the interpreter's own experience and values become
the most important data. That moment cannot be spotted in

        26 Laird v. Tatum. 409 U.S. 824, 835 (1972) (Chambers
opinion of Rehnquist, J . ) .

Frankfurter on the Supreme Court 211, 216-17 (P. Kurland ed. 1970).

advance ... but it is certain that the moment will come."29

         Thus, try as he might, Judge Thomas cannot disassociate
himself as a judge from himself as a person. As we have noted,
his passionate hostility to government regulation cannot fail to
influence his interpretation of statutes authorizing government
regulation, and his antipathy towards Congress inevitably will
influence his rulings as to the scope of congressional powers and
so on.

         This makes it all the more important for the Committee and
the Senate to base their evaluation of the nomination on what
Judge Thomas has said and done over the years, and not on the
convenient but vague assurances that he now offers.

                                                       IV.
         Judge Thomas' unwillingness to be judged on his public
record also accentuates a pressing problem in the confirmation
process that threatens to make the process an empty ritual.
         In his testimony, Judge Thomas -- like Justice Souter,
Justice Kennedy, Justice Scalia, and Justice O'Connor before
him -- refused to discuss constitutional decisions or doctrines
except in the airiest generalities. Like them, Judge Thomas
confined himself to various bromides for our time: that he has
no agenda other than to follow the law, that judicial restraint
is a virtue, that stare decisis is to be respected, that Brown v.
Board of Education and Griswold v. Connecticut were correctly

decided, and that Lochner v. New York was wrongly decided. More
than that he -- like the nominees who have come just before him
(with the notable exception of Judge Bork) -- would not say.

         In past hearings, this refusal to engage the Committee in a
candid discussion has been tempered by the fact that the nominee
had a substantial record of professional achievement -- as a
jurist, as a legislator, or as a legal scholar -- on which he or
she could be evaluated. But even taking into account the utility
of such "resume reviews,"30 the recent experience demonstrates
that the Senate is in danger of losing its check on a President
who is intent on a Court in his own image.

         The Reagan and Bush Administrations have purposefully and
successfully placed on the Court four Justices who have joined
with Chief Justice Rehnquist to form a voting block that has
watered down the Bill of Rights, cut back the anti-discrimination
laws, and increasingly denied access to the federal courts to
those who must depend on the protections of the law. The pious
platitudes those nominees voiced before this Committee have a
hollow -- and bitter -- ring in the face of their voting records
since confirmed.

         The President has the prerogative to nominate Justices for
ideological reasons, but the Constitution permits the Supreme
Court to be so constituted only so long as the President and the
Senate jointly decide that it should be so.

        The Framers granted the Senate the power of Advice and

Consent, as Alexander Hamilton explained, to subject "the
propriety of [the President's] choice to the discussion and
determination of a different and independent body."31 The
Framers did so for two more than sufficient reasons.

         First, the Judiciary has the ultimate responsibility for
declaring the meaning and limits of the law. Its decisions will
thus determine whether Congress1 actions carry or miscarry.

         Second. the Constitution creates a dynamic governance scheme
whose driving force is a continuing creative competition between
the Legislative and Executive Branches. The Court, in turn,
elaborates the detailed rules of that competition out of the
Constitution's text and its plan. This system of checks and
balances is threatened if the Judicial Branch is the handmaiden
of the Executive.

        As Professor Charles Black demonstrated two decades ago,
given the paramount importance of these functions, the Senate's
role in passing on Supreme Court nominees is not merely "to
screen[] out proven malefactors," but to determine whether a
nominee's "service on the Bench will hurt the country." On r
reaching such a determination, "the Senatfe] can do right only by
treating this judgment ... as a satisfactory basis in itself for
a negative vote."32

        Grover Rees put the same point this way: "The responsibility

of the Senate to choose good Supreme Court Justices is just as
great as that of the President;" thus "nobody should be appointed
to the Court unless the President and a majority of Senators
believes he would be a good Justice..."33

        The AFL-CIO does not believe that the Senate should
acquiesce to the President in his plan to make the Supreme Court
the preserve of the Republican Party's far right wing.

        We believe this Committee and the Senate have both the right
and the ty to confirm only a nominee of the highest attainments
whose r rd and testimony together establish a commitment to
what is ist in the law. We believe that this Committee must act
to preserve the Senate's constitutional prerogatives in this
regard. If a nominee is not required to demonstrate unquestioned
accomplishments and is not required to state his approach to and
his understanding of the law, what basis remains for an informed
and intelligent Senate judgment?

         Only by rejecting the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to
the Sup. ne Court will this Committee restore the confirmation
process to its proper place in the constitutional scheme and put
a halt to the Administration's cynical "tell them nothing"
strategy; a strategy that threatens to drain the Senate's role in
the process of all meaning.

   Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Kirkland.
   Mr. Kirkland, in 1988 when the committee was considering the
nomination of Justice Kennedy, you wrote Chairman Biden of your
organization's concerns with the nomination. You said at that time,
and I quote: "In a number of areas of critical concern to working
people, Judge Kennedy's record on the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Ninth Circuit is quite troubling, and his record is only
somewhat reassuring in other areas." You went on to say that "he
has shown only a limited appreciation of the legitimate needs and
aspirations of women, of minorities, and of the other members of
this society who over the years have been denied equal rights and
opportunities." And yet in that statement you urged that Justice
Kennedy be confirmed.

  So what are the differences this time?
  Mr. KIRKLAND. The differences this time, Mr. Chairman, are
matters to some extent of degree. We had differences, of course,
with the positions that typified Justice Kennedy's history, but we
must acknowledge that those differences still left him within the
spectrum of differences of a variety that don't dictate or urge us or
compel us to oppose his nomination.
  We believe that Judge Thomas' record is outside of that spec-
trum. And I think the fact that we did not oppose and in fact sup-
ported the confirmation of Justice Kennedy demonstrates quite
fully that we do not go into taking such a position casually or with-
out considerable concern and study and reluctance.
  I think it demonstrates that our forbearance in these matters is
very considerable, and perhaps in the light of Justice Kennedy's
subsequent position on the court, perhaps that forbearance was
misguided. We do not always do those things that we ought to have
done; we sometimes do those things we ought not to have done,
being human.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much.
  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Kirkland, we are glad to have you here.
I have no questions. Thank you.
  Mr. KIRKLAND. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator KOHL. Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I too want to join in welcoming Lane Kirkland, who speaks for
working men and women all over this country. We are fortunate to
have a leader of working men and women prepared to take posi-
tions on many of the important issues of our time that affect work-
ing men and women.
  I am interested in why you think that the interests or the rights
of working men and women might be threatened with Judge
Thomas on the court. Is it perhaps the way that he views various
statutes and construes them in an apparently extremely narrow
way? I won't ask you about his statements opposing minimum
wage or Davis-Bacon or parental leave, or his recommendation ac-
tually for the abolition of the Labor Department, the Agriculture
Department--an agriculture department that looks after a number
of different programs, but certainly health and safety issues, in
terms of food supply, obviously, and a wide range of different issues
including occupational health and safety.
                                         659

  Do you draw from the range of different comments on a wide va-
riety of different economic issues that Judge Thomas would not
provide the kinds of protections for working men and women that
you think should be at least evidenced by a nominee to the highest
court of the land?

  Mr. KIRKLAND. His record, as we have found it on the record
over a significant period of time and up until very recently, has
been one of consistent expressed and strongly expressed hostility to
the pattern of laws and social and economic programs that have
been developed in this country through experience and after con-
siderable sacrifice, and after disasters have occurred and proven
their necessity. His record in that regard has been consistent, and I
have no reason to believe that they do not represent his deeply-
held views.

  I cannot believe that they were simply opportunistic expressions
designed for a particular audience.

  Senator KENNEDY. SO you think that his expressions about enti-
tlements, for example, his opposition to the economic interests of
working men and women, and his expressions about, as you point
out, hostility in terms of a wide range of different legislative initia-
tives to try and provide some degree of economic justice, you think
that the correct interpretation of those statutes--not so much with
regard to this particular question about the constitutionality of
them--most of them obviously have been upheld from the constitu-
tional point of view--but there are going to be many statutes that
affect working men and women that are going to be interpreted by
the court over the period of the next 10 or 15 years, and it is diffi-
cult for me to read the past statements that he has made in terms
of the economic rights that would protect working men and women
and not feel that his construction of those particular statutes that
are passed to protect the economic interests of working men and
women would not be threatened.

  I have no further questions. I thank the chair.
  Senator KOHL. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Kirkland, one of the questioning areas that I pursued with
Judge Thomas involved a bitterly contested dispute with a labor
union in New York City, Local 28 trade union. It was a case which
arose back in 1964 when the New York Human Relations Commis-
sion complained about discriminatory practices in hiring with the
union. They went through a series of court tests with the district
court, finding the union discriminating and then in contempt and
being upheld by the court of appeals, and more contempt citations,
and finally more than 20 years later, getting to the U.S. Supreme
Court. The EEOC during the period of chairmanship of Judge
Thomas came in on behalf of the union in that case, and the record
is not clear whether that was the solicitor's view or whether it was
the view of the commission. But EEOC came in on behalf of the
union, contending that there ought not to be a remedy which
would correct discrimination other than against the specific indi-
viduals who were discriminated against, and it should not be di-
rected to put the class in a position that it would have been but for
historical discrimination.
                                                    660

   I don't want to get involved in too many hyper-technicalities, and
I don't

   Mr. KIRKLAND. I understand the principle that you are address-
ing, Senator Specter.

   Senator SPECTER. Excuse me?
   Mr. KIRKLAND. I understand the principle that you are talking
about and the issue.
   Senator SPECTER. I would be interested in your view as to wheth-
er Judge Thomas was right or wrong in that case when he sided
with Local 28 of the building trades union in New York.
  Mr. KIRKLAND. In my view, he was wrong, sir. And this goes to a
very basic proposition. I think the AFL-CIO can fairly claim a con-
siderable share of the authorship of title VII of the Civil Rights
Act. In fact, in 1963, I have a rather vivid memory of going to the
White House. I was then assistant to George Meany, and he was
out of the country, and he called from abroad and said he had had
a call and that I should go over, together with our legislative direc-
tor, who at that time was Andrew Behmiller.

  The civil rights law was in the process of being drafted, and it
was before it was passed by the Congress. President Kennedy at
that time was concerned that the balance in the Congress was so
narrow that to incorporate title VII in it at that stage might have
doomed the legislation.

  The AFL-CIO, the trade union movement, supported Title VII
very strongly. We worked very closely with the NAACP, and I
recall with Clarence Mitchell particularly, in drafting it and in
putting it together, and we insisted on its inclusion, over some con-
siderable countervailing pressures. It was subsequently enacted--
because of the change in climate, I think it was problematical
whether it could have passed in 1963--it was enacted, and the emo-
tions of the time following the assassination of President Kennedy
I think was a major component of it. But that was the key guts
part of that Civil Rights Act, and it was the insistence of the AFL-
CIO and of its leadership at that time that that provision should
apply with equal force to both trade unions and to employers; that
trade unions actually needed the support of that legislation, being
democratic bodies, to help them take the right position in support
of comprehensive efforts to eliminate employment discrimination.

  That is our history. It is an established fact. And that is our posi-
tion today.

  Now, this debate as to whether that act as tendered was only to
apply to ex post factor acts of discrimination against particular in-
dividuals, or whether it contemplates and supports and calls for
more comprehensive acts both to assure against continued discrimi-
nation in the future or to remedy past discrimination, is a very
central issue, and it applies not only to the Civil Rights Act and to
employment discrimination but against one's vision of society and
one's attitude toward the role of Government and of efforts to cure
basic lingering social problems generally.

  There are many, many people in this world who are very kind
and forthcoming and compassionate about the problems of individ-
uals, particular individuals, but who take a wholly different view
when the subject is measured to address the problems of masses of
                                      661

individuals or individuals as a class where they may be totally re-
sistant and in opposition to that.

  It is our strong view that these wholesale problems must be ad-
dressed in a wholesale way and not in a retail way, one by one. If it
is done one by one, singly, after proven particularized cases of
abuse have happened, and the remedy addresses only that case, no
social problem will ever be competently addressed. And that ap-
plies to a whole range of issues, including all relations between the
labor and management and the contest or the frequent tension be-
tween what is called property rights and individual workers' rights
and human rights.

  I don't know if I have answered it satisfactorily, sir, but that is
my very strong view on it.

  Senator SPECTER. I think you have answered it eloquently, Mr.
Kirkland. I take it you are not only against Judge Thomas but
against Local 28 in that particular circumstance.

  Let me wrap up with one question which has quite a number of
components

  Mr. KIRKLAND. And I trust that our learned counsel did not
appear as a part in that case.

   Mr. GOLD. NO.

  Senator SPECTER. Let me ask you one other question--and I can
only ask the question and then leave, Mr. Kirkland, because we
have about 4 minutes left in this 15-minute rollcall vote, but I will
study your answer with care in the transcript.

  You have been very emphatic in your statement that you oppose
Judge Thomas and the efforts to put "nine persons who have the
virtual power by interpretation to rewrite the Constitution for our
times, the unchallenged preserve of a narrow and privileged seg-
ment of American opinion". My question to you--and this is more
than one, but as I said, I'm going to have to wrap it up because we
have to go vote--is how important is it in your view to have an
African-American on the court? Others have testified, African-
Americans have, that they prefer to have someone not African-
American advancing their values as opposed to having someone
who is African-American. But how important is it to have an Afri-
can-American in your opinion on the court in the context of wheth-
er a replacement will do better than carry on the ideas which you
disagree with as an appointee of this President?

  Mr. KIRKLAND. Senator, I would be delighted if the Supreme
Court were broadly representative of the entire spectrum of Ameri-
can society. I think it is rather outrageous that over so many years,
there has been no representative of the black community on the
Supreme Court, and then only one; and then that he should be re-
placed by a person whose views are so diametrically opposed, I be-
lieve, to the measures that have been designed in this country to
address the problems of the afflicted and the underprivileged, and
who has elected to align himself with the forces of privilege and of
power in this country.

  I believe that consideration overrides the question of ethnic rep-
resentation. I would be delighted and I would support a Court
made up of five, six, seven, eight or nine black Americans drawn
from what is now a considerable body of distinguished jurists who
are black and who represent within their views the spectrum of
                                                662

opinion in society and who embody the possibility that those views,
affecting everyone, of every race, creed, color and previous condi-
tion of servitude, are adequately and thoroughly debated.

  Now, I firmly believe that the forces on that court whose deci-
sions on issue after issue, and in controversy after controversy, are
absolutely predictable and are becoming more predictable, I am
quite confident, regrettably, that if Judge Thomas is appointed to
that Supreme Court that he will join that group whose anticipated
positions on these issues will be highly predictable. And I do not
think that is good for the country or for the court.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Kirkland.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator Heflin [presiding]. I have taken over as presiding officer
due to the fact that there is a vote on the floor of the Senate and
others have gone. I went and voted early and got back.
  As I understand it, there are a group of Congressmen who are
here that Chairman Biden wants to accommodate because they
have duties in the House of Representatives. But he wants to be
here when they start, and he should be back momentarily, in the
next minute or 2, but since I have been requested to do it, I will
declare about a 3- to 4-minute recess at this time, and we'll resume
very shortly and proceed with the congressional group from the

             Mr. Chairman and members of the Judiciary Committee, I
am honored to be submitting this statement to you. I am
especially honored to be submitting a statement to a committee
whose membership includes the distinguished senior Senator from
Alabama, who is a former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme
Court and who has served my state and our country so well for
so many years.

             Let me begin by saying that the confirmation of Judge
Clarence Thomas should not be a partisan political issue. I am
a lifelong Democrat and a former member of the Alabama
Democratic Executive Committee. I was elected to my present
office after defeating a Republican, who is now Chairman of the
Alabama Republican Party, in the general election last year. I
am a Democrat in every sense of the word, but there are some
things that are too important for partisan politics, and the
confirmation of Judge Thomas is one of those.

56-271 O--93 22

            As chief law enforcement officer for the State of
Alabama, I know that there is no greater problem facing America
today than the problem of violent crime. Judge Thomas
understands that. In his earlier public statements he has said
that the number one priority in our inner cities ought to be
controlling crime, and he is absolutely right. It used to be
that in many of our cities it was not safe to be on the streets
at night. Now, it is becoming unsafe to be on those streets
even in broad daylight.

            Judge Thomas has also previously spoken publicly of the
totalitarianism of criminals and how crime robs us of our
freedoms. Again, he is absolutely right. Much has been said
in these hearings, and rightfully so, about the cherished
freedoms that are ours as Americans to enjoy. However, we
should never forget that a murder victim has no freedom, and a
rape victim is condemned to living under the tyranny of fear.
An essay on freedom rings hollow to a mother, living in a
housing project, whose children have to dodge stray bullets on
the playground. One of the most important civil rights is the
right to be free from fear in our homes, in our streets, and in
our schools and places of worship. Millions of Americans are
being denied that civil right.

            In the face of all of this, a national association of
special interest attorneys, who represent criminals, has
criticized Judge Thomas because they say his opinions show a
"cold indifference." I can assure you that the last thing we
                                     665

need on the Supreme Court is a judge who has warm and sensitive
feelings toward drug traffickers, murderers, and rapists. I
know from reviewing Judge Thomas' opinions and from his public
comments that he is sensitive to the interests of law
enforcement and to the rights of the victims of crime. He is
fair and unbiased, and we need him on the Supreme Court.

            This opinion is not just my opinion. It is the view of
the law enforcement community in America. Let me give you some
examples from my state. Judge Thomas has been endorsed by the
Alabama District Attorneys Association, by the Alabama Sheriffs
Association, by the Alabama State Troopers Association, by the
Alabama State Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, and by
the Metropolitan Criminal Justice Executive Association. He
has also been endorsed by twelve Alabama black community
leaders in the law enforcement area, whose number includes
state and federal law enforcement officials.

            Mrs. Miriam Shehane is the President of Victims of Crime
and Leniency, or V.O.C.A.L., which is Alabama's largest
victims' rights organization. In her letter endorsing Judge
Thomas, Mrs. Shehane pointed out something that I was reminded
of when I came into this building today. She pointed out that
those who work in this building are protected by metal
detectors and guards. As Senators, you also enjoy under
federal law special protection from violent attacks upon you.
If you are the victim of violence, all the force of the federal
government will be brought to bear in apprehending and
                                    666

punishing the criminal. Mrs. Shehane said that was as it
should be, and I agree. We want you to be safe.

            However, as she pointed out, there are millions of
Americans who do not have the special protection that you
enjoy. They are dependent upon the criminal justice system for
their protection. What they need is a judiciary that will be
as concerned with protecting the lives and interests of
innocent citizens as it is with protecting those of criminals.
The confirmation of Judge Thomas will be an important step in
the right direction. On behalf of law enforcement, and on
behalf of the law-abiding citizens of Alabama and of the entire
country, I urge you to vote to confirm Judge Thomas.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I say to our colleagues from the other
body, welcome. Maybe it is more often from your perspective than
you would like to think that you have had to come over here and
sit around and just wait, and I appreciate it very much. I hope my
colleagues understand that we have not been able to, with great
precision, indicate when any one panel would be up.

  And I want to thank my Republican friends on the committee be-
cause we have been going back and forth, a pro panel, a negative
panel, a pro again, et cetera. But understanding the incredible con-
straints on the time of each of our five colleagues from the House
side, our Republican friends have agreed to take out of order in the
sense that we would have two pro panels in a row.

  And we have a genuine array of talent, and also of power on the
House side. It is not often we get you before us like this to have all
of you there. We are going to keep you 5 or 6 hours, ask you a lot
of questions about things that don't have anything to do with this
nomination, and I am going to put Conyers under oath and make
sure we find out what we do on some of this stuff. He is the tough-
est ally and toughest opponent on the Judiciary Committee. I know
it is not going anywhere unless I get his agreement before it goes.

  But at any rate, testifying are the Honorable John Conyers, Jr.,
from Detroit, MI, representing the 1st District; the Honorable
Louis Stokes from Shaker Heights, OH, representing the 21st Dis-
trict; the Honorable Major Owens from Brooklyn, NY, representing
the 12th District of New York; the Honorable Craig A. Washington
from Houston, TX, representing the 18th District; and the Honora-
ble John Lewis from Atlanta, GA, representing Georgia's 5th
District.

  Gentlemen, we are indeed honored to have you here and we
know how difficult it is for your time because you have equally as
many calls upon your time as any member of this committee. Obvi-
ously, it is important to you or you wouldn't be here.

  Let me yield to the panel and suggest however you all would like
to begin, it is up to you. Do you have any preferred order of who
would go first?

   Mr. CONYERS. NO.

  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Congressman Conyers, welcome, and
we are anxious to hear what you have to say.

STATEMENTS OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF HON. JOHN CONYERS,
  A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF
  MICHIGAN; HON. LOUIS STOKES, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CON-
  GRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO; HON. MAJOR OWENS, A REP-
  RESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK;
  HON. CRAIG WASHINGTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
  FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS; AND HON. JOHN LEWIS, A REPRE-
  SENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA, ON
  BEHALF OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS

   Mr. CONYERS. Thank you very much, Chairman Biden. It is a
pleasure and honor for us to appear here today. We represent here,
with myself and Louis Stokes and Major Owens, Craig Washington
and John Lewis, the Congressional Black Caucus, which was estab-
                                      668

lished 21 years ago to protect and advance the interests of African-
Americans here in Congress.

  We have been democratically chosen to represent the views of
our constituents for quite a number of years. We chair 5 full com-
mittees and 13 subcommittees, and we come here today as a group
sorry to report that our assessment of Judge Thomas' stewardship
of key agencies administering civil rights laws is that he has
flunked the test.

  The record is clear. While at EEOC, the Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission, Judge Thomas was, in fact, a lawless admin-
istrator, failing to enforce civil rights laws and substituting his own
vision for civil rights enforcement. This has been documented in
his extraordinary 56 appearances before the Congress. Most of
these appearances were controversial, and much of the record ex-
pressed exasperation of members of House committees with his ad-
ministration of the law, as documented in the several General Ac-
counting Office reports on his stewardship.

  There are several major issues. One is the issue of credibility,
and let me get straight to the point. You are confronted with the
dilemma of the enigma of Clarence Thomas. Is he the pugnacious
conservative who didn't hesitate to espouse his hostility to tradi-
tional civil rights remedies, his support for natural law, his opposi-
tion to abortion, his contempt for Congress? Or he is really the
moderate trying to get confirmed to the Supreme Court who is re-
treating from virtually every controversial statement that he has
ever made?

  It is an important issue, this one of credibility. He couldn't re-
member personally ever engaging in a discussion about Roe v.
Wade since 1972. However, in 1987, in a news article in the Chica-
go Defender, Judge Thomas stated that there was a tremendous
overlap of the conservative Republican agenda and black beliefs on
abortion, however incorrect that statement may be.

  In the 1989 Harvard Journal of Law on Public Policy, in a cri-
tique of judicial activism he wrote that the current case provoking
the most protest from conservatives is Roe v. Wade. Is it credible,
then, to believe that he has never discussed this case?

  On the issue of the South Africa connection, he told the commit-
tee that he was not aware of the representation of South Africa by
Mr. Jay Parker, a friend whom he has described as a mentor or
hero. But Newsday has reported that in an EEOC staff meeting in
1986, Judge Thomas entered the meeting with a newspaper outlin-
ing Parker's relationship with South Africa and discussed for 45
minutes the representation of South Africa by Parker.

  In 1987, again, according to the Foreign Agents Registration Act,
Judge Thomas attended a dinner for the South African ambassador
arranged by Mr. Parker's agency to permit the Ambassador to in-
fluence Judge Thomas and other black officials. If Parker was at
the dinner, the act requires that Parker inform Thomas that
Parker was a paid agent, and I think this issue deserves quite a bit
more attention.

  There is the whole question of stonewalling before this commit-
tee. We have the additional issue of the attack on equal employ-
ment opportunity and affirmative action. We are dealing here with
a nominee who has literally no private legal experience. He has
                                      669

only 18 months on the bench, and the most that we have from his
record is about 9 years in the executive branch. We ask that our
statement be incorporated and reproduced fully into the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be.
  Mr. CONYERS. Thank you. We go to the heart of this matter of his
resistance not only before the congressional committees, but even
before courts where he was brought for noncompliance. The Gener-
al Accounting Office has documented very critically many of the
acts that he has committed that resist the implementation of law
and lead us to conclude that we might not be safe with him as a
guardian of those laws that seek enforcement derived from the
Constitution.
  I close on this point, many have dwelled on the fact that he is an
African-American nominee. I would like to point out to you that if,
contrary to the views of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Pro-
gressive Baptist Church organization, the Convention of Baptist Or-
ganizations, the NAACP, State black caucuses of elected officials,
the labor movement which includes many African-American lead-
ers--if he were to go on the bench, it is unlikely that any adminis-
tration within our lifetime would appoint another African-Ameri-
can jurist to this high post.
  And so we come here to ask you to apply the same standards
that we had to apply. This debate has elevated the critical evalua-
tion of blacks in America about how we choose to support our lead-
ers, and it seems to me that we have made this decision without
reference to his race. We come to this conclusion independently,
and we urge, as a result of our examination of the record, our expe-
riences with him as members of Congress, that you very definitely
reject the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas.
  Thank you very much for this opportunity.

                          OH THB MOMXMATION OF JUDQB CLARENCE THOMAS

              AS ASSOCIATE JUSTZCI OF THB UNITED STATES 8UPRKKB COURT

              The Congressional Blade Caucus was established twenty-one
      years ago to protect and advance the interests of African
      Americans here in Congress. We have been democratically chosen
      to represent the views of African Americans themselves. As
      Members of the House we are highly sensitive to the views of our
      constituents, who get unusually frequent opportunities to inform
      us of their opinions.

              Our members include the chairs of five full committees and
      the chairs of thirteen subcommittees. We have exercised close
      oversight over the implementation of civil rights laws. I am
      sorry to report that our assessment of Judge Thomas's stewardship
      of key agencies administering these laws, is that Judge Thomas
      has flunked the test.

               The record is clear, while at EEOC Judge Thomas was a
      lawless administrator, failing to enforce civil rights laws, and
      substituting his own vision of civil rights enforcement. This has
      been documented in his extraordinary 56 appearances before
      Congress. Most of these appearances were controversial and much
      of the record expressed exasperation of the members of House
      Committees with his administration of the law, as documented by
      several GAO reports on his stewardship.

      THE CASK OF THB TWO CLARENCES': AH ISSUE OF CREDIBILITY
               Let me get straight to the point. The members of this

      committee are confronted with a dilemma. Clarence Thomas is an
      enigma. Is he the pugnacious conservative who did not hesitate
      to espouse his hostility to traditional civil rights remedies,
      his support for natural law, opposition to abortion and his
      contempt for Congress? Or is he really the moderate trying to
      get confirmed to the Supreme Court, who is retreating from
      virtually every controversialstatement he ever made? It is an
      important issue of credibility.

               Clarence Thomas testified that "I cannot remember personally
      engaging" in any discussion about Roe v. Wade and "I do not have
      a personal opinion on the outcome in Roe v. Wade." However, in
      1987 in the Chicago Defender, Judge Thomas stated that there was
      "tremendous overlap of the conservative Republican agenda and
      Black beliefs on abortion". In the 1989 Harvard Journal of Law
      and Public Policy in a critique of so-called judicial activism,
      Clarence Thomas wrote that "the current case provoking the most
      protest from conservatives is Roe v. Wade." Is it credible to
      believe then that Clarence Thomas never discussed Roe v. Wade?

                                                     MORE
                              671

        Concerning the Grlaas decision. Thomas declared:
        "We have permitted sociological and demographic realities
        to be manipulated to the point of surreality by convenient
        legal theories such as adverse impact."

        These are not the comments of a reasoned jurist who happens
to have a different point of view on affirmative action. They
are the comments of a man whose imprudent remarks could destroy
the delicate fabric of racial tolerance we have carefully
developed in the country.

ATTACK OH THB VOTXHQ RIGHTS ACT
        Clarence Thomas has demonstrated a hostility to the one law

which is most responsible for most members of the Congressional
Black Caucus, the Voting Rights Act.

        Judge Thomas in a fundamental misunderstanding of the law
attacked the Voting Rights Act in a speech at the Tocqueville
Forum in April 18, 1988, saying:

        "Many of the Court's decisions in the area of voting rights
        have presupposed that blacks, whites, Hispanics, and other
        ethnic groups will inevitably vote in blocs."

   This is simply untrue. As members of this committee know our
intent was that the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate
racial bloc voting does occur, as several cases, most notably
Thornbura v. Ginalea. have affirmed.

        He has also criticized the effects test in the Voting Rights
Act as unacceptable. This test has formed the cornerstone of the
Voting Rights Act, and is largely responsible for the increase in
the number of black elected officials around the country.

FAXLUBH TO KHFORCB THB LAW AT H O C
        This committee is aware that while Clarence Thomas was

chairman of the EEOC over 13,000 age discrimination cases were
not investigated within the two year statute of limitations
period. As a result, older workers lost their right to pursue
their claims in court. I would like to briefly talk about one
important episode on this issue since it was investigated by one
of the subcommittees of the House Government Operations Committee
which I chair.

        The head of the St. Louis EEOC office, Lynn Bruner,
commented publicly in 1988 that EEOC's failure to investigate age
discrimination cases was wide spread, thus allowing these cases
to lapse in every EEOC district office.

        Ms. Bruner was asked to testify on this issue before the
Senate Special Committee on Aging. The night before her
testimony, she received a negative performance rating, the first
one in her career, and was specifically criticized for making
comments to the press which "present Chairman Thomas in a
negative light."

        Despite this evaluation, Ms. Bruner testified on June 23,
1988 that she had repeatedly alerted EEOC headquarters to the
urgent problem of age discrimination charges not being
investigated, however, EEOC under Clarence Thomas failed to act.
Four days after this testimony, Ms. Bruner was visited by Polly
Meade, the Director of Performance Services from EEOC
headquarters in Washington, who reported directly to Judge
Thomas. According to Ms. Bruner, Ms. Meade spoke disparagingly
of her Senate testimony, stated that she was in trouble and
intimated that Ms. Bruner would not be in her job much longer.

         It was not until two months later, when Judge Thomas was
about to be nominated for the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia, that he phoned one of my subcommittees indicating
that he had changed his mind and would withdraw the negative
evaluation.

                                                    MORE
                              672

        On the issue of South Africa, he told this committee,
"I was not aware, again, of the representation of South Africa
itself by Jay Parker." However, Hewsday has reported that at an
EEOC staff aeeting in 1986, Clarence Thomas entered the meeting
with a newspaper article outlining Parker's relationship with
South Africa, and discussed for 45 minutes the representation of
South Africa by Parker, according to former Thomas aides. In
1987, according to Foreign Agents Registration Act records,
Thomas attended a dinner for the South African ambassador
arranged by Jay Parker, apparently to lobby the South African
ambassador.

        I am not here to suggest that Clarence Thomas was personally
involved in representing South Africa. However, it is beyond
belief that he was unaware that his close friend and mentor Jay
Parker was representing South Africa. What did he think he was
doing dining with the South African ambassador? Just shooting the
breeze? These are important issues of credibility.

        None of us knows which Clarence Thomas we will get on the
Supreme Court. But the stakes are too high for the committee to
roll the dice when the lives of all racial minorities in this
country hangs in the balance. If, as his view suggest, he
continues to oppose class action law suits, affirmative action,
Roe v. Wade, and the Voting Rights Act, nothing can be done once
he is on the Court for life. Now is the only time to act.

stonewalling Members of the Senate Judiciary committee
        Clarence Thomas's selective stonewalling of this Committee

threatens to undermine the integrity of the confirmation process.
Clarence Thomas says it would be inappropriate for him to discuss
a range of issues, including abortion because these issues may
come before the Court one day.

        On the other hand, he has freely offered that he has no
philosophical objections to school prayer and the death penalty.
He cannot have it both ways.

        If Judge Thomas is permitted to decide for himself which
issues he will address and which issues he will not, then the
confirmation process becomes merely window dressing for the
politically popular views of the present administration. In
addition, every other nominee from this day forward will do
exactly the same thing.

ATTACK ON EQUAL BtPLOTJODR OFPORTUMITT AMD AITXBlfATXVB ACTION
        Judge Thomas refuses to recognize that civil rights is now a

systemic problem that requires systemic solutions like
affirmative action. Yet, the most disturbing aspect of Judge
Thomas's opposition to affirmaMQiS action is that he has
challenged the Constitutional authority and the integrity of the
Congress to even consider affirmative action and other solutions
to remedying the widespread discrimination that continues to
exist in this country.

        In the Fullilove decision, upholding Congress's effort to
provide a remedy for the longstanding exclusion of minorities
from opportunities to become government contractors, Thomas said:

        "Not that there is a great deal of principle in Congress
         itself. What can one expect of a Congress that would pass
        the ethnic set-aside law the Court upheld in Fullilove v.
        Klutznick."

        Regarding affirmative action generally, Thomas stated:
         "It is just as insane for blacks to expect relief from
        the Federal government for years of discrimination as it is
        to expect a mugger to nurse his victims back to health.
        Ultimately, the burden of being mugged falls on you."
             673

        The Senate Special Committee on Aging Report found that:
                 "The EEOC misled the Congress and the public on the
                 extent to which ADEA charges had been permitted to
                 exceed the statute of limitations."

        Senator Pryor, the current Chairman of the Committee, made
it clear that the misrepresentations were those of Clarence
Thomas, by stating, "I was dismayed to learn about several
erroneous statements made by Chairman Thomas...Those statements
are certainly misleading..."

        Judge Thomas's actions at EEOC illustrate his lack of
commitment to First Amendment, to protecting whistleblowers, to
protecting victims of age discrimination, and enforcing our equal
opportunity laws. The conclusion that we are compelled to reach
is that Judge Thomas has failed to carry out the constitutional
obligation of members of the Executive Branch to "take care that
the laws are faithfully executed" and that he exhibited a
pervasive disrespect for Congress and the legislative process.

        Finally, let me say that Clarence Thomas's past record and
his stated views are threats to the best interests of African
Americans. We do not oppose Judge Thomas for any other reason
than his record. I opposed Judges Haynsworth, Carswell, Boric,
and Kennedy -- not because of their race, but because they
espoused a judicial philosophy which if implemented would reverse
civil rights progress we have made in this country over the last
three decades.

        similarly, you should not support a nominee merely because
they are black. The issue is not race but merit. On the merits,
Thomas should be rejected.

                   STATEMENT OF HON. LOUIS STOKES

  Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I also
deem it a pleasure and an honor to appear before you this after-
noon.

  Our appearance here today, while born in necessity, is also born
in pain. When Judge Thomas shared with you the touching experi-
ence of his boyhood in Pin Point, GA, he evoked in each of us the
memory of similar boyhoods in our own families.

  While we were not born in Pin Point, we share with him the like
and similar circumstances of ill-housing, poverty, mothers who
were maids, and grandparents without whom we or our mothers
could not have made it.

  Not just Judge Thomas and members of the Congressional Black
Caucus have shared this common experience. A majority of black
Americans who have achieved in this society have shared both the
poverty, segregation and the racial indignities which emotionally
overcame Judge Thomas when he testified.

  The difference between Judge Thomas and most black Americans
who have achieved, in spite of poverty, adversity, and racism, is
that most of them have not forgotten from whence they have come.
Whenever possible, they have used their educations and positions
of achievement to help eliminate from our society these barriers to
equal opportunity, liberty, and justice. It is almost unheard of to
see them utilize their educations and positions to impede the
progress of those less fortunate than they.

  When Justice Thurgood Marshall retired, Chairman Biden was
quoted as saying, and I quote,

  The Supreme Court has lost a historic Justice, a hero for all time. I hope the
President will nominate a replacement who is worthy of this great man's place in
the Court and in our hearts.

  As African-Americans, we not only wanted to see another worthy
person replace him; we wanted to see another qualified black
American replace him. Justice Thurgood Marshall is a legend in
America. As the NAACP's top lawyer, he traveled the length and
breadth of this Nation, winning hundreds of civil rights victories in
one courtroom after another.

  He was America's greatest constitutional lawyer, having won 29
of 32 cases he argued in the U.S. Supreme Court. Each case he won
whittled away at some barrier to equality and justice confronting
African-Americans. As NAACP lawyer, solicitor general, judge of
the court of appeals, and Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Mar-
shall became a giant in American law.

  I said to you earlier that our appearance here, while born in ne-
cessity, is also born in pain. We are pained because as much as we
would like to see the diversity that another black American would
bring to the Court, Judge Thomas is not the man.

  Our opposition to Judge Thomas does not derive from his being
in a different political party. Indeed, we expect the President to
nominate a person from his own party. In fact, a well-respected Re-
publican, Gary Franks, is a member of the Congressional Black
Caucus.
                                             675

  We do not believe or expect that ideological conformity or strate-
gic agreement is required of African-Americans in public service.
What is required in our fight for justice is a demonstrated commit-
ment to the broad, bipartisan approaches that have been adopted
by Republicans, Democrats, blacks, whites, Hispanics, women, and
many others alike.

  The record of Judge Thomas shows a firm and consistent opposi-
tion to many of those things our people need most urgently. We
cannot ignore or excuse Clarence Thomas' record, views, and
values merely because he is an African-American. His view of con-
stitutional rights, as he has articulated them as jurist, administra-
tor and before the nation's press, are inconsistent with the inter-
ests of the people we serve.

  Americans, in general, cannot afford to invest their future in the
hope that Clarence Thomas will change once he sits on the Su-
preme Court. We would not be credible if we had a standard built
upon the race of the nominee. We believe that the same standard
must be applied to Thomas that we applied to Robert Bork when
we opposed his nomination.

  As Members of Congress, we know Judge Thomas and we know
his record. He has testified before congressional committees more
than 50 times. Most of his appearances were controversial and
much of it expressed the exasperation of House committees with
his administration of the law.

  How Judge Thomas has viewed his legal responsibilities in the
past is the best evidence of how he would perform as a Supreme
Court Justice. The conclusion we have reached is that Judge
Thomas failed over that period of time to carry out the constitu-
tional obligation of members of the executive branch to take care
that the laws are faithfully executed and that he exhibited a perva-
sive disrespect for Congress and for the legislative process.

  Our conclusion, which is amply supported by the evidence, is
that his 9 years in the executive branch is almost all of the experi-
ence that Clarence Thomas has to offer in support of the proposi-
tion that he is qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. Far from as-
sisting his candidacy, the performance of Judge Thomas as a Feder-
al official provides powerful reasons why he should not be con-
firmed.

  In asking you to reject his nomination, we must ask you to hold
President Bush to the same standard demonstrated by President
Lyndon Banes Johnson, who, when the time came for a black ap-
pointee to the Court, nominated the best constitutional lawyer in
America. Moreover, his nominee had a demonstrated commitment
to the values of this Nation in protecting the less fortunate in our
society. Judge Thomas does not meet this criteria.

  I thank you.

                               REMARKS OF
           THE HONORABLE LOUIS STOKES (D-OH)

                               BEFORE THE
                      UNITED STATES SENATE
                 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS ON JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS

                        SEPTEMBER 19, 1991
                                  677

        MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I ALSO DEEM IT
A PLEASURE TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU THIS AFTERNOON. OUR APPEARANCE
HERE TODAY, WHILE BORNE IN NECESSITY, IS ALSO BORNE IN PAIN.

         WHEN JUDGE THOMAS SHARED WITH YOU THE TOUCHING EXPERIENCE
OF HIS BOYHOOD IN PINPOINT, GEORGIA, HE EVOKED IN EACH OF US THE
MEMORY OF SIMILAR BOYHOODS IN OUR OWN FAMILIES. WHILE WE
WEREN'T BORN IN PINPOINT, WE SHARE WITH HIM THE LIKE AND SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES OF ILL HOUSING, POVERTY, MOTHERS WHO WERE MAIDS,
AND GRANDPARENTS WITHOUT WHOM WE AND OUR MOTHERS COULD NOT HAVE
MADE IT.

         NOT JUST JUDGE THOMAS AND MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL
BLACK CAUCUS HAVE SHARED THIS COMMON EXPERIENCE. THE MAJORITY
OF BLACK AMERICANS WHO HAVE ACHIEVED IN THIS SOCIETY HAVE SHARED
                                     678

BOTH THE POVERTY, SEGREGATION AND THE RACIAL INDIGNITIES WHICH
EMOTIONALLY OVERCAME JUDGE THOMAS WHEN HE TESTIFIED. THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JUDGE THOMAS AND MOST BLACK AMERICANS WHO
HAVE ACHIEVED IN SPITE OF POVERTY, ADVERSITY AND RACISM IS THAT
MOST OF THEM HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN FROM WHENCE THEY HAVE COME.

         WHENEVER POSSIBLE, THEY HAVE USED THEIR EDUCATIONS AND
POSITIONS OF ACHIEVEMENT TO HELP ELIMINATE FROM OUR SOCIETY
THESE BARRIERS TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, LIBERTY AND JUSTICE. IT IS
ALMOST UNHEARD OF TO SEE THEM UTILIZE THEIR EDUCATIONS AND
POSITIONS TO IMPEDE THE PROGRESS OF THOSE LESS FORTUNATE THAN
THEY.

        WHEN JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL RETIRED, SENATOR BIDEN WAS
QUOTED AS SAYING, "THE SUPREME COURT HAS LOST A HISTORIC
                                     679

JUSTICE -- A HERO FOR ALL TIMES. I HOPE THE PRESIDENT WILL
NOMINATE A REPLACEMENT WHO IS WORTHY OF THIS GREAT MAN'S PLACE
IN THE COURT AND IN OUR HEARTS.'

         AS AFRICAN AMERICANS WE NOT ONLY WANTED TO SEE ANOTHER
WORTHY PERSON REPLACE HIM, WE WANTED TO SEE ANOTHER QUALIFIED
BLACK AMERICAN REPLACE HIM. JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL IS A
LEGEND IN AMERICA. AS THE NAACP'S TOP LAWYER, HE TRAVELLED THE
LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THIS NATION WINNING HUNDREDS OF CIVIL
RIGHTS VICTORIES IN ONE COURTROOM AFTER ANOTHER.

         HE WAS AMERICA'S GREATEST CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER, HAVING
WON 29 OF THE 32 CASES HE ARGUED IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME
COURT. EACH CASE HE WON WHITTLED AWAY AT SOME BARRIER TO
EQUALITY AND JUSTICE CONFRONTING AFRICAN AMERICANS. AS NAACP
                                     680

LAWYER, SOLICITOR GENERAL, JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEALS, AND
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, THURGOOD MARSHALL BECAME A GIANT IN
AMERICAN LAW.

         I SAID TO YOU EARLIER THAT OUR APPEARANCE HERE, WHILE BORNE
IN NECESSITY, IS ALSO BORNE IN PAIN. WE ARE PAINED BECAUSE AS
MUCH AS WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DIVERSITY THAT ANOTHER BLACK
AMERICAN WOULD BRING TO THE COURT, JUDGE THOMAS IS NOT THE MAN.

         OUR OPPOSITION TO JUDGE THOMAS IS NOT DERIVED FROM HIS
BEING IN A DIFFERENT POLITICAL PARTY. INDEED, WE EXPECT THE
PRESIDENT TO NOMINATE A PERSON FROM HIS OWN PARTY. IN FACT, A
WELL RESPECTED REPUBLICAN, GARY FRANKS, IS A MEMBER OF THE
CONGRESSIONALBLACK CAUCUS.

        WE DO NOT BELIEVE OR EXPECT THAT IDEOLOGICAL CONFORMITY OR
                                     681

STRATEGIC AGREEMENT IS REQUIRED OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN PUBLIC
SERVICE.

         WHAT IS REQUIRED IN OUR FIGHT FOR JUSTICE IS A DEMONSTRATED
COMMITMENT TO THE BROAD BI-PARTISAN APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN
ADOPTED BY REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, BLACKS, WHITES, HISPANICS,
WOMEN AND MANY OTHERS ALIKE.

         THE RECORD OF JUDGE THOMAS SHOWS HIS FIRM AND CONSISTENT
OPPOSITION TO MANY OF THOSE THINGS OUR PEOPLE NEED MOST
URGENTLY. WE CANNOT IGNORE OR EXCUSE CLARENCE THOMAS' RECORD,
VIEWS, AND VALUES MERELY BECAUSE HE IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN.

         HIS VIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AS HE HAS ARTICULATED
THEM AS JURIST, ADMINISTRATOR AND BEFORE THE NATION'S PRESS ARE
INCONSISTENT WITH THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE WE SERVE.
                                     682

AMERICANS IN GENERAL CANNOT AFFORD TO INVEST THEIR FUTURE IN THE
HOPE THAT CLARENCE THOMAS WILL CHANGE ONCE HE SITS ON THE
SUPREME COURT.

         WE WOULD NOT BE CREDIBLE IF WE HAD A STANDARD BUILT UPON
THE RACE OF THE NOMINEE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE SAME STANDARD MUST
BE APPLIED TO THOMAS THAT WE APPLIED TO ROBERT BORK WHEN WE
OPPOSED HIS NOMINATION.

         AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, WE KNOW JUDGE THOMAS AND WE KNOW
HIS RECORD. HE HAS TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES
MORE THAN 50 TIMES. MOST OF HIS APPEARANCES WERE CONTROVERSIAL
AND MUCH OF IT EXPRESSED THE EXASPERATION OF HOUSE COMMITTEES
WITH HIS ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW. HOW JUDGE THOMAS HAS VIEWED
HIS LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE PAST IS THE BEST EVIDENCE OF
                                     683

HOW HE WOULD PERFORM AS A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
         THE CONCLUSION THAT WE HAVE REACHED IS THAT JUDGE THOMAS

FAILED OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME TO CARRY OUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL
OBLIGATION OF MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO "TAKE CARE THAT
THE LAWS ARE FAITHFULLY EXECUTED" AND THAT HE EXHIBITED A
PERVASIVE DISRESPECT FOR CONGRESS AND FOR THE LEGISLATIVE
PROCESS.

         OUR CONCLUSION, WHICH IS AMPLY SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE,
IS THAT HIS NINE YEARS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS ALMOST ALL OF
THE EXPERIENCE THAT CLARENCE THOMAS HAS TO OFFER IN SUPPORT OF
THE PROPOSITION THAT HE IS QUALIFIED TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME
COURT. FAR FROM ASSISTING HIS CANDIDACY, THE PERFORMANCE OF
JUDGE THOMAS AS A FEDERAL OFFICIAL PROVIDES POWERFUL REASONS WHY
                                     684

HE SHOULD NOT BE CONFIRMED.
         IN ASKING YOU TO REJECT HIS NOMINATION, WE MUST ASK YOU TO

HOLD PRESIDENT BUSH TO THE SAME STANDARD DEMONSTRATED BY
PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON WHO WHEN TIME CAME FOR A BLACK
APPOINTEE TO THE COURT NOMINATED THE BEST CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER
IN AMERICA. MOREOVER, HIS NOMINEE HAD A DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT
TO THE VALUES OF THIS NATION IN PROTECTING THE LESS FORTUNATE IN
OUR SOCIETY. JUDGE THOMAS DOES NOT MEET THIS CRITERIA.
                                             685

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Congressman.
  Congressman Owens.

                   STATEMENT OF HON. MAJOR OWENS

  Mr. OWENS. Mr. Chairman, I also want to thank you for the op-
portunity to appear before this committee during this set of histor-
ic hearings. In the time allotted to me, Mr. Chairman, I want to
make two important points. First, Judge Thomas should not be con-
firmed because as a Federal official of the executive branch of Gov-
ernment, he consistently demonstrated an open contempt for law.
For the youth of America and all people of the world who believe
in rule by law, Judge Thomas is a monstrous negative role model.

  My second point relates to the obligation I feel to communicate
to you the deep feelings of my constituents concerning this nomi-
nee and the process which led to the placement of his name before
this committee.

  Judge Clarence Thomas is being rewarded for the loyal and obe-
dient execution of the orders of two Presidents and his political
party. In the process of carrying out those orders, Judge Thomas
has trampled on certain legal principles which are vital for the sur-
vival of our people.

  It is important that I place on the record the response of the
great majority of African-American people to his behavior and the
clever maneuvers of his sponsor, the President.

  On the matter of Judge Thomas' contempt for law, let me make
it clear that I speak from the experience of direct observation. As a
member of the Education and Labor Committee, which has over-
sight responsibility for the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, I served on numerous panels which heard testimony from
Judge Thomas.

  At this point, I would like to state for the record that there is a
voluminous set of records of hearings and General Accounting
Office reports which comprise a body of evidence too little analyzed
or referred to since Judge Thomas was nominated.

  Judge Thomas has testified before congressional committees an
extraordinary 56 times. This large number of appearances does not
simply reflect the judge's long tenure. Very little of Clarence
Thomas' congressional oversight testimony was mere reporting or
was otherwise routine. Most of it was controversial and much of it
expressed the exasperation of House committees with his adminis-
tration of the law.

  In the same vein are 10 GAO reports, an unusual number, and
most of them highly critical of the nominee's administration of the
laws under his jurisdiction. It is Judge Thomas' actual professional
record while serving in the government that should count most to
the outcome of these deliberations. How Judge Thomas has viewed
his legal responsibilities in the past is the best evidence of how he
is likely to discharge them in the future.

  The conclusion that we have reached is that Judge Thomas failed
over that period of time to carry out the constitutional obligation
of members of the executive branch to, quote, "take care that the
laws are faithfully executed," end of quote, and that he exhibited a
pervasive disrespect for Congress and for the legislative process.
                                              686

  Our conclusion, which is amply supported by the evidence, is all
the more damning when it is recognized that his years in the exec-
utive branch constitute almost all of the experience that Judge
Thomas has to offer in support of the proposition that he is quali-
fied to serve on the Supreme Court.

  Far from assisting his candidacy, the performance of Judge
Thomas as a Federal official provides powerful reasons why he
should not be confirmed. Two years ago, 14 Members of the House
of Representatives, including 12 chairs of committees having juris-
diction over the EEOC and 5 members of the Congressional Black
Caucus, wrote to President Bush asking that Clarence Thomas not
be nominated to the court of appeals.

  After reviewing the record, the writers of the letter said that
Thomas had, quote, "resisted Congressional oversight and been less
than candid with legislators about agency enforcement policies,"
end of quote. These Members of Congress concluded that Thomas
had demonstrated an, quote, "overall disdain of the rule of law."

  Time will not permit me to offer more detail on this point. How-
ever, pages 4 through 9 of the written statement of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus does provide amplification for this argument.

  Like numerous other Reagan administration appointees, Judge
Thomas repeatedly displayed great contempt for the law. Although
sworn to uphold and implement the law, Judge Thomas repeatedly
delayed, sabotaged and blockaded the process of enforcement of the
laws entrusted to his administration.

  In this pattern of behavior, Judge Thomas was certainly not
unique among Reagan administration officials. For 8 years, con-
tempt for the law was part of the style and the strategy of the ex-
ecutive branch of Government. Members of Congress repeatedly en-
countered this contempt for the law not only in the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission under Judge Thomas, but also in
OSHA, EPA, the Department of Justice, and, as the whole world
knows, on the National Security Council. Oliver North's separate
government in the basement of the White House was the most visi-
ble and the most dangerous example of this contempt for law.

  What must be recognized, however, by this committee is that the
spirit of Oliver North was rampant throughout all of the units of
the Reagan administration. As a Member of Congress, I regret very
much the helplessness and inability of Congress to curtail and
counteract the brazen contempt for law exhibited by so many ex-
ecutives who were sworn to uphold and implement the law. I pray
that in the future we will find ways to guarantee that such a wide-
spread hemorrhaging of the integrity of Government will never
take place again.

  But one giant step to restore respect for law, and thus resuscitate
the vital moral authority of our Government, is a step that can be
taken immediately by this committee and the Members of the
Senate. Let it be clearly stated by this committee and this Senate
that a new standard has been established that regardless of the de-
sires of the President to reward the loyal and the obedient, any
persons who have, in their public performance at any level of Gov-
ernment, displayed a contempt for the law shall not be sanctioned
and confirmed for the Federal judiciary. In other words, the price
of obeying orders instead of upholding and implementing the law
                                             687

should be denial of the privilege of adjudicating and interpreting
law.

  In addition to his job performance, for example, before the youth
of America and the people of the world. The nominee has used
what could accurately be labeled as the equivalent of the Fifth
Amendment as his run from his own record. What manner of Gov-
ernment are we, to tolerate people in high places who blatantly
evade honest questions?

  Finally, I would like to briefly convey to you the sentiments of
my constituents on this nominee and the nomination process. I rep-
resent the 12th Congressional District of New York, which is 90
percent African-American. I have been a public official for more
than 23 years, and I know how to read my constituents. The over-
whelming reaction to the nomination of Clarence Thomas was one
of disbelief and a sense of betrayal, and, among the youth, immedi-
ate bitterness.

  If you want to truly understand the thoughts and feelings of the
overwhelming majority of African-Americans in this country, then
try to imagine how the French would have felt, if the collaborator
Marshall Petain had been awarded a medal after the liberation of
France in World War II, or if in Norway Quisling had been made a
high official in the government. Try to put yourself in the place of
a soldier in the Continental Army, after Valley Forge and all of
the other difficult struggles, try to imagine the feelings of such a
soldier, if he was forced to watch a ceremony where Gen. George
Washington promoted Benedict Arnold to the level of a general.
Imagine the tears in the eyes of those strong men that such an act
would have generated.

  The masses of black people judge Clarence Thomas as a man who
has clearly and consistently stood against those legal principles,
philosophies and ideas which are vitally necessary for our survival
and continuing progress. The elevation of this man to the Supreme
Court would be a gross insult, a cruel slap in the face of all Afri-
can-Americans.

  It is my plea that you and that the Senate should not acquiesce
and permit the continuing erosion of the moral foundation of
America. The Senate should not acquiesce and participate in the
further trivializing of the Supreme Court of our Nation. On the ap-
pointment of Judge Clarence Thomas, it is my plea that the vote
on confirmation be a clear and decisive no.

  Thank you.

           TESTIMONY OF CONGRESSMAN MAJOR OWENS
            BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
              REGARDING THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE

               CLARENCE THOMAS - SEPTEMBER 19,1991

MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE DURING THIS SET OF HISTORIC HEARINGS FOR THE PURPOSE OF
CONSIDERING JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS FOR APPOINTMENT TO THE UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT.

IN THE TIME ALLOTTED TO ME, MR. CHAIRMAN, I WANT TO MAKE TWO
IMPORTANT POINTS. FIRST, JUDGE THOMAS SHOULD NOT BE CONFIRMED
BECAUSE AS A FEDERAL OFFICIAL OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT
HE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED AN OPEN CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW. FOR THE
YOUTH OF AMERICA AND ALL PEOPLE OF THE WORLD WHO BELIEVE IN RULE BY
LAW JUDGE THOMAS IS A MONSTROUS NEGATIVE ROLE MODEL.

MY SECOND POINT RELATES TO THE OBLIGATION I FEEL TO COMMUNICATE TO
YOU THE DEEP FEELINGS OF MY CONSTITUENTS CONCERNING THIS NOMINEE
AND THE PROCESS WHICH LED TO THE PLACEMENT OF HIS NAME BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE. JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS IS BEING REWARDED FOR THE LOYAL
AND OBEDIENT EXECUTION OF THE ORDERS OF TWO PRESIDENTS AND HIS
POLITICAL PARTY. IN THE PROCESS OF CARRYING OUT THOSE ORDERS JUDGE
THOMAS HAS TRAMPLED ON CERTAIN LEGAL PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE VITALLY
NECESSARY FOR THE SURVIVAL OF OUR PEOPLE. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT I
PLACE ON THE RECORD THE RESPONSE OF THE GREAT MAJORITY OF AFRICAN
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HIS BEHAVIOR AND THE CLEVER MANEUVERS OF HIS
SPONSOR.
                                    689

ON THE MATTER OF JUDGE THOMAS' CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW LET ME MAKE IT
CLEAR THAT I SPEAK FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF DIRECT OBSERVATION. AS
A MEMBER OF THE EDUCATION AND LABOR COMMITTEE WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION I
SERVED ON NUMEROUS PANELS WHICH HEARD TESTIMONY FROM JUDGE THOMAS.
AT THIS POINT I WOULD LIKE TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT THERE IS A
VOLUMINOUS SET OF RECORDS OF HEARINGS AND GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE
REPORTS WHICH COMPRISE A BODY OF EVIDENCE TOO LITTLE ANALYZED OR
REFERRED TO SINCE JUDGE THOMAS WAS NOMINATED.

JUDGE THOMAS HAS TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES AN
EXTRAORDINARY 56 TIMES (55 PUBLISHED; 1 UNPUBLISHED). THIS LARGE
NUMBER OF APPEARANCES DOES NOT SIMPLY REFLECT THE JUDGE'S LONG
TENURE. VERY LITTLE OF CLARENCE THOMAS'S CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT
TESTIMONY WAS MERE REPORTING OR WAS OTHERWISE ROUTINE. MOST OF IT
WAS CONTROVERSIAL AND MUCH OF IT EXPRESSED THE EXASPERATION OF
HOUSE COMMITTEES WITH HIS ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAW. IN THE SAME
VEIN ARE TEE GAO REPORTS, AN UNUSUAL NUMBER AND MOST OF THEM HIGHLY
CRITICAL OF THE NOMINEE'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE LAWS UNDER HIS
JURISDICTION. IT IS JUDGE THOMAS' ACTUAL PROFESSIONAL RECORD WHILE
 SERVING IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT SHOULD COUNT MOST TO THE OUTCOME OF
THESE DELIBERATIONS. HOW JUDGE THOMAS HAS VIEWED HIS LEGAL
RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE PAST IS THE BEST EVIDENCE OF HOW HE IS
LIKELY TO DISCHARGE THEM IN THE FUTURE.

 THE CONCLUSION THAT WE HAVE REACHED IS THAT JUDGE THOMAS FAILED

                                      2
                                    690

OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME TO CARRY OUT THE CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION
OF MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO "TAKE CARE THAT THE LAWS ARE
FAITHFULLY EXECUTED" AND THAT HE EXHIBITED A PERVASIVE DISRESPECT
FOR CONGRESS AND FOR THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. OUR CONCLUSION,
WHICH IS AMPLY SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE, IS ALL THE MORE DAMNING
WHEN IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT HIS YEARS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH
CONSTITUTE ALMOST ALL OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT CLARENCE THOMAS HAS TO
OFFER IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSITION THAT HE IS QUALIFIED TO SERVE
ON THE SUPREME COURT. FAR FROM ASSISTING HIS CANDIDACY, THE
PERFORMANCE OF JUDGE THOMAS AS A FEDERAL OFFICIAL PROVIDES POWERFUL
REASONS WHY HE SHOULD NOT BE CONFIRMED.

TWO YEARS AGO, 14 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
INCLUDING 12 CHAIRS OF COMMITTEES HAVING JURISDICTION OVER THE EEOC
AND FIVE MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS, WROTE TO
PRESIDENT BUSH ASKING THAT CLARENCE THOMAS NOT BE NOMINATED TO THE
COURT OF APPEALS. AFTER REVIEWING THE RECORD, THE WRITERS OF THE
LETTER SAID THAT THOMAS HAD "RESISTED CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT AND
BEEN LESS THAN CANDID WITH LEGISLATORS ABOUT AGENCY ENFORCEMENT
POLICIES." THESE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CONCLUDED THAT THOMAS HAD
DEMONSTRATED AN "OVERALL DISDAIN FOR THE RULE OF LAW".

TIME WILL NOT PERMIT ME TO OFFER MORE DETAIL ON THIS POINT;
HOWEVER, PAGES 4 THROUGH 9 OF THE WRITTEN STATEMENT OF THE
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS DOES PROVIDE AMPLIFICATION FOR THIS
ARGUMENT.
                                    691

AS A REAGAN ADMINISTRATION APPOINTEE JUDGE THOMAS WAS THE MODEL OF
LOYALTY AND OBEDIENCE. HE DEFENDED THE ADMINISTRATION'S DEFORMED
AND DISTORTED CIVIL RIGHTS AND EEOC POLICIES WITH GREAT ARROGANCE
AND PASSION. IT IS PERFECTLY LOGICAL THAT HIS PARTY WOULD SEEK TO
REWARD SUCH A DEDICATED TEAM PLAYER. BUT IT IS NEITHER LOGICAL NOR
MORAL FOR THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS
POLITICAL CLUBHOUSE PROMOTION PROCESS.

LIKE NUMEROUS OTHER REAGAN ADMINISTRATION APPOINTEES JUDGE THOMAS
REPEATEDLY DISPLAYED GREAT CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW. ALTHOUGH SWORN TO
UPHOLD AND IMPLEMENT THE LAW, JUDGE THOMAS REPEATEDLY DELAYED,
SABOTAGED AND BLOCKADED THE PROCESS OF ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS
ENTRUSTED TO HIS ADMINISTRATION. IN THIS PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR JUDGE
THOMAS WAS CERTAINLY NOT UNIQUE AMONG REAGAN ADMINISTRATION
OFFICIALS. FOR EIGHT YEARS CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW WAS A PART OF THE
STYLE AND THE STRATEGY OF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS REPEATEDLY ENCOUNTERED THIS CONTEMPT FOR THE
LAW NOT ONLY IN THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION UNDER
JUDGE THOMAS, BUT ALSO IN OSHA, IN THE EPA, IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE, AND AS THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS ON THE NATIONAL SECURITY
COUNCIL. OLIVER NORTH'S SEPARATE GOVERNMENT IN THE BASEMENT OF THE
WHITE HOUSE WAS THE MOST VISIBLE AND THE MOST DANGEROUS EXAMPLE OF
 THIS CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW.

 WHAT MUST BE RECOGNIZED BY THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT THE SPIRIT OF
 OLIVER NORTH WAS RAMPANT THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE UNITS OF THE REAGAN
                                 692

ADMINISTRATION. AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS I REGRET VERY MUCH THE
HELPLESSNESS AND INABILITY OF CONGRESS TO CURTAIL AND COUNTERACT
THE BRAZEN CONTEMPT FOR LAW EXHIBITED BY SO MANY EXECUTIVES WHO
WERE SWORN TO UPHOLD AND IMPLEMENT THE LAW. I PRAY THAT IN THE
NEAR FUTURE WE WILL FIND WAYS TO GUARANTEE THAT SUCH A WIDESPREAD
HEMORRHAGING OF THE INTEGRITY OF GOVERNMENT WILL NEVER TAKE PLACE
AGAIN. ONE GIANT STEP TO RESTORE RESPECT FOR THE LAW AND THUS
RESUSCITATE THE VITAL MORAL AUTHORITY OF OUR GOVERNMENT IS A STEP
THAT CAN BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THE MEMBERS OF
THE SENATE.

LET IT BE CLEARLY STATED BY THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS SENATE THAT A
NEW STANDARD HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED; THAT REGARDLESS OF THE DESIRES
OF THE PRESIDENT TO REWARD THE LOYAL AND THE OBEDIENT, ANY PERSONS
WHO HAVE IN THEIR PUBLIC PERFORMANCE AT ANY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT
DISPLAYED A CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW SHALL NOT BE SANCTIONED AND
CONFIRMED FOR THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY. IN OTHER WORDS THE PRICE OF
OBEYING ORDERS INSTEAD OF UPHOLDING AND IMPLEMENTING THE LAW SHOULD
BE DENIAL OF THE PRIVILEGE OF ADJUDICATING AND INTERPRETING THE
LAW.

TO IGNORE THE PERFORMANCE RECORD OF JUDGE THOMAS OR ANY OTHERS WHO
BEHAVED IN A SIMILAR MANNER IS TO CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO THE
POISONING OF THE MORAL ENVIRONMENT OF AMERICA. WHILE OUR
DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL SYSTEM MAY AT THIS POINT LEAVE US PARALYZED
WITH RESPECT TO OUR ABILITY TO CURTAIL CONTEMPT FOR THE LAW IN THE
                                        693

     EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, I URGE YOU TO PLEASE FULLY UTILIZE
     THE MECHANISM OF CHECKS AND BALANCES TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT THOSE
     WITH A RECORD OF HIGH LEVEL LAWLESSNESS SHALL NOT BE ALLOWED TO
     ASCEND TO THE HIGHEST COURT OF OUR NATION.

-> IN ADDITION TO HIS JOB PERFORMANCE, JUDGE THOMAS1 PERFORMANCE
     BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE HAS SET A DISMAL EXAMPLE BEFORE THE YOUTH OF
     AMERICA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. THE NOMINEE HAS USED WHAT
     COULD ACCURATELY BE LABELED AS THE EQUIVALENT OF THE FIFTH
     AMENDMENT AS HE HAS RUN FROM HIS OWN RECORD. WHAT MANNER OF
     GOVERNMENT ARE WE TO TOLERATE PEOPLE IN HIGH PLACES WHO BLATANTLY
      EVADE HONEST QUESTIONS? WHERE IS THE PARENT WHO WOULD TOLERATE
      SUCH INSULTING BEHAVIOR FROM A TEENAGE SON OR DAUGHTER? A
      PRECEDENT OF TOLERATING EVASIVE ANSWERS WAS SET WITH JUDGE SOUTER
     WHICH DISCREDITS THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS. THAT PRECEDENT SHOULD
      BE STRUCK DOWN NOW. JUST AS MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO
      CAST SECRET BALLOTS ON ISSUES, NO PERSON SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO
      ASSUME A LIFE-TIME SEAT ON THE COURT WITHOUT THE FULLEST POSSIBLE
      DISCLOSURE OF HIS PHILOSOPHY AND IDEAS.

      FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY CONVEY TO YOU THE SENTIMENTS OF MY
      CONSTITUENTS ON THIS NOMINEE AND THE NOMINATION PROCESS. I
      REPRESENT THE TWELFTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN NEW YORK WHICH IS
      NINETY PERCENT AFRICAN-AMERICAN. I HAVE BEEN A PUBLIC OFFICIAL FOR
      MORE THAN TWENTY-THREE YEARS AND I KNOW HOW TO READ MY
      CONSTITUENTS. THE OVERWHELMING REACTION TO THE NOMINATION OF
                                    694

CLARENCE THOMAS WAS ONE OF DISBELIEF AND A SENSE OF BETRAYAL -- AND
AMONG THE YOUTH IMMEDIATE BITTERNESS.

IF YOU WANT TO TRULY UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS OF THE
OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY, THEN
TRY TO IMAGINE HOW THE FRENCH WOULD HAVE FELT IF THE COLLABORATOR
MARSHAL PETAIN HAD BEEN AWARDED A MEDAL AFTER THE LIBERATION OF
FRANCE IN WORLD WAR II, OR IF IN NORWAY, QUISLING HAD BEEN MADE A
HIGH OFFICIAL IN THE GOVERNMENT. TRY TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE PLACE
OF A SOLDIER IN THE CONTINENTAL ARMY AFTER VALLEY FORGE AND ALL OF
THE OTHER DIFFICULT STRUGGLES; TRY TO IMAGINE THE FEELINGS OF SUCH
A SOLDIER IF HE WAS FORCED TO WATCH A CEREMONY WHERE GENERAL GEORGE
WASHINGTON PROMOTED BENEDICT ARNOLD TO THE LEVEL OF A GENERAL.
IMAGINE THE TEARS IN THE EYES OF THOSE STRONG MEN THAT SUCH AN ACT
WOULD HAVE GENERATED.

FOR THE MASSES OF BLACK PEOPLE JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS IS A MAN WHO
HAS CLEARLY AND CONSISTENTLY STOOD AGAINST THOSE LEGAL PRINCIPLES,
PHILOSOPHIES AND IDEAS WHICH ARE VITALLY NECESSARY FOR OUR SURVIVAL
AND CONTINUING PROGRESS. THE ELEVATION OF THIS MAN TO THE SUPREME
COURT WOULD BE A GROSS INSULT, A CRUEL SLAP "IN THE FACE" OF ALL
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

REMEMBER THAT DANTE, IN THE INFERNO. ASSIGNED THE LOWEST PIT IN
HELL TO BRUTUS, THE MOST INTIMATE AND TRUSTED OF ALL TRAITORS.
IMAGINE WHAT OTHERS THROUGHOUT HISTORY MIGHT HAVE FELT AS THEY
                                       695

    BEHELD THE ELEVATION OF ONE THEY PERCEIVED TO BE A TRAITOR TO THEIR
    CAUSE AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND HOW A CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE THOMAS
    WILL GIVE BIRTH TO A BOTTOMLESS PIT OF BITTERNESS THAT WILL ENDURE
     FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.
- IT IS MY PLEA TO YOU THAT THE SENATE SHOULD NOT ACQUIESCE AND
     PERMIT THE CONTINUING EROSION OF THE MORAL FOUNDATION OF AMERICA.
     THE SENATE SHOULD NOT ACQUIESCE AND PARTICIPATE IN THE FURTHER
     TRIVIALIZING OF THE SUPREME COURT OF OUR NATION. ON THE
     APPOINTMENT OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS IT IS MY PLEA THAT YOUR VOTE
     ON CONFIRMATION BE A CLEAR AND DECISIVE NO!

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Congressman.
   Congressman Washington.

              STATEMENT OF REP. CRAIG A. WASHINGTON

   Mr. WASHINGTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Mr. Chairman and members, I thank you for the privilege and
honor of speaking before you today. We truly appreciate this oppor-
tunity to express our views on a vitally important nomination.
  I speak in opposition to the nomination of Judge Clarence
Thomas. My opposition to Judge Thomas has nothing at all to do
with his personal political views. It has nothing at all to do with
the politics that resulted in his nomination, but, rather, based upon
a scientific, objective, reasoned and calm analysis of Judge Thomas'
legal writings, legal opinions, editorial opinions, remarks and
speeches. I have concluded at least the following:
  Judge Thomas has a disturbingly paradigmatic disdain and disre-
gard for legal precedents and stare decisis. In fact, I don't think he
knows what stare decisis means. Judge Thomas has shown a previ-
ous long-standing disrespect for the civil liberties of groups. Judge
Thomas has espoused as a fulcrum of his legal thought the concept
of natural law, and Judge Thomas has shown a lack of respect for
the rule of law.

  We have reached these and other conclusions only after much re-
search and analysis. As you know, it is often difficult to take a
stand that would seem to be unpopular. It is our duty, however, as
elected officials, to speak against the nomination of Judge Clarence
Thomas, based upon the facts.

  Our position is clearly based upon just that, the fact that the ele-
vation of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the
United States is dangerous for all Americans. The quintessential
underpinning of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence is that, if you have a
case with similar facts, similar evidence and similar legal predi-
cates, you should reach a similar outcome. Stare decisis, which in
Latin, as you know, means standing by decided matters, is a doc-
trine of following rules of principles laid down in previous judicial
decisions.

  The most blatant example of Judge Thomas' disregard for legal
precedent came when Judge Thomas was chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. As chairman of the EEOC,
Judge Thomas spoke out against the Supreme Court's approval of
racial and sexually defined employment goals and timetables.

  Judge Thomas states that he considered goals and timetables to
be a weak and limited weapon against forms of discrimination.
There have been at least four Supreme Court decisions on race con-
scious remedies in which the Supreme Court has approved them.
They are, as you know, United States v. Paradise, Local 28 Sheet-
metal Workers v. EEOC, Local 93 Firefighters v. Cleveland, and
Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, California.

  There are times when we all disagree with the law. Rules and
regulations make our society stable. If we all agree that, for better
or worse, the rule is that privates salute generals and that we
should drive the speed limit as established by the legislatures of
our various States, then we should obey those rules and regula-
                                      697

tions. I might not like the person wearing the uniform of the gener-
al, but if I am a private and he or she is a general, I am bound to
respect the rank of the general.

  Judge Thomas' opinion of Brown v. Board of Education is simply
this: If individual violations of discrimination came to Judge
Thomas and complained of discrimination, they would be heard.
However, if a group complained and presented evidence of group-
wide systemic discrimination, he would not hear such evidence.
This notion is in direct contradiction with the fundamental rights
that the Constitution was intended to protect.

  Moreover, the Bill of Rights and other amendments were intend-
ed to protect those who are similarly situated from the tyranny of
Government. Natural law has as much to do with judicial opinion
as voodoo has to do with the practice of medicine. As an example of
the application of natural law would be to take the example I used
earlier about driving the speed limit. Under a theory of natural
law, the majority of people have agreed that we should drive the
speed limit. If one were to adhere to a natural law philosophy,
however, one could state, "Since I've paid for my car and I've paid
part of the taxes to build this highway, I can drive as fast as I
wish. I'm not bound by mere legal opinion, I'm bound only by
myself." The logical extension of such a philosophy is that we
would have no law, no order, and no rules to govern our society.

  During Judge Thomas' tenure as chairman of the EEOC, he re-
fused to process cases of age discrimination, in spite of the fact he
had been ordered to do so by several governmental bodies. Instead,
Judge Thomas allowed 13,000 age-discrimination cases to expire
and go unresolved. It was Judge Thomas' duty to file these case. It
did not matter that he disagreed with the law. He, like others, was
bound to respect and follow the law, regardless of whether he liked
it or not.

  I oppose Judge Thomas based upon these aforementioned facts.
The choice, based upon my evidence and that of my Congressional
Black Caucus colleagues is that Judge Thomas is not a worthy suc-
cessor to Justice Thurgood Marshall. The difference that we have
is Judge Thomas does not stem from reasonable and understand-
able differences over particular cases or remedies. Rather, Judge
Thomas repudiates the fundamental role of the Supreme Court as
a guardian of the constitutional freedoms and rejects the legacy of
Justice Marshall.

  On behalf of 25 of the 26 members of the Congressional Black
Caucus, we respectfully urge you to reject the nomination of Judge
Clarence Thomas. At the appropriate time, I will be happy to re-
spond to your questions.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Before we move to Congressman Lewis, Senator Kennedy has a
responsibility to be over in the caucus on another matter, but
maybe you
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I just want to join in welcoming our friends from the House and
their testimony. We are getting first-hand information, some of our
colleagues here, of individuals who had oversight responsibilities
that directly related to the work of Judge Thomas, and their pres-
                                      698

entation and their experience is certainly unique in terms of the
kind of presentations that we have had.

  We have members who have been leaders, most all of them, but
some in particular have been working in civil rights legislation and
also in striking down discrimination in employment, so their testi-
mony is particularly valuable.

  Our next speaker, John Lewis, who was out there and still bears
the bruises of the physical struggles in the late 1950's and early
1960's, was a civil rights leader, not because he named himself one,
but because others looked to him for leadership, and we heard
some remarks from Judge Thomas in disparagement of many of
those that bled and I think even died to eliminate some of the bar-
riers of discrimination.

  So, I want to just say, as one member of the committee, how we
welcome all of your comments. I think it is enormously valuable to
us. I apologize to Congressman Lewis for not hearing the testimo-
ny, but look forward to reading it in its entirety.

  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  I suspect Congressman Lewis would rather see you get the exten-
sion of the unemployment compensation, than listen to him, as
much as he would like you to listen to him.
  Congressman Lewis.

                   STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN LEWIS
  Mr. LEWIS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the committee, I
am pleased and delighted to be here with you today.
  When I was growing up in the rural South in the 1940's and
1950's, I saw for myself the evil system of segregation and discrimi-
nation. I was bused long distances over unpaved roads, dusty in
summer and muddy in winter, to attend overcrowded, poorly
staffed segregated schools. For many blacks, they were not called
high schools then, they were called training schools. An evil
system, a way of life had been built on a foundation of racism,
greed, hatred and a denial of basic human needs and human rights.
It was a closed society, and everywhere I turned, I found closed
doors.
  I saw those signs that said "white men," "colored men," those
signs that said "white women," "colored women," those signs that
said "white waiting," "colored waiting." I grew up in a family with
a mother and a father, six brothers and three sisters. We were very
poor. The house in which we lived had no indoor plumbing or elec-
tricity. I read by the light of kerosene lamps.
  But that does not make me qualified to sit on the highest court
of the land! If you are going to vote to confirm Clarence Thomas to
sit on the highest court of the land, you must have some reason
other than the fact that he grew up poor in Pin Point, GA.
  I also come here as one who participated in the civil rights move-
ment of the 1960's, as one who was beaten, arrested and jailed on
more than 40 occasions. During the 1960's, as I traveled and
worked throughout the South, I saw civil rights workers and many
people whom we were trying to help, with their heads cracked open
                                              699

by nightsticks, lying in the streets, weeping from teargas, calling
helplessly for medical aid.

  I have seen old women and young children involved in peaceful,
nonviolent protests, run down by policemen on horses, beaten back
by fire hoses, and chased by police dogs. But also during the 1960's,
we saw the Federal Government, and particularly the Supreme
Court, as a sympathetic referee in the struggle for civil rights.

   I can recall on one occasion when the Supreme Court issued a
decision dealing with public transportation, an elderly black
woman was heard to say, "God Almighty has spoken from Wash-
ington." The Supreme Court was there for the people then. That is
no longer the case.

   Let us set aside for the moment Thomas' view on abortion, which
he won't share with you, his views on affirmative action, on which
he has been incredibly unclear, and his views on natural law,
which were one thing last year, something different when he was
nominated, and still something else at this hearing last week. Let
us set aside all of this and see what you have.

  What you have is a nominee who wants to destroy the bridge
that brought him over troubled waters. He wants to pull down the
ladder that he climbed up. You have a nominee who has refused to
answer your questions, a nominee who has defied the law, a nomi-
nee who has tried to stonewall this committee, a nominee who
changes his story to suit the audience, a nominee who is running
from his record.

  As elected officials, men who have to run, you have come up
against men who have to run on their records and others who run
from their record. Well, Clarence Thomas is a man who is running
from his record!

  I ask you again, what reason do you have, other than the fact
that he grew up poor in Pin Point, GA, to confirm Clarence
Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court? I know this is a tough
decision for you to have to make. It was as tough decision for me to
decide to come before you today. I have been advised by some that
I should not testify against Clarence Thomas, because he is black.
The color of Clarence Thomas' skin is not relevant. The person, his
views and his qualifications are.

   Leadership demands that we not avoid decisions, just because
they are tough. It requires that we be fair, be critical and do what
is right, not what may appear to be politically correct. You have
information that the masses don't have. You know Clarence
Thomas' record. You know the truth.

   Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, as a member of
the House, I don't want to tell you what to do. I cannot. But I do
want to say that you have a mission, a mandate and a moral obli-
gation, not just to our generation, but to unborn generations. The
decision you make on the Thomas nomination will affect how we
live well into the next century.

   You cannot vote to confirm Clarence Thomas, unless you feel
confident that Clarence Thomas will not bring his own agenda to
the bench and that his decisions will not be burdened with his own
preconceived notions about how things are or should be. You must
feel confident in your gut that, as he himself put it, Thomas is fair,
full of integrity, open-minded and honest.
                                              700

   Look at his record, listen to what he has said to you during this
hearing. Hear what he has refused to say. You may have to sail
against the current, but that is OK. I urge you to vote against con-
firmation of Mr. Thomas.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, gentlemen. I know you
all used the phrase this is not easy for you to do. I suspect a lot of
people think it was easy. I have some sense, some little sense, of
how hard it must be. You have all fought your entire lives to see to
it that black women and men are in positions of power, positions of
authority, to be able to be role models to a generation of black chil-
dren, and here you are, walking down that long walk across from
the other body to come to this great, majestic room and tell a
group of your colleagues on the Senate side not to vote for a man
to the Supreme Court who is black, when not a one of you--I don't
want to reveal all of your ages--but not a one of you failed to un-
derstand at some point in your lives the lash of legal segregation.
The notion that 20 years ago, 30 years ago, any one of you would be
in this room saying, "don't put any black person on the Supreme
Court of the United States," would boggle the mind. And you are
here, and as I said, I am confident of what you say when you say it
is not an easy decision.

  Let me be the devil's advocate with you for a moment, if I may.
  Clarence Thomas and those who vociferously support Clarence
Thomas say two things about black leadership in America and
black leadership in the Congress--and you are the black leadership
of the Nation. They say, No. 1, that this really only reflects a dif-
ference on affirmative action; that's what this is all about. The
only thing you all are concerned about is affirmative action. Clar-
ence Thomas is hostile to affirmative action, apparently--although
I acknowledge, John, it is kind of hard to tell--and that's why you
are here.

  The second thing they say is that any black man who has suf-
fered the indignities and injustices of a legally segregated system
as well as a system, in my view, that continues to be segregated, in
a much more sophisticated way these days, that that person's in-
stincts have got to be right when they get on the bench; that in the
end, whether or not he calls himself a Republican or a Democrat,
conservative or liberal, he will do the right thing.

  So the two big arguments that have been posited by supporters
of Thomas and those who have been detractors of your position are
(a) that this is all about affirmative action and a desire for you to
maintain a position of black leadership in the Nation, your points
of view, and (b) how could any black man with his background not
do the right thing when it comes to issues relating to race.

  Would any or all of you please comment for the record on both of
those assertions that we have heard so many times in this commit-
tee?

  Congressman Conyers.
  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, might I comment on that and ask
before we begin that all of our individual statements be submitted
and reproduced in the record.
                                         701

  The CHAIRMAN. They all will be. Anything beyond what you have
said, if you have a statement, will be placed in the record as if
read.

  Mr. CONYERS. Thank you very much.
  Of course, we have pointed out here in all of our testimony that
this goes far beyond individual differences of how we approach civil
rights; that we are talking about our lack of confidence that wheth-
er he will apply fundamental constitutional concepts in a way that
is going to satisfy us far beyond affirmative action. We are talking
about his conduct in 9 years of public office that required him to
come before Congress as many times as you've heard here today.
  We are talking about the fact that senior citizens are aggrieved
about the way he handled age discrimination cases. We are talking
about the women's organizations who are disturbed about where
his views on privacy are going to lead. We don't know what is
going to happen on natural law.
  So I think it is patently obvious that this is not a single issue or
some truncated difference of view on one part of the civil rights
issue that we take. It would be trivial of us to come forward on
that kind of a question.
  I also very firmly believe that what happens here in these next
few weeks before your body is going to determine whether we ever
come forward with an adequate African-American nominee to re-
place Thurgood Marshall. And I think what we have to continue to
watch very carefully is if he is confirmed, we are essentially closed
down for Justice Marshall's representative. If he is not confirmed, I
think the picture is open. We all know a long list of African-Ameri-
can jurists, male and female, with good constitutional experience
and many others coming forward that could leave that picture
open.
  So I urge that we not accede to any notion that we are trivializ-
ing this confirmation process on a very narrow civil rights point.
  The CHAIRMAN. Does anyone else wish to speak to either point?
  Yes, Congressman Stokes.
  Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, at the expense of being redundant, I
will forego speaking to part (a). I would like to speak to part (b)
because I think that troubles many people. I think many people
feel that any person born black, subjected to racism and the other
indignities that black people have been subjected to in this society,
once they get on that Court and once they have that paper that
says they have a lifetime appointment, will then feel secure and be
able to do the right thing. And I guess I have tried in my own mind
to analyze it and try to understand this individual--and let's face
it--what I have had to do is try to look at his record.
  One of the most poignant things that points up the fears I have
about him is in a case called Moore v. City of East Cleveland. I hap-
pened to represent East Cleveland. A 63-year-old grandmother who
had taken in one of her grandchildren when he was less than a
year old when his other died was charged on an ordinance that de-
fined "family" as being only the parents and their children. In this
home, this grandmother had taken in her own son and two grand-
children, one of whom was this 1-year-old child when his mother
died. But they were not brothers; they were cousins. And under
this particular statute, she was ordered by the municipality to evict
                                              702

this child because the child did not fit the family definition under
the ordinance.

   She refused to do so, and she was jailed and fined. The case went
up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the U.S. Supreme Court found
that this was an invasion by the municipality of the privacy of
family. The Court recognized the fact that in the black family par-
ticularly, there is a need for the extension of the family to take in
other relatives, so long as it does not break zoning laws and things
of that nature. The Court found that this is in the course of Ameri-
can tradition, and that other ethnic groups have had to do this
when they came to this country, and so forth.

   Clarence Thomas was on a White House Task Force on the
Family. They issued a report highly critical of this particular Su-
preme Court decision, meaning in effect that they would have
jailed the grandmother and permitted the fine to stand. When I ex-
amined that case and his relation to it and the fact that he signed
this report criticizing it, I asked myself how could this man who in
your hearings made so much to-do about his grandparents and
what they had done for him and his mother and for his family--
and in fact I dare say to you that you know more about his grand-
parents, Mr. Chairman, than you know about him because he
talked over and over again about what his grand -ents had
done--how then, you must say^ can this same man then jail or
want to have jailed this grandmother who took in her grandchild?

  I think when you look at this, you get some answer to whether
or not he would really go back to his roots and do the right thing. I
don't think he will.

  The CHAIRMAN. My time is about up, but I want to give you gen-
tlemen a chance to respond if you'd like.

   Mr. OWENS. Just quickly, Mr. Chairman, I would like to say that
the record of Clarence Thomas with respect to affirmative action
and civil rights is not subtle at all. It is not unclear at all. It is not
mysterious at all. It is quite clear where he stands. He had 8 years,
and his performance in office at EEOC made it quite clear, and
most African-Americans clearly understand this. After they get
over the shock of understanding that a person of his education and
his position could espouse those ideas, their reaction is we're quite
sorry, but--I'll tell you what one lady told me at church. "Let's
take the Christian approach," she said. "We want you, Congress-
man, to go out there and fight as hard as you can to see that this
man does not get a place on the Supreme Court. But since the
President is powerful, and we know that it is possible you might
lose and he might be placed on the Supreme Court, after you get
through fighting and you lose, then we'll start praying that he will
be born again and will act right when he gets on the court. But
we'll fight first, and then we'll pray later."

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Mr. Washington.
   Mr. WASHINGTON. Very briefly, Mr. Chairman, on the first part
of your question, I'd like to rely upon my 20 years' experience as a
trial lawyer which I brought to this job. Whenever I was trying a
murder case, and I couldn't do much to get over all the facts that
the prosecution had assembled against me, I'd try the deceased
person. It's an attempt to divert your attention from the issue by
talking about all these organizations that have come out in opposi-
                                               703

tion to him. If our focus were as narrow as a difference of opinion
over affirmative action, as a trial lawyer I believe that the true art
of cross examination would get to the truth in that, and you'd be
able to find it real soon.

  We have not talked about our difference of opinion with him on
affirmative action. We have talked about things that we think are
a lot more important to the function that he is about to ascend to,
with your permission.

  On the second point, to suggest that a black man who has suf-
fered as much as he has will "do the right thing", I find to be con-
descending, both condescending and patronizing. If we set that up
as a standard, then, the Supreme Court ought to adopt it as a
standard, and all these people who are suggesting that it is the
right thing to do ought to adopt it as a standard.

  That means that any time that a black person who is not quali-
fied goes to apply for a job as a truckdriver, instead of looking at
whether he can drive a truck or not, just see what kind of back-
ground he came from. If you are applying for a job as a school-
teacher, if you are applying for a job as a U.S. Senator, then you
ought to be able to get out and campaign. Well, I'm not as qualified
as Senator Grassley, I am not as adroit at the issues as Senator
Grassley, but by God I come from humble beginnings, so by God,
give the job to me. That's ludicrous. It is ludicrous to suggest it,
and it is condescending, and black people don't like it a bit.

  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Chairman, let me just be brief and say as black
Members of the Congress and as Members of the Congress, we
don't have anything to gain from coming here being against the
confirmation of Clarence Thomas.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well said.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, I know it is not my time but I
just got word I am supposed to be over on the floor on an amend-
ment that I have there. If I could just take 1 minute.
  The CHAIRMAN. Would you all mind if he takes 1 minute out of
order?
  Senator THURMOND. NO. GO ahead.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right.
  Senator SIMON. First of all, I really appreciate your testimony
and your standing up. I served in the House with three of my col-
leagues here--Congressman Conyers, Congressman Stokes, and
Congressman Owens--and while I didn't serve in the House with
Congressman Lewis, I have known him for many years.
  One other factor, and that is, if I can go back to something that
happened in Atlanta many years ago. You had two black leaders--
Frederick Douglass, who was an advocate, who said we ought to get
the right to vote, we ought to have civil rights; you had another
leader who brought himself up from the bootstraps, but who was
an accommodator, who said in what has been called the "Atlanta
compromise speech", Booker T. Washington said we ought to forget
those things, we ought to just do the best job we can wherever we
are. And the white majority seized on Booker T. Washington's
statement, and it was used not for the benefit of African-Ameri-
cans.
  One of the things that we do here is we elevate someone who up
to this point has been an accommodator rather than an advocate. I
                                               704

mention that in connection with this brief question. One of the ar-
guments used, and I hear it from my friends in the African-Ameri-
can community, is "I don't like Clarence Thomas' views, but if we
don't take him, we are going to get somebody with the same views
who is white; and we ought to have an African American on the
court."

  Congressman Conyers has answered that in part by saying this
for all practical purposes probably precludes another viewpoint
from the African-American community on the court.

  I would be interested in how you would answer, and is the
Booker T. Washington analogy a fair one or an unfair one?

  Mr. CONYERS. It is. DuBois and Washington was the reference
you were making to in the "Atlanta compromise", and we hear
that--better to take a chance now, and keep your fingers crossed.
Will he change? And you know, gentlemen, I have never ap-
proached a confirmation process supporting somebody that I didn't
agree with and hoping they'd change.

  I go back to Haynesworth, Carswell and on down the line, up
into Bork, and it makes no sense. And I think your accommoda-
tionist parallel that you draw, Senator Simon, has validity. As a
matter of fact, we had one of our great historians, John Hope
Franklin, draw up comments for us that he submitted in which he
went back to that day and made a reference quite similar to the
one that you draw at this time.

  Mr. STOKES. Senator Simon, I can only say in answer to your
question, "If you don't get Thomas, then you probably will not get
another black on the Court," that the only way to answer that is to
say we will just have to be patient and wait our time. The fact is
that if we don't get Thomas at this time, we don't get black at this
time, then we will just have to be patient and wait.

  It is as bad to have a bad appointee on there who is black as it is
to have a bad appointee on there who is white. If Bork was wrong
for the Court, Thomas is wrong for the Court, and you have to
stand with that. You can't have a separate criteria.

  Mr. OWENS. It is hard to believe, Senator, that there would ever
be a situation where two blacks would be appointed to the Court,
we just don't believe it is going to happen. As long as one is there,
we are not likely to have another. It is hard to believe that Judge
Thomas will ever change very much, because, as a member of the
Reagan administration, he was one of the most outspoken and bel-
ligerent of the executive branch team.

  He, of course, has been promoted and sponsored by people who
are deeply rooted in the conservative philosophy, which is directly
opposed to the kind of principles and the kinds of ideas that are
necessary for the advancement of African-American people. The
likelihood that he is going to change and not be grateful to his
sponsors and do something different, we find it hard to believe that
is going to happen.

  We find it hard to believe that we won't be placed in a position
where a member of the Supreme Court, occupying that position,
which is quite an exalted one, will not be quoted extensively and
used against us. If I was in Moscow or London or some other part
of the world, and Judge Thomas made a statement and I made a
statement in direct opposition to it, I would expect the people in
                                               705

London or Moscow or any other part of the world to automatically
defer to Judge Thomas and assume that a judge on the Supreme
Court, you know, speaks with more authority and has more credi-
bility than a Congressman, and that's the way it is going to be. He
is going to be in a position where he can do great harm to the
things that we believe in and to the people that we represent.

  Mr. WASHINGTON. Senator, let me just say, in chess, as you know,
there's a saying that if black moves first, black will most often win,
not because of the color, it doesn't matter what the colors are, but
the piece that moves first in chess, two similarly situated chess
players playing, the person who moves first is more likely to win
than the other, which comes to the question, it seems to me, that
you raise about Judge Thomas.

  I think the question is not whether if the Senate, in its wisdom,
rejects this nomination, whether we are likely to get a white
person or a Hispanic person or a woman or someone else, the ques-
tion is whether they are qualified. If you turn that question over,
the other side is, if he were a white person, if he were a woman, if
he were a Hispanic, if he were anything other than black, with the
paucity of qualifications that he brings with him and the griev-
ances that have been unearthed at these hearings and before, is it
any question that there would be a good deal of resentment and a
good deal of opposition to him.

  We have come too far--I don't mean black people, I mean all
people, I mean America has come too far since the Civil War, since
the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, we didn't come all the way to
here to say, when it comes down to it, that the color of the skin
matters more than anything else. If he is not qualified, he is not
qualified. If he is not qualified, making him black does not make
him qualified.

  Mr. LEWIS. Senator Simon, let me just respond by saying this
man is very young, and if he is conformed by the Senate, he will be
on the Court for many, many years to come. He will emerge as a
symbol, as a symbol for hundreds, for thousands and millions of Af-
rican-Americans. Is this the symbol that we want, as African-
Americans?

  The Supreme Court, during the 1960's, starting in 1954 and
during the 1960's, created a climate, an environment to make this
country something different, something better. We don't want to go
back.

  Senator SIMON. I thank all of you, and I thank Senator Thur-
mond for yielding.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you.
  I want to welcome you all today to this hearing, not only as
Democratic Congressmen, I believe you all are Democrats, but also
as prominent Democratic leaders.
  I want to mention one thing about Congressman Stokes regard-
ing the White House report. Judge Thomas testified that he con-
tributed the housing section to this report, but that he did not en-
dorse the whole report. I thought I would mention that for your in-
formation. I don't think you distinguished that difference in your
statement.
                                               706

  Mr. STOKES. NO, Senator, I didn't. What I said was that he was
on the White House Task Force on the Family and that he signed
the report, which criticized the Supreme Court for its ruling in
that case. In criticizing it, I could have said he also criticized Jus-
tice Marshall, because Justice Marshall was on the concurring
opinion with Justice Brennan, but I knew nothing about the hous-
ing section.

  I do know that he said he didn't read the report in your hearings
here and he said that he just signed it, I do know that.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, he testified at the hearings that he did
not endorse that whole report. I thought you ought to know that.

  Mr. STOKES. Certainly.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, I want to mention this to you: You are
all Democrats. A great many of the black people now are joining
the Republican Party, and I hope you will respect their right to do
that. There is a general feeling--whether it is true or not is an-
other question, but there is a general feeling that black Democratic
leaders prefer not to support a black for a high position unless he
is a Democrat. There is a general feeling out there to that effect,
and I just want to pass that along to you.
  We are glad to have you here and we thank you for coming.
  The CHAIRMAN. Would you all like to say thank you in order?
[Laughter.]
  Mr. WASHINGTON. I would like to say that I appreciate that, Sen-
ator, but I would hope that you would take that with a grain of
salt, quite frankly, from those who make those statements. I think
you will find, Senator, that we have at least always known that
there is as wide a divergence of views and opinions in the black
community as there is in any other community. It just happens
that most of the vocal leaders in the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s
happen to have been associated with the Democratic Party. We rec-
ognize that President Lincoln was a Republican. Some of my best
friends are Republicans. [Laughter.]
  We have been trained, Senator, because most of our lives and
most of us are old enough, without telling our ages, for most of our
lives we have had to confront racism in many forms. It has become
more sophisticated now, but we recognize that--we would be the
last people on earth to put people in a group, because prejudice
means prejudging based upon group identification. We don't look at
Republicans as being Republicans. We look at the character of the
individual.
  I count among some of my best friends and some of the people I
admire the most Republicans who I consider to be champions of
civil rights, like Senator Specter. I am not saying that just because
he is here. I have been watching him on television. Senator Hatch
and I disagree on a lot of things, but I think we consider ourselves
friends.
  Don't listen to those who tell you that we are trying to keep
down the movement. We want many blacks to be involved in the
Republican Party. We want every black person to vote. We are not
like those who discourage people from going to the polls to vote.
We think that the best democracy is one where all people partici-
pate.
                                               707

  Senator THURMOND. I hope you will associate more with your Re-
publican friends, they may win you over yet.

  Mr. WASHINGTON. They have got their work cut out for them,
Senator. [Laughter.]

  Senator THURMOND. I want to say this: I think it is to the advan-
tage of the black people of this country to be in both parties.

   Mr. WASHINGTON. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. For years and years, the South was solid
Democratic. We got no attention from Democrats. They had us in
the bag. We got no attention from the Republicans, because they
knew they couldn't get us. I think it is to the advantage of your
people that you have blacks in both parties and, in that way, I
think you will get more attention than ever.

  We are glad to have you here.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I just want to welcome all of you here. I
just got back from being out in my home State with the President
and just came in, but I at least wanted to come up and say hello.
  We are happy to have your testimony. I am a little disappointed
that it is not more favorable to Judge Thomas, but each of you is a
friend and I have great admiration for you.
  I do not have any questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Grassley, who has been waiting patiently and kind
enough to let everybody else go ahead. Senator Grassley?
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you.
  I welcome two of my former colleagues in the House of Repre-
sentatives here to the Senate side, and I am glad to become more
acquainted with others, although I have known Congressman Lewis
for quite a while.
  You know, I have never walked in the shoes of African-Ameri-
cans, and I don't think we work hard enough to understand the
problems of race relations in America. We all try, but probably do
not try hard enough. So, I am not here to preach. I guess I am here
to try to tell you problems that I have, as I measure the testimony
of the Congressional Black Caucus and the testimony of other black
Americans, I guess I have to measure the testimony of everybody,
and that is my responsibility.
  I want to tell you that I appreciate your testimony. I suppose
that if I were going to be really candid, I would say that I am trou-
bled by the position of what I would say is the elected leadership or
the so-called leadership of the black community's national organi-
zations, as well as the Congressional Black Caucus, in opposing
Judge Thomas, because we have also had several panels of wit-
nesses who are black Americans, let me say from the grassroots, as
opposed to the elected leadership, and who know Clarence Thomas
and have spoken eloquently about his commitment and devotion to
insuring equal opportunity.
  Just yesterday, as an example--and you probably heard it as
well as I did--we had this woman from Compton, CA, speaking for
herself but also a member of the NAACP chapter there, Ms. Holi-
fleld, who laid down the challenge, when she was speaking about
the group you represent, the Congressional Black Caucus, she
                                      708

said--and I think maybe some of you, in the statements just made,
probably have indicated to me that you understand this--26 mem-
bers of the Congressional Black Caucus don't represent 30 million
black Americans, any more than 26 white Congressmen could rep-
resent 200 million white Americans. That was her opinion.

  Besides that, we have polls--and I know we cannot make deci-
sions here in the Congress based upon public opinion polls, and
maybe part of the problem with Congress is maybe too often we do,
but we have polls showing a majority of black Americans support
the confirmation of Judge Thomas to the Supreme Court, and only
this week, the ABC News poll showed 58 percent of black Ameri-
cans support Judge Thomas' confirmation.

  I also had an article that I had collected for this hearing that
quoted then Lt. Gov. Douglas Wilder, speaking out, espousing what
I think are some of the same ideas as Judge Clarence Thomas
might advocate, and I would read just a couple of sentences from
the Washington Post story in the fall of 1986:

  In speech after speech, Wilder, who surprised many politicians with his November
5th election here, is telling black audiences something that they say white politi-
cians can't suggest--stop making excuses, and take control of your destiny.

  And then going on to quote.

  But Wilder, a 55 year-old Richmond lawyer who calls himself a conservative on
many issues, is delivering his message with lowkey rhetoric that warns blacks not to
expect government to resolve many of their problems.

  So I don't feel like I can ask you questions, just kind of give you
some idea of some wrestling that goes on as I compare your opin-
ions with those of other black Americans.

  I guess I would just close by expressing my view that Judge
Thomas shouldn't be condemned because he challenged the status
quo in his search for new answers to some old problems. He prob-
ably was able to do a better job of that as a policymaker than he is
going to be able to do as a Supreme Court Justice, but he will be in
a powerful position and will be a leader for these causes, even
though it is interpreting law rather than helping to make law.

  Well, I appreciate your listening to me, and I also appreciate
your testimony.

  Mr. CONYERS. Senator Grassley, could I just point out to you that
the NAACP had a discussion--as a matter of fact, they met with
Judge Thomas--and there was one chapter that decided not to go
along with the decision to urge that his nomination be rejected,
and that was the chapter in Compton, CA. That was out of approxi-
mately 2,200 chapters across the country, and I think it really illus-
trates the exception rather than the rule.

  I might also point out in my own district, I can tell you quite as-
suredly that there is no majority of people who support Clarence
Thomas. What we have is a phenomenon I'd like to just explain
that might make you rest a little bit more easily about what seems
to be support for Judge Thomas.

  When Judge Thomas, African-American, was nominated to suc-
ceed Justice Thurgood Marshall, nationally, black America was
overjoyed. I would warrant to you that 90-something percent of
black America had never heard of Clarence Thomas before. With
all due respect to him; he was an inside-the-beltway government
bureaucrat. But as we began to reveal the difficulty with his track
                                      709

record and the reasons that we opposed him, which spread not just
from the Congressional Black Caucus but through the church lead-
ership, the civil rights community, the labor community, women's
organizations, the understanding of him has completely changed.
And I think that you should really understand that dynamic. We
were so happy to have a black name that that led to immediate
support, regardless of whether we knew him or not.

  Mr. STOKES. Senator, if I could just make an additional point
here, the lady who spoke to you is absolutely right in the sense
that we do not speak for all black Americans, nor do we presume
that the 26 of us in the Congressional Black Caucus can speak for
all Americans.

  First, while many of us represent in our individual congressional
districts, majority black constituents, we also represent white
Americans. Some of us have congressional districts that are a ma-
jority white as opposed to being majority black. And we don't pre-
sume that we can speak for all white Americans, either, by virtue
of that in our districts.

  What we do, I think, claim is this. We are not self-appointed or
self-acclaimed leaders. Every 2 years, we do what you have to do in
the Senate every 6 years, and that is go back to the people and get
elected again. We go back every 2 years. We get elected, and we
represent individually 550,000 people. So collectively, there are 26
of us representing 550,000 people, both black and white, who go to
the polls and vote for us.

  So to that degree, we think we speak for those people to whom
we go back every 2 years with a record, and they then vote upon us
to return to the Congress based upon that record.

  Mr. OWENS. Senator, I don't want to be redundant. I want to say
pretty much the same thing. There are a lot of people who trivia-
lize and try to minimize the importance of elected officials, but as
one fellow elected official to another, you know what we go
through to get elected, and you know that those of us who are in
office through this process do represent the majority of the people
in our districts. And some of us have been in public office for more
than 20 years, so I think we speak not as self-appointed leaders,
but we speak with great authority. And if you look across the coun-
try at elected officials not only in Congress but in State legislatures
and city legislatures, you will find that the overwhelming majority
of those elected officials feel the same way we do about the ap-
pointment of Clarence Thomas.

  Mr. WASHINGTON. Senator, let me only add the point that I was
attempting to make earlier and perhaps did not make clear
enough. It is unnecessary to attack one person in order to state
their point of view, so I would ask you to look with a jaundiced eye
upon those, because we are elected, as are the Members of the
Senate. The people that you are talking to are either anointed or
appointed, but not elected; 25 of the 26 black Americans who have
been elected by white, Hispanic, Asian, black, other people to the
Congress of the United States have stated our position. That should
not subject us to attack; they shouldn't attack the body politic be-
cause they disagree with the result.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me point something out, if I may, to my col-
leagues which I found interesting, I thought insightful, and I think
                                         710

somewhat illuminating about what still amazes me after so many
years of getting less than equal treatment in this country. Black
Americans did what I suspect almost no one else would do. Upon
the announcement of Mr. Thomas to be the nominee, notwithstand-
ing the fact that he was black, over 60 percent of black Americans
had an open mind--over 60 percent, from all the polls I read, said
"We're not sure; let's see what he has."

  Now, I have not made my judgment on him yet, but I think that
is astounding. Everyone likes to assume the point that you made,
Congressman Washington, in such an articulate fashion, that you
point out is not true--that blacks all think alike. Here, a black
man was appointed to the bench, and almost two-thirds of black
America said, notwithstanding that, "I am going to withhold judg-
ment until I find out more about him." I thought that was astound-
ing and quite a compliment.

  Mr. LEWIS. Let me just add, Mr. Chairman, I think you make the
point that as American and as black American--I think as a
people--we are very considerate. We are kind, we are compassion-
ate, and we have a great deal of pride. And I think a lot of blacks
supported Thomas when they heard that he had been nominated
because they were proud of the fact that a black was nominated.
And when they got more information, they started looking and
moving the other way.

  Another point I want to make is that the National Baptist Con-
vention, which came out against Clarence Thomas, represents more
than 10 million African Americans. The black church is probably
the most powerful, most influential group in the African American
community, and this is the largest black religious institution.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter--oh, I'm sorry, I beg your
pardon, Senator Grassley. I thought you were finished.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I'm done, except I want to make one state-
ment to clarify that the poll I referred to of 58 percent black Amer-
icans' support for Thomas was taken the 13th to the 15th, so it was
after he had been testifying before us for 4 days. So these people
have had an opportunity to view his philosophy as well as just his
name and who he is.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I join with my colleagues in welcoming you, our fellow members
of Congress, to this hearing. The brief exchange between Senator
Thurmond and this caucus, I think, was historical in a sense, and
an underlying sense that touched some very, very important feel-
ings.
  The issue of affirmative action, I think, is a big one, and I have
expressed before my regret that we didn't do more about it sub-
stantively, but that's what I would like to discuss with you gentle-
men for a few minutes today.
  I believe that these hearings have had the benefit of having
people focus on a substantive issue, not as much as I would have
liked, but Judge Thomas has advocated a position in opposition to
affirmative action on the grounds that as to the minorities which it
purports to help, that he feels that it is in fact harmful. He feels it
fosters a notion that the minorities are disabled, fosters a notion
that the minorities are in need of handouts and takes away self-
                                         711

respect. As to those who are in the majorities who are displaced,
there is a sense of resentment, of unfairness, of being displaced by
individuals with lesser qualifications. And he articulates a view
that there is a significant increase in racial divisiveness.

  Now, he has articulated these views in the context of an individ-
ual who has pulled himself up by his bootstraps or--perhaps not by
his bootstraps, because some say he had no boots--by his kneecaps,
who has become a very prominent individual, and perhaps more
than any African-American since Justice Thurgood Marshall--
aside from athletes, and there is the big concern about whether
athletes are too much a role model in our society. But he has
thrust himself on the national scene in a way that no African-
American has in modern times as a role model and articulating a
view of self-help, really sort of rugged self-help.

  The comment that I'd like to ask you to make is in response to
two questions. One is even if you don't agree with this articulation
of opposition to affirmative action, doesn't it have a reasonable
basis? And secondly, doesn't Judge Thomas have the potentiality to
be a real vibrant role model for African-American youngsters who
won't understand the nuances of the Griggs case or the Johnson
case or local 28, or don't know all the things that have happened in
this hearing room, but simply see an African-American who has at-
tained tremendous stature by pulling himself up with his own en-
ergies?

  Congressman Conyers, may we start with you?
  Mr. CONYERS. Yes, I am delighted to respond to your question,
Senator Specter, because I am sure at this stage of the hearing we
must all know that he was a beneficiary of affirmative action as
much as anyone has ever been in the country. And what I find
ironic is that after Yale University Law School, which used affirm-
ative action and was happy to bring him in, and he succeeded well,
that we find now that he doesn't think other people should use
that same method.
  That seems to me to refer to the kind of character that I'm not
really particularly proud of. I didn't like the reference that he
made, speaking of how much role model he is going to be, about his
sister who worked very hard at a hospital and for one short period
of time had to go on public assistance. He held that up as the spec-
tacle of why he didn't like welfare. I was absolutely shocked to
hear that.
   So you won't hear me agreeing that he is a new role model
second only to athletes which you and I rightly agree may be over-
valued. I see him, as a matter of fact, doing exactly the wrong
thing about the right strategy. When we talk about these legal sys-
tems of class action and affirmative action and patterns of practice,
looking for result rather than intent, these may be legal theories
that may slip unnoticed in the general public, but I think that they
stamp him as the wrong guardian of constitutionally derived reme-
dies that we are struggling so hard to get into effect and on the
books.
  Two of you have worked with us and members of the conference
committee on the failed 1990 Civil Rights Act that was vetoed by a
President who now threatens to veto yet another civil rights bill
that we are toiling with. These kinds of principles to me, when I
                                      712

think of Judge Thomas being elevated, I see more problem being
created. I see us moving backward and not forward. And race won't
help him there. A poverty-stricken background is of no use to us in
what we think he is going to do based on what he has done in the
past.

  Senator SPECTER. Congressman Stokes.
  Mr. STOKES. Thank you, Senator Specter.
  The manner in which you have characterized the positions taken
by Judge Thomas is what really frightens me about him. I think
that for one who has been the beneficiary of affirmative action to
say, "Now, I've got mine; you get yours the best way you can"; "It
was okay for me, but you ought not have affirmative action"--that
frightens me.
  Black Americans and other minorities who are in need of affirm-
ative action aren't really asking for anything special. All they are
asking for, Senator Specter, is under our Constitution the guaran-
tee of opportunity and equality that is given to all Americans
under our Constitution. That is not asking for a handout. When the
person who is discriminated against in the marketplace or in the
employment place asks just to have an equal opportunity--not
preference, not priority, just an equal opportunity to earn a decent
living--that's not a handout.
  It is Judge Thomas' attitude toward people who need relief, his
attitude when he was head of the EEOC of trying to get away from
class actions and reduce it down to individual action with the
knowledge that what that did was to hurt the masses of cases--
that is disturbing to me in the same way that Congressman Con-
yers has already mentioned.
  A man who had the attitude he had toward his own sister and
her children; the references that he made to them publicly before
conservative black groups, while he made his points with the Presi-
dent and other conservatives, that this man can attack his own
family. And it turns out that he really wasn't telling the truth
about his sister. While she was on welfare at that time, and he was
referring to the children as learning how to cheat now and so
forth, later information came out that all of them really worked
when they had an opportunity to do so.
  But these are things that frighten me about him. I don't think,
in the sense of a role model for black Americans, that a Judge
Thomas will ever be the role model that a Thurgood Marshall is.
  Senator SPECTER. Congressman Owens?
  Mr. OWENS. I think the thinking that you have set forth as being
the position of Judge Thomas with respect to affirmative action
and blacks not receiving any special treatment is a very backward
kind of reasoning, very limited, lacking in compassion, and basical-
ly dishonest to any black in America to take that position because
there is a cornered reality which blacks in America live through
every day.
  All Judge Thomas needs to do is take off his suit and his tie and
walk through 1 day of life in this city or anywhere else in the coun-
try and he will experience some things to let him know that blacks
are treated in a very special way.
  Prejudice and discrimination are a part of the reality of human-
kind all over the globe. We have all kinds of conflicts that people
                                         713

set up or reasons that they set up to discriminate against each
other. Often, when both groups are white it is religion or some
other ethnic difference, but when you are dealing with blacks, you
are dealing with people who are highly visible, and the degree to
which discrimination is expressed against us is far greater.

  And any black who says that we are just like everybody else and
should never expect to have any kind of special treatment in order
to overcome certain problems is basically dishonest. They are dis-
honest because of the current reality; they are dishonest because,
as an intellectual, they want to disregard all of history.

  Blacks are the descendants of African slaves who were brought
here against their will, not like other immigrants. We were, for 300
years, treated as slaves and suddenly set free with very little or
nothing to compensate. There was a social experiment called the
Freed Man's Bureau. Thank God for that, because it created his-
torically black colleges.

  But, basically, nothing happened when the slaves were set free to
deal with the problem that they had their labor stolen from them
all those years. They had no property, et cetera, et cetera. So the
whole concept of reparations has to enter into dealing with the de-
scendants of African slaves today, but we refuse to accept that.

  In every group, there is a certain percentage who will overcome
and excel no matter what the conditions are, no matter how great
their pressure. There is a certain percentage who will overcome.
The majority of the people are just normal human beings; they will
not be able to overcome without some special help.

  We accept the principle of reparations in the case of war. One
nation loses a war; they have to pay. We also accepted it in the
case of Israel and the Jews under the Nazis. We went one moral
step further, and oppressed people who had not won the war were
paid reparations by the Germans because of the conditions they
subjected those people to during the course of the Nazi period.

  I am not asking for reparations in the payment of dollars to indi-
vidual blacks, but some consideration of what--300 years of slav-
ery, followed by years of de facto discrimination that impact on a
people has to be taken into consideration.

  Any person, black or white, who is an intellectual and knows his-
tory and wants to disregard this totally, I find, you know, either
naive or basically dishonest, and I think in the case of Judge
Thomas it is basic dishonesty.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, my time is up, Mr. Chairman. May the
answers continue?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Mr. WASHINGTON. I will be brief in my response, not to say that
the others weren't, of course, because they are senior to me.

  The first question you asked is about--you ran off a litany of
things dealing with--and you arrived at the correct assessment
that we are dealing with, unfortunately, a period of more racial di-
visiveness in this country than any of us would think ordinarily
possible in 1991; that we were on a course where things were get-
ting better. Now, it appears that things are either standing still or
moving backwards.

  And the question you raised, as I understood it, Senator, had to
do with Judge Thomas' views about affirmative action vis-a-vis
                                      714

that, and the question was does his position have a reasonable
basis. The answer to that question is no because it misappends, if
you will, the very touchstone of what discrimination is.

  Judge Thomas' view is that whatever has happened to him, good
or bad, has happened to him as an individual. Nothing could be
farther from the truth. Prejudice is prejudgment because of group
identification. People can't prejudge you if they don't know you,
except either you are too tall, Senator Simpson, or you are too
short or you are too black or you are too this or you are too that,
based upon group identification.

  It oversimplifies and overlooks the fact that, as my colleague has
said, the prejudice that is visited upon black people or Hispanics or
any other group of individuals is born of someone having catego-
rized them as being not as qualified to have the job. So, that is not
going to go away.

  If you did away with all affirmative action, then there are white
people and black people and Hispanic people and all kinds of
people who think that the view of the sunset is somehow enhanced
if they are standing on somebody else's shoulders. Nothing is going
to change about that. There are always going to be white people
who think the black guy got the job because he was black rather
than because he was qualified.

  We as leaders have to ensure that regardless of how we feel
about these laws, if these are laws on the books that are bound to
be enforced that overcome the vestiges of past discrimination, we
can't play political cannon fodder with them, it seems to me. We
lend ourselves to that kind of notion when we get out and play pol-
itics with notions about job discrimination and the like.

  We know that Griggs decided that there would be remedies avail-
able to overcome the built-in headwinds as long as the headwinds
continue to exist for women or for Hispanics or for--one of these
days, it is going to be for white males. A majority of people in this
country are not going to be white males forever. Demographers al-
ready tell us that. So when you become the minority, then will the
built-in headwinds be opposing you? I think so.

  In answer to the second part of the question of does he have the
potential to be a role model, he has the same potential as in Ru-
dyard Kipling's admonition in the poem, "he travels the fastest
who travels alone"--"when by the aid which he has done and the
aid his own which he has done, he travels the fastest who travels
alone." That is the role model he presents. He presents a role
model that if you want to get ahead in life, don't come up through
the ranks the same way that you and all the rest of us do; get in
the short line.

  That is exactly what he has done. He went over, he looked at the
line over here on this side, and he said that the line of black people
who want to move up is shorter over there, so he got in the short
line, and that is the role model that he presents for black Ameri-
cans, I think.

  Mr. LEWIS. Senator, let me just state that in spite of all of the
changes, in spite of all of the progress that we have made in this
country during the past few years, the scars and stains of racism
are still deeply embedded in American society. So there is still a
need for affirmative action. I think you have a nominee who would
                                         715

like to destroy the bridge of affirmative action that brought him
across. He is forgetting those that have been left out and left
behind.

  And on the question of a role model, I think we want someone
who is going to be a headlight rather than a taillight when it
comes to the issue of simple justice and simple fairness. Is this man
the type of role model that we want for our children, someone who
is defiant, evasive and inconsistent? It is not a role model I want
for my son.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank my fellow
legislators for coming. I appreciate that, and I do understand your
terribly deep concern. I am sure that the deliberations within your
caucus were very spirited because I know more than several mem-
bers of your caucus, and quite well, and I enjoy my work with you
as legislators. We have been on conference committees together,
and panels and forums, and that has been an opportunity for me to
know you better.
  And so, you know, I know that it was a spirited discussion you
had in your caucus. We are going to have another group before us
today, black lawyers, where the vote on Clarence Thomas was 113
to 104. That is reality in this one. The black community is split for
the first time in my memory here on this panel. It is very real, and
I understand that and it is troubling to you.
  And the things you talked about, the EEOC and comments about
the sister and the affirmative action--all of those things were ad-
dressed by the nominee. The sister sat right here with him for 5
days--an example of family affection. The mother, the son--all
those things have been covered; all parties have been treated
fairly.
  No one is going to be shut out, but it seems to me that it is the
diversity of thought and philosophy of this man that is the fear,
the real fear. That is a terribly presumptuous statement of mine
because there is no way I can even identify. But I do think that it
is unfortunate to see sometimes a white legislator telling a black
person how a black person should feel. I don't like that one. I bet
you don't like it either.
  So this is not the usual black conservative; that is not who this
Clarence Thomas is, and that is why he has got to be a big puzzle
to you and somewhat to us. But I don't think he is dishonest. I
think he is fair, I think he is compassionate, and I think he is sen-
sitive. I think he is going to be a tremendous addition to the Su-
preme Court and he is going to surprise everybody.
  Craig, I heard what you said about you and I have to buy our
shirts in a separate place. We have a wingspread of about 37xh
inches. And we are different, but I enjoy you and admire you great-
ly. John Conyers and I have had some tough words back down the
line, and I respect him. We have been on conferences. I know Con-
gressman Stokes somewhat, but Kweisi Mfume and Don Payne,
and you have got a lot of wonderful people in your group. And so
here we go. We will just try to do our best.
                                      716

  I really don't have any questions, but I can certainly understand
the anguish and the heavy concern that you have. I have no ques-
tions.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  I am sure that one thing the five Congressmen and I share in
common is that if--if--Clarence Thomas is approved by the Senate
and goes on the Court, it will be our sincere hope that he does sur-
prise you. You, personally. We hope when you are on the Court you
and the President are having lunch someday, and you will say, Oh,
my Lord, what have we wrought. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, you were gone from the cham-
ber off and on for several minutes, and Orrin and I were going to
take over this committee. So think how lucky you were. I can
assure you that he will surprise me.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sure that day may come again when you all
take over the committee. Hopefully--by that time, I will have no
hair, but maybe not. It is going rapidly. I am doing my best.
  At any rate, I want to thank you. I think it was Congressman
Conyers who mentioned his sister. We will enter in the record--but
I think I am not mistaken when I say this--I am not making the
comment relative to Thomas himself, but relative to his sister who
did sit here the whole time. She is a remarkable woman. As I un-
derstand, this woman held down two minimum-wage jobs and had
an aunt who was taking care of her children while she could hold
these two minimum-wage jobs. The aunt became ill. Only when the
aunt became ill did Clarence Thomas' sister--again, I don't care
what Clarence Thomas said about it. I am not talking about his
comment, but just because her name has been mentioned a number
of times.
  As I understand it, only when the aunt became ill and could no
longer take care of her children during the day while she worked
her two minimum-wage jobs did she have to quit, get relief for a
period of time until she could rectify the situation and then went
back to work at a local hospital and has worked since them. Quite
a remarkable woman.
  Quite frankly, I have no reason to doubt it. I have heard nothing
to controvert what I have just said. I may have one of the details
off, but that is the essence of it at a minimum. We will put in the
record precisely what the situation is. But I kind of always thought
that was the reason why we had public assistance, for people who
had no choice.
  I don't know many Americans who like working at all. A lot of
them would work in that circumstance two minimum-wage jobs.
Well, that is not true. There are tens of thousands who do it and
have to do it. But at any rate, not just because you mentioned it,
John, but her name has been mentioned off and on for the last 7
days, and I just think the record should note she is a remarkable
person facing the struggle that tens of thousands of Americans
have faced in their lives, black and white.
  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of all us here, we want to
thank this committee for the unusual amount of time that has
been afforded to us to exchange these views. We are very grateful
for that.
                                      717
  The CHAIRMAN. Simply stated, you are important. Simply stated.
It is a simple fact of life. And I thank you for all coming over. You
have lent a great deal to this deliberation and given us all some-
thing to think about. I am just delighted in my very short years of
practice before coming to the Senate at age 29 that I was not on
the other side of a case in the courtroom with you, Congressman
Washington. I now know why you were a successful trial lawyer.
  Having said that, let me thank you all again for being here, and
we will continue to seek your counsel on many other things. And,
John, look over the crime bill.
  Mr. CONYERS. Thank you. May we be excused?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU may be excused. Thank you.

                   STATEMENT OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS
                    ON THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS

      AS AIT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

                                           September 19, 1991

                                               Introduction
         It is a special pleasure to testify before our friends and
colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Representatives of
the Congressional Black Caucus have testified at Supreme Court
confirmation hearings "before, and we truly appreciate this
opportunity to once again express our views on a vitally
important nomination.

        Although as Members of the Congressional Black Caucus we
represent substantial numbers of African Americans, as Members of
Congress we^ also represent whites, Hispanics, Asians, Native
Americans, older Americans, people with disabilities, and
Americans of every stripe. It is on behalf of all Americans that
we oppose the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas for a seat on
the United States Supreme Court.

         Our members have been chief sponsors of every piece of
legislation touching on civil rights and liberties, women's
rights, and equal opportunity for a quarter of a century. A
large number of our members serve on the House Education and
Labor Committee and several others serve on the Judiciary
Committee, thetwocommittees which have the major responsibility
for overseeing the agencies and laws Judge Thomas was responsible
for.

         Judge Thomas has testified before Congressional committees
56 times (55 published; 1 unpublished). Yet this extraordinary
number of appearances is not reflective of a long tenure in
public service or governmental office, and very few of his
appearances were routine.

       In fact, most of those appearances stemmed from controversies
in which he was involved and reflected the exasperation of House
Committees with his administration of the law. The publication
of an unusual number of General Accounting Office (GAO) reports,
most of them highly critical of the nominee's administration of
the laws under his jurisdiction, underscore this view.

        After carefully examining the Thomas record, we have
concluded that during his government service Judge Thomas failed
to carry outhis constitutional obligation to hisoath of office
                                    720

to enforce the laws of the land. Moreover, Judge Thomas exhibited
a pervasive disrespect for Congress and the legislative process.
It is our belief that his disregard for legal precedent and the
rule of law undermines his privilege to a seat on the Supreme
Court.

         The Supreme Court 'belongs to all Americans. More than any
other, it is the institution that curbs excesses by other
government bodies, that safeguards the rights and liberities of
every citizen, and that serves as a unifying force, enabling our
nation to survive as a constitutional democracy longer than any
other.

         Beyond this tie that all citizens have to the Supreme Court,
however, the Court has a special significance to African
Americans. Throughout our nation's history, the actions of the
Supreme Court have had a powerful influence on the lives of
African Americans -- for better or worse. During the 19th
century, the Supreme Court first decided that African slaves were
property with no rights that a white man was bound to respect.
Then, after the Civil War, the Supreme Court helped bring an end
to Reconstruction, with decisions that gutted original civil
rights laws and imposed the judicial invention of "separate but
equal."

         In contrast, in the latter half of the 20th century, the
Supreme Court's interpretations of the Constitution have provided
African Americans with long overdue freedom. The Supreme Court's
decision in Brown v. Board of Education and subsequent civil
rights cases helped rid the nation of the scourge of MJim Crow".
These decisions created conditions in which African Americans
could improve their economic, social, and political status.
Without the Supreme Court, it is doubtful that most Members of
the Congressional Black Caucus would be in Congress, that General
Colin Powell would be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, or
that Judge Clarence Thomas would be a nominee to the Supreme
Court.

         No one individual is more responsible for the Supreme
Court's contemporary role as the guardian for equal rights than
Justice Thurgood Marshall. First as an advocate and then as a
distinguished jurist, Justice Marshall is responsible for most of
-the great equal protection decisions of the past 40 years and for
the legacy of opportunity that we are struggling to make tangible
for Billions of Americans. The nation'? debt to Justice Marshall
is enormous and can never be repaid.

         The nominee before you has been offered by President George
Bush as a worthy successor to Justice Marshall. As an African
American and as someone who overcame humble beginnings, we are
told, Judge Thomas will understand the needs of those who face
similar struggles. Even if these claims were not made on Judge
Thomas' behalf, it is inevitable that Judge Thomas will be
assessed as Justice Marshall's successor.

         Regrettably, fchen we examine the nominee's record -- not
only his proformance -as a government official -- but his
writings, speeches, and remarks over the past decade, it is clear
that Judge Thomas is not a worthy successor to Justice Marshall.
Our differences with the nominee do not stem merely from
reasonable and understandable differences over particular cases
or remedies. Rather, Judge Thomas repudiates the fundamental
role of the Supreme Court as guardian of our Constitutional
freedoms and rejects the legacy of Justice Marshall.
                                      721

                    On behalf of 25 of the 26 members of the Congressional Black
           Caucus, we respectfully urge you to reject the nomination of the
           Judge Clarence Thomas.

CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS STATEMENT

      I. The Nominee's Failures to Enforce the Law and his Contempt
               for the Legislative Process

               A. Failures at the EEOC

                        Two years ago, 14 members of the House of
               Representatives, including 12 chairs of committees having
               jurisdiction over the EEOC and five members of the Black
               Caucus, wrote to President Bush asking that Thomas not be
               nominated to the Court of Appeals.

                        After reviewing the record, the writers of the letter
               said that Thomas had "resisted Congressional oversight and
               been less than candid with legislators about agency
               enforcement policies." They concluded that he had
               demonstrated an "overall disdain for the rule of law and
               that his record as "EEOC Chair sends a clear message to
               those who have suffered job discrimination that he is
               insensitive to the injustice they have experienced."

                        These were harsh conclusions, but they are based on a
               we11-documented record, including the following:

                        o As Chair of the EEOC, Thomas persistently refused
                                 to use the mechanisms provided by law after
                                 Congress earmarked funds specifically for this
                                 type of enforcement and threatened to cut the
                                 budget for the office of the Chair and members of
                                 the EEOC. In 1985, 40 members of Congress wrote
                                 to Thomas expressing "grave concern" over EEOC's
                                 failure to pursue class action cases.1 This
                                 refusal to use the one mechanism that has been
                                 essential to the elimination of discrimination
                                 flows directly from Judge Thomas's personal view
                                 that "group remedies" are inappropriate.

                        o Also underlying Thomas's refusal to pursue
                                 systemic cases was his opposition to the employee
                                 selection guidelines. These guidelines were the
                                 bajses fjpr the Supreme Court's unanimous decision
                                 in Griggs v. Duke Power Company in 1971 holding
                                 that employer practices that had a disparate
                                 impact violated Title VII unless justified by
                                 business necessity. The guidelines and Griaas
                                 were the bases of great progress in equal job
                                 opportunity in the 1970s. When Thomas was
                                 thwarted in his effort to repeal the guidelines,
                                 he simply refused to enforce them, leaving EEOC to
                                 file only the kinds of cases "that employers write
                                 off as the cost of doing business."2

                                      722

                           o Despite a Supreme Court decision specifically
                                    endorsing goals and timetables and the failure of
                                    a Meese-Thomas effort to repeal the Executive
                                    Order authorizing such remedies, Thomas declared
                                     in 1986 that EEOC had abandoned the remedy and
                                    would no longer approve settlements involving the
                                    use of such goals.

                           o Through indifferent and negligent administration,
                                    Thomas allowed some 13,000 claims under the Age
                                    Discrimination in Employment Act to lapse without
                                    action, requiring special legislation by Congress
                                    to restore individual rights.4

                           o As Chairman, Thomas also failed to enforce the age
                                    discrimination law in dealing with the obligations
                                    of employers to make pension contributions for
                                    workers over the age of 65. Thomas dragged his
                                     feet, allowing employers to freeze the pension
                                    accounts of people who worked beyond the age of
                                    65, even after Congress had clarified the law and
                                    a federal court had held that EEOC delays were
                                     "entirely unjustified and unlawful, at worst
                                     deceptive to the public."5 Thomas only backed down
                                     after further Congressional pressure and
                                     objections from the IRS.

                            o During his years at the EEOC, Thomas failed to
                                     challenge gender-based wage discrimination,
                                     embracing an analysis by Thomas Sowell that
                                     asserts|hat women prefer jobs that pay less and
                                     that black women fare better in the labor force
                                     than white women.6

                   B. Failures at the Department of Education

                            The nominee's record as a lawless administrator at the
                   EEOC is of a piece with his defaults in his previous post -
                   as director of the Office of Civil Rights in the Department
                   of Education.

                            There, he made startling admissions at a 1982 hearing
                   in federal district court concerning charges that his office
                   had violated court-ordered requirements for processing civil
                   rights cases.

                            Q: And aren't you in effect -- But you're going ahead
                            and violating those time frames; isn't that true?
                            You're violating them in compliance reviews on all
                            occasions, practically, and you're violating them on
                            complaints most of the time, or half the time; isn't
                            that true?

                            A: That's right.

                 comply with this 90 day period; isn't that true?

                 A: That's right.

                 Q: And meanwhile, you are violating a court order
                 rather grievously, aren't you?

                    A: Yes.7 .

         Following the hearing, Judge Pratt concluded that while
there had been some problems in past administrations with
compliance, the difference between David Tatel (Thomas's
predecessor) and Thomas "is the difference between day and
night."1 Judge Pratt found that the court's order had "been
violated in many important respects" and that under Thomas,
the view was that fre will carry out (civil rights statutes]
in our own way and according to our own schedule."' This episode
is hardly comforting when we consider that a justice must himself
respect and follow the law.

         C. The Nominee's Disrespect for the Legislative Process

                 The failures by Judge Thomas to enforce the civil
         rights laws he was responsible for administering have been
        matched by unprecedented expressions of hostility toward
         Congress for scrutinizing and criticizing his agency's
         performance.

                  For example, in its effort to deal with the lapsed
         complaints under the Age Discrimination Act, Congress was
         continually frustrated by misrepresentations made by Thomas
         about the severity of the problem, leading the Senate
         Special Committee on the Aging to find that:

                           "The EEOC misled the Congress and the public on
                          the extent to which ADEA charges had been
                          permitted to exceed the statute of limitations."10

                 Yet, the moral drawn by the nominee from this episode,
         in which the rights of older people were restored only
         through painstaking investigation and corrective action by
         Congress, was that Congress was at fault. He said:

                           "My agency will be virtually shut down by a

Senator Pryor, the current Chairman of the Committee, has made it
clear that the misrepresentations were those of Clarence Thomas,
stating that "I was dismayed to learn about several erroneous
statements made by Chairman Thomas... Those statements are
certainly misleading..." Cong. Rec. S 1542 (daily ed. Feb. 22,
1990).

                          getting a Senate Committee to subpoena volumes
                          of EEOC records... Thus a single, unelected
                          official can disrupt civil rights enforcement

                                 and all in the name of protecting rights.""

                 This hostile, unresponsive treatment of any
         Congressional criticism of his performance was repeated by
        Mr. Thomas on many occasions. In 1988, the General
        Accounting Office issued an audit report in response to a
         request from now retired Congressman Augustus Hawkins, then
         Chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, to
         look into EEOC's record of investigating and settling
        complaints. The GAO report set out facts showing a mounting
        backlog, delays in investigation and a decrease in the
        average amounts of settlements.12

                 Thomas's reply was to cast doubts on the independence
and integrity of the GAO, complaining that the report was a
"hatchet job" and adding that:

                          "It's a shame Congress can use GAO as a lap
                          dog to come up with anything it wants..."13

                 On other occasions, the nominee has offered the
 following opinions of Congress and the legislative process:

                 o Congress has "proven to be an enormous obstacle to
                          the positive enforcement of civil rights laws that
                          protect individual freedom."14

                 o "Congress is no longer primarily a deliberative or
                          even a law making body."15

                 o As EEOC Chair, he was "defiant in the face of some
                          petty despots in Congress."16

                 o A committee request for semi-annual reports on the
                          EEOC's work was an "intrusion into the
                          deliberations of an administrative agency."17

                 o "As Ollie North made perfectly clear last summer
                           it is Congress that is out of control." [emphasis
                           in original]11

         Our concern is not that Thomas engaged in spirited
discussions in public or with members of Congress. We are all
accustomed to the rough and tumble of legislative and political
debates and we can take it as well as dish it out.

        Rather, something of more fundamental importance is at stake
here. Faced on many occasions with facts indicating that his
agency was not enforcing the law, Clarence Thomas chose neither
to promise improved performance nor to engage in a substantive
discussion of the legislative and administrative issues. He
elected, rather, to challenge the legitimacy of the legislative
process and the good faith of those who are a part of it.

         Even without more, the Thomas record of disdain for law
should be viewed as a disqualifying factor in his quest for a
seat on the Supreme Court. His actions and utterances should
also set off alarm bells in this Committee about what may be
expected of Judge Thomas should he be confirmed. We will discuss
these concerns more fully later in this testimony.

II. The Nominee's Repudiation of the Role of the Supreme Court
as Guardian of Constitutional Rights and Liberties

         Supporters of Clarence Thomas's nomination seek to portray
opponents as people who disagree with the nominee about "busing"
and "quotas." This caricature of the opposition is both crude
and inaccurate. An examination of the nominee's writings and
speeches makes it abundantly clear that he quarrels not just with
a few decisions or remedies but with the great body of equal
protection jurisprudence that has made progress possible in the
latter half of the 20th century.

        A. The Nominee's Attack on Court Interpretation of the
Voting Rights Act. In 1988, Judge Thomas assailed Supreme Court
decisions applying the Voting Rights Act, with the following
words:

                          "The Voting Rights Act of 1965 certainly was

                           crucial legislation. It has transformed the
                           policies of the South. Unfortunately, many of the
                           Court's decisions in the area of voting rights
                           have presupposed that blacks, whites, Hispanics,
                           and other ethnic groups will inevitably vote in
                           blocs. Instead of looking at the right to vote as
                           an individual right, the Court has regarded the
                           right as protected when the individual's racial or
                           ethnic group has sufficient clout.""

                  Elsewhere, the nominee has attacked the 1982 amendments
         to section 2 of the Voting Rights Act on which the court
         decisions were based as "unacceptable".20

                  The decisions referred to by Judge Thomas presumably
         are White v. Register. 412 U.S. 755 (1971) and Thornburct v.
        Ginales. 478 U.S. 30 (1986). The latter decision
         implemented the 1982 amendments to section 2, which
         prohibits election laws and practices with a racially
        discriminatory effect. The most important application of
         this prohibition is to forbid schemes that dilute minority
         voting strength. As the NAACP Legal Defense Fund has
        written:

                  "Judge Thomas's criticism of section 2 and the related
                  Supreme Court cases reflects a fundamental
                 misunderstanding of the law. Neither section 2 nor
                 those decisions, assume that whites or minorities vote
                  in racial blocs; in a section 2 case like Ginqles the
                 burden is on the plaintiff to adduce evidence proving
                 that racial bloc voting does occur in the jurisdiction
                 at issue. Where that, in fact is the case, the
                  individual's right to vote as well can be rendered
                 meaningless by a system which assures that the
                 candidate supported by black voters has no chance
                 whatsoever of actually being elected."21

                  In 1981 and 1982 we in the Black Caucus worked with
        many members of this Committee to craft amendments to the
        Voting Rights Act that would provide a meaningful
        opportunity for minority citizens to elect candidates of
        their choosing. At the same time we specifically eschewed
         in the statute any notion of "proportional representation"
        or "group rights."

                 Our work is surely not beyond criticism, but for the
        nominee to caricature both the statute and the Court's
         interpretation of it as he has, betrays both his failure to
        understand the issues and his persistent rejection of the
        role of the judiciary in protecting rights established by
        the Constitution or the Congress.

        B. Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action
        For more than a decade, the Supreme Court has struggled to
        balance fairly the interests involved in affirmative action
        cases. While recognizing a need to go beyond formalistic
        declarations of good intentions by employers, the Court has
        sought to assure that the interests of already-employed
        white workers were not "unduly trammeled" by affirmative
        action policies. While recognizing that race-conscious
        remedies ordinarily must be based on the need to overcome a
        history of past racial discrimination or exclusion, the
        Court has recognized the utility of voluntary agreements
        that avoid contentious litigation about liability.

                 Thoughtful observers on all sides of the issue have not
        been reluctant to criticize the Court for "going too far" or
         "not going far enough" on a given matter, but their
        criticism has been tempered by an appreciation of the
        complexity of the issues, the need to discern legislative
         intent that is not always evident and the need to be fair
        and equitable.

                 That is what one might have expected of Clarence
        Thomas, given his position at the EEOC and presumed
        expertise. Instead, Mr. Thomas has approached affirmative
        action issues with an elephant gun, using overblown rhetoric
         instead of careful analysis. His attack on affirmative
        action remedies has been across-the-board and all-
        encompassing. Unlike some proponents of judicial restraint,
        he gives no deference to the will of the majority as
        expressed in Congressional legislation (Fullilove),n nor
        would he permit private employers to act voluntarily to
        remedy their past practices (Weber and Johnson)." And he
        would restrain the authority of courts to order race-
        conscious remedies even in the most aggravated cases of
        discrimination. (Sheet Metal)24

                  The intemperate language used by the nominee in his
         attacks is instructive. The Weber case involved a voluntary
         effort to deal with the long-standing exclusion of black
         workers from the steel industry, and Johnson a voluntary
         effort to deal with entrenched patterns of gender
         discrimination in county government.

                  Yet in Mr. Thomas's lexicon, the facts did not matter.
         Weber was "the egregious example"23 of Court
         misinterpretation of legislative intent. Johnson was
         "just social engineering and we ought to see it for what it
         is."26

                 Most disconcerting, if one expects a Supreme Court
         justice to be committed to the rule of law and to give
        weight to the doctrine of Stare Decisis. is the nominee's
         statement that he hoped that the dissent in Johnsont

                           "will provide guidance for lower courts and a
                          possible majority in future decisions."27

                 As for the Fullilove decision, upholding Congress's
        effort to provide a remedy for the long-standing exclusion
         of minorities from opportunities to become government
        contractors, Thomas said:

                           "Not that there is a great deal of principle in
                          Congress itself. What can one expect of a
                          Congress that would pass the ethnic set-aside law
                          the Court upheld in Fullilove v. Klutznick."2*

                 Concerning the Griaas decision, Thomas declared:

                           "We have permitted sociological and demographic
                          realities to be manipulated to the point of
                          surreality by convenient legal theories such as

                          adverse impact."29

                 His reference of course was to a decision not grounded
         in abstract theory, but in a practical recognition that
         minorities would have an opportunity for economic
         advancement only if barriers to employment that were not
         related to ability to do the job were removed. This
         Committee knows as well as we do that the progress that
         black workers have made in becoming police officers,
         firefighters, skilled construction workers, and over-the-
         road truckers, to name but a few, is due to the liberating
         effects of the Griggs decision that Clarence Thomas scorns.

                 The blunderbuss approach that the nominee has taken to
         equal employment and affirmative action decisions and his
         failure to make fundamental distinctions, created serious
        problems. After the Supreme Court's 1984 decision in the
         Stotts case holding that white workers with seniority could
         not be laid off before less senior minority workers in order
         to protect an affirmative action plan, Thomas argued that
         the decision had to be applied to invalidate affirmative
         action in hiring and promotions as well.30 He was forced to
         abandon this transparent rationale when the Court upheld the
        use of goals and timetables31 and then reverted to an
         explanation based on his "personal disagreement" with the
         Supreme Court's approach.32

         C. Equal Educational Opportunity. The nominee has
         challenged the reasoning of the seminal case of Brown v.
         Board of Education; but far more important, he has
         criticized as a "disastrous series of cases" the Supreme
         Court rulings that gave real content to the Brown
        decision.33 One decision he has singled out for criticism
         is Green v. County School Board of New Kent County. In that
         case, the Court held unanimously that "freedom of choice"
        plans under which children remained segregated unless black

parents and children risked the consequences of requesting
transfer, were inadequate unless actual desegregation
occurred.

         Thomas complained that Green went too far because it
"not only ended segregation but required school
integration."14 In that criticism, offered in 1988. he
echoed the views of two other judges, Parker and
Haynesworth, who took the position that the Brown case
implied no affirmative obligations, but only a duty to cease
formal segregation. Those judges (both of whom were
rejected at different times by the Senate for a seat on the
Supreme Court) spoke many years ago before the Supreme Court
had addressed the question of remedy.

         Judge Thomas's criticism should be clearly understood.
It is not an attack on busing, for in the Green case,
desegregation would have brought less busing not more since
children were being bused for purposes of segregation.
Rather, the Thomas view is that the demands of the
Fourteenth Amendment should be considered satisfied by a
formal disavowal of segregation, even if no desegregation
actually follows. To do more, apparently, would be to
validate the idea that separate is inherently unequal, a
premise that Thomas disputes.

         If the view that Judge Thomas urged in the 1980s had
prevailed earlier, Brown might have become little more than
a formal exercise and millions of children, who like Mr.
Thomas grew up black and poor in the South, would never have
had an opportunity to escape the yoke of segregation. This
is not a vision that black Members of Congress can accept in
a Supreme Court justice.

D. The Nominee's Disdain for the Role of Courts in
Protecting the Poor and Disadvantaaed. In 1986, Mr. Thomas
joined in a report of the White House Working Group on the
Family. The report condemned a series of Supreme Court
decision as having "crippled the potential of public policy
to enforce familial obligations, demand family
responsibility, protect family rights or enhance family
identity."35 Among the decisions condemned was that in
Moore v. Citv of East Cleveland.3* In that decision, the
Court overturned the jail sentence of the grandmother who
had been procecuted and jailed for refusing to evict the 10

        year-old grandson for whom she had cared since infancy, when
        his mother had died. The city insisted that because he
         shared his grandmother's home with a cousin, the 10 year-old
        was an "illegal occupant." The presence of two
        grandchildren in her household violated a local ordinance,
        which limited the definition of a family to exclude
         "cousins."

                 According to the White House Task Force in which
         Clarence Thomas participated, and whose report he signed,
         the Court was wrong to interfere with Ms. Moore's eviction
         and jailing by declaring the eviction unconstitutional.
        The Report accused the Supreme Court of improperly intruding
        on the right of the municipality "to define 'family' in a
        traditional way" in zoning for single-family occupancy. The
        Report denounces the Moore case as among the Supreme Court
        decisions that question whether "the family... retains any
        constitutional standing."37

                 It is clear from Justice Powell's decision in Moore
        that the opposite is the case -- that the decision is based
        on the special constitutional status of the family. Indeed,
        as Justice Brennan noted in a concurring opinion, the
        ordinance if upheld would have had a devastating impact on
        many black families.38

                 The emphasis now being placed on the nominee's life
         story as one of his qualifications for the Court makes his
        view of the Moore case especially ironic. Having been
        raised by his grandfather, he nevertheless joined a report
        that would have resulted in the rending of many extended
         families. From the evidence it appears that his ideological
        opposition to the role of the courts in protecting rights
        and liberties overrides concern about the tragic
        consequences that may flow from such a commitment. Whatever
        the reason, the nominee's position on the Moore case should
        give pause to anyone who believes that once on the Court,
        Thomas's own experience will make him sensitive to the
        plight of minorities and the poor.

III. The Impact of the Nominee's Philosophy and Approach on the
Public Interest

        What emerges from an examination of the nominee's career is
a disturbing pattern of disdain for law, disrespect for the
legislative process under which he was required to function
during his tenure in government, and a sweeping repudiation of

        37 The Family, supra note 35 at p. 11.

        38 431, U.S. 494, 508-10, (Brennan J. concurring).

                                                       14
                                      732

the role of federal courts in protecting the rights and liberties
of people from the dangers of government excess.

         There are other aspects of Mr. Thomas's judicial philosophy
that may bear scrutiny, but we are speaking here of threshold
concerns that are of fundamental importance. If a nominee's
approach to his judicial duties is not grounded in an
understanding and respect for the historic and constitutional
roles of the major institutions of government, it is of little
consequence whether he styles himself a believer in natural law
or of some other theory of rights. He will simply lack the
understanding of constitutional processes and the commitment to
equality before the law that are central to the job of a justice
of the Supreme Court.

         These are not abstract matters; they have implications for
all of us. Over the course of the last decade, on at least a
dozen occasions, we in the Congress have been called upon to
correct through legislation the Supreme Court's
misinterpretations of civil rights statutes that the Congress had
previously enacted. In all of these cases the Court had so
narrowly construed the law that rights or remedies we believed we
had set out in the legislation were denied by a majority of the
justices. In almost all of these cases the legislative effort to
restore rights was successful.

         But as you know well, these legislative struggles have not
been without cost. Each time the issue has arisen we in the
Congress and in the nation have been compelled to fight battles
that most thought had been settled years ago. The legislative
struggles have been attended by a rise in racial tensions and
doubt about the nation's continuing commitment to equality of
opportunity.

        We are engaged in such an effort now with the Civil Rights
Act of 1991, designed to restore the rule of Griqqs V. Duke Power
Company and to undo the harm to equal job opportunity done by
several Supreme Court decisions. This has been a bipartisan
effort and in 1990 more than 60 percent of the members of each
House supported legislation to repair the harm caused by the
Supreme Court's decisions. There are differences, of course,
among us, but if there is one area of agreement in the Congress
it is that once we do enact a law we want the Supreme Court to
pay careful attention to the words used in that law, to the
legislative intent reflected in our committee reports and to the
national commitment to equality of opportunity that gave rise to
our action. The Thomas record while in government requires a
vote of no confidence that Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court
justice will follow the legislative intent reflected in the laws
we enact.

         In the first place, we know that Judge Thomas has expressed

                                                        15
                                      733

strong disagreement with provisions of the Voting Rights Act and
with Title VII as interpreted in the Grioas case. Perhaps more
important, we know that the nominee has frequently expressed open
contempt for the legislative process (speaking on more than one
occasion of "run-amok majorities" and a "Congress that is out of
control") 3' and that he felt free as an administrator to refuse
to enforce laws with which he personally disagreed. What
confidence then can we as legislators have that as a Justice he
will interpret the laws as the Congress has written them?

         Our point should be clearly understood. It will not take a
William Brennan or a Thurgood Marshall to meet the needs that are
expressed here. Jurists such as Felix Frankfurter and John
Harlan, the younger pursued with some consistency a philosophy of
"judicial restraint," gave deference to legislative intent even
when they disagreed with what the legislatures wished to
accomplish. George Bush and his predecessor told us often that
they wanted judges who would "adjudicate" not "legislate," but
they have persistently nominated people to the Court who were
prepared to upset longstanding interpretations of statutory law.
From the record, it appears clear that confirmation of Clarence
Thomas would continue the trend toward a Court that feels free to
act as a super-legislative body in the area of civil rights and
in other spheres as well.

        The Nation already is paying a heavy price in conflict and
disunity from the confrontations that the Court's new majority
has provoked with Congress. In considering this nomination, we
suggest that confirmation of this nominee may well exacerbate
that trend.

IV. CONCLUSION

         Finally, Mr. Chairman, as colleagues and friends we ought to
be able to speak frankly to one another.

         In this hearing you are considering a nominee with a
personal history of overcoming poverty and discrimination, one
that reflects a classical pattern in our communities, without of
course, the opportunities and fruits of success Clarence Thomas
has experienced. Despite that history, it is abundantly clear
that the nominee lacks a demonstrated commitment to equal justice
and an understanding of the role of courts in protecting rights
and liberties.

        He is a person of limited legal experience and his record in
the public offices that provide the bulk of that experience has

        39 See, e.g., Thomas, "The Higher Law Background and the
Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,"
Harvard Journal of Law and Policy, p. 63, 64, 69.

                                                                16
                                      734

been given low marks by those who are most familiar with it.
Members of both Houses of Congress who monitor the agencies that
the nominee has headed have had to act on a regular basis to
repair his defaults in performance and the damage those defaults
have done to the lives of citizens whose rights he was sworn to
protect. Federal courts that have examined the performance of
the nominee at the Office of Civil Rights and the EEOC have found
his actions to be contrary to law. Leading members of Congress
have questioned the nominee's candor and a federal judge found
that the Commission under Thomas's direction "has been no more
candid with this Court than with Senate committees and the
public."40

         In other words, those responsible officials who know the
nominee's work best have found it grievously wanting. These
assessments are the antithesis of the kinds of recommendations
one would expect to accompany the nomination of a candidate with
a distinguished record of public service.

         The record is made worse by the nominee's confrontational
style in his writings and speeches, and by his failure to
demonstrate a real understanding of the role of major
institutions in our society.

         Given all this, why should the question of confirmation be a
close one? If it is, it is only because questions of . ~e
continue to cloud the judgment of otherwise sensible American
citizens. The hope of the nominee's supporters as one
commentator has said is that "the Senate will judge him less
harshly than a white candidate with equally poor qualifications."

        Members of this Committee know as well as members of the
Caucus that such a judgement would be a perversion of the ideal
of affirmative action, that it would ill-serve the needs of the
millions of citizens of all races that we have been elected to
represent and that it would not promote the larger interest of
the nation both in equal justice and domestic tranquillity.

         The best way to serve these great purposes would be for the
Committee to reject this nomination and to ask the President to
send another name to the Senate.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, because we went out of order to accommo-
date the schedules of our colleagues on the House side, we are now
going to hear from two distinguished panels, both panels support-
ing, and strongly supporting, Judge Thomas' nomination to the
bench.

  The first panel is made up of three very distinguished persons:
Alphonso Jackson, the director of the Dallas Housing Authority, an
authority that is probably as big as some States in the Nation; the
Reverend Buster Soires, pastor of the First Baptist Church--it just
says First Baptist Church, New Jersey. What city?

  Reverend SOIRES. Somerset, NJ.
  The CHAIRMAN. Somerset, NJ; and Mr. Robert Woodsen, presi-
dent of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise. It is good
to see you. You have been here many days during the hearing, and
it is good to have you here, Mr. Woodsen.
  Welcome to all of you. I thank you for coming to testify. Unless
the panel has concluded otherwise, why don't we begin in the order
that I have--well, you begin any way you all this. I can see they
are pointing to you, Mr. Woodsen. Why don't you begin?

STATEMENTS OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF ROBERT WOODSEN,
  PRESIDENT, NATIONAL CENTER FOR NEIGHBORHOOD ENTER-
  PRISE; ALPHONSO JACKSON, DIRECTOR, DALLAS HOUSING AU-
  THORITY; AND REV. BUSTER SOIRES, PASTOR, FIRST BAPTIST
  CHURCH, SOMERSET, NJ

  Mr. WOODSEN. Thank you, Senator. We are truly delighted to
have this opportunity for you to hear from the other side of black
America.

  As you indicated, 60 percent of black Americans were undecided
when Judge Thomas' nomination was first introduced. In recent
polls, one conducted by Jet magazine, a black publication, indicated
that over 60 percent of black Americans now support him after
having heard him present himself.

  As a veteran of the struggle for civil rights and having led dem-
onstrations in the 1960's in suburban Philadelphia, I witnessed
first hand the sacrifices that were made to end this country's
apartheid system. Following the death of Dr. King, I intervened in
the confrontation between rioters to restore order and organized a
nonviolent means to enable those who had no voice to redress deci-
sionmaking.

  Early in that movement, it became quite apparent to me that
many of those who struggled most and suffered in the struggle for
civil rights did not benefit from the change once the doors of oppor-
tunity were open. This was a fact, and the leadership of the civil
rights movement, a lot has been made of the position of the leader-
ship. To what extent does it reflect popular black opinion?

  Well, let me say to you, as a veteran of the civil rights move-
ment, I can recall when the students at Orangeburg first sat down
and engaged in civil disobedience. This strategy was not embraced
by the leadership. In fact, they were opposed to it. It was only after
it became popular did the leadership embrace it. And when Dr.
King entered into Birmingham, he was not embraced by the leader-
ship. Again, when Dr. King wrote his letter from a Birmingham
                                      736
jail, when he challenged the sincerity of white moderates, the lead-
ership at that time said that Dr. King was in danger of alienating
the white support.

  Again, when Dr. King--I remember, as an official with the
NAACP at the time, being on the dais with Roy Wilkins

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU were an official?
  Mr. WOODSEN. I was an official with the NAACP at the time at
the local level. I led demonstrations. And I remember being on the
dais when Roy Wilkins was the speaker. That was the day that Dr.
King announced when he was going to join the peace movement
with the civil rights movement. He was characterized by Carl
Rowan as a Communist. It was the civil rights leadership that cas-
tigated Dr. King because, they said, he would weaken the civil
rights movement.
  But Dr. King, being the leader that he was, did not just simply
reflect popular opinion or the consensus of the majority. He knew
that he had the majority of blacks behind him, and that consensus
drove this movement.
  Again, the civil rights leadership opposed Jesse Jackson's candi-
dacy for the Presidency in 1984. They said it was ill-advised for
him to run. Eighty percent of blacks who voted supported Jesse
Jackson. It was hailed by the civil rights organization at that time,
the next year, as the greatest thing that ever happened to black
America.
  They were out of touch on those circumstances in the past, and
they are out of touch today with Judge Thomas. Clearly 60 percent
of black Americans having heard Judge Thomas now support him.
And the reason is that there has been--there is no single black
America. We talk about blacks and minorities and poor as if they
are synonymous. Judge Thomas understood what some of us in the
movement understood; that it is important to understand that not
all black Americans suffered equally even under discrimination;
that some of us were better prepared to deal with the storm of
racism and discrimination.
  As a consequence, you see a bifurcation of the black community
today. Black families with incomes in excess of $50,000-plus have
increased 350 percent over the last 20 years while black families
with incomes below $10,000 have also increased. If racial discrimi-
nation were the sole culprit, then why are not all blacks suffering
equally since only one out of six whites with a college degree works
for government and three out of six blacks with a college degree
work for government?
  You have a proprietary interest in the maintenance of race-spe-
cific solutions, and I have prepared and submit for the record an
article written in 1965, October 29, that says, "Civil Rights Gains
Bypassing Poor Negroes," written by Bill Raspberry who quotes
the civil rights leadership in 1965. In this article, the civil rights
leadership said, "Continued emphasis on race-specific solution will
never address the problems of poor blacks, that we must mount an
economic development program to address their needs."
  The civil rights leadership, because many of their members bene-
fited, continues to ignore this reality and press race-specific solu-
tions to the detriment of poor blacks. And as a consequence, some
of us--and Clarence Thomas certainly is numbered in that group--
                                             737

began to understand that, yes, we affirm the progress of the civil
rights movement, but the strategy is insufficient, that we must now
define affirmative action differently so that it exempts the sons
and daughters of the panelists here and people in my--my son--I
have four children. My oldest boys have a better education than
most whites. They went to Wilmington Friends School, Senator.
Therefore, what we believe is that if affirmative action, as Clarence
Thomas has said, should be redefined to apply to low-income
people, white, black, Hispanic, whatever, since we only have a lim-
ited amount of resources, that we should concentrate those re-
sources among the people who are in crisis.

  And so Clarence Thomas, I think, brings that very important
perspective to this issue, and therefore should be confirmed on the
Court when the issue of the future of black colleges, public-support-
ed black colleges are being destroyed in the name of integration,
and they educate most black youngsters, not Harvard, Yale, or
Stanford. Therefore, there are many issues that go beyond affirma-
tive action that we think Judge Thomas is eminently qualified to
sit in judgment.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Woodsen.
  Mr. Jackson.

                   STATEMENT OF ALPHONSO JACKSON

  Mr. JACKSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I am Alphonso Jackson, the executive director of the housing au-
thority for the city of Dallas, and a personal friend of Judge Clar-
ence Thomas. I am here before you today to testify on his behalf.
  I, too, like Judge Thomas, came from humble means, as the last
of 12 children to Arthur and Henrietta Jackson. Although my
mother was a high school graduate, my father was not, but he still
managed to educate all 12 of his children. He taught us the value
of giving back, not only to the society at large, but to the African-
American community specifically.
  In 1965, while a freshman in college, I left at the request of Rev.
Bernard Lee, the top aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, to
go to Selma and be instrumental in the voter registration drive.
  I also, as many others did, participated in the march from Selma
to Montgomery. Furthermore, I spent the summer of 1976 working
for the NAACP, at my own expense, at the request of Margaret
Wilson, then chairperson, and the Rev. Ben Hooks, the executive
director.
   Upon graduation from law school at Washington University, in
St. Louis, I then met Attorney General John Danforth, who intro-
duced me to Judge Thomas. We have remained steadfast friends
for the past 18 years, and I dare say that both of us were enriched
by Senator Danforth's kindness and wisdom.
  Judge Thomas is the every man we strive to be. He is intuitive,
insightful and highly proficient in the law, with extremely valuable
hands-on experience in public policy. He possesses keen intellect
and strong values that would benefit the Supreme Court.
   The Clarence Thomas I know is a self-made man, who has
worked enormously hard to get where he is today. He will serve
the Supreme Court well, not through quick and simplistic means,
                                              738

but through his own strength of character, perseverance and strong
belief in the American dream.

  As a public official working with low-income families over the
past 6 years, I have seen Federal programs go astray. Programs
that initially had good intentions have turned out to have devastat-
ing effects on low-income families. The overly-subsidized existence
has killed the spirit and, in many instances, left these families
hopeless.

  It is painful to see the hopelessness that exists in many low-
income communities. But what is more disillusion is to see the ac-
ceptance of this hopelessness. I often reflect back on my idealistic
days when I, too, felt the programs would change the world, but
my liberal vision has faded. I firmly believe that self-help is the
road to salvation for all low-income people, especially African-
Americans.

  Clarence Thomas' view of self-help is one that I fully support and
a view that is supported by most and many African-Americans. His
focus has always been on moving individuals towards self-sufficien-
cy. He understands the need for economic empowerment of all mi-
norities, and to expand the education and economic opportunities,
while emphasizing the importance of self-direction.

  Clarence Thomas' life story reveals a more complex human being
than the conservative label might suggest. Clarence was taught to
never ignore discrimination. In addition, he was taught the way to
defeat it was through hard work and education. I can tell you, from
my discussions with him, he remembers the pain and humiliation
of discrimination, as I do, and he vowed never to forget those inci-
dents that ultimately shaped his life and mine.

  Judge Thomas' nomination should remind us all in this country
that every person can rise as high as he or her ability will take
them, regardless of color. He symbolizes our continued commit-
ment toward making the American dream a reality for every
American.

  Despite the serious and sincere disagreement between Judge
Thomas and others in the civil rights movement to reach this goal,
I firmly believe that Judge Thomas will be capable of recognizing
racism when it comes before him on the Supreme Court, competent
to judge critical issues and compassionate to rule on each of them
according to the facts, and not politics.

  The question should not be whether Judge Thomas is a liberal or
a conservative, but, rather, does he have the ability to interpret the
law fairly and judge with compassion. There is no doubt in my
mind that he will be fair and equitable Justice of the Supreme
Court. My question to you, Senators: Isn't that simply what we
want? We want a Justice that will be fair and equitable.

  I am elated that President Bush made a bold and decisive act of
nominating Clarence Thomas for the next Supreme Court Justice. I
am proud of the confidence that the President has placed in a man
he trusts will act in a just and fair manner, regardless of political
pressures.

  I have traveled Africa, Asia and Europe, and each time that I
land back on our shores, I simply say God Bless America. Even
though we are still faced with an enormous amount of racism, this
country is mine, and I too agree with Judge Clarence Thomas,
                                      739

when he stated during President Bush's announcement of his nomi-
nation, that this could have only happened in America. Only in
America, gentlemen, can a citizen be recognized for his or her
achievement, regardless of their background, race or religion. Only
in America, gentlemen, can a role model like Clarence Thomas
show our children that, if they work hard enough, there is a better
tomorrow and there is a pot of gold at the rainbow.

  Finally, only in America, gentlemen, can an African-American
such as myself have the honor of sitting before you today testifying
on behalf of not only my good friend, but an individual whose cre-
dentials are above reproach and whose experience uniquely quali-
fies him to serve on the Supreme Court.

  Lastly, I think it is important to say, when we get to the ques-
tion, that I am truly, without a doubt, within the 1960 group that
benefited from affirmative action programs, and I accept that fully.
But I will say to you today that I practice affirmative action for my
children by paying for their education.

  I have a daughter that is an honor student at the University of
Texas, who got there on her merits, who graduated third in her
class, from one of the best prep girls schools in this country, and
that is affirmative action, to me. I have a daughter who is in the
top of her class at one of the leading prep schools in the country,
and that is affirmative action.

  I truly believe that we must practice affirmative action, but it
must be for those who are most in need, not my children. There-
fore, I say to you that I fully ascribe to Clarence Thomas' belief
that affirmative action is important, but those of us who have
made it must stop relying on excuses and begin to produce.

  I close lastly by saying simply this: I am happy to be here. Last
year, African-Americans in this country consumed $380 billion.
Anglo-Americans did not tell us how to spend one penny of that. I
am saying to you today, some responsibilities we must take for our-
selves.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  There are about 7 minutes left to vote. Rather than interrupt
your testimony in the middle, because I am going to have to go
vote, Reverend, I think maybe it would be wise for us to recess and
come back.
  Let me ask you, because we may start before I get back, because
whoever comes back first will start, let me ask you a question, Mr.
Jackson. I am a little confused by your testimony. You talk about
the fact that there is this cycle of despair and expectation of the
Government to help, that is, in the African-American community,
that has been spawned by affirmative action programs and those
kinds of programs. Then you say those of you who made it should
stop relying on affirmative action. I don't imagine that is where
the despair is, is it, among those of you who have made it?
  Mr. JACKSON. Sure, I think the despair is between those of us
who have made it, who consistently create excuses for others not
making it. My position is simply this, that I practice affirmative
action by making sure that my two daughters are educated well.
There are others that are not in the position that either one of us
at this table are in. Those persons clearly must receive affirmative
                                                740

action, whether they be Anglo, Hispanic, African-Americans. There
are a lot of poor people in the world, and when we discuss the larg-
est

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, if they have affirmative action based on
that basis--you said you are a beneficiary of affirmative action. I
don't know in what circumstance, whether it was law school or col-
lege.

  Mr. JACKSON. Law school, specifically.
  The CHAIRMAN. Law school. You wouldn't have gotten into law
school, even on affirmative action back in those days, if it had been
a pool, not of merely black Americans and Hispanic Americans,
but if it had been a pool of all Americans in need, because I expect
my financial circumstance wasn't any better than your financial
circumstance--I don't know that to be true. My father made
$12,000 a year, so I don't know what that was, with four children.
  Mr. JACKSON. That is about what mine made.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, I imagine we would have been competing
with one another for affirmative action, along for every one of you,
there were 15 of me or 10 of me, because there are ten times as
many white folks as there are black folks, 10 times as many poor
white folks as there are poor black folks. So, how would you have
gotten into school?
  Mr. JACKSON. I think at the time that affirmative action was
being practiced, it is clear that there were very few African-Ameri-
cans in this country that could afford the kind of education that
exists today. That is not the case. I think that Mr. Woodson made
it clear that our income has gone up over 300 percent.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am not talking about that. I am talking about
the black folks and minorities who can't afford it.
  Mr. JACKSON. And I am saying that those are the people that we
are speaking in reference to which should be given the opportuni-
ties, without a doubt.
  The CHAIRMAN. But it should be in a pool
  Mr. JACKSON. That has not been the case, though.
  The CHAIRMAN. But it should be in a pool of all Americans, not
just black Americans.
  Mr. JACKSON. All low-income Americans.
  The CHAIRMAN. All low-income Americans. Well, you all know,
in low-income Americans, you are outnumbered in a big way, don't
you?
  Mr. JACKSON. NO, Senator, the very fact

   The CHAIRMAN. YOU are.

  Mr. JACKSON. We are disproportionately represented there.
Therefore, we will be disproportionately beneficiaries of whatever
is done to that group of people.

  The CHAIRMAN. AS you know, that is not true, if you are talking
about absolute numbers. If there are 100 spots open and, for the
sake of argument, let's assume 80 percent of class A is disadvan-
taged and only 10 percent of class B is disadvantaged. If class B is
20 times as big as class A, you are still going to find yourself out of
those 10 slots, most of them going to the folks in class B. That is
the only point I am making.
                                         741

  I just think we should kind of get our facts straight. You all are
the businessmen and I am just the politician. Let me stop here and
you all think about that for a minute until I come back.

   Senator Simon is here, let's continue. Reverend, why don't we
begin with your testimony, and then I will come back and we will
continue questioning for the whole panel.

  Thank you.

                  STATEMENT OF REV. BUSTER SOIRES

  Reverend SOIRES. Thank you very much for having us.
  I am the Pastor of First Baptist Church in Somerset, NJ. We
have a membership of approximately 3,000 congregants, and I have
been there for 10 months. Prior to accepting this call to this
church, I spent 5Vz years traveling throughout this Nation, speak-
ing primarily to high school students, warning them about the dan-
gers of drugs and immoral behavior and activities which would pre-
clude successful futures.

  Prior to that, I served as the national director of Operation
PUSH. I reported directly to Reverend Jesse Jackson, who gave me
unusual exposure and invaluable training in my efforts to become
an advocate for people. In 1988, I ran as a delegate to represent
Reverend Jackson at the Democratic National Convention.

  I have come here, in light of my experience and exposure, to sup-
port the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. I
believe that Judge Thomas has a knowledge of the Constitution,
which qualifies him for membership on the Supreme Court. I be-
lieve that his personal integrity and demeanor bring to bear won-
derful implications for mediation between the two branches of Gov-
ernment, the executive branch and the legislative branch.

  Moreover, I believe that, as a pastor, that Judge Thomas reflects
more character and personal integrity that display values rooted
deep in the American tradition and in the black tradition. I have
watched with great interest and listened with great intrigue to the
discussion around Judge Thomas, and I would like to focus on the
enigma factor.

  I think, Senator, one of the important discussions that we should
have is why this enigma factor, which I think you yourself have
pointed to, seems to be so prominent.

  I think, first, we should see the enigma that surrounds Judge
Thomas within the context of the overall enigma in which we all
live, the enigma of having voting rights, yet the majority of the
Americans do not vote, the enigma of having civil rights, yet we
have a disproportionate number of people who did not have civil
rights still living in poverty.

   Even beyond that, the legal enigma today--I listened with great
interest to the prior panel, the Congressman from Houston, I am
certain, will attest to the fact that in his city today, the No. 1 issue
among the mayoral candidates is the issue of crime, and 25 percent
of the cases that go before the Supreme Court have less to do with
abortion or affirmative action than they do crime.

   Crime has become such an enigma, that black people and black
neighborhoods are afraid of black children. The root cause goes
back for centuries, but the reality is this, that that is an enigma. It
                                              742

is an enigma today that, in New York City, the greatest concern
among the people that I speak to is the fact that the Board of Edu-
cation has decided to distribute condoms to teenage children, with-
out their parents permission. That is an enigma. It is an enigma,
because, on the one hand, we have the question of individual
rights, and, on the other hand, we have the issue of the integrity of
the family. It is an enigma which may end up in the Supreme
Court.

   In the city of Detroit, I went to speak at a public high school,
where we had another enigma. The enigma was that parents were
pressing the school to install metal detectors, because children
were bringing weapons to school. Civil libertarians and some advo-
cates of civil rights opposed the parents, who were attempting to
protect their children, in the name of individual rights.

  The point is we have such a complex situation today that is
much larger than the black/white situation or the civil rights situ-
ation, that Clarence Thomas' appearing to be an enigma may not
be as enigmatic as we think he is, if we look at the overall enigma
of our social condition.

  If one is pro-life today, that person, if he is in public life, is char-
acterized as being anti-woman. If he is pro-choice, then he is ac-
cused of killing babies. If a person changes his views, we say he
can't be trusted. If a person is rigid, we say he is narrow-minded. If
a person works inside the system, we say he has turned his back on
his people. If a person attacks the system, we say he has got a chip
on his shoulder. If a person advocates government help, then we
suggest he has a welfare mentality. If a person proposes self-help,
then we say he blames the victim. If a person is a flaming liberal,
then we say he's not practical. If a person is a conservative, we call
him an opportunist.

  The problem, Senator, is that the labels that have traditionally
described people are no longer applicable, given the enigmatic cli-
mate in which we live.

  So I support Judge Thomas, not because I agree with everything
he has said--I don't agree with everything I have said. [Laughter.]

  I support Judge Thomas because I believe he possesses the per-
sonal qualities that include recognizing the flaws in our society.
When I look at Judge Thomas, I see a man who sees a need to re-
flect on his own thoughts. I would not want a Senator, a Supreme
Court Justice or a President who cannot admit that there is a need
to reflect on things he has said and things he has done.

  I support him because I believe he respects the integrity of the
judiciary, and he is willing to rise above personal preconceptions
and pledge impartiality on difficult cases.

   I am not frustrated by the fact that Judge Thomas insists on
being loyal to the judicial code that requires impartiality and
giving each case due consideration on its own merits.

   I see a man who personifies the tension of moving up and reach-
ing back. Each of us who lived in middle class or upper class neigh-
borhoods has this tension of how do we in fact reach back and sup-
port people who have not been as successful as we. And while we
may differ in style, all of us should be consistent in substance.

   I think what inspires us today as a free society, and as we consid-
er even intervention in foreign lands, what inspires all of us is the
                                                    743

character and will of our forebears, whether our forebears be men
who rode on horseback crying, "One if by land or two if by sea", or
whether or forebears be slaves who sang songs like "Ain't gonna
let nobody turn me around." What inspires us is their character
and their will, and I believe that Judge Clarence Thomas is an-
other link in this great train of freedom which represents the
greatest social achievement in human history. Never before in the
history of this planet has there been a social experiment like the
one that you preside over. There has never been at any point in
history a precedent set for how to take people who were character-
ized as "60 percent human" and matriculate them as full citizens
into a society.

  So yes, we need diverse opinions. We need to be able to admit
when we have made mistakes. We have no society to which we can
look at a model. We've got to work through this proposition all by
ourselves.

   So I support Judge Thomas because I believe that he is willing,
as a post-World War II citizen to say that perhaps we need a new
interpretation of what we mean when we say we are committed to
justice and fairness and equality, and I think that new interpreta-
tion will be a ray of light and a ray of hope for our entire Nation.

   Senator SIMON [presiding]. Thank you, Reverend Soires.
  The puzzle, the dilemma that we face is in a sense illustrated by
your presence. You mentioned the Reverend Jesse Jackson, who
takes precisely the opposite position that you do on Judge Thomas.
Congressman Payne from your State also is on the other side.
   I agree with you that a judge should be impartial. But a judge
does not come to the court with a blank slate. And here is the prob-
lem that I see that we face on this committee, and I would be inter-
ested in the comments of any one of the three of you.
   If we were to judge Clarence Thomas by his record at the EEOC,
at the Department of Education, by his written statements, if I
were to judge by that alone, frankly, it would be a very easy nega-
tive vote for me because it is not a record that provides help on
employment and the kinds of things that are very important to less
fortunate Americans.

   On the other hand, if I look at the student at Holy Cross, if I
look at the record of growing up, and if you look at his testimony,
it differs appreciably from his written record and his statements.

   So I have two Clarence Thomases, and the question is which
Clarence Thomas is the real Clarence Thomas. And it is very dif-
ferent from, if I may use the illustration, Thurgood Marshall. You
could look at his record and what he had said, and you knew where
Thurgood Marshall was going to go on the court. I don't see that
same consistent pattern with Clarence Thomas.

   Any comments from any one of you?
   Reverend SOIRES. Yes, I'd like to respond, Senator. First, on the
issue of the distribution of condoms in New York, for instance, if I
were a Senator, I would on the one hand have wanted Judge Clar-
ence Thomas to assure me that he would take a position that par-
ents have a right to say something about their children receiving
condoms. On the other hand, I appreciate and respect the fact that
he is willing, by his own testimony under oath, to assure me that
                                               744

he is willing to look at each case individually and to make a deci-
sion on that case based on the merits of that case.

  When I looked at this record of Judge Thomas, quite frankly, I
had the same questions as you; but then I began to interpolate the
executive branch experience into a prospective Supreme Court posi-
tion. And by that, I mean this. Judge Thomas was loyal to the exe-
cution of his executive responsibilities as he understood them.
Therefore, I expect that same kind of loyalty to be consistently ap-
plied in the judiciary and that Judge Thomas will be as consistent-
ly loyal to the principles of the judiciary as he was consistently
loyal to the responsibilities in the executive. And so I am quite
comfortable.

  Senator SIMON. I guess it is one thing to be loyal. I expect you to
be loyal to your employer.

  Reverend SOIRES. TO principles, I said.
  Senator SIMON. But I don't expect people to say things they don't
believe in.
  Reverend SOIRES. NO; I said loyal to principles. I believe that
Judge Thomas articulated and executed within the scope of what
was possible--he wasn't the president; he was the chairman of an
agency--to the extent that he felt he was properly interpreting
statutes and laws.
  I heard him described as being "lawless," and there is a differ-
ence between being called in by oversight committees, as I under-
stand the process, and being charged with criminal offenses. If
Judge Thomas were as "lawless" as he has been described, why has
he not been charged with breaking the law?
  So I don't think that Judge Thomas was unduly loyal to his job. I
think Judge Thomas was appropriately loyal to the role that he
played, and he was consistent in attempting to apply statutes as he
understood them to be fair and to be honest.
  No one in America, including those who disagree with us on the
Thomas issue, would suggest that affirmative action, for instance,
means that one group deserves to treat another group unfairly. No
one argues that. But we have seen this concept of affirmative
action--which, by the way, is not really an antidote to racism. To
suggest that affirmative action is the antidote to racism I think is
ludicrous and is not based in anything that is real. And also, by the
way, to suggest that affirmative action and quotas are not the same
I think is one of the difficulties we have with affirmative action be-
cause we heard in these chambers today the suggestion that if
Judge Thomas is on the Supreme Court, then there will be no more
black appointees for our lifetime, which suggests that there is a
quota of one on the Supreme Court, and I have never seen that
written anywhere.
  So what I am suggesting, Senator, is that Thomas has had an op-
portunity to reflect on his role in the executive branch, and I think
in all due fairness, out of great respect for the process, has pledged
impartiality and has pledged loyalty to the ethics and the princi-
ples of the judiciary if confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Jackson, Mr. Woodsen, and then I will yield
to Senator Grassley.
  Mr. JACKSON. I think my answer, probably having known Clar-
ence longer than anyone sitting at the table, since we started out
                                      745
together in St. Louis with one of the persons who testified this
morning, Larry Thompson--we are all very close friends--I think
how I would answer that is evolution. And let me give you an ex-
ample, if I might, of evolution. And I'd like to use you, Senator
Simon.

  I have long followed you from the time of your newspaper days
in Illinois to Representative Simon to Senator Simon. I lived in St.
Louis for 17 years of my life. It is clear to me that during the Presi-
dential campaign of 1988, some of the views you had espoused early
in your career were quite different at the end during the campaign.
I don't think in any way you were untrue. I think what had oc-
curred is that you had evolved; you had become wiser, you had
looked at the issues more in-depth, you had decided that the ap-
proach that you had taken very early in your life was not the ap-
proach that you would take--not that it was incorrect, but you
have taken another approach.

  I think what we see in Judge Thomas is evolution. I don't see
enigma. I don't see two Judge Thomases. I have had tremendous
debates with him, tremendous disagreements, but in the final anal-
ysis, the Judge Thomas that I know is a person of integrity, compe-
tence and compassion who deeply feels for what is happening to Af-
rican-Americans in this country, who will be an excellent jurist.
And I think what you have seen with Judge Thomas in these hear-
ings and through his life is evolution. And I think you and I both
know that we will continue to evolve until the Almighty decides
that we are no more.

  So I am saying in making that analogy, just as I have seen you
evolve, just as I have seen you take different stands on issues from
the time I can remember you being in St. Louis, and then so you'll
know who met you six or seven times with one of your personal
friends, Jack Kirkland, at his home; I have seen the evolvement.

  So I am saying give Clarence Thomas the same due deference
that others have given you and others have given others. I think
what we see is an evolution, and I think he will be an excellent
jurist.

  Senator SIMON. Mr. Woodsen.
  Mr. WOODSEN. Just a footnote to that. I think he has been cer-
tainly in this regard falsely accused of being in opposition to af-
firmative action. It was Ben Hooks, president of the NAACP, who
said on issues of individual discrimination, Judge Clarence Thomas
will nail a person or an institution to the wall on cases of individ-
ual discrimination. He differs on the application of it when it
comes to group remedies. So that point.
  The other thing, as a footnote to Mr. Jackson's point, yes, people
are evolving. If you maintain the same views over time, you are
called rigid or an ideologue. And I think that Judge Thomas' views
are evolving.
  I remember the Congressional Black Caucus when they were
freshmen Congressmen, they were unalterably opposed to the se-
niority system until they were in positions of seniority. Now they
are steadfast supporters of it. Were they hypocrites then, or did
their strategic circumstance change and therefore their views on
things change?
                                                746

  I think it is in this regard that we ought to view Judge Thomas. I
find his record, I find his positions on principle totally consistent,
and I think that for that reason that some of the charges against
him are just not true.

  Mr. JACKSON. And may I make one comment? I think, too, what
you have seen, which deeply bothers me, is that we have right now
in America a tremendous debate about how we should get where
we should be. Should we continue to rely on Government as the
only source for us to make it, or can we somehow begin to take
some of the responsibility and say we can do some of the things on
our own?

  Senator Simon, it is important to me to understand that pre-
1960, we had more banks that were owned by African-Americans in
this country than we did after the Sixties. We owned our own
hotels. We owned our own restaurants. We owned our own hotels. I
think that the Great Society when it started, started out well, but I
think it took our independence away and created dependency, and
I see it every day, as I said in my speech, hopelessness.

  So when you get a voice who says, look, some things we must
take responsibility for ourselves, even though we understand that
racism still runs rampant in this country, there is no question. But
some things, as I said to your earlier about your evolution, the evo-
lution of African-Americans in this country to what we perceive as
the conservative lean, scares many of the liberals who have bought
into the doctrine that Government owes us something and should
repay us.

  Well, let me say this to you. I might be labelled after this as a
conservative, but I think my mother and father were conservatives
because they taught us to go to church, they taught us the value of
family. My father never made more than $12,000 and educated all
12 of us, and he brought us up with the fear of God. If that's con-
servatism, I am happy, because that is the way that I want to bring
my kids up and I'm trying to bring them up.

  So that what you have is a dichotomy. We have been told by
people in this country that you owe something--it's clear racism
was devastating on us, and it is still devastating. But let me say
this to you, as my father said, who did not have a high school edu-
cation, the way that you fight racism is to educate yourself. We
did. Affirmative action was very helpful to me. My way of dealing
with affirmative action is that I educate my kids very well. There-
fore, when my daughter left her high school she was third in her
class, and she is doing work on her own. I think that is important.
And I think when that is said, that scares a lot of people, when we
start saying we're not going to hold every Anglo person in Ameri-
can responsible for what has happened.

  Senator SIMON. Thank you very much.
  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Jackson and Reverend Soires and Mr. Woodsen, we want to
welcome you here. I admire you for coming here and taking the
stand that you are. You are taking just the opposite view from
what the Black Caucus did. That took courage. It took endurance.
It took character, integrity.
                                               747

  I appreciate your coming here and expressing your views in spite
of some of the positions some of the black leaders have taken.

  I just have two questions, the same questions I have asked these
others who have come and testified here on behalf of Judge
Thomas. You can answer it first and then right down the line.

  Is it your opinion that Judge Thomas is highly qualified and pos-
sesses the necessary integrity, professional competence, and judi-
cial temperament to be an Associate Justice of the United States
Supreme Court?

  Mr. JACKSON. Unequivocally, yes.
  Senator THURMOND. I didn't hear you.

   Mr. JACKSON. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. The answer is yes. Reverend Soires.
  Reverend SOIRES. Based upon everything I have read and heard
and seen from him, the answer is yes.
  Senator THURMOND. The answer is yes.

   Mr. WOODSEN. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Woodsen's answer is yes.
  The second question: Do you know of any reason why he should
not be made a member of the Supreme Court of the United States?
  Mr. JACKSON. I will answer it this way: The Sunday or the
Monday before President Bush nominated Judge Thomas for the
Supreme Court, that Friday we had breakfast, and I said to him
that, in my mind, the best thing that could happen is that the
President nominate you to the Supreme Court because I think you
will bring to the Supreme Court some values, some ideas, and a
perspective that is not there that is badly needed. So my answer to
you is absolutely I think that Clarence will be a tremendous addi-
tion to the Supreme Court.
  Senator THURMOND. DO you know of any reason why he should
not be made a member then?
  Mr. JACKSON. Absolutely not.
  Senator THURMOND. The answer is no.
  Reverend Soires.
  Reverend SOIRES. NO, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. The answer is no.
  Mr. Woodsen?

   Mr. WOODSEN. NO.

  Senator THURMOND. That is all the questions I have. Thank you
very much for your appearance. I think you made a fine impres-
sion.

  Senator SIMON. Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to welcome each of you to the committee. Frankly, we are
very proud to have you here before the committee.
  When Judge Thomas was testifying, I asked him about affirma-
tive action. And as I interpreted his answers, he is for every aspect
of affirmative action except for preferences. Do you know of any
difference from that statement?

   Mr. JACKSON. NO.

  Mr. WOODSEN. NO, I don't, sir. I think he said it should apply to
people because of economic circumstances, and he would have
qualified under those guidelines.
                                               748

  Senator HATCH. Well, I remember when he was being criticized
by some. They indicated he was against affirmative action.

  Mr. WOODSEN. That is not true.
  Senator HATCH. It is just not true.
  Reverend SOIRES. Senator, before you came in, we talked about
the enigma of our current social situation. One of the enigmas is
that today complex issues have been reduced to sound bites and
slogans. When I was coming up, equal educational opportunity was
an issue. It was reduced to the word busing. And we became char-
acterized as either being for equal educational opportunity or
against equal educational opportunity based on our response to the
issue of busing.
  The same thing has happened with the terminology affirmative
action. Affirmative action for me and for those persons with whom
I grew up meant this: that there was an inside crowd and an out-
side crowd. The inside crowd had been protected by laws and by
traditions which virtually excluded the outside crowd irrespective
of qualifications. Affirmative action meant that the inside crowd
would use creative ideas and meaningful efforts to include the out-
side crowd based on the fact they had been excluded without
regard to qualifications.
  And so affirmative action meant that the Government would pro-
tect the outsiders from being excluded simply by virtue of the color
of their skin. Government intervention has never been the question
that we debate. When land-grant colleges were created, that was a
wonderful initiative. When the Veterans' Administration gave vet-
erans vouchers to buy homes and go to schools anywhere in the
country, everybody applauded that. We are not against Govern-
ment intervention or affirmative action. We are against using af-
firmative action as a means of denying other people opportunities
in the name of helping the outsiders so that the outsiders are now
discriminating against the insiders and then become victims them-
selves.
  Last Sunday in the New York Times, the New York Times de-
scribed the affirmative action generation, my crowd, people who
have benefited substantially from affirmative action. And there
was one aspect of that article that troubled me, and that was that
the white peers of blacks in many major corporations perceived
their black peers as having been inferior simply by virtue of the
assumption that they were there due to affirmative action. We
have got to figure out a more creative way and a fair system to
ameliorate the injustices without creating more injustices.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Woodsen.
  Mr. WOODSEN. Senator, let me just give you two examples. I
think what we are engaged in here--and I mentioned earlier in my
testimony that there is a bifurcation in the black community. In
the last 20 years, black families with incomes of $50,000 have
soared 350 percent to the point where they are at 93 percent of
parity with whites, while those families representing one-third,
their incomes are getting worse. So obviously race alone is not the
sole culprit. There are other factors at work here.
  But what we do is engage in a kind of bait and switch game
where the conditions of all blacks are used to justify affirmative
                                      749

action remedies that only help blacks who are highly unionized or
those who are highly professional. And we see examples

  Senator HATCH. Or those who can make it on their own, is what
you are simply saying.

  Mr. WOODSEN. Those that can make it. And so we think it ought
to be defined in terms of economic conditions.

  But two quick examples. Last year, a former black mayor of a
Southern city, who was an architect, well educated, purchased a li-
cense for a television station that was set aside to get blacks into
the television ownership industry. He purchased this for a nominal
amount of money and turned around in two weeks and sold it to a
white company for millions of dollars, realizing a windfall and,
when challen^jd on this, said, "I did nothing illegal."

  Now, blacks are still not in television in that city, but here was a
windfall going to a single individual who, because he was identified
as black, was identified as being disadvantaged. And so the public
feels and believes that now we have served the interest of blacks.
We are saying that this is immoral, it is wrong, and that these spe-
cific remedies need to be challenged to determine under what cir-
cumstance are certain kinds of affirmative action good or bad
public policy.

  Mr. JACKSON. I think also, if I might answer, we must make a
distinction between affirmative action and race-based remedies.
There is clearly a distinction. And I think we must make a distinc-
tion between affirmative action as it has been applied as of today
with how I perceive it should be applied.

  I too, like Judge Thomas, do not believe that race-based remedies
are the best that we can do, because when you do that, clearly you
alienate others. And that is not to say that as an African-American
we have not been discriminated against--truly we have, and I want
to make that clear--in this country and continue today. But I do
think that there is a large enough class of us, and clearly we can
make a distinction.

  Second, I have tc give you a story. I was talking to my daughter,
and both of my daughters and I are extremely close. She said to me
the other day, she said,

  Dad, I was in the dormitory. We were talking. And we had some kids who were
beating the system. Their fathers were doctors, lawyers, principals. But through a
system of saying that I am independent and I don't have an income, they could
clearly fall under the area where they could receive aid.

  In my mind, that is absolutely wrong when you have so many
African-Americans whose fathers or mothers are not doctors, law-
yers, et cetera.

  I said to her, "Don't declare independence," and I am not
wealthy, as I sit before you all today. But I feel that economically I
am in the position to pay for her education or their education and I
should. And I think clearly when we start talking about affirma-
tive action, we are talking about affirmative action to benefit those
who are most in need.

  And let me assure you, I run one of the largest public housing
agencies in this country, and I see kids every day that are bright
and intelligent. But because of a lack of money, they can't go to
college. And I have spent an inordinate amount of time getting
                                              750

them money to go to college. They are the people in my mind who
should be the recipients of affirmative action.

   Senator HATCH. YOU seem to be saying, Mr. Woodsen, and all of
you, that the system ought to be based upon disadvantage regard-
less of race.

  Mr. WOODSEN. Absolutely.
   Senator HATCH. Or any other factor. But if you do that, then it
seems to me that there might not be as much help go to black
people or black kids as goes today. Do you agree with that?
  Mr. WOODSEN. NO, I don't. I think if you did it based upon pro-
portionality of those in poverty, you will find that since we are 30
percent of those in poverty, that 30 percent of the money should go

  Senator HATCH. SO you wouldn't do it on the basis of proportion-
ality but across the board regardless of race.

  Reverend SOIRES. Senator, two other points. One, if we are talk-
ing within the context of having to choose between groups, then we
will always have a problem. When we have a domestic policy that
addresses the needs of all America, then we don't have to worry
about which groups gets in and which group gets left out.

  Senator HATCH. SO we will have less discrimination because the
system

  Reverend SOIRES. That is right. That is No. 1.
  Second, I don't think we should focus on affirmative action as if
the resolution of that debate concludes the problem. In Trenton,
NJ, where I live, the dropout rate at the public high school is 53
percent. It would not matter what kind of affirmative action pro-
gram the bank downtown had; 53 percent of our children won't be
qualified to work there if there was a set-aside program to guaran-
tee them all the jobs.
  The deeper problem is to get at those systemic issues that sustain
poverty and hopelessness and illiteracy, because affirmative action
becomes almost moot in the face of a generation that can dance but
can't read. And that is not a black problem.
  Senator HATCH. I have appreciated the testimony. I have just one
last thought. All three of you know Judge Thomas?

   Mr. JACKSON. Yes.

  Reverend SOIRES. I don't know him personally.
  Senator HATCH. YOU don't know him personally.
  Mr. JACKSON. I have known him for 18 years.
  Senator HATCH. But all three of you are for him for this position?
  Mr. JACKSON. Absolutely.
  Reverend SOIRES. Yes.

   Mr. WOODSEN. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I am, too. I think it is a great opportunity
to have a person go on the Court as young as he is, with his back-
ground, and with perhaps new ideas that may be very beneficial to
everybody. So I want to thank you for your testimony. It has been
very persuasive and I think very good. So we appreciate having you
all here today.

   Mr. JACKSON. Thank you.
   Mr. WOODSEN. Thank you.
   Reverend SOIRES. Thank you.
   Senator SIMON. Senator Grassley.
                                         751

  Senator GRASSLEY. DO any of you have any questions or doubts in
your mind about Clarence Thomas' commitment to civil rights and
equal opportunity?

  Mr. JACKSON. Absolutely not.
  Mr. WOODSEN. Absolutely not.
  Reverend SOIRES. I don't, and I feel comfortable saying that be-
cause, while we may differ within the African-American communi-
ty and within the religious community and the overall community
about priorities and approaches, I think we all agree on goals. It
does concern me that many of us are willing to place things as pri-
orities that I don't think should be priorities. As I mentioned to
Senator Hatch, if we have a 53-percent dropout rate out of the
public high school in our community, I think our priority should be
that issue and not whether or not the bank downtown hires our
kids. I think we have to deal with the bank downtown, but we have
got to start with first things first.
  So I think what you will discover is that when you talk to all of
us long enough, we will agree on the problems and we will agree
on the goals. The question is: What are our priorities and ap-
proaches? Therefore, Judge Thomas is as committed as Jesse Jack-
son, as Bob Woodsen, as anyone else who is doing anything else rel-
ative to civil rights. But the priorities and the approaches may
differ.
  Mr. WOODSEN. I think what Judge Thomas is doing, Senator, in
my relationship with him, is to probe different questions. We need
different questions asked. One of the questions that he asks, and I
do too, is: If race alone were the principal culprit, how is it that
blacks control 8 of the 12 major cities, the school systems, the
health systems, the housing systems, and yet poor blacks are no
better off now than when they were controlled by whites, according
to the numbers. The downtown is booming, even in the Reagan era.
Eighty percent of the development dollars going to those cities
went to reconstruct the downtown, not in the neighborhood. Those
were local decisions.
  And what Clarence Thomas and others of us are asking is how
are those local decisions made to build a Hyatt Regency downtown
instead of a business incubative facility with retail shops in low-
income neighborhoods that could serve as an anchor for the resto-
ration of those neighborhoods.
  I think that these are the kinds of critical questions that the
Thomas nomination is causing to be debated within the black com-
munity, and I think this is a healthy occurrence.
  Mr. JACKSON. May I add something? And I will probably try to
be a little more simplistic about it. In a speech that I was giving in
Colorado about 2 months ago, I simply said, as Reverend Soires
said--and which I think is so important--and this was an issue
dealing with where are we going in the year 2000 and how effective
affirmative action has been in the African-American community.
  The question that I posed at that time--or the person posed, I
should say, that I had to answer, they simply asked: Are African-
Americans better off today than they were 20 years ago? And I will
not call the person's name because they are a noted civil rights
person, automatically said no. My answer at that point in time was
to the moderator: Which group of African-Americans are you
                                             752

speaking in reference to? If you are speaking in reference to me,
yes; or the three members of this panel, yes; or the leadership of
the NAACP, yes; or the leadership of the Urban League, yes. We
are better off. If you are speaking about the public housing resi-
dents in Dallas, Texas, no. They are not better off.

   So when you pose the question, you have to ask: Who is better
off? There are a group of us that are, and we have benefited great-
ly from affirmative action. And we took advantage of it. But the
question today, which I finally answered to the person, was simply
this: Let us not use affirmative action as a facade, because that is
what we are using it as in these hearings as I hear many of my
African-American brothers and sisters, many of my Anglo brothers
and sisters speak.

  What we should be asking ourselves more crucially than any-
thing else is: What do we do about the educational deficit that
exists in our inner-city communities? If tomorrow we decided that
affirmative action would be only for African-Americans and that
we would push it as hard as we could, it would do no good at this
point in time when my young brothers and sisters are leaving high
school reading at a fifth-grade level, doing math at a third-grade
level. It would not help us.

  So I say to you today, when you listen to testimony that has
come before you and will precede us, the question should be asked:
Which group of African-Americans have benefited? And those who
have not benefited will not be at this table. Those of us who have
will be at this table.

  Senator GRASSLEY. There have been several other panels in pre-
vious days of African-Americans who have spoken, like you have,
of their strong feeling of Judge Thomas' commitment to civil rights
and equal opportunities. I would like to have you help me under-
stand and all of America understand. With Clarence Thomas' com-
mitment to civil rights, documented by so many different groups
here, why do you think the so-called leadership of black organiza-
tions like the NAACP and the Black Caucus are opposed to Judge
Thomas?

  Reverend SOIRES. Senator, I became the pastor of a very tradi-
tional African-American Baptist Church 10 months ago. I have had
a wonderful experience there for the last 10 months, and one of the
new ideas that I introduced was computerizing the church's oper-
ation.

  Some of the opposition that came to that was simply that we
have never done it that way before. And I have this need to bal-
ance the tradition which has brought the church this far, and now
innovative ideas to take the church to the next generation.

  We have had 300 to 400 years of a very consistent kind of resist-
ance movement against the racism of America. It takes a while to
develop a new strategy with a broad consensus that moves from
civil rights to economic empowerment. There are many organiza-
tions who have dedicated their lives and people who have dedicated
their lives to the protection of the rights that were won after years
of battle. And that is a legitimate pursuit.

  But that pursuit should not function in exclusivity. We also need
efforts as momentous as the civil rights movement to convince chil-
dren not to have children. We need efforts to convince families of
                                             753

the root responsibilities of families. We need efforts to convince
people that laws don't change people. People change laws. Laws
can change people's behavior, but it takes a new value system to
change people's hearts.

  The point is we are in disagreement not necessarily with the
facts but with the priorities. We feel that in 1991 the priorities
should be economic and educational empowerment, not race-based
solutions simply, but, rather, economic conditions, economic pro-
grams, and economic solutions.

  Senator GRASSLEY. And their opposition is because Clarence
Thomas challenges that traditional approach?

  Reverend SOIRES. Clarence Thomas comes along as a post-World
War II baby. Clarence Thomas is not really a veteran of the pre-
World War II leadership. He is 43 years old. I am 40 years old. I
was too young to march with Dr. King. I was too young to go to jail
40 times and have my head beaten, and often perceived as someone
who perhaps is not loyal to that tradition. But there does come a
time--just like we did in the Persian Gulf--there comes a time
when after the war is over you look at what is the next step. That
doesn't mean that the war against racism is over, but we have our
civil rights, we have our public accommodation rights, we have our
voter registration rights. There is no need for me to lead a march
on city hall to get the right to vote. My task in my community is to
convince people to register and to vote.

  Now, we have to protect the voting rights on the one hand, but
that should not function in the absence of people who do what I do,
and that is motivate people to exercise their rights. We are in part-
nership, not in competition.

  Mr. WOODSEN. I think that part of it is ideological, too. Clarence
Thomas does not fall conveniently into liberal Democratic tradition
that many members of the Black Caucus have defined black Ameri-
cans. They have become in one sense the police of black thinking.
And there has been a gag rule imposed on the black community
over the past 20 years that unless you see life through the prism of
a liberal Democrat, you will be suspicious, you will be castigated.
And so I think Clarence Thomas, because he does not espouse that
position, is castigated.

  I think members of the caucus talk about they are suddenly
going to judge him based upon the content of his record and not
the color of his skin. And yet there have been several black offi-
cials, including some of their own members, that have been guilty
of personal indiscretions and illegal acts, and one judge in New Or-
leans who was guilty of accepting a bribe while on the bench and
found guilty by a court. And I remember being on McLaughlin and
Company with a member of the Caucus when John McLaughlin
asked both of us: What do you think about what this man did? Do
you think, as some are saying, that he was targeted by whites? And
this member said yes. Not judging him on the content of his record
or his character but the color of his skin.

  And all of a sudden, when Judge Thomas emerges on the scene,
members of the Black Caucus suddenly became color blind and
wanted to judge Clarence Thomas based upon the context of his
record. I think that this moral inconsistency is not really being re-
ceived well in black America, at least the people that I talk to.
                                                    754

  Therefore, I think his membership in a different club, if you
may, is a source of much of the consternation and resistance to
Judge Thomas.

   Mr. JACKSON. I guess to add to what Bob has said, what Rever-
end Soires has said, I will not cast any aspersions on the NAACP
because I am a member and I have a great deal of respect for Rev-
erend Hooks and his wife and consider them my friends. I have a
number of friends that I consider my friends on the Black Caucus.

  What I will say to you, Senator, in asking the question, is that
we have been a proponent over the years to the victim theory. And
somehow anyone who wishes to escape the victim theory based on
doing some things for themselves is labeled either a Tom, an Oreo,
someone that is bought off by the system.

  But one thing that we must keep in mind and I remind us all the
time: Those who are calling us those names are clearly benefiting
from the system. They serve on the major boards of the corpora-
tions in this country. They fly around in Lear jets. They play at the
best country clubs. But yet they are telling us to accept the victim.

  I see myself as an African-American extremely fortunate, having
served both public and private life, having made a great deal of
money. In the process of doing that, you must give something back.
And I think Clarence Thomas simply says: How can we best give
something back?

  The way we give something back in my mind is to give people
hope and to work with those who are most in need. And that is our
philosophical viewpoint, rather than, quote, unquote, telling them
that they are a victim, that the system will ever keep them a
victim, they can never hope to escape being a victim, so therefore
the best avenue is to keep hollering that racism is the epitome of
what is keeping us down. Yet those who tell them that will be with
us at the Jockey Club tonight.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you.
  Senator SIMON. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Woodsen, let me direct my first question to you. I believe you
were present when the five Congressmen testified, correct?

   Mr. WOODSEN. Yes, I was.

  Senator SPECTER. And the five Congressmen testified in opposi-
tion to Judge Thomas, on the basis that he was not a good role
model, since he was the beneficiary of affirmative action and, once
he had attained his status, he was turning his back on other Afri-
can-Americans.

  You have suggested that the opposition by that group was really
directed in a political context, that they are the beneficiaries of
having African-Americans to support the Democratic Party, as op-
posed to looking for a role model like Judge Thomas who, in his
speeches, was very direct about wanting to bring more African-
Americans to the conservative cause and more African-Americans
to the Republican Party.

   Are you saying that the opposition by the congressional panel
was really based on Democratic/Republican politics?

  Mr. WOODSEN. I think, in part, it was, Senator. It was based also,
in part, as Mr. Jackson said, any black that does not characterize
other blacks as being victims of white oppression and believes that
                                         755

the mugger might have knocked him down, that is, racism, but it is
the responsibility of the person mugged to get up, the victim's re-
sponsibility to get up, and I have debated most members over the
years

  To espouse this puts you at odds politically and ideologically with
members of the caucus, and, yes, I think Clarence Thomas, because
of his position on civil rights, challenging--again, Senator, I dis-
agree with the characterization that Clarence Thomas is against af-
firmative action and civil rights. He is not. Even Ben Hooks af-
firms that, when he says, in cases of individual discrimination,
Judge Thomas will nail you to the wall.

  Where Judge Thomas disagrees or has some problems with it is
when remedies are applied to groups, so I think that it is in that
context where there is some debate, and I think what he is trying
to do, and some of us are trying to find some middle ground to find
out what do we do about the blacks who are locked out, because of
race and economic and social circumstance, and I think Judge
Thomas is grappling for alternative questions to be raised, and a
lot of the members of the Caucus just simply do not want those
questions raised.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Woodsen, the Congressmen criticized Judge
Thomas on the ground that he was a beneficiary of affirmative
action. But he did not want to see it extended to others, and I do
not know if you heard the testimony

   Mr. WOODSEN. I did.

  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. But Judge Thomas did say that,
when it came to employment, and there was considerable discus-
sion about the very famous discrimination case in New York City
on Local 28 of the building trades, which had been going on for
more than 20 years, with a finding of egregious discrimination.
Judge Thomas held back and said that he would grant a remedy
for any specific individual who was discriminated against, but in
terms of looking to the future, in a context where you knew with
virtually certainly that the next group of African-American appli-
cants would be discriminated against, and, as one of the Congress-
men put it, you wanted to give some of the tail-wind to the head-
wind which was going to face that African-American who was
going to look for the job. Don't you think that, just as preference is
desirable, as Judge Thomas said in the educational context, which
he received, that there ought to be a preference for the next appli-
cant, say, in the New York City context, where you have every
reason to expect discrimination, as the prior applicants had been
discriminated against?

  Mr. WOODSEN. Senator, you have taken me into the details of
that particular case that are beyond my knowledge, but I can say
to you that the fact that when Secretary Donovan was facing trial,
the trial judge, in ruling against or setting aside one of the charges
against him of using a prominent black elected official as a dummy
8(a) firm, that the practice is so widespread that you could not hold
Secretary Donovan culpable in that situation. I think that is the
kind of situation, at least, that I think requires some review and
some discussion and some debate as to who are the true benefici-
aries of some of these group remedies. And I think all Judge
Thomas was trying to do, as I and the rest of us are trying to do, is
                                              756

to try to begin to raise a new set of questions, instead of just rely-
ing upon some of the same set-aside remedies.

   I remember contracts that get set-aside contracts bid on a con-
tract $30 million, and because they are black, they get the contract,
they take $2 million and then subcontract with the white firm that
came in second and that firm hires all-white employees, while this
one black contractors has $2 million.

   Now, is this really what we intended through affirmative action,
or did we really intend to improve, increase the number of workers
and people participating? I think those are the situations, Senator,
that we need to look into.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Jackson, let me direct this question to you,
where a major point was made by the Congressmen who testified,
in response to my questions, if Judge Thomas is a good role model.
They were highly critical of Judge Thomas, because of the state-
ments he had made about his own sister, and were highly critical
of him, because he was unwilling to see affirmative action benefit
others as affirmative action had benefited him.

  Do you consider those factors to be relevant in evaluating wheth-
er Judge Thomas would be a good role model for other young Afri-
can-Americans in this country?

  Mr. JACKSON. Senator, first, let me say this: Knowing Clarence as
I do and his family, Clarence and his sister are extremely close. I
think that was a philosophical difference at a point in time be-
tween the two and that has not in any way daunted their relation-
ship. I think that probably every one of us has had some differ-
ences with our different brothers and sisters.

  Second, Clarence Thomas has made it clear in the days of his tes-
timony here that he supports affirmative action, so those who will
basically tend to distort the reality of the situation is doing that
basically to serve their own interests.

  Lastly, I was very pained to listen to many of the members of the
Black Caucus come out as they did sitting at this table today
against a man that I know very well and have a great deal of affin-
ity for and I think is an excellent human being, with a tremendous
amount of compassion.

  But I think a few minutes ago, I said, when Senator Hatch asked
the question, that you must understand it in the overall context
that we are still operating in a victimized situation, and when
someone comes in and challenges the philosophical viewpoint that
we are victims and we will remain victims and there is nothing
that we can do, the only recourse that must occur is they cannot
deal with them from an academic or philosophical viewpoint, so,
therefore, it becomes very personal, and it saddens me to hear
them say that they do not believe that Judge Thomas would be a
role model.

  I must tell you a story that they did on the Today Show not 2
weeks ago about a young African-American boy, in Savannah, GA,
who had no hope. For 2 years, Judge Thomas has been writing him
letters, sent him a set of encyclopedias, sending him a book every
month. That young African-American's grades have gone up tre-
mendously. He has set his sights on being a doctor. Had Clarence
ignored his letter, he might have been doomed to defeat. To say
that Clarence Thomas as a man is not a role model is to basically
                                               757

say that young boy in Savannah, GA has no substance, and I think
he has a great deal of substance.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Jackson, you testified that Judge Thomas
is in favor of affirmative action. I am not so sure you are right
about that, but it may depend upon definitions and it may depend
upon scope. There is a very limited preference that Judge Thomas
testified to here during the course of the proceedings on disadvan-
tage in an educational context. He testified very forcefully about
being against discrimination, as you find the specific victims of dis-
crimination. But if Judge Thomas was not in favor of affirmative
action, would you still support his nomination for the Supreme
Court?

  Mr. JACKSON. If he was not in favor of affirmative action?
  Senator SPECTER. Correct.
  Mr. JACKSON. I have to tell you that I think that is a very hypo-
thetical question, and my answer would be that I know he in favor
of it, so, therefore, I would support him wholeheartedly.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, OK, but I am not so sure he is in favor of
affirmative action, so it leaves you, at least in my mind, in equi-
poise on the hypothetical. [Laughter.]
  Mr. JACKSON. Let me say this, Senator: I am a firm believer
in affirmative action. I have three degrees and I am convinced that
affirmative action played a role in those degrees, but I also had to
do a lot on my own to make sure that I got them.
  Clarence Thomas is a beneficiary of affirmative action, I don't
think he denies that, but he had to do a lot on his own. But I think
today, Senator, for us to be misled and for us to consistently deal
with one aspect of affirmative action, as many of the groups that
have appeared before you and will appear after us want you to do,
would be to overlook the real issue that is facing us today.
  In 1976, we had almost 800,000 African-American males and fe-
males in college. In 1991, we have a little over 300,000 in college. In
many cases, affirmative action has not stopped, but what has oc-
curred is there has been a breakdown somewhere, in our school
system, in the raising of our kids. So even tomorrow, as I said earli-
er, if you say we are going to practice affirmative action the best
way that we know how, when you have African-American kids
leaving school, reading at a fifth grade level and doing math at a
third or fourth grade level, affirmative action, in my mind, be-
comes a moot question, until we do something about making sure
that we benefit those kids who are suffering greatly in our commu-
nities and in the cities.
  I see those kids every day, as an executive director of the public
housing agency, and I am saying to you that what we need to do is
begin to raise those persons up, and I can tell you, if we do that,
affirmative action will not be a necessary issue, the issue will be
how can we stop African-Americans from ascending to the highest
ranks in this country.
  I think, lastly, I would say this to you: There have been so many
excuses made. I always use the analogy that 20 years ago, at the
end of the Vietnam War, we had refugees coming from all over
Southeast Asia, they could not speak English. But because there
was a system in place where the family was strong, where we did
not have people making excuses for them, in those same inner-city
                                              758

schools that African-Americans and Hispanics are suffering in, the
Asians are topping out of the class.

   So, I am saying to you that some responsibility must lie with
what we are doing, especially us at this table who have been bene-
ficiaries of affirmative action. We must do our job and that is not
in any way to dismiss or deny that racism exists and that affirma-
tive action has played a role.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, gentlemen, and thank
you, Mr. Chairman.

  Senator SIMON. We want to thank all three of you for your testi-
mony. Let me just add, if I may have the attention of Senator
Thurmond here, we have averaged 37 minutes a witness. We have
27 witnesses to go. If we keep up the current pace, we will be here
until about 9 tomorrow morning.

  Until Senator Biden gets back, I wonder if we could agree to just
have 5 minutes for members' questions rather than the current 10
minutes.

  Senator THURMOND. I certainly think it ought to be restricted as
much as possible.

  Senator SIMON. OK, so there is no objection. At least until Sena-
tor Biden gets back, we will limit it to 5 minutes per member.

  We thank the three of you. Our next panel is a panel supporting
Judge Thomas: Pamela Talkin, a member of the Federal Labor Re-
lations Authority and former chief of staff for Judge Thomas while
he chaired the EEOC; Ms. Willie King from the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. Ms. King was director of the Financial
Management Division of the EEOC during then Chairman Thomas'
tenure. James Clyburn, Commissioner of the South Carolina
Human Affairs Commission, who is here on behalf of the Interna-
tional Association of Official Human Rights Agencies, which is the
Association of State Fair Employment Agencies; and Dr. Talbert
Shaw, the president of Shaw University.

  We are happy to have all of four of you here. Ms. Talkin, we will
start with you, if we may, and we will enter your full statements in
the record. We will limit the witnesses to five minutes.

  Should we start with you, Ms. Talkin, or however you would
prefer?

  Ms. TALKIN. Dr. Shaw has to leave and catch a plane, and he has
been moved on to this panel so

  Senator SIMON. Dr. Shaw, we will start with you, and I will
during my temporary reign here as Chair be firm on the 5-minute
rule.

  Dr. Shaw.

STATEMENTS OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF TALBERT SHAW,
  PRESIDENT, SHAW UNIVERSITY; PAMELA TALKIN, FEDERAL
  LABOR RELATIONS AUTHORITY; WILLIE KING, EQUAL EM-
  PLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION; AND JAMES CLY-
  BURN, COMMISSIONER, SOUTH CAROLINA HUMAN AFFAIRS
  COMMISSION

  Mr. SHAW. Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of this Judici-
ary Committee, I am Talbert Shaw, president of Shaw University
in North Carolina, and I deeply appreciate this opportunity to testi-
                                         759

fy before you in support of the appointment of Judge Clarence
Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Although I do express today opinions of my own, it is significant
that I speak as the president of Shaw University, an historically
black liberal arts coeducational institution founded in 1865, fully
accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools,
and presently offering baccalaureate degrees in major academic
disciplines to over 2,000 students.

  I do not appear before you distinguished legislators claiming any
expertise in American jurisprudence. Although philosophy is my
academic discipline, I do bring a keen interest in history; generally,
in American history, in particular, especially that aspect of our his-
tory that focuses on the evolution and development of democratic
principles, principles that seek objectivity, equality, and justice, all
representing a quest for the common good.

  It is a common good predicated on objectivity; that is, allowing
the facts to speak for themselves, but a good which fosters opportu-
nity. When the facts have spoken, they should be allowed to come
to fruition. This, I believe, is the foundation of the American dream
of economic and spiritual well-being. It is a dream predicated on
equal opportunity fueled by preparation and competence.

  It seems convincing that if these indices of preparation, compe-
tence, and opportunity are applied in determining Judge Thomas'
eligibility to serve on the Supreme Court, he could easily pass the
test. Judge Thomas brings to the bench impeccable credentials. He
holds a law degree from Yale University Law School, one of the
most distinguished institutions of the country. Thus, objectivity in
assessing the judge's credentials easily gives him an excellent
grade. Therefore, his preparation to be a distinguished jurist is
beyond question based on his academic credentials.

  In addition to academic credentials, experience has also prepared
the nominee for this day. Having served as assistant attorney gen-
eral in the State of Missouri, legislative assistant to Senator Dan-
forth, legal officer with the Office of Civil Rights in the Depart-
ment of Education, chairman of the Equal Employment Opportuni-
ty Commission, and now judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals, which
is considered the second highest Federal court, Judge Thomas' pro-
file of service reveals a convincing progression of his appropriate
professional ladder.

   In fact, his experience as a Georgia youth in the days of severe
racism reminds him that he grew up in the other America where
one is never allowed to forget his black skin and that one never
escapes the ghetto, whether one lives on a farm in Georgia or sits
on the U.S. Supreme Court in the District of Columbia.

  In his own words which appeared in the Atlantic magazine in
1988, and quoted in Jet on May 22, 1991, page 8, Judge Thomas
states,

  There is nothing you can do to get past your black skin. I don't care how educated
you are, how good you are at what you do. You will never have the same contact or
opportunities.

   However, because of his credentials, his experience and ambition,
an opportunity is knocking at his door today. It is an opportunity
deeply embedded in the American dream which says that compe-

          56-271 O--93 25
                                               760

tence, industry, and creativity will be rewarded. That dream in-
stilled in him by his parents kept hope alive in the long journey of
43 years along that circuitous path from Pin Point, GA, to hopeful-
ly the highest court of our land.

  With credentials and experience documented, with an inescap-
able past that will keep him tied to his roots, thus sensitive to the
struggles of the other America, Judge Thomas' appointment to the
U.S. Supreme Court is further legitimized by its symbolic signifi-
cance.

  This point is very important here. A Nation with such ethnic di-
versity as America should consciously seek representation of all its
citizens in the halls of justice. It further symbolizes that the Ameri-
can dream is achievable. It says to every American that regardless
of race, creed or color, you can dream the impossible dream, you
can climb every mountain.

  Now, neither am I disturbed by the evolutionary process evi-
denced in the judge's thinking on a variety of legal and social
issues.

  Senator SIMON. If you could conclude your statement now, the 5
minutes is up.

  Mr. SHAW. Yes, sir, I am concluding it right now.
  The posture of growth that we find in the gentleman is saying
that intellectual honesty suggests that we maintain a posture of
openness so that we need not be frozen to the past, and this is a
strong point that has been raised over and over again. Will the real
Thomas stand up? We are saying that the man is open and he need
not be tied to the frozen positions of the past, and I think this is
one of the very strong points in his candidacy for this great posi-
tion.

             TESTIMONY BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
                        IN SUPPORT OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS
                                                      BY
                                TALBERT 0. SHAW, PRESIDENT

                                   RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

        MR. CHAIRMAN, AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THIS JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE, I AM TALBERT 0. SHAW, PRESIDENT OF SHAW UNIVERSITY IN
RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA, AND I DEEPLY APPRECIATE THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU IN SUPPORT OF THE APPOINTMENT
OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.

         ALTHOUGH I DO EXPRESS, TODAY, OPINIONS OF MY OWN, IT IS
SIGNIFICANT THAT I SPEAK AS THE PRESIDENT OF SHAW UNIVERSITY, AN
HISTORICALLY BLACK, LIBERAL ARTS, COEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION,
FOUNDED IN 1865, FULLY ACCREDITED BY THE SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION OF
COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS, AND PRESENTLY OFFERS BACCALAUREATE DEGREES
IN MAJOR ACADEMIC DISCIPLINES TO OVER 2,000 STUDENTS.

         I DO NOT APPEAR BEFORE YOU, DISTINGUISHED LEGISLATORS,
CLAIMING ANY EXPERTISE IN AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE, ALTHOUGH
PHILOSOPHY IS MY ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE; BUT I DO BRING A KEEN
INTEREST IN HISTORY, GENERALLY AND AMERICAN HISTORY IN
PARTICULAR, ESPECIALLY THAT ASPECT OF OUR HISTORY THAT FOCUSES
ON THE EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES,
PRINCIPLES THAT SEEK OBJECTIVITY, EQUALITY AND JUSTICE, ALL
REPRESENTING A QUEST FOR THE COMMON GOOD. IT'S A COMMON GOOD
PREDICATED ON OBJECTIVITY, I.E., ALLOWING THE FACTS TO SPEAK FOR
                                   762

THEMSELVES, BUT A GOOD WHICH FOSTERS OPPORTUNITY, I.E., WHEN THE
FACTS HAVE SPOKEN, THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO COME TO FRUITION.
THIS, I BELIEVE, IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM OF
ECONOMIC AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING. IT IS A DREAM PREDICATED ON
EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FUELED BY PREPARATION AND COMPETENCE.

         IT SEEMS CONVINCING THAT IF THESE INDICES OF PREPARATION.
COMPETENCE. AND OPPORTUNITY ARE APPLIED IN DETERMINING JUDGE
THOMAS' ELIGIBILITY TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT, HE WOULD
EASILY PASS THE TEST. JUDGE THOMAS BRINGS TO THE BENCH
IMPECCABLE CREDENTIALS. HE HOLDS A LAW DEGREE FROM YALE
UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL, ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED
INSTITUTIONS IN THE COUNTRY. OBJECTIVITY IN ASSESSING THE
JUDGE'S CREDENTIALS EASILY GIVES HIM AN EXCELLENT GRADE.
THEREFORE, HIS PREPARATION TO BE A DISTINGUISHED JURIST IS
BEYOND QUESTION.

         IN ADDITION TO ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS, EXPERIENCE HAS ALSO
PREPARED THE NOMINEE FOR THIS DAY. HAVING SERVED AS ASSISTANT
ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE STATE OF MISSOURI, LEGISLATIVE ASSISTANT
TO SENATOR DANFORTH, LEGAL OFFICER WITH THE OFFICE OF CIVIL
RIGHTS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, CHAIRMAN OF THE EQUAL
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION, AND NOW JUDGE IN THE D.C.
COURT OF APPEALS, WHICH IS CONSIDERED THE SECOND HIGHEST FEDERAL
COURT, JUDGE THOMAS' PROFILE OF SERVICE REVEALS A CONVINCING
PROGRESSION UP HIS APPROPRIATE PROFESSIONAL LADDER.

         IN FACT, HIS EXPERIENCE AS A GEORGIA YOUTH IN THE DAYS OF
                                  763

SEVERE RACISM REMINDS HIM THAT HE GREW UP IN THE "OTHER
AMERICA," WHERE ONE IS NEVER ALLOWED TO FORGET HIS BLACK SKIN,
AND THAT ONE NEVER ESCAPES THE GHETTO WHETHER ONE LIVES ON A
FARM IN GEORGIA OR SITS ON THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. IN HIS OWN
WORDS WHICH APPEARED IN THE ATLANTIC MAGAZINE IN 1988 AND
QUOTED IN JET, MAY 22, 1991, PAGE 8, JUDGE THOMAS STATES, "THERE
IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO GET PAST YOUR BLACK SKIN. I DON'T CARE
HOW EDUCATED YOU ARE, HOW GOOD YOU ARE AT WHAT YOU DO. YOU WILL
NEVER HAVE THE SAME CONTACT OR OPPORTUNITIES."

         HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF HIS CREDENTIALS, EXPERIENCE, AND
AMBITION, AN OPPORTUNITY IS KNOCKING AT HIS DOOR TODAY. IT IS
AN OPPORTUNITY DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE AMERICAN DREAM WHICH SAYS
THAT COMPETENCE, INDUSTRY, AND CREATIVITY WILL BE REWARDED.
THAT DREAM INSTILLED IN HIM BY HIS PARENTS KEPT HOPE ALIVE IN
THE LONG JOURNEY OF 43 YEARS ALONG THAT CIRCUITOUS PATH FROM
PINPOINT, GEORGIA TO, HOPEFULLY, THE HIGHEST COURT OF OUR LAND.

         WITH CREDENTIALS AND EXPERIENCE DOCUMENTED, WITH AN
 INESCAPABLE PAST THAT WILL KEEP HIM TIED TO HIS ROOTS, THUS
SENSITIVE TO THE STRUGGLES OF THE "OTHER AMERICA," JUDGE THOMAS'
APPOINTMENT TO THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IS FURTHER LEGITIMIZED BY
 ITS SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE. A NATION WITH SUCH ETHNIC DIVERSITY
 SHOULD CONSCIOUSLY SEEK REPRESENTATION OF ALL ITS CITIZENS IN
 THE HALLS OF JUSTICE. IT FURTHER SYMBOLIZES THAT THE AMERICAN
 DREAM IS ACHIEVABLE; IT SAYS TO EVERY AMERICAN THAT REGARDLESS
 OF RACE, CREED OR COLOR, "YOU CAN DREAM THE 'IMPOSSIBLE' DREAM,
 YOU CAN CLIMB EVERY MOUNTAIN."

                                                        3
                                   764

        NEITHER AM I DISTURBED BY THE EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS
EVIDENCED IN THE JUDGE'S THINKING ON A VARIETY OF LEGAL AND
SOCIAL ISSUES, FOR INTELLECTUAL DISHONESTY INVOLVES CLINGING TO
OUT-DATED OPINIONS DESPITE CONVINCING EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY.
OPENNESS, THE POSTURE FOR GROWTH IN A WORLD OF NOVELTY AND
CHANGE IS THE ONLY HONEST INTELLECTUAL ATTITUDE TO ASSUME IN THE
MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS. ESPECIALLY IS THIS TRUE IN THE INEXACT
SCIENCES, LIKE JURISPRUDENCE, WHERE INTERPRETATION IS THE
METHODOLOGY OF PRACTICE IN QUEST OF UNDERSTANDING AND TRUTH.
UNREADINESS TO ASSUME INFLEXIBLE POSITIONS ON LEGAL ISSUES
COMPLICATED BY TIME AND CIRCUMSTANCE IS, IN MY OPINION,
INTELLECTUALLY MATURE, AND PROCEDURALLY APPROPRIATE. AGAIN, IF
THE JURISTS INTERPRETATION OF LAW IS INFORMED BY GENERAL
PRINCIPLES AND SPECIFIC SITUATIONS, THEN THERE IS A DIALECTIC
WHICH PROVIDES SPACE FOR SUBJECTIVITY ON WHICH GROUNDS APPEAL
COURTS OVERTURN LOWER COURT DECISIONS. IT IS THIS ARENA OF
INTERPRETATION THAT LEGITIMIZES SHIFTS IN OPINIONS IN THE LIGHT
OF NEW EVIDENCE, FOR "TIME MAKES ANCIENT GOOD UNCOUTH."

         THEREFORE, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE, ON SUCH GROUNDS AS ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS, EXPERIENCE,
SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE, AND INTELLECTUAL HONESTY, I STRONGLY
RECOMMEND THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS FOR THE
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

         THANK YOU.

                                         ON CLARENCE THOMAS

         Last night as I watched CNN report on hearings of this past
Tuesday, I was encouraged to hear testimony of Dean Guido Carbaresi
of Harvard Law School express the need for openness in the quest
for truth, and that inflexible pre-established positions on complex
legal issues is intellectually irresponsible, and could in fact be
pragmatically dishonest.

        A Supreme Court Justice with such pre-packaged attitudes would
provide a great disservice to the American people. I had already
written my testimony before hearing the Harvard Law Dean and thus
was greatly comforted to hear my position affirmed by such a
distinguished scholar.

         Perhaps the Clarence Thomas, who brackets his previous
positions and opinions in the quest for clarity and truth, assuming
a willing posture to adjust his thinking as facts and circumstances
dictate, is the most promising nominee for the highest court of our
land in recent years. Resisting the temptation to nurture frozen
and predictable judgments on complicated legal and social issues
that plague the American people. Judge Thomas, if confirmed, could
be a new refreshing voice on the Supreme Court and could possibly
initiate a new era in American jurisprudence where such mischievous
and nonenlightening labels as conservative and liberal are
relegated to the dustbins of legal history.
                                         766

   Senator SIMON. We thank you for your testimony. We will enter
your full statement in the record.

   Ms. Talkin.

                     STATEMENT OF PAMELA TALKIN

  Ms. TALKIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senators.
  For some 10 weeks now, including today, I have heard the relent-
less repetition of various inaccurate assertions regarding Judge
Thomas and his tenure at EEOC. Those statements do not describe
either the man or the agency that I know.
  There really should be no mistake about it. As chairman of the
EEOC, Judge Thomas sought to vigorously enforce all the laws pro-
hibiting discrimination on behalf of all workers, including women,
older workers and Hispanic Americans. In fact, the record estab-
lishes that the EEOC came of age during the tenure of Chairman
Thomas.
  I was somewhat taken aback when Clarence Thomas, then chair-
man of EEOC, asked me, a Democrat and a politically correct
career civil servant, to be his chief of staff. But it soon became ap-
parent that we did share a commitment to equal employment op-
portunity, a commitment to the full protection of workers' rights,
and the common goal of making EEOC a credible and aggressive
law enforcement agency.

  When Judge Thomas asked me to be his chief of staff, he concen-
trated on my law enforcement experience. He ignored by party af-
filiation and never questioned me as to my philosophical views. My
strict and single mandate from Judge Thomas was to help him
make the EEOC effective, and I believe he did make it effective.

  The Thomas EEOC fully investigated more cases, filed more law-
suits, and that is more individual lawsuits and more class actions,
than ever before, and received more damages on behalf of victims
of discrimination--over $1 billion--than ever before. The Thomas
Commission achieved that with inadequate funding and under
severe staffing restrictions.

  For the first time, charges were fully investigated and full re-
dress was sought for victims of discrimination. No more would the
EEOC merely make perfunctory inquiries and then settle meritori-
ous claims for 10 cents on a dollar and a neutral employment refer-
ence. Victims of discrimination were to receive back pay, and those
unlawfully deprived of a livelihood were to get a job.

  In the past, the EEOC field offices made unreviewable determi-
nations to prosecute only a small number of cases. Under Judge
Thomas, all cases in which the law had been violated were submit-
ted to the Commission for litigation. No longer would the EEOC
tell people that although they had been discriminated against,
their case was too small or unimportant for the government to
prosecute.

  Some have mistakenly assumed that this increased effort on
behalf of individual claimants represented a shift away from con-
cern about the systemic discrimination that results from patterns
and practices of employment. Well, it is simply not true. Judge
Thomas sought to improve the handling of all cases at EEOC, in-
cluding the systemic cases. He revitalized our systemic program.
                                             767

  In 1981, there was one systemic case in active litigation. In 1988,
there were 16 such cases in active litigation, and 100 more under
investigation. If not settled, then they could be litigated, too.

  In addition, the EEOC on its own initiative broadened hundreds
of individually-filed claims into class actions. As a matter of fact,
the number of class action suits doubled during the tenure of Clar-
ence Thomas.

  Many have expressed a concern about whether Judge Thomas
can separate his philosophical views from his official obligations.
Well, I can tell you that Judge Thomas approved dozens of settle-
ments which provided for the use of goals and timetables, and that
is despite his now well-publicized and then well-publicized views re-
garding the efficacy of such measures. As an aside, I should note
that even the potential use of goals and timetables arose in prob-
ably one-half of one percent of the 60,000 cases the EEOC handled
annually.

  Another example of Judge Thomas' ability to always carry out
his official duties is in the area of affirmative action, not goals and
timetables, as a remedy. We govern the Federal sector, and I know
there has been a lot of discussion about Johnson v. Santa Clara,
but we required every federal agency to also submit affirmative
action plans, including goals and timetables, based upon the stand-
ards set forth in Johnson v. Santa Clara.

  It is difficult to compress 8 years of accomplishments into 5 min-
utes of testimony. I won't try to discuss the many other innovative
programs that Judge Thomas adopted to enhance our enforcement
capabilities or to discuss the tremendous management strides he
made.

  I can only say that I know that Judge Thomas has a strong belief
in the principles of equal employment opportunity; that he has a
clear understanding of the need for affirmative steps to be taken to
ensure such opportunity, and he obviously has a knowledge of the
debilitating effects of discrimination.

  I am proud to be a public servant. I have been for more than 20
years, and I can tell you that in more than 20 years of public serv-
ice I have never met a public official, or actually any public serv-
ant, for that matter, who was more encouraging and tolerant of di-
versity of opinion and background.

  I know that many of the Senators--I see the red light is on. I
will finish. I know that Senator DeConcini had questions regarding
Hispanic-Americans. I am prepared to answer that or any of the
other questions that the Senators might have. Thank you for this
opportunity.

                               Testimony of Pamela Talkin

Mr. Chairman, Senators:

          Thank you for the opportunity to testify at this
proceeding.

          My name is Pamela Talkin and I am currently a Member
of the Federal Labor Relations Authority. From October 1986
through November 1989 I served as Chief of Staff of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reporting directly
to then-Chairman Clarence Thomas.

          For some time now I have listened to the relentless
repetition of inaccurate assertions regarding the EEOC and
Clarence Thomas. Those statements do not describe the
agency or the man that I know. Let there be no mistake
about it; as Chairman of the EEOC, Judge Thomas vigorously
and effectively enforced all the laws against employment
discrimination. Indeed, the record establishes that the
EEOC came of age under the leadership of Clarence Thomas.
As his Chief of Staff, I witnessed many of these
developments as they occurred.
                                 769

                                             -2-

          Hhy would the Republican Chairman of the EEOC ask me,
a Democrat and a career Federal employee, to be his Chief of
Staff? And why would a "politically correct" civil servant
such as myself accept the position? The reasons are clear.
We shared an abiding commitment to equal employment
opportunity and the full protection and vindication of the
rights of women, minorities, older Americans and workers
with disabilities and a common goal of making the EEOC a
credible and aggressive law enforcement agency. When he
hired me as his Chief of Staff, Judge Thomas concentrated on
my years of NLRB law enforcement experience, ignored my
party affiliation and did not question me as to my
philosophical views; my strict and single mandate from
then-Chairman Thomas was to help him in making the EEOC
effective.

           Judge Thomas missed no opportunity to forcefully
advise all EEOC employees that he expected no less than the
same commitment from them. And EEOC employees were glad to
live up to that expectation because they understood that
Clarence Thomas desired and would encourage, permit and
reward their best efforts toward that goal no matter what
role the employees played and no matter what their age,
color or gender.
                                  770

                                                   -3-

          During Clarence Thomas' tenure as Chairman, the EEOC
fully investigated more cases, filed more legal actions and
recovered more damages for victims of discrimination than at
any other time in the agency's history- The Thomas
Commission went to court on behalf of workers 60% more often
than in previous years and collected a billion dollars on
behalf of American workers, an amount far greater than that
of any comparable period. These accomplishments were
achieved in spite of inadequate funding and severe staffing
restrictions.

          For the first time in the agency's history, policies
were adopted providing for all charges of discrimination to
be thoroughly investigated and for the EEOC to seek full
redress for all victims of discrimination. No longer would
the agency simply make perfunctory inquiries and then settle
meritorious claims for 10 cents on the dollar and a neutral
employment reference. Workers who were unlawfully deprived
of a livelihood were to receive a job and full backpay. And
as a deterrent to future violations of the law, those who
engaged in discrimination would be and were required to take
such affirmative steps as retraining or discharging
offending supervisors, eliminating unlawful practices and
posting notices to employees to advise them of their rights
and assure them that those rights would not again be
                               771

                                                   -4-

violated. There was no compromise in the EEOC's enforcement
efforts.

          In contrast to the past, when EEOC field offices made
selective and unreviewable determinations to prosecute only
a small number of cases found to have merit, under Judge
Thomas the EEOC determined that all cases in which the law
had been violated would be submitted to the Commission
members for litigation consideration. People would no
longer be told that although they had been discriminated
against, the EEOC would not pursue their complaint. Now
victims of discrimination did not have to search for an
attorney who might handle their case for fees they could
hardly afford; the government would vindicate their rights
and enforce the law on their behalf. The message was clear;
justice was to be achieved in every case.

           Some have mistakenly assumed that the EEOC's increased
efforts on behalf of individual workers constituted a shift
away from concern about the continued existence of
broad-based systemic discrimination resulting from
employment patterns and practices within businesses or
 industries. To the contrary, Judge Thomas sought to improve
the EEOC's handling of all cases. To that end he
restructured and revitalized the EEOC's systemic program.
                                  772

                                                   -5-

In 1981 the EEOC had only one broad systemic, pattern and
practice case in active litigation. In 1988 the Commission
had 103 such cases in various stages of investigation; 16 in
active litigation. Moreover, the EEOC, on its own
initiative, actively prosecuted, as broad class actions,
hundreds of cases that had been filed as individual claims.

          In accordance with established legal precedent, in
pattern and practice cases Clarence Thomas voted, along with
his fellow Commission members, to approve settlements which
provided for the use of goals and timetables, despite his
now well-publicized personal views regarding the efficacy of
such measures. Reasonable people can and do, of course,
differ with Judge Thomas' views on the utility of goals and
timetables in certain circumstances. It should be noted,
however, that cases involving even the potential use of such
measures constituted less than one-half of one percent of
the over 60,000 cases filed annually with the EEOC.
Differences of opinion over the effectiveness of this one
form of affirmative action, valid as they may be, cannot
serve as a legitimate basis for assertions that Judge Thomas
did not enforce the laws ensuring equal opportunity and
prohibiting discrimination.

           Judge Thomas was and remains committed to identifying,
attacking and eliminating patterns and practices of
                                  773

                                                   -6-

discrimination and all arbitrary barriers and obstacles to
equal opportunity. Not only were millions of dollars in
damages secured in individual and systemic cases but
innovative approaches were taken to ensure that subtle
barriers and obstacles to equal employment would also be
eliminated. Major corporations were required to actively
recruit minorities and women and to set aside millions of
dollars for the training of minority and women employees and
for the establishment of dozens of scholarship funds. All
Federal agencies were required to analyze their workforce
profile and workplace policies and to submit to the EEOC,
along with goals and timetables, affirmative action plans
that identified barriers to the full employment of
minorities, women and employees with disabilities and that
detailed what steps would be taken to remove those obstacles.

           Judge Thomas' belief in the principles of equal
opportunity, the need for affirmative action to ensure such
opportunity and the debilitating effects of discrimination
informed all his efforts as Chairman of the EEOC. He
constantly sought to reach out and educate members of the
public as to their rights and responsibilities under the law
and the benefits to business and our country of ensuring
that all Americans be permitted to contribute to their full
potential. His commitment was apparent in his own approach
                                  774

                                                   -7-

to the employees of the EEOC. Women, employees with
disabilities, older workers, Hispanic-Americans,
Asian-Americans, African-Americans and other minorities were
affirmatively and actively recruited, trained and promoted.
No other Federal agency had as high a percentage of women
and members of various racial and ethnic minorities in
professional and managerial positions. In over 20 years of
public service, I have never observed anyone who was more
respectful, tolerant and encouraging of diversity of
background and opinion than Clarence Thomas was at the EEOC.

          When he became Chairman in 1982, Clarence Thomas found
an EEOC in disarray. At the time, the General Accounting
Office reported that the EEOC's finances were in shambles
and its case processing was in a state of "complete chaos."
The Office of Personnel Management had concluded that the
work environment at EEOC was "beset by acrimony, improper
employee conduct, poor performance and favoritism." Judge
Thomas introduced sound financial management, established
reliable recordkeeping procedures, completely automated
operations, developed appropriate and fair personnel and
performance evaluation systems, and streamlined the
bureaucracy at the EEOC.

           Clarence Thomas not only built the EEOC's
infrastructure, but by virtue of his unstinting efforts and
                                  775

                                                          -8-

enormous commitment to equal opportunity and the law, he
also succeeded in transforming the EEOC into a respected and
highly professional agency that enforced all the laws
entrusted to it.

          No one was more dismayed than Clarence Thomas when the
evolving EEOC did not, on occasion, live up to its own
enhanced expectations. As he often stated, we at the EEOC
had to build our wagon while we were riding in it and, in
those circumstances, with 50 field offices and over 3,000
employees, mistakes and failures sometimes occurred.
Clarence Thomas recognized and took full responsibility for
such shortcomings and renewed and redoubled his efforts to
make the EEOC a formidable opponent of those who would
violate the laws prohibiting discrimination.

           Today's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is a
fitting and lasting tribute to Clarence Thomas' vision and
his unwavering commitment to upholding the laws protecting
American workers.

  Senator SIMON. Thank you.
  Ms. King.

                      STATEMENT OF WILLIE KING
  Ms. KING. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me this opportu-
nity.
  I am Willie King, financial manager of the U.S. Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission. I have been working in civil rights
for approximately 30 years. My career in civil rights began at the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference in February of 1962 in
Atlanta, GA.
  I won't speak to my activities in civil rights. I have three letters
signed by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., that I think will
fully explain my civil rights activities. I have worked for EEOC for
almost 26 years. I am one of the first employees to be hired by the
Commission.
  I am happy to say that I know Judge Thomas and that I have
worked with him at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion during his tenure as chairman. When Judge Thomas became
chairman of the EEOC, there was an uneasy feeling in the finance
and accounting office. Clearly, we had reason to be apprehensive
because the General Accounting Office [GAO] had just issued a
report criticizing every aspect of the agency's financial operation,
from paying of the bills, accounting for travel advances, issuing
travel checks, and issuing accounting reports.
  The staff was sure that someone would be pointed out to Mr.
Thomas and blamed. To our surprise, he tolerated neither blame
nor finger-pointing. Rather, he wanted to know what it would take
to clean up the financial operation and how long. He promised his
full support and expressed his confidence in the employees working
in finance.
  Judge Thomas kept his word. He gave us clear expectations,
moral support, and provided us with the necessary equipment to do
our jobs. As a result, in May 1984, approximately 2 years after he
became chairman, the GAO approved our accounting system. This
was accomplished in record time because of the support and leader-
ship provided by Judge Thomas.
  Judge Thomas regularly stopped by the finance office to thank
employees personally for doing a good job. Occasionally he would
bring some young protege to my office, show them the operation,
and ask me to explain to them the civil rights movement. Judge
Thomas saw the agency and its mission as a direct result of the
civil rights struggle.
  The clerical and support staff at EEOC had a special relationship
with Judge Thomas. He connected with employees at all levels. He
established a rapport and received genuine and positive feedback
because he cared about the people. The morale at EEOC was at an
all-time high during his administration. The secretarial and re-
sources star board that was started under his administration is still
a viable and integral part of the day-to-day secretarial staff at
EEOC.
  Judge Thomas is a very compassionate man. He took interest in
the less fortunate and the little people. He showed concerns for the
                                             777

plight of working women and minorities. During his tenure as
Chairman of EEOC, many women and minorities were recruited
for and promoted to high level positions. Some were office direc-
tors, senior executive service, and high level secretaries.

  In one service area alone, four black females were promoted to
director at the same time. Only one of those women had a college
degree. He took a chance on them because they had demonstrated
the ability to do their jobs in an outstanding manner, and he re-
members where he came from.

  Judge Thomas also had an interest in people such as the handy-
man and single mothers. He was concerned about families, and he
gave encouraging words when there were problems. He encouraged
college students to do their best, telling them that B grades were
not acceptable, to strive for A's.

  Judge Thomas made older workers feel at ease by regularly stop-
ping by and greeting them. One employee in the financial manage-
ment division followed him out of the office crying when he left.
The employees even dedicated the headquarters office building to
Judge Thomas in appreciation for his outstanding contribution to
EEOC and its mission. He was there for people in need.

  In addition to the financial management improvements made
under Judge Thomas, EEOC made monumental improvements in
the areas of budget execution and formulation, administrative serv-
ices such as personnel management. We have received thousands of
dollars in rebates on our telecommunications area. We have made
improvements in space management and automation. Just this
past July, EEOC received the prestigious Outstanding Property
Managers of the Year Award.

  Senator SIMON. If you could conclude your statement now.
  Ms. KING. All right. To conclude my statement, Mr. Chairman, I
have two letters from employees at the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission expressing their support for Judge Thomas. One
is from a group of women and one is from the EEOC employees at
headquarters in general. I would like to make these two letters a
part of the record.
  Senator SIMON. They will be included in the record.
  Ms. KING. Thank you very, very much.

                     STATEMENT OF JAMES CLYBURN

  Mr. CLYBURN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  It is a pleasure for me to be here today to present testimony in
favor of my good friend, Clarence Thomas. I have known Clarence
for 10 years, and I consider him to be a personal and professional
friend, in spite of the fact that he shares a conservative Republican
philosophy and I am considered a more moderate to liberal Demo-
crat. We have argued and debated many topics during our relation-
ship. On some occasions we have agreed and at other times we
have disagreed. But through it all, I have always found him to be
zealous in his pursuit of the facts and intellectually honest and ob-
jective.
                                               778

  Today I will make observations based on my 17 years of experi-
ence as commissioner of the South Carolina Human Affairs Com-
mission, and two of those years I spent as president of the Interna-
tional Association of Human Rights Agencies and 1 year as presi-
dent of our national association. Today I represent over 200 civil
and human rights agencies as their congressional and Federal liai-
son.

  In the interest of time, I am going to limit my observations to
two areas because you have heard about two or three others al-
ready.

  As South Carolina Human Affairs commissioner, I can appreci-
ate the difficulty in assessing the performance of an agency which
enforces anti-discrimination statutes. There is judgment involved
every step along the way, and emotional disagreements are a regu-
lar part of the decision-making process.

  But if there is one unassailable impediment to fair treatment
under the law, it is inefficient and non-professional conduct by the
enforcing agency. Judge Thomas brought efficiency and profession-
alism to this process in many ways, including reduction in process-
ing time of appeals, higher standards of professionalism among
staff members, greater accountability in its financial management,
and a greater delegation of authority to State and local contracting
agencies.

  I do not find Judge Thomas, as many seem to feel, to be anti-
affirmative action. He does express displeasure with any forms of
racial preference and appears to believe that it is a dilution of af-
firmative action to award benefits those who have not been identi-
fied as victims. I am among those who differ with Clarence on this
methodology. But it should be noted that this same Clarence
Thomas, while at the EEOC, required us at the State and local
levels to complete affirmative action plans as a prerequisite to ob-
taining contracts with EEOC.

  In another instance, I think it is important to note that the
people who know Clarence Thomas best, aside maybe from the
people who are at this table from EEOC, are those of us who run
the State and local agencies throughout the country.

  We found Clarence to be highly compassionate, sensitive, judi-
cious, and we always found him to be of the intellectual honesty
that is required in this field.

  Mr. Chairman, I do not present myself as one who has agreed
with Clarence on every occasion. Trying to find consensus in en-
forcing anti-discrimination laws is about like trying to match up
the sides of a Rubik's cube. While there have been instances where
my philosophy may have differed from his, I have never found any-
thing in his philosophy of a nature to deny him this Supreme
Court confirmation.

  When I look at the record of Clarence Thomas, I find the record
of a man deeply committed to an even-handed system of justice. I
would suggest that in Clarence Thomas there is the integrity, the
conscientious spirit, and the basic sense of fairness which well de-
scribe the requirements for a successful Justice on the Supreme
Court.

  Thank you.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Commissioner.
                                      779
  Dr. Shaw, as you may be aware, I have been very much involved
in the historically black colleges portion of the Higher Education
Act. Much of that was written with the great leadership of Dr. Pat-
terson in my office when I was over on the House side.
  As I follow the legal theories of Judge Thomas, he would say we
can assist people on the basis of economic need. And in fairness to
him, he has not suggested this, but as I follow the theories logical-
ly--and the commissioner referred to the racial preference issue
that he believes is unconstitutional and unsound--he would rule
that we could not have the kind of legislation that we now have for
the historically black colleges and universities.
  If you knew on the Supreme Court he was going to rule against
funding for historically black colleges and universities, would you
still be supporting him?
  Mr. SHAW. If I knew--let me, Senator Simon, say that a certain
settlement that he made with General Motors some years ago, a
large settlement, he deliberately saw to it that $10 million of that
went to historically black colleges. And I might say to you, sir, that
initially I was opposed to Judge Thomas until I heard his posture
with reference to historically black colleges. He believes they ought
to be retained and strengthened.
  If that documented decision of him is to presage his behavior on
the Court
  Senator SIMON. If I may interrupt, are you saying--and maybe
he has said this. I am not suggesting that he is opposed to the his-
torically black colleges. What I am suggesting is that his legal
theory, if it is followed, would suggest that Federal assistance on
the basis of race would be unconstitutional. Are you saying that he
has said that he follows a legal theory that that can continue?
  Mr. SHAW. I do not know that he is against opportunity for all
Americans. And although I am not conversant to the fact regard-
ing a legal theory of his which if extended would eliminate black
colleges, I think I understand him. His position on civil rights
would in fact support institutions that would give opportunities to
all Americans, Senator. He is for civil rights. He is for opportunity.
This has, in fact, made him what he is.
  If any person would overturn the instruments that are made to
enforce the American dream, I would be against him or her getting
on the Supreme Court. But I do not see any necessary implication
in his legal theory that would, in fact, eliminate black colleges.
  Senator SIMON. All right. Well, we are both arguing theories at
this point, and I did not ask Judge Thomas that. Thank you.
  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to take this opportunity to welcome this panel here. Dr.
Shaw, you are from Raleigh, NC, I believe. Was Shaw University
named after you?
  Mr. SHAW. NO, sir. I don't own the place, sir. It is 126 years old
this year. [Laughter.]
  It is one of the accidents of history, sir.
  Senator THURMOND. MS. Talkin, I understand you and Ms. King
have worked with Clarence Thomas and know him personally well.
  Ms. TALKIN. Yes, Senator.
                                             780

   Senator THURMOND. YOU are basing your testimony on your per-
sonal knowledge.

  Ms. TALKIN. Yes, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. And, Dr. Shaw, you are basing your testimo-
ny on personal knowledge or writings of Clarence Thomas or what?
  Mr. SHAW. His writings which I have read and from what I have
heard. I do not know him personally, but I am basing my
  Senator THURMOND. His writings and reputation; is that it?

   Mr. SHAW. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Clyburn, are you basing your recom-
mendation on personal acquaintance, aren't you?

   Mr. CLYBURN. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. Personal knowledge as well as writings and
other things, too?

   Mr. CLYBURN. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, I want to thank you all for coming. I
am not going to take a lot of time. I think we have taken too much
time of some of these witnesses. It boils down to this: The same two
questions I have asked these others witnesses I am going to ask
you. And, Mr. Clyburn, I want to especially welcome you here.

  Mr. CLYBURN. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. YOU are the South Carolina Human Affairs
commissioner in South Carolina.
  Mr. CLYBURN. Right.
  Senator THURMOND. We are very proud of your work. You have
done a fine job there.
  Mr. CLYBURN. Thank you very much.
  Senator THURMOND. These are the questions I am going to ask
all of you. We will start here with Dr. Shaw.
  Is it your opinion that Judge Thomas is highly qualified and pos-
sesses the necessary integrity, professional competence, and judi-
cial temperament to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court?
  Mr. SHAW. Yes, sir. May I just read a last paragraph of my state-
ment which is four lines in response to you?
  Therefore, distinguished members of the Judiciary Committee,
on such grounds as academic credentials, experience, symbolic sig-
nificance, and intellectual honesty, I strongly recommend the con-
firmation of Judge Clarence Thomas for the U.S. Supreme Court.
  So, yes, sir.
  Senator THURMOND. SO, your answer is yes?

   Mr. SHAW. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. MS. Talkin, I would ask you the same ques-
tion.

  Ms. TALKIN. I don't presume to substitute my judgment for this
panel, but I would concur that he is well qualified.

  Senator THURMOND. SO, your answer is yes?

   Ms. TALKIN. It is.

  Senator THURMOND. MS. King?

   Ms. KING. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. The answer is yes. Mr. Clyburn?

   Mr. CLYBURN. Yes.
                                      781

  Senator THURMOND. The second question: Do you know of any
reason why Clarence Thomas should not be made a member of the
U.S. Supreme Court, since he has been appointed by the President?

  Mr. SHAW. NO, sir, I don't.
  Senator THURMOND. The answer is no. Ms. Talkin?
  Ms. TALKIN. NO, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. MS. King?

   Ms. KING. NO.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Clyburn?

   Mr. CLYBURN. NO, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. I think you have answered the questions
that the committee wants to know. We have spent days here prob-
ing affirmative action, but it all boils down to this, whether you
favor him or not, and you said you do support him and you have
told us why, so that is all we need to know.

  Thank you very much. We are pleased to have you here.
  Mr. CLYBURN. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator SIMON. Senator Grassley?
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you very much for your testimony, and
I won't take a lot of time, just a very general question.
  Because you know and have studied Clarence Thomas well, and
particularly those who have worked closely with him, and because
so often other panels have questioned his commitment to civil
rights and equal opportunity, I want to ask each of you in much
the same way that Senator Thurmond did, for a short opinion or
statement:
  Due to your extensive exposure to Clarence Thomas, do you have
any question at all of his commitment to equal opportunity and
civil rights, and not only in regard to African-American civil
rights, but do you have any question that he is committed to the
advancement of the civil rights of all minorities, whether it be Af-
rican-Americans, women, the elderly, Hispanics, Asians, or any
other group?
  Dr. Shaw first, and then Ms. Talkin.
  Mr. SHAW. I did not get the essence of your question, sir.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Dta you have any doubt in your mind
  Mr. SHAW. I don't.
  Senator GRASSLEY [continuing]. About his commitment to civil
rights?
  Mr. SHAW. I don't.
  Senator GRASSLEY. MS. Talkin?
  Ms. TALKIN. In my experience, Judge Thomas has demonstrated
an unwavering dedication to civil right.
  Senator GRASSLEY. And for all groups?
  Ms. TALKIN. For all groups, and I can give you numerous exam-
ples, if you want.
  Senator GRASSLEY. MS. King?
  Ms. KING. Based on my 30 years of work in the civil rights move-
ment and the work with Judge Thomas, I am positively convinced
that he does not have any problems in the area that you just out-
lined of civil rights.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Clyburn?
                                                782

  Mr. CLYBURN. NO, Senator, I do not. I think it is kind of interest-
ing, if I may, that questions raised about the sole issue of affirma-
tive action, every debate I have ever had with Clarence Thomas on
this subject has always convinced me that he believes in affirma-
tive action as a concept, very strongly. He has real problems with
methodology, and there is difference of opinion as to what the
methods ought to be.

  Our of fairness to him, I think we ought to take into account,
Senator Simon, that what Clarence has said time and time again is
that race ought to be but one factor, that's the threshold that
ought to be crossed, and after that threshold is crossed, then he
thinks other things ought to kick in, in order to determine whether
or not affirmative action ought to take place. So, I think that is a
little bit different from what people seem to say as being against
affirmative action.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Senator Simon, I am through.
  Senator SIMON. We thank the witnesses very much for being
here. We appreciate you taking the time and also your patience in
sitting through a lot of the hearings here.
  Senator Biden wants to be here for the next panel, but we would
ask Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Chambers, Mr. Rauh and Ms. Hernandez, if
all four of you could come to the podium. Mr. Lucy is also on this
next panel.
  Senator Biden is on his way over here, and we will just take a 2-
minute recess until he gets here.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN [presiding]. The meeting will come to order.
  Our seventh panel this morning, talk about optimism--when the
staff wrote this, they said the seventh panel this morning--the sev-
enth panel is one of our most distinguished panels that has come to
testify in opposition to Judge Thomas, and includes John Buchan-
an, a former Congressperson, now the Policy Chair of People for
the American Way. John, you have not only been here today, I
have observed you have been here I think every day from the
outset.
  Julius Chambers, on behalf of the NAACP Legal Defense and
Education Fund. I read your statement, Mr. Chambers, and you
sure did a whole heck of a lot of work on going back and going
through all of the former Justices, when they were appointed and
how old they were, and I am anxious to hear what you have to say.
  A man who is not at all unfamiliar to this committee, one of the
distinguished lawyers in the Nation, Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. Joe is
known to everyone on this committee and has been here on almost
every important issue in the last couple of years.
  Antonia Hernandez, on behalf of the Mexican-American Legal
Defense and Education Fund and the Alliance for Justice.
  And Mr. William Lucy, president of the Coalition of the Black
Trade Unionists, and secretary-treasurer for the American Federa-
tion of State and County Municipal Employees. It is good to see
you, Bill.
  Again, I was told by Senator Thurmond that, in my absence, Sen-
ator Simon ran a tough ship. He said he got it done, he said he got
everybody in in 5 minutes and limited Senators' questions. See
even the stenographer smiling over there. So that there is not a re-
                                             783

bellion on the committee, and I am not suggesting you should value
my chairmanship, it would be helpful to me that you not make me
look bad, in light of Simon's chairing of this committee.

  All kidding aside, your entire statements will be placed in the
record. We have a number of questions for you, so to the extent
you can come close to keeping the limit, I would appreciate it.

  Has the panel determined how they would like to proceed? Con-
gressman, why don't you begin first, and we will work our way
across, that is how we will do it.

STATEMENT OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF JOHN H. BUCHANAN,
  JR., POLICY CHAIR, PEOPLE FOR THE AMERICAN WAY; JULIUS
  CHAMBERS, NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL
  FUND, INC.; JOSEPH L. RAUH, JR., LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
  ON CIVIL RIGHTS; ANTONIA HERNANDEZ, ON BEHALF OF THE
  MEXICAN-AMERICAN LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND
  AND THE ALLIANCE FOR JUSTICE; AND WILLIAM LUCY, COALI-
  TION OF BLACK TRADE UNIONISTS

  Mr. BUCHANAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  First, People for the American Way Action Fund has additional
material we would like to submit for the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.
  Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chairman and Senator Thurmond, it is nei-
ther easy or pleasant to come before this committee to testify
against the nomination of Clarence Thomas. We do not take this
step lightly. In fact, the People for the American Way Action Fund
has only once before opposed a Supreme Court nominee.
  Like Judge Thomas, I grew up in the Deep South in the bad old
days of segregation, discrimination and white supremacy. My pro-
found empathy and identification with black Americans is the
reason I became a civil rights activist, as a Representative of Bir-
mingham, AL, in the U.S. Congress. For 16 years, I served as a
Representative to many families like Judge Thomas' and have
served and do serve as a pastor to black Americans. I am keenly
aware of the experience he shares with generations of African-
Americans, and I understand the burden they have carried and the
road they have traveled.
   But in evaluating this nomination to the Supreme Court, the
committee knows it must look beyond background and character,
for character alone does not tell us what type of a Justice Clarence
Thomas would make. Indeed, Mr. Chairman, I would submit that
character is a threshold requirement for such a nomination, some-
thing that should be a granted and a given. We agree that it is
vital to examine Clarence Thomas' record as a public official. That
is what the People for the American Way Action Fund did, after
Judge Thomas was nominated--reading every speech he made
available and every article he had authored, and examining his
service at the Office of Civil Rights and the EEOC.
   After that searching and thorough process, we concluded that
Judge Thomas' record reveals hostility to numerous Supreme Court
precedents involving individual liberties and civil rights. In short,
Mr. Chairman, Judge Thomas' troubled tenure in the executive
branch, his obvious animosity toward Congress, and his oft-ex-
                                              784

pressed, strongly held views on the vital constitutional issues that
will come before the Court suggest that he would join forces with
those Justices who would substitute their own judgments for the
written law and who willingly disregard legislative directives.

  I wish I could say his testimony before this committee had con-
vinced us we were wrong. But nothing in Judge Thomas' 5 days of
testimony led us to believe that we had made a mistake. In fact,
the testimony only added to our concerns.

  As a former Member of Congress, I know that one who aspires to
high public office cannot simply disavow his or her prior actions
and prior statements. Yet, that is precisely what Judge Thomas did
for 5 days. He offered one excuse and evasion after another:

  He had not read the document or he did not agree with state-
ments he explicitly endorsed; or he did not mean what he said, it
was only rhetoric designed to appeal to his audience; or he had no
opinion on, indeed he had never thought about or discussed it; or
he was only acting as an advocate for the administration and he
would leave what he said in speech after speech in that capacity at
the door of his chambers.

  Sometimes, Judge Thomas asked the committee to ignore the
plain meaning of his statements and writings, especially in the
area of natural law. In other instances, Judge Thomas simply
stonewalled on matters of great importance to the committee and
the country, most notably a woman's right to choose.

  Simply stated, Judge Thomas refused to engage in a dialog about
his past record or even his view of the Constitution.

  It is the Senate's constitutional responsibility to exercise mean-
ingful advice and consent, a role coequal to that of the President.
We agree with Senator Thurmond's statement in 1968 at another
Supreme Court nomination hearing, when he said: "To contend
that we must merely satisfy ourselves that the nominee is a good
lawyer and a man of good character is to hold to a very narrow
view of the role of the Senate, a view that neither the Constitution
itself nor history and precedent have prescribed."

  Judge Thomas' disavowals, equivocations, denials and stonewall-
ing are no doubt part of a strategy to advance the nominee's
chances for confirmation.

  It is not just the liberals who have been concerned about this.
One conservative activist said she wished he would be more specific
and not try to ride the fence on these issues. Another said it is irri-
tating that the White House strategists apparently feel he has got
to go to such lengths to deny that he has a position comparable to
the one that the President openly defended during his campaign.

  Mr. Chairman, you mentioned the Souter standard might now
become the Thomas standard. I would suggest it is the Bush stand-
ard, because the real question here is how far the White House will
go in seeking to derail the Senate's constitutional obligation of
advice and consent.

  Whether the committee votes to put a liberal or a moderate or a
conservative on the Court, at the very least you should be able to
determine which it is you are getting. You should not have to take
it on faith alone.

  The question the members of this committee must ask is: Am I
confident this nominee will protect American's fundamental liber-
                                      785
ties. That question could not be answered in the affirmative before
Judge Thomas' testimony. I would say we have heard in these
hearings nothing that would overcome the worrisome aspects of his
public record, and I think those questions remain.

  It is our deepest hope, therefore, Mr. Chairman, the Senate will
not approve this nomination and the erosion of the Court's historic
role in protecting individual rights and liberties that it represents.

  Thank you.

      ACTION FUND

                  Defending Constitutional Liberties

                         CLARENCE THOMAS: THEN AND NOW

                 In his first three days of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee this
         week, Judge Clarence Thomas repeatedly contradicted his previous record. Much of the
         discussion of those contradictions has focused on his testimony concerning Natural Law
         and its role in constitutional adjudication. Those contradictions are extremely significant,
         but the nominee has also contradicted himself on a variety of other issues.

                 The following quotations contrast Clarence Thomas's sworn testimony to the
         Senate Judiciary Committee with his previous record.

        Natural Law and Its Use in Constitutional Adjudication

                 Then - Clarence Thomas repeatedly advocated a "jurisprudence" grounded in "the
                 Founders' notions of natural rights." (Notes on Original Intent) He argued that
                 "without recourse to higher law, we abandon our best defense of judicial review"
                 and that "higher law is the only alternative to the willfulness of both run-amok
                 majorities and run-amok judges." ("The Higher Law Background of the Privileges
                 and Immunities Clause," (hereinafter "Higher Law"^ Harvard Journal of Law and
                 Public Policy, vol.12, no. 1, Winter 1989 at 63-64).

                Now - Clarence Thomas claims that "I don't see a role for the use of natural law
                in constitutional adjudication. My interest in exploring natural law and natural
                rights was purely in the context of political theory." (Hearings before the Senate
                Judiciary Committee on Clarence Thomas to become an Associate Justice of the
                Supreme Court (hereinafter "Hearings"), Sep. 10, 1991 at 137). Later, in the
                hearings Thomas offered a somewhat different view, stating that "there is no
                independent appeal to Natural Law," but "what one does is one appeals to the
                Drafters' view of what they were doing, and they believe in Natural Law."
                (Hearings, September 12 at 41.)

        Opinion Concerning Roe v. Wade

                Then - In a critique of so-called judicial activism, Clarence Thomas wrote that
                the "current case provoking the most protest from conservatives is Roe v. Wade."
                (Higher Law at 63 n. 2.) Thomas wrote in a black newspaper that there was
                "tremendous overlap of the conservative Republican agenda and Black beliefs on
                abortion" and other issues. ("How Republicans Can Win Blacks, Chicago
                Defender, Feb. 21, 1987)

Washington DC 200.%   -
                                         787

         Now -- Clarence Thomas told the Committee that "I cannot remember personally
         engaging" in any discussion about Roe v. Wade and "I do not" have a "personal
         opinion on the outcome in Roe v. Wade." (Hearings, Sep. 11, 1991 at 104-05)

White House Working Gromp om ikt Family

         Then -- Clarence Thomas was the highest Administration official who served on
         the White House Working Group on the Family, which issued a report sharply
         criticizing as "fatally flawed" a series of decisions protecting the right to privacy,
         including Roe v. Wade. The Report notes that such decisions could be
         "corrected" either by constitutional amendment or by "the appointment of new
        judges and their confirmation by the Senate." (White House Working Group on
         the Family Report to the President, December 2, 1986 at 12)

        Now - Clarence Thomas claimed that "To this day, I have not read that report"
         and that he does not necessarily agree with several of its criticisms of privacy
         decisions (Hearings, Sep. 10, 1991 at 155,156-7).

Endorsement of Lewis Lehrman's Anti-abortion Article

        Then - Clarence Thomas called Lewis Lehrman's article, entitled "The
        Declaration of Independence and the Right to life: One Leads Unmistakably to
        the Other," a "splendid example of applying natural law to the right to life."
         (Speech before the Heritage Foundation, June 18, 1987 at 22)

        Now - Clarence Thomas says that he "did not endorse the article," does not agree
        with it, and was attempting to use it simply to "convince my audience" concerning
        his views of civil rights. He testified that "I do not believe that Mr. Lehrman's
        application of natural law is appropriate." (Hearings, Sep. 10, 1991 at 195-7;
        Hearings, Sep. 11, 1991 at 97)

Views on the Ninth Amendment

        Then - Clarence Thomas criticized the "invention" and "activist judicial use of the
        Ninth Amendment," and wrote that the Ninth Amendment "will likely become an
        additional weapon for the enemies of freedom." ("Civil Rights as Principle versus
        Civil Rights as Interest," in D. Boaz, ed., Assessing the Reagan Years. Spring 1987
        at 398-9; "Higher Law" at 63 n.2)

        Now - Clarence Thomas testified that 1 think that the only concern I have
        expressed with the respect to the Ninth Amendment, Senator, has been a generic
                                         788

        one" that a judge "who is adjudicating under those open-ended provisions tether
        his or her rulings to something other than his or her personal point of view."
        (Hearings, Sep. 11, 1991 at 110)

Participation in Lincoln Review

        Then ~ Clarence Thomas served for ten years on the Editorial Advisory Board of
        the Far Right Lincoln Review and published three articles in the journal. It was
        the only scholarly publication with which Thomas was affiliated. (The three
        articles were "With liberty...For AIL" Lincoln Review. Winter - Spring 1982 at 41;
        "Remembering an Island of Hope in an Era of Despair, Lincoln Review. Spring
        1986 at 53; Thomas Sowell and the Heritage of Lincoln," Lincoln Review. Winter
        1987/88 at 7.)

        Now ~ Clarence Thomas said, "the role of a member of the advisory board was
        purely honorary. There were no meetings. There was no review of literature.
        There were no communications. There was no selection of material that was
        included in the journal. Indeed, I don't think that I have read a copy of the
        Lincoln Review in two or three years." (Hearings, Sep. 11, 1991 at 175)

.Tav Parker and South Africa

        Then - At an EEOC staff meeting in 1986, Clarence Thomas discussed for 45
       minutes the representation of South Africa by his friend Jay Parker, according to
        former Thomas aides. (Newsday, Sep. 12, 1991) In 1987, according to Foreign
       Agents Registration Act records, Thomas attended a dinner for the South African
       ambassador which Parker helped to arrange. (IPAC filings under the Foreign
       Agent Registration Act, Sep. 10, 1987; Newsday July 16, 1991).

       Now - Thomas testified that "I was not aware, again, of the representation of
       South Africa itself by Jay Parker. (Hearings, Sep. 11, 1991 at 174)

Level of Protection for Economic Rights

       Then ~ Clarence Thomas argued, "What we need to emphasize is that the entire
       Constitution is a Bill of Rights; and economic rights are protected as much as any
       other rights." (Speech to the American Bar Association, Aug. 11, 1987 at 10)

       Now ~ Clarence Thomas claimed, "There is ako a reference to property in our
       Constitution. That does not necessarily mean that in constitutional adjudication
       that the protection would "be at the same level that we protect other rights. Nor
                                     789

         did I suggest that in constitutional adjudication that would happen. But it
         certainly does deserve some protection." (Hearings, Sep. 10, 1991 at 144)

Views on Discrimination against Women in the Work Place

         Then - Clarence Thomas argued that "the disparity in hiring figures between men
         and women" in cases like the Sears case could "be due to cultural differences
         between men and women, educational levels, commuting patterns, and other
         previous events." (Juan Williams, "A Question of Fairness," Atlantic Monthly.
         February 1987 at 81, quoting Williams.) Thomas praised an article by Thomas
         Sowell, that argued that historic pay and job inequities between men and women
         were due largely to women's personal choices, as a "useful, concise discussion"
         which "presents a much-needed antidote to cliches about women's earnings and
         professional status." ("Thomas Sowell and the Heritage of Lincoln, Lincoln
         Review. Winter 1987/88 at 15-16)

         Now - Clarence Thomas maintains that "I did not indicate that, first of all, I
         agreed with [Sowell's] conclusions" and that "my only point in discussing statistics
         is that I don't think any of us can say that we have all the answers as to why there
         are statistical disparities." (Hearings, Sep. 10, 1991 at 189,193)

Violations of Age Discrimination Law

         Then - Thomas stated that "I am of the opinion that there are many technical
        violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that, for practical and
         economic reasons, make sense. Older workers cost employers more than younger
        workers. Employee benefits are linked to longevity and salary." (ABA Banking
        Journal 9/85 at 120)

        Now - Clarence Thomas claimed that "I have never condoned violations of the
        Age Discrimination in Employment Act," although "it would make sense to an
        employer to think that, well, this approach is okay." (9/12 at 110,112).

Violation of Court Order while at Office of Civil Rights

        Then - While bead of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education,
        Thomas admitted in federal court that be was violating "grievously" a court order
        concerning OCR handling of civil rights cases. The court concluded that "the
        order has been violated in many important respects and we are not at all
        convinced that these violations will be taken care of and eventually eliminated
        without the coercive power of the court." (Adams v. Bell. 3/12/82 Tr. at 61 &
                                         790

         3/15/82 Findings at 3)

         Now ~ Clarence Thomas testified that "we did everything we could to comply"
         with the court order and that the court recognized that "we were doing all we
         could" and "that it was impossible for us to comply with it." (9/12 at 161)

Run-amok Judges

         Then - Clarence Thomas wrote that "higher law is the only alternative to the
         willfulness of both run-amok majorities and run-amok judges." ("The Higher Law
         Background of the Privileges and Immunities Clause," Harvard Journal of Law
         and Public Policy, vol. 12, no. 1, Winter 1989 at 63-64)

         Now - In response to Senator Kennedy's question of whether the nominee could
         identify any run-amok judges, Thomas said: "Senator, I thought about it when I
         looked at that language again, and I couldn't name any particular judge." (Sept.
         13 P. 145)

Views on Oliver Wendell Holmes

         Then - Clarence Thomas stated that "If anything unites the jurisprudence of the
         left and the right today, it is the nihilism of Holmes." Quoting Walter Berns, a
         leading natural law advocate, and Robert Faulkner, Thomas said of Holmes: "No
         man who ever sat on the Supreme Court was less inclined and so poorly equipped
         to be a statesman or to teach . . . what a people needs to govern itself well," and
         "what [John] Marshall had raised Holmes sought to destroy." Speech to Pacific
         Research Institute, August 4, 1988 p.13.

         Now - Clarence Thomas characterized Homes as "a great judge." He stated that
         "we might disagree here and there" but that "he is a giant in our judicial system."
         September 13 P. 145.

The Nomination of Robert Bork

        Then - Clarence Thomas stated that "Judge Bork is no extremist of any kind. If
        anything, he is an extreme moderate." (Speech to Pacific Research Institute Aug.
         10, 1987 p. 16). According to Thomas, it "reflected disgracefully on the whole
        nomination process that Judge Bork is not now Justice Bork." (Speech to Cato
        Institute Oct. 2, 1987 p. 2) Thomas referred to the "spectacle of Senator Biden,
        following the defeat of the Bork nomination, crowing about his belief that his
        rights were inalienable and came from God." (Speech to Pacific Research
                                     791

        Institute Aug. 4,1988 p. 12)
         Now ~ Clarence Thomas testified that "I do not think that this committee and did
        not say that this committee engaged in" improper characterizations or conduct
        with respect to the Bork nomination, but "my view was that Judge Bork was
         qualified as to his temperament, as to his competence, and certainly qualified as
        to his overall abilities." (Sept. 13 P. 103,104)

Statements about Oliver North and Congress
        Then - Clarence Thomas stated that "I thought that Ollie North did a most
        effective job of exposing Congressional irresponsibility. He forced their hand, and
        revealed the extent to which their public persona is a fake." (Speech at Wake
        Forest, April 18,1988 p.21). He commented "As Ollie North made perfectly clear
        last summer, it is Congress that is out of control." (Speech at Univ. of Virginia
        March S, 1988 p.13) (emphasis in original) According to Thomas, North's
        testimony showed that the defense of limited government "is still possible," and
        the Iran-Contra committee "beat an ignominious retreat before Colonel North's
        attack on it, and by extension all of Congress." (Speech to Cato Institute, Oct. 2,
         1987 p.13)
        Now -- Clarence Thomas testified that "I do not think that I condoned" improper
        conduct by North. "I think myself, like many others, that in that highly charged
        political environment that Col. North took the advantage to himself and used that
        environment to his advantage, rather than succumbing to it." (Sept. 13 P.92)

Obligations of government and compassion
        Then - Clarence Thomas stated that "I, for one, don't see how the government
        can be compassionate. Only people can be compassionate and then only with
        their own money, their own property and their own efforts, not that of others."
        (Speech at California State Univ. April 25, 1988 p.22) He advocated changes
        "affecting our governance in all areas," including not only "racial preference
        schemes, and welfare and housing policy, but so-called middle class welfare
        programs as well", under which government "would return to limited government."
        (Speech at Wake Forest Univ. April 18,1988 at 25-6)
        Now - Clarence Thomas testified that government "has an obligation" and "as a
        community, as people who live in an organized society, we have an obligation as a
        people to make sure that other people are not left out." (Sept. 13 P.86)

INTRODUCTION
         In recent years, Supreme Court decisions narrowly interpreting congressional

legislation and legislative authority have posed increasing problems for Congress and the
nation. A series of Court decisions according a cramped construction to federal civil
rights laws has led to divisive and difficult battles over legislation to correct the Court
rulings.1 This year in Rust v. Sullivan.2 the Court deferred to a controversial agency
interpretation of a federal family planning law imposing an abortion "gag rule." The
decision produced outcries in Congress and both houses have approved legislation to
prevent its implementation, which President Bush has threatened to veto.3 Recently, the
Court upheld by only a narrow 5-4 vote the authority of Congress to pass remedial
legislation to counteract prior discrimination.4 As a result, the views of any Court
nominee concerning Congress and congressional authority are critical for the Senate to
examine.

         Article I of the U.S. Constitution established Congress as the legislative branch of
government vested with appropriate powers. Among its mandates is the authority to
make all laws necessary for the functioning of government.5 To carry out its
constitutional duty, Congress must be able to monitor the effectiveness of congressionally
created entities.

         The record reveals, however, that one of the central concerns about Clarence

thereof."
                                      794

Thomas is his attitude toward Congress and its authority. Throughout his professional
career, Thomas has avoided accountability to congressional committees; he has been
uncooperative and hostile when forced to confront Congress' necessary oversight
responsibilities; and he has disparaged Congress' authority and praised those who
disregard that authority. Before Thomas was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit, 14 members of the House of Representatives took the extraordinary
step of writing to President Bush urging him not to nominate Thomas precisely because
of his "overall disdain for the rule of law."6 All of the members who signed the letter
either chaired or were senior members of congressional committees with responsibility
for oversight of the EEOC.7

        A brief review of Thomas' quotes about Congress, all of which are examined in
further detail in this report, is revealing. According to Thomas:

        o Congress has "proven to be an enormous obstacle to the
                positive enforcement of civil rights laws."

        o "Congress is no longer primarily a deliberative or even a law-
                making body."

        o As EEOC chair, he was "defiant in the face of some petty
                despots in Congress."

        o The General Accounting Office is the "lapdog of Congress."

        o "As Ollie North made perfecly clear last summer, it is
                Congress that is out of control."

        o "Under the guise of exercising oversight functions," a

    6 Letter from 14 members of the House of Representatives to President Bush, July
17, 1989.

    7 The signatories of the letter were: Don Edwards, Edward Roybal, Cardiss Collins,
Charles Hayes, Barney Frank, Tom Lantos, Pat Williams, William Clay, Gerry Sikorski,
Augustus Hawkins, Matthew Martinez, Dale Kildee, Patricia Schroeder and John
Conyers.

                  congressional staffer "seeks to implement the program of the
                  American Association of Retired Persons."
         o "Democratic Subcommittee and Committee Chairmen
                  mircromanage agencies and departments."
         o An oversight request for semi-annual reports on the EEOC's
                  work was an "intrusion into the deliberations of an
                  administrative agency."
         o "Ollie North did a most effective job of exposing
                  congressional irresponsibility" and "revealed the extent to
                  which their public persona is a fake."
         o A Supreme Court decision by Chief Justice Rehnquist
                  upholding Congress' authority to appoint special prosecutors
                  "failed not only conservatives but all Americans."
         o "There is little deliberation and even less wisdom in the
                  manner in which the legislative branch conducts its business."

         Thomas' consistent contempt for Congress, its processes, its mandates and its
constitutional role indicates an impatience with democratic ideals ill-suited to a nominee
for the U.S. Supreme Court. His past actions and statements indicate that if Thomas is
confirmed for the Supreme Court, he is likely to heighten the conflict between the Court
and Congress and contribute to undermining legislative authority.

A CASE STUDY: CLARENCE THOMAS AND CONGRESSIONAL

OVERSIGHT OF "LAPSED CASES" BY EEOC

         An egregious example of Clarence Thomas' resistance to legislative oversight
came during a congressional inquiry into EEOC enforcement of the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act (ADEA). Thomas' hostile and uncooperative behavior during a

                                                         3
                                         796

legitimate congressional inquiry raises serious questions about his fitness for a seat on
the nation's highest court.

         The EEOC is responsible for implementation of the ADEA and ensuring that
seniors are not discriminated against in matters of employment. After a person who
thinks he or she has been the victim of age discrimination files a claim with EEOC,
there is a two-year statute of limitations within which EEOC must act or the claim will
lapse. In 1988, in response to concerns raised by seniors and other, the Senate Special
Committee on Aging investigated EEOCs enforcement of the ADEA.

        According to a finding by the Committee on Aging, The EEOC misled the
Congress and the public on the extent to which ADEA charges had been permitted to
exceed the statute of limitations.1* The Committee report provides a revealing
comparison of what then-Chairman Thomas knew and what he stated to the Committee
at a public hearing.

        Acting on reports that large numbers of cases were exceeding the statute of
limitations, the Committee on Aging requested figures on the number of lapsed cases
from EEOC on September 3, 1987. EEOC conducted a telephone survey of regional
offices and learned that before the end of the month over 1,500 cases would exceed the
statute of limitations. At the hearing, Thomas elected to reduce that figure by 95
percent and reported that only 70 cases had lapsed.9

        In response to a request for further data by the Senate Committee Thomas

Sess., 1988, p. 36.

    9 Jd. at 37.
                                      797

balked, saying "we do not routinely keep statistics in forms that are of no use to us."10
He was completely oblivious to the need for others, specifically Congress, to be able to
monitor EEOCs progress and effectiveness, and said nothing to Congress about the data
already in EEOCs possession responsive to the Committee's requests.

         Over the next three months the Committee continued its efforts to obtain
information on lapsed cases from EEOC. Thomas refused, leading the Chair of the
Committee to write an unusually harsh letter to EEOC: "Your unnecessary delay in
supplying us with information is an unwarranted withholding of information from the
Senate."11 On December 23, 1987 EEOC reported a total of only 78 lapsed cases.

         Only after news reports put the number at nearly 900, did Thomas acknowledge
that approximately 900 cases had exceeded the statute of limitations. In the face of
continuing reports of more lapsed cases, the Committee issued a subpoena demanding
more exact information by March 11, 1988. EEOC responded to the subpoena by
claiming that 779 ADEA charges had exceeded the statute of hmitations between 1984
and 1987 with 350 of them lapsing in 1987. Two weeks later Thomas received an
internal report that the actual figure was 1,200 for 1987 alone. But the ballooning
number of lapsed charges did not end there.

        To ensure that claimants would not necessarily lose their rights due to EEOCs
neglect, Congress passed the Age Discrimination Claims Assistance Act of 1988,
extending the statute of hmitations for some lapsed cases. In November 1988, over one

                                     798

year after the Committee's original request, EEOC submitted a report mandated under
the new law, which stated that as many as 8,800 cases may have exceeded the statute of
limitations between 1984 and 1987 - more than ten times the number that EEOC had
reported under subpoena.12 Eventually EEOC admitted mailing notices of expiration to
more than 13,000 seniors whose claims had been allowed to lapse.13

        Senator David Pryor, the current Chair of the Committee on Aging, summed up
the results of Thomas' disregard of congressional authority.

                I was dismayed to learn about several erroneous statements
                made by Chairman Thomas...These statements are certainly
                misleading, and raise serious questions about the nominee's
                appropriateness for the Federal bench.

                [Tjhere should be little dispute that thousands of ADEA
                claimants have unfairly and unacceptably lost their rights
                during Chairman Thomas' 8-year tenure. We all agree that
                the massive lapses of ADEA charges prior to 1988 should
                have never happened. Likewise, we must recognize the
                tragedy and irony that even as Congress was acting to restore
                the rights of those who lose [sic] claims during that period,
                hundreds more cases were lapsing.14

       Thomas nonetheless harshly criticized Congress' oversight efforts, particularly the
Committee on Aging. "My agency will be virtually shut down by a willful Committee
staffer who has succeeded in getting a Senate Committee to subpoena volumes of EEOC
records...Thus, a single unelected individual can disrupt civil rights enforcement - and all

                                     799

in the name of protecting rights."15 In a later speech, he further derided the motives
and integrity of the staff member. "Under the guise of exercising oversight functions, the
staffer seeks to implement the program of the American Association of Retired Persons,
AARP."16 Thomas seems unconcerned that had it not been for the Senate Committee's
diligent actions in determining the number of lapsed ADEA charges, no remedial
legislation would have been enacted and thousands of claimants would have lost their
rights forever due to his agency's neglect. It therefore seems odd that he would conclude
that Congress has "proven to be an enormous obstacle to the positive enforcement of
civil rights laws that protect individual freedom."17

        Thomas' open hostility to Congress' legitimate role shows a disturbing disregard
for the system of constitutional checks and balances and for Congress' oversight
authority.

THOMAS' SPEECHES AND PUBLIC STATEMENTS ON CONGRESS
AND CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY

         Further instances of Thomas' disparaging references to Congress checker his
writings and speeches. For example, in a speech on the role of Congress in the

     15 Speech to The Federalist Society at the University of Virginia, March 5, 1988, p.
13. Similar statements were also made in other forums. See also speech to The
Tocqueville Forum at Wake Forest University, April 18, 1988, p. 22.

formation of public policy, he said that "it may surprise some but Congress is no longer
primarily a deliberative or even a law-making body...[T]here is little deliberation and
even less wisdom in the manner in which the legislative branch conducts its business."18

         The theme of this speech was that Congress has generally abdicated its
responsibility to formulate readily understandable legislation, and that it instead enacts
overly broad laws, the interpretation of which is left to the bureaucracy. Despite the
view that Congress takes a hands-off approach Thomas nonetheless charges that
"Democratic Subcommittee and Committee Chairmen micromanage agencies and
departments."19 Worse still, according to Thomas, is that such a process puts
tremendous power in the hands of Subcommittee chairs, who "direct and administer
bureaucracies in a manner compatible with their own interests."20 This point of view is
apparently responsible for his characterization of members of Congress as "petty
despots."21

         Clearly in Thomas' eyes Congress cannot win. If it passes a statute that is
insufficiently detailed, it is because members "prefer to remain in the shadows on
controversial issues."22 But if Congress acts to check the improper implementation of a
statute by an executive agency, it is engaging in "selective intervention" and creating a

"feeble executive which means a weakened presidency."23 This despite the allegedly
overbroad grant of power to the executive branch.

        The example of "selective intervention" Thomas used to demonstrate his thesis
concerned an attempt at oversight by three members of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee, Senators Edward Kennedy, Howard Metzenbaum and Paul
Simon. They asked Thomas at the time of his 1986 renomination as head of the EEOC
to keep them apprised of the EEOCs work by submitting semi-annual reports "to be
sure this committee is informed about EEOC progress in enforcing the law as Congress
and the Supreme Court intend."24 Thomas was harshly critical of this "intrusion into
the deliberations of an administrative agency."25

       Thomas even resents congressional "intrusion" into serious allegations of improper
behavior at his agency. In 1989, a House Subcommittee looked into charges that an
EEOC district director had been demoted for testifying before Congress under subpoena
in such a way as to cast EEOC in a negative light. When asked about these harassment
charges Thomas responded:

               The one thing that I do want is for at least at some point the
               legislative branch to leave the agency alone so it can get its
               house in order and hopefully at some point miraculously give
               it the resources so it can get its house in order.
               You want to talk about harassment, I can tell you about two
               years of harassment, and I can tell you about two years of not

                     giving the agency the resources to do the incredible job that
                     is being required.26

           Besides trivializing the charges of retaliation against a whistleblower, Thomas'
statement shows two things. First he views a congressional investigation as "harassment,"
and second he believes Congress should simply provide funds with no oversight into how
the money is spent.

          This was not merely an example of Thomas losing his temper under sharp
questioning. He was repeating a sentiment that he had expressed earlier in his own
speeches.

                    Through subcommittees and professional staff, the typical
                    member of Congress is a kind of unseen co-administrator of
                    a part of the executive branch bureaucracy. They are able to
                    exercise this authority on a regular basis by subjecting
                    administrators to the will, not of Congress, but that of the
                    members who have jurisdiction over the agency.
                    They are able to do so through control of agency budgets,
                    personnel, and reporting requirements, as well as through the
                    power of investigation.

          Rather than viewing congressional control of the purse, the power to confirm
appointments, and authority to investigate abuses as constitutional mandates, Thomas

disparages such oversight as an inappropriate intrusion into executive autonomy.28
         Thomas' complaints include the confirmation process for Supreme Court Justices.

"It was a disgrace on the whole nomination process that Judge Bork is not now Mr.
Justice Bork."29 The Senate's rejection of Robert Bork was undoubtedly a
disappointment to right-wing extremists, but it was certainly not a disgrace to the
process.30 Judge Bork testified for five days before the Judiciary Committee on a whole
range of constitutional questions. In the end, the nation rejected a man who defended
the constitutionality of the poll tax and who would not uphold the use of contraceptives
by a married couple as a constitutionally protected right of privacy.31

         Further evidence of Thomas' contempt for the legislative process and the rule of
law can be found in his praise for Oliver North. In one speech, as support for the
proposition that Congress is too involved in executive matters, Thomas stated, "I thought
that Ollie North did a most effective job of exposing congressional irresponsibility. He

     28 A s recently as this year, Judge Thomas indicated that Congress' investigating
body, the General Accounting Office, is not credible since it is the "lapdog of Congress."

     29 Speech before the Cato Institute, October 2, 1987, p. 2. See also Harvard

     30 Thomas' very use of the phrase "nominating process" seems to exclude any role
for the Senate. The President nominates but then the Senate must exercise its
constitutional responsibility to confirm or reject the nominee. The nominating process
for Judge Bork was done in the White House; the confirmation process was carried out
in view of the entire country.

     31 In other speeches Thomas attacked Senator Joseph Biden, w h o m he depicted as
"crowing" over the defeat of Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court. Pacific Research
Institute speech at 12. See also Harvard University speech at 12.

forced their hand, and revealed the extent to which their public persona is a fake."32 In
another speech, Thomas said that the congressional committee "beat an ignominious
retreat before Colonel North's direct attack on it, and by extension all of Congress."33
In other speeches, while decrying Congress' role in overseeing the federal bureaucracy,
he noted that "as Ollie North made perfectly clear las\ summer, it is Congress that is out
of control!"34 This praise for North's open disregard of the intentions of Congress and
its constitutional role as the law-making body is wholly inappropriate from one being
considered for an appointment to the Supreme Court.

        One indication of how Thomas would limit congressional power on the Supreme
Court came in his comments on the case of Morrison v. Olson.35 That case tested the
authority of Congress to appoint a special prosecutor - an issue of considerable
importance to Oliver North. Although the Court ruled 7-1 in favor of Congress'
authority, Thomas could only praise Justice Scalia's "remarkable" dissent. Calling the
decision "the most important Court case since Brown v. Board of Education." Thomas
placed himself to the ideological right of even Chief Justice Rehnquist in attempting to
limit Congress' power. He stated that, "Unfortunately, conservative heroes such as the
Chief Justice failed not only conservatives but all Americans" in Morrison.36 Such

attitudes by the Supreme Court nominee are of grave concern.

TOE VERDICT OF CONGRESS AND THE COURTS ON THOMAS
         As members of Congress and the federal bench have reviewed Thomas and his

performance at the EEOC, they have forcefully voiced their own concerns about
Thomas' respect for Congress and the rule of law. In July 1989,14 Representatives,
many of them Committee and Subcommittee chairs with responsibility for overseeing
EEOC, wrote an extraordinary letter to President Bush. They urged the President not to
nominate Thomas to the U.S. Court of Appeals. "Mr. Thomas' actions as chair of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission raise serious questions about his judgment,
respect for the law and general suitability to serve as a member of the Federal
judiciary."37 Eight years of dealing with Thomas had shown the members that "Mr.
Thomas has resisted congressional oversight and been less than candid with legislators
about agency enforcment policies."38 The letter concluded that "Mr. Thomas has
demonstrated an overall disdain for the rule of law."39

         The courts have also noticed Thomas' attitude toward Congress and the rule of
law. When Thomas took over EEOC in 1982 he inherited an administrative
interpretation of a regulation concerning pension contributions for workers over age 65.
He acknowledged that the interpretation was incorrect and should be changed. After

years of delay including repeated assurances to members of Congress that a change was
imminent, a lawsuit was filed to force a change. The court held that the delay was
inexcusable and ordered an immediate revision. "Although it is among the Commission's
duties under law to eradicate age discrimination in the workplace and to protect older
workers against discrimination, that agency has at best been slothful, at worst deceptive
to the public, in the discharge of these responsibilities."40 The court agreed that
Thomas and his staff had misled Congress. "(T]he Commission has been no more candid
with this Court than with the Senate committees and the public."41

CONCLUSION
        The need for Supreme Court Justices to respect theintent and authority of

Congress iswell established. Much of the Court's work involves interpretation of
statutory language and congressional intent. In recent years, conservative Justices have
undermined many statutes, most notably in theareas of civil rights and family planning
legislation. These Court decisions have damaged privacy interests and civil rights
protections, forcing Congress to take repetitive steps to overrule theCourt that should
not be necessary.

         Instead of effectuating Congress' intent in passing statutes, Thomas has viewed
any section that is open to interpretation as void and seizes the opportunity to make new
law. The disdain that Thomas has displayed for Congress and its intentions strongly
suggests that, if confirmed, he would further the current Court's disturbing trend of
misreading legislation and limiting congressional authority.

                              JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS:
              4AN OVERALL DISDAIN FOR THE RULE OF LAW1

         The nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court comes at a historic
juncture when die rights and liberties of die American people are under siege. After weeks of
research into Mr. Thomas* public record, the Board of Directors of die People For die
American Way Action Fund has concluded that Judge Thomas is an unacceptable choice for
die Supreme Court and urges die United States Senate to reject his nomination.

INTRODUCTION

         The Supreme Court is die last bulwark of protection of die rights of every American
citizen. Recently, die Supreme Court has charted a dramatic course that has changed die law
in just a few years. Rights and protections diat millions of Americans depend on are now
direatened. Reproductive freedom has been restricted, and die basic right to choice on
abortion is imperiled as new state laws make dieir way to die Supreme Court Civilrights
protections for women and minority workers have been undermined. The bright line
separating church and state is gradually being weakened.

         For all die tetfjacks to individual rights we have already witnessed, the potential future
dneats are even more severe. The Court has already accepted cases involving school
desegregation and church-state questions for die next term. Looming just over die horizon
are cases involving die restrictive aboruon laws passed in die wake of die Court's decision in
Webster v. Reproductive Health Services. As we enter a new century, die Court will grapple
with complex new legal issues spawned by significant changes in technology,
communications, medicine and a host of odier fields.

          Letter from 14 Members of Congress to President George Bush asking that the President not nominate
          Clarence Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for me District of Columbia, July 17.1989.
                                         810

         Even as the Court has reversed course, a thin line still exists among the Justices on
many of these issues. The conservative judicial activists, led by Chief Justice Rehnquist and
Justice Scalia, have been pushing for a wholesale rewriting of the law. Respect for prior
decisions -- the principle of stare decisis -- has always been central to our constitutional
system. But in its judicial activism the current Court seems determined to abandon mis
principle and replace it with an approach in which "power, not reason, is the new currency of
[the] Court's decisionmalring."*

         In his final dissent, Justice Thurgood Marshall inveighed against his fellow justices'
reversal of precedent and their "far-reaching assault" on die BUI of Rights.3 To date, a
comparatively more moderate bloc on die Court has been able torestraindie activist impulse
in a number of critical cases.

         The next justice will play a pivotal role in determining the future direction of die
Court Not only will he or she participate in cases that will have a profound impact on die
quality of life for millions of Americans, die new justice will also help to define whether die
Court will pursue an even more activist agenda of reversing Supreme Court precedents diat
protect individual liberties and civil rights. It is in this context diat we consider die
nomination of Clarence Thomas to fill die seat being vacated by Justice Marshall.

         In weighing this historic nomination, die People For die American Way Action Fund
measured Judge Thomas' record against five essential standards diat must be met by any
nominee to our highest court The standards are: demonstrated outstanding legal ability and
competence as evidenced by substantial legal experience; proven respect for established legal
precedents and commitment to core constitutional values; respect for die constitutional system
of government and die separation of powers; a judicial philosophy diat falls in die
mainstream of legal thought; and an appreciation for die impact of die law and government
actions on individuals. We base our final judgment on this broad range of criteria.

        Justice Rehnquistreiteratedhis attack on stare decisis in a speech to die Fourth Circuit

                                    811

        After a thorough examination of Clarence Thomas' public record, we find that he fails
to meet these essential standards for elevation to the Supreme Ooun. The reasons for our
conclusion are:

   Mr. Thomas* legal and Judicial experience are far too limited for a Supreme
        Court nominee. Mr. Thomas served for nine years -- more than half his professional
        career -- as an official in the Reagan and Bush administrations, and his performance in
        these positions was marred by proven allegations of lax enforcement and disrespect for
        the law. Mr. Thomas has served only 17 months on the appellate court, not long
        enough to amass a significantrecord.

   Mr. Thomas has repeatedly attacked key Supreme Court precedents. Mr. Thomas
        has severely criticized a dozen landmark Supreme Court rulings, focusing especially
        on cases involving fundamental individual liberties, remedies for workplace
        discrimination, and school segregation cases.

   Mr. Thomas has time and again failed to enforce the law. In his positions as Chair
        of the EEOC and as Director of the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of
        Education, Mr. Thomas has often disregarded Congressional mynHt* or court orders.

  Mr. Thomas has shown hostility to legislative authority. Mr. Thomas was
        extremely uncooperative with Congress, and in one instance a committee was forced to
        subpoena agency records he had refused to produce. In speeches and articles, Mr.
        Thomas publicly endorsed the flouting of Congressional authority and investigations.

   Mr. Thomas espouses a Judicial philosophy based on natural law that is "outside
        the mainstream of constitutional interpretation."4 Since 1987, Mr. Thomas has
        written and spoken extensively about natural law or higher law as being a necessary
        pan of constitutional interpretation. The natural law theory mat Mr. Thomas has
        embraced has been widely discredited, and Mr. Thomas* suggested applications of the
        theory could result in dramatic reversals of Supreme Court piecedents.

        For these reasons, we have concluded mat Clarence Thomas' nomination to the
Supreme Court must be opposed. This was not an easy conclusion to reach. The People For

        Geoffrey Stone, dean of the University of Chicago Law School, quoted in Page, "Will
        Thomas Be Barked?: Views Are Fair Game." Washington Times. July 12, 1991.
                                         812

die American Way Action Fund has only once before opposed a nominee to the Supreme
Court. Moreover, Mr. Thomas is only the second African-American nominated to the high
Court He is a man with a compelling personal story of overcoming discrimination and
poverty. Nonetheless, after carefully analyzing his record and views, we are absolutely
convinced that Clarence Thomas' nomination to the highest court is not in the best interests
of the nation.

L LIMITED EXPERIENCE - NOT THE 'BEST MAN FOR THE JOB'

         The Supreme Court should be the place where our nation's most distinguished lawyers
and jurists decide the thorniest issues of the day. The members of the Court should have
great stature, achieved through long, celebrated careers in the law. Service on the Supreme
Court should be reserved for those who are truly die best and brightest that this nation has to
offer.

         President Bush said mat he nominated Clarence Thomas because Mr. Thomas was "the
best man for the job on the merits." This statement is transparently false. For all his
accomplishments, Clarence Thomas is obviously not the most qualified person, not even the
most qualified conservative, and far from the most qualified Republican African-American or
Hispanic, to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Former Solicitor General Erwin
Griswold recently said: "This is a time when [President] Bush should have come up with a
first-class lawyer, of wide reputation and broad experience, whether white, black, male or
female. And that, it seems to me obvious, he did not do." Griswold complained that Mr.
Thomas "has no breadth of experience at all.**

         Mr. Thomas served for nine years, mare than half of his professional life, as an
official in the Reagan and Bush administrations. As documented in detail later in this report,
Mr. Thomas' tenure in these positions was marred by proven allegations of lax enforcement
and disrespect for the law - notable largely for Mr. Thomas' conflicts with Congress and the
courts.

        For the past 17 months, Mr. Thomas has been a judge on the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia. Although he has participated in some 170 appeals, during this period

        Washington Post. July 15,1991.
                                        813

Mr. Thomas has written only 17 majority opinions, all but one of which was a unanimous
decision. Mr. Thomas has written separate concurring or dissenting opinions in only three

         Most of the cases in which Mr. Thomas played a pan were unanimous and relatively
uncontroversial cases. Two of the occasions on which Mr. Thomas chose to write separately
from the majority do, however, raise concerns because both opinions specifically address
critical issues involving the scope of judicial review. In both instances, Mr. Thomas argued
for limiting access to die courts, once on die basis of standing, and once on the grounds of
mootness.

         In Cross Sound Ferry Services v. IOC' Mr. Thomas myinf^n^ that die Court should
have dismissed plaintiffs complaint on die grounds of standing. The court found that die
Interstate Commerce Commission had properly decided mat certain ferry services were
exempt from ICC regulation. Mr. Thomas agreed wim this portion of die decision. The
majority further concluded mat this ICC decision did not trigger environmental review
responsibilities under National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and die Coastal Zone
Management Act (CZMA). Mr. Thomas dissented from die ruling on die applicability of die
environmental statutes, arguing mat die plaintiff did not have standing to raise die
environmental claims. While die majority found diat die environmental claims did not have
merit, Mr. Thomas would not even have addressed die merits of die petitioner's complaint

         Similarly, Mr. Thomas dissented in Pgf v, {MliYIOT-*arguing diat die case should
have been dismissed on die grounds of mootness. Doe, which was decided on July 16,1991,
involved a regulation diat permitted die use of unapproved drugs to protect troops from
chemical weapons during die Gulf War. A serviceman challenged die regulation. The
government argued diat die coon should have found die plaintiffs claim moot because die
regulation had been terminated. The majority ruled diat die claim was not moot, holding diat
die controversy was "capable of repetition, yet evading review" because die underlying
regulation diat p*"T"f^ die waiver of die ordinary drug approval process was still in effect.
The majority dien dismissed plaintiffs claims on die merits. Mr. Thomas took exception.
He wrote: "The war has ended and die troops are home, but to die majority die case Kves

on."1 Rather than considering plaintiff's complaint, Mr. Thomas would have simply closed
die courthouse door.

         Overall, Mr. Thomas' record as a judge is extremely limited. However, the rest of
Mr. Thomas* record, as revealed in speeches and articles about key legal precedents and
policy questions, and as shown in Mr. Thomas* performance as an official in the Reagan and
Bush administrations, is extremely troubling.

IL CRITICISM OF KEY SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTS

         Mr. Thomas has attacked the results and legal underpinnings of a dozen landmark
Supreme Court decisions of the past four decades. Mr. Thomas* criticisms focus on Supreme
Court rulings involving fundamental rights with respect to privacy, workplace discrimination
and school segregation, as well as congressional authority under the Constitution. These
criticisms are not simply abstract or theoretical; he has severely attacked a number of Court
decisions, even going so far in one case as to urge lower courts to follow the dissent and not
die majority opinion.

         A. The Right to Privacy

        The Supreme Court first enunciated the constitutional right to privacy in Griswoid v.
Connecticut a 1965 decision striking down a Connecticut law banning the sale of
contraceptives.* Griswold. in turn, became thefoundationfor the Court's decision in Roe v.
Wade, where die Court held mat the right to privacy included a woman's right to choose an
abortion.10

         Mr. Thomas has criticized Griswold. however, particularly a concurring opinion signed
by Chief Justice Warren and Justices Goldberg and Brennan, which relied on me Ninth
Amendment as the foundation for the right to privacy. Just three years ago, Mr. Thomas
enrnpipiiK^ of die Court's improper "invention" of die Ninth Amendment in Griswold. and

wrote that die Nindi Amendment "wOl likdy become an additional weapon for die enemies of
freedom."11

         Mr. Thomas has also suggested diat he finds fault with Roe v. Wade. In a 1987
speech, Mr. Thomas lavishly praised an article arguing not only diat Roe should be
overturned, but diat fetuses should be granted constitutional protection.12 The article, which
Mr. Thomas called a "splendid example of applying natural law," was an unbridled attack on
Roe written by anti-abortion activist Lewis Lehman." Lehrman asserted diat die right to
choose abortion recognized in Roe is "a spurious right" wim "not a single trace of lawful
authority" diat has produced a "holocaust". The Lehrman article diat Mr. Thomas so heartily
endorsed takes die most extreme position on choice, insisting diat abortion is prohibited by
die Constitution and diat nddwr Congress nor die states may protect die right to choose an
abortion.14

        In addition to his personal criticism of key Court precedent concerning die right to
privacy, Mr. Thomas was a member in 1986 of a White House Working Group on die Family
diat produced a report shaiply critical of Court decisions in diis area. The repon disparages
Roe v. Wade and Planned Parendiood v. Danforth." which ruled unconstitutional a state law

"fatally flawed" decisions could be "corrected" either by Constitutional amendment or through
"the appointment of new judges and their confirmation by the Senate.1"*

         B. Workplace Discrimination

         Mr. Thomas has also taken aim at a broad range of employment discrimination
decisions -- rulings mat helped break down barriers to the hiring and advancement of women
and minorities in the workplace.

         For example. Judge Thomas criticized the Court's ruling in United Steel Workers v.
Weber, upholding voluntary affirmative action programs by private employers1* and its
decision in Johnson v. Transportation Agency. Santa Clara County, permitting a state
employer's voluntary affirmative action programs for job categories traditionally segregated
against women." Mr. Thomas called these decisions an "egregious example" of
misinterpretation of the equal protection clause and legislative intent in civil rights statutes.21
In fact, be has specifically suggested the overruling of Johnson, and went so far as to state
mat he hoped Justice Scalia's dissent in the case would "provide guidance for lower courts
and a possible majority in future decisions."**

         Mr. Thomas voiced similar concerns about the Court's holding in Fvffil?Vt Yi

lo correct past discrimination.0 **r Thnmit ciiyri ht h Otirt fa FuHflovy '"p"T*<y

       Mr. Thomas also objected to the Court's rulings in three employment discrimination
cases dealing with court-ordered remedies and consent decrees. In Local 28 Sheet Metal
Workers International v. EEOC die Court upheld court-ordered affirmative action as a
remedy for egregious and longstanding discrimination.11 In Firefighters v. Cleveland, the
Court approved consent decrees including affirmative action measures in job-bias cases.*
Finally, in United States v. Paradise, the Court upheld an affirmative action remedy for
egregious bias where an employer resisted previous anti-discrimination orders.27 Mr. Thomas
criticized all three cases by name, expressing "personal disagreement with the Court's
approval of numerical remedies."''

        C School Segregation

       Mr. Thomas hasalso attacked several landmark rulings in thearea of school
desegregation. Most notably, he criticized die reasoning in die Court's historic opinion in
Brown v. Board of Education, in which die Court confronted and struck down as
unconstitutional school segregation and die notion of "separate but equal" schools.29

       Mr. Thomas hasdisparaged Brown as being based on "dubious social science" and
containing a "great flaw."30 Mr.Thomas has said that die proper ground for outlawing
segregation in Brown would have been die privileges and immunities clause of die Fourteenth
Amendment, even diough Mr.Thomas himself admits that this clause has been made
meaningless as a source of authority for die Court since 1873." Mr.Thomas has also

specifically disagreed with the Court's premise in Brown that separate is inherently
unequal.12

         In the years following Brown, many school authorities sought to circumvent the
decision by contriving new methods for assigning students to schools - methods that were
designed to produce segregated schools. In Green v. County Board of Education, the
Supreme Court was faced with one such system. Hie Court held that die so-called "freedom
of choice" assignment system used by many school districts to avoid desegregation was
incompatible with Brown and held that all vestiges of state-imposed segregation must be
eliminated.**

         Mr. Thomas described the Court's decision in Green as reflecting a "lack of
principle."94 Mr. Thomas has complained that, according to Green, the decision in Brown
"not only ended segregation, but required school integration.'41

         In the key decision of Swann v. Charlotte-Mccklenberg Board of Education, the Court
held that courts may order student reassignment, transportation, and other remedies to fully
realize the promise of Brown." Although not mentioning Swann by name, Mr. Thomas has
denounced what he terms "a disastrous series of cases requiring busing and other policies mat
were irrelevant to parents' concern for a decent education" after Green."

        D. Congressional Authority under the Constitution

        Mr. Thomas has also criticized several key Court decisions upholding the authority of
Congress under the Constitution. As discussed above, he has disparaged the decision in
Fullilove. where the Court ruled that Congress has the power to enact legislation to remedy
the effects of past discrimination. In addition, he has attacked the Court's important holding

in Morrison v. Olson, where the Court ruled 7-1 that Congress could properly create
independent prosecutors such as those which investigated Watergate and Iran-Contra.* Hie
lone dissent was by Justice Scalia, who argued mat Congress had absolutely no authority to
appoint special prosecutors, no matter how serious a crime may have been committed by
Executive branch officials. According to Mr. Thomas, however. Justice Scalia's dissent was
"remarkable" and should have been followed, while Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority
opinion "failed not only conservatives but all Americans."1'

m . UNWILLINGNESS TO FOLLOW ESTABLISHED LAW

        A. Controversial Tenure as Chair of the EEOC

         Mr. Thomas* most significant legal experience is the eight years he served as Chair of
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency with prime responsibility for
enforcing federal laws forbidding employment discrimination. During this period, Mr.
Thomas repeatedly displayed a failure and unwillingness to enforce fully federal anti-
discrimination laws as mandated by Congress. He frequently denounced court-approved
methods of establishing discrimination and remedies for workplace discrimination. In many
instances, Mr. Thomas appeared not to believe in the very laws he was sworn to enforce,
especially the laws forbidding discrimination against older workers. Congress and the courts
had to intervene to require Mr. Thomas to enforce the law. Throughout his tenure as an
executive branch official, Mr. Thomas demonstrated aggressive hostility to congressional
oversight and direction.

         One particularly disturbing example of Mr. Thomas* behavior at the EEOC was his
attempt to reverse the Commission's long-standing policy of seeking goals and timetables in
conciliation efforts and court-approved settlements. Mr. Thomas attempted to justify his shift
by arguing that the Supreme Court's decision in Firefighters Local Union No. 1984 v.
Stotts*0 required mat the agency stop seeking goals and timetables.41 Mr. Thomas'

conclusion was extraordinary because the Court in Stotts was very careful to say that its
decision simply allowed employers to use a seniority system that had an adverse impact on
minority employees, npj. that the Constitution required it. To conclude, as Mr. Thomas did,
that the Court prohibited the long-accepted practice of employing goals and timetables was a
tortured reading of the decision, a reading mat seemed to be motivated by a personal hostility
to these types of remedies. In fact, Mr. Thomas* statement about Stotts directly contradicted
a representation he himself had made to Congress in August, 1984, where he wrote that Stotts
"does not require the EEOC to reconsider stated policies with respect to the availability of
numerical goals and similar forms of affirmative action relief."

         Mr. Thomas was widely criticized for his shift concerning Stotts. and in 1986, the
Supreme Court firmly rejected Mr. Thomas' revised reading of the case, reiterating mat goals
and timetables are constitutionally pennissible remedies for employment discrimination under
appropriate circumstances.4* However, even in the face of this long line of authority, Mr.
Thomas continued to voice his "personal disagreement" with the Supreme Court's approach,
and insisted that the use of goals and timetables "turns the law against employment
discrimination on its head."**

         Mr. Thomas' purposeful misreading of Stotts is emblematic of his defiant refusal to
enforce anti-discrimination laws and his willingness to allow his personal policy preferences
to take precedence over established law. A particularly egregious example of mis problem
can be found in the EEOC's failure to enforce the Age Discrimination in Employment Act
(ADEA).

         In 1987 and 1988, Congress discovered that the EEOC under Mr. Thomas had failed
to act on more man 13,000 cases charging violations of ADEA. This failure to act reflects a
callous disregard for the legal rights of older workers.

         Perhaps even more troubling man mis dereliction of duty was Mr. Thomas' response
once die problem was discovered. Mr. Thomas was extremely uncooperative wim Congress.
When he was first asked by die Senate Special Committee on Aging about die number of
ADEA cases whose time limits had lapsed, Mr. Thomas reported mat 78 cases had expired.

However, die EEOC's own informadon revealed at this point that well over 1,000 cases had
lapsed. After published news reports brought attention to die problem of lapsed cases, Mr.
Thomas reluctantly confirmed that die statute of limitations had run on over 900 cases. These
estimates were later revised to over 1,500, then to over 7,500, and finally to more than 13,000
lapsed claims.44

         Instead of cooperating wim Congress in investigating and resolving diis massive
problem, Mr. Thomas repeatedly complained about Congress* role in overseeing die EEOC,
and refused to cooperate wim die Senate oversight committee. Eventually, die Senate Aging
Committee had to resort to a subpoena to obtain die EEOC's records on lapsed cases. Even
when die Aging Committee's investigation turned up evidence of gross dereliction of duty by
die EEOC, Mr. Thomas still attacked Congress. He at one point complained diat a "willful
committee staffer -- succeeded in getting a Senate Committee to subpoena volumes of
EEOC records."45 Mr. Thomas added diat "it will take weeks of time, and costs in die
hundreds of diousandsof dollars, if not in die millions. Thus, a single unelected individual
can disrupt civil rights enforcement-and all in die name of protecting rights."4*

         Ultimately, Congress had to pass special legislation to restore die rights of diese older
workers whose claims die EEOC had allowed to lapse.47 This incident is representative of a
pattern in which Congress had to pass legislation to address problems created by Mr. Thomas*
rfminictrtifm o f die EEOC.4*

         Mr. Thomas' actions wim respect to employers' obligation to make pension
contributions for workers over age 65 is anodier example of bis failure to protect older
workers' interests. Mr. Thomas pledged to rescind an improper Department of Labor
interpretation stating diat employers were notrequiredto make pension contributions for
workers older dian age 65, but never carried dtrough on his promise. After four years of

agency inaction under Mr. Thomas, Congress passed an amendment to the ADEA requiring
pension contributions. Still, the agency did not rescind the incorrect regulation until ordered
to do so by a federal court, and failed to issue newregulationson pension accruals in a
timely fashion. As a consequence of EEOC inaction, older workers lost benefits valued at as
much as $450 million per year. As U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene wrote in finding
against the EEOC die agency "has at best been slothful, at worst deceptive to the public, in
the discharge of [its] responsibilities."4'

         Similarly, in 1987, over vocal objections from Congress and the senior community, die
EEOC issued a regulation permitting employers to ask older workers to waive their ADEA
rights even before any discrimination claim existed and without die supervision or approval of
the EEOC Congress responded by passing riders on the 1988,1989, and 1990 EEOC
appropriation to prevent die Commission from implementing the new rule on unsupervised
waivers. Even in die face of this Congressional action, Mr. Thomas continued to oppose
EEOC supervision.

        The extent and seriousness of die problems widi Mr. Thomas* performance at die
EEOC were brought to die fore when Mr. Thomas surfaced as a possible nominee to the
Court of Appeals. Fourteen Members of Congress who served on subcommittees widi
oversight responsibilities for die EEOC took die extraordinary step of writing to President
Bush, asking mat Mr. Thomas not be nominated to die federal bench. According to these
Members of Congress, Mr. Thomas* "questionable enforcementrecord"at die EEOC
"frustrates die intent and purpose" of die Civil Rights Act of 1964. In addition, die letter
took strong exception to Mr. Thomas* lack of candor in dealing widi die oversight
committees, and concluded diat Mr. Thomas "has demonstrated an overall disdain for die rule
of law."*

        Mr. Thomas* tenure at the EEOC has received die most attention to date. However,

Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in the Department of Education. During this short period, Mr.
Thomas manifested a similar pattern of flouting established law. Mr. Thomas admitted in
federal court that he had violated his legal obligations governing civil rights enforcement at
OCR. .In addition, Mr. Thomas' failure to enforce civil rights protections was so serious that
on three separate occasions, OCR actions were opposed even by the Reagan Justice
Department.

        During Mr. Thomas' tenure, OCR was governed by a court order issued in the Aft1"*
y, Bell litigation, which required that OCR meet specified time limits in processing
complaints and taking other enforcement action. This order was necessary because of a
"general and calculated default" over a period of years in enforcing civil rights laws in
education.51 In 1982, while Mr. Thomas was head of OCR, me Adams court held a hearing
concerning charges mat OCR was failing to comply with the court order.

        At the hearing, Thomas specifically admitted that be was violating the court order's
requirements for processing civil rights cases:

        Oj . . . But you're going ahead and violating those time frames; isn't mat true?
                 You're violating mem in compliance reviews on all occasions, practically, and
                 you're violating mem on c"mpiwft*f most of the time, or half the time; isn't
                 mat true?

        A: That's right
        Q: So aren't you, in effect, substituting your judgment as to what the policy

                 should be for what the court order requires? The court orderrequiresyou to
                 comply with this 90 day period; isn't that true?
        A: That's right--
        Q: And you have not imposed a deadline [for an OCR Mudy concerning lack of
                 cornpliarKT with the Adtttt onler]; is that correct?
        A: I have not imposed a deadline.

         Q: And meanwhile, you a n violating a court order rather grievously, aren't you?

         A: Yes."

Shortly after Mr. Thomas' testimony, the federal court in Adams in fact found that the court's
order "has been violated in many important respects." 

         One reason mat Mr. Thomas failed to comply with the Adams order is that OCR
placed "holds" on the processing of certain lands of civil rights complaints while it considered
or reconsidered its policies. As a memorandum to Mr. Thomas from his deputy pointed out,
the use of hold categories not only "impeded the timely processing of a number of OCR
cases" but also "stifled morale in OCR."**

         In 1982, even the Reagan Justice Department protested OCR's refusal to enforce civil
rights laws through the continuation of "bold" categories. OCR was suspending processing of
complaints of improper job discrimination against the handicapped by universities and other
recipients of federal education aid. Assistant Attorney General Bradford Reynolds wrote to
Mr. Thomas, specifically questioning "the propriety of refusing to process" such complaints in
most states, and pointedly requested mat Mr. Thomas promptly notify OCR offices to "begin
accepting, investigating and, where appropriate, remedying" those complaints.51 Even after
this complaint from the Department of Justice, which occurred less dun a month after the
court found gigmfirynt violations of the Ajams. order, Mr. Thomas took no action to remedy
mis violation of law.

         In addition, during Mr. Thomas' tenure, OCR finalised the implementation of a
procedure called ECR, or Early Complaint Resolution.** Under ECR, OCR would seek to
settle civil rights " T '  " t  in non-class action cases before an investigation had even begun.

         During Mr. Thomas' tenure, in November, 1981, die Justice Department specifically
alerted OCR of its "major concern" diat die use of ECR did not meet applicable standards and
"could lead to a weakening of your enforcement posture and our litigation position."97
According to a House Committee diat investigated die use of ECR, however, no significant
changes were made by Thomas or his successor in dus area, despite Justice's complaint and
its request diat die use of ECR be closely monitored. By 1985, die Committee reported, 312
cases had been settled dirough ECR, and OCR could not assure die committee diat "any or all
of die ECR setdements were in accordance widi statutory orregulatoryrequirements."51As
die House Committee concluded, however, die use of ECR "may be illegal, may not protect
die rights of complainants, and may jeopardize future litigation involving violations of civil
rights laws.""

         Mr. Thomas was also involved in a blatant attempt in 1981 by die Department of
Education to change its position and undermine enforcement of sex discrimination laws.
Since die mid-1970s, federal regulations provided diat it was illegal for universities or other
recipients of federal education funds to commit job bias on die basis of sex.*0 In 1981,
however, even as die Supreme Court was considering a case challenging die Department of
Education rules, Mr. Thomas announced diat die Department was about to reverse its position
and argue diat die anti-sex discrimination law "does not cover employment"*1

         In fact, two weeks after Thomas* announcement, Education Secretary Bell wrote to die
Justice Department to seek permission to repeal die anti-sex discrimination rules and
effectively to concede diat diey were invalid in die Supreme Court6 The Justice
Department refused, rejecting dus apparent attempt by Mr. Thomas and Secretary Bell to
seriously weaken anti-discrimination protections.0 The Supreme Court repudiated die

in fact prohibit employment discrimination.'*

IV. HOSTILITY TO LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY

        The need for Supreme Court justices to respect die will and intent of Congress is well
established. Much of die Court's work involves interpretation of statutory language and
congressional intent In Tecent years, conservative justices have undermined many statutes,
most notably in die areas of civil rights and family planning legislation. These Court
decisions have damaged privacy interests and civil rights protections, and have led to
congressional efforts to overrule me Court decisions.40

         Mr. Thomas' attitude towards die legislative function suggests that, if confirmed, he
would further die Court's disturbing trend in tftis area. Mr. Thomas' record at die Office of
Civil Rights and die EEOC, as described above, contains numerous examples of actions and
statements contrary to existing law. This disrespect for Congress is even clearer in his
writings and speeches.

        For example, Mr. Thomas has frequently condemned Congress, and commented mat
willful violations of its intentions are to be applauded.*6 In a speech on die role of Congress
in die formation of public policy, Mr. Thomas said that "it may surprise some but Congress is
no longer primarily a deliberative or even a law-making body... [T]here is little deliberation
and even less wisdom in me manner in which die legislative branch conducts its business.*47

                    See, for example. RR. 1 (1991) (the Cml Rights Act of 1991, attempting to overrate a series
                    of Supreme Coot derisions narrowing die scope of employment discrimination and civil rights
                    laws); S. 323, HJR. 392 (1991) (attempting to ovexrule Rust v. Sullivan, which upheld a rule
                    forbidding doctors at federally funded health clinics from providing patients with information
                    about abortion).

        In his 1988 speech, Mr. Thomas specifically attacked Congress' oversight activity.
Mr. Thomas focussed his criticism on three members of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee who simply requested that Mr. Thomas at the time of his 1986 re-
nomination as head of the EEOC keep them appraised of die EEOC's work by submitting
semi-annual reports. Mr. Thomas referred to mis oversight as an "intrusion" into die
administrative deliberative process."

         A further example of Mr. Thomas' contempt for the legislative process and the rule of
law can be found in his repeated praise for Oliver North. In one speech, Mr. Thomas said
that the congressional committee "beat an ignominious retreat before Colonel North's direct
attack on it, and by extension all of Congress."" In another speech, while decrying
Congress' role in overseeing the federal bureaucracy, he noted that "as Ollie North made
perfectly dear last summer, it is Congress that is out of control!wT0 This praise for North's
open flouting of Congress and the Constitution is wholly inappropriate from someone being
considered for the Supreme Court, whose respect for the Constitution, the separation of
powers, and the rule of law must be beyond reproach.

        Mr. Thomas' harsh disparagement of congressional authority is particularly troubling
in light of his belief that Congress does not even have the power to create a special
prosecutor to investigate executive branch misconduct and his own refusal at OCR and EEOC
to comply with the law. These aspects of Mr. Thomas' record strongly suggest that, if
confirmed, he would join justices like Rehnquist and Scalia in seeking to undermine
congressional statutes protecting individual rights and liberties and to limit improperly
congressional authority under the Constitution.

V. JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY: ADHERENCE TO A'DISCREDITED'71 THEORY
         OF NATURAL LAW

         Mr. Thomas* overall judicial philosophy is centered on a belief in "natural law" or
"higher law". According to Mr. Thomas, there are fixed objective truths in natural law that
somehow trump or override die Constitution or other written law.72 Mr. Thomas asserts that
the Supreme Court is justified in overturning the decisions of "run-amok majorities" and
"run-amok judges" as long as it adheres to natural law.?1 Legal scholars and judges have
recognized, however, mat mis emphasis on natural law is extraordinarily troubling, and the
theory has been rejected as a basis for constitutional analysis for over fifty years. Geoffrey
Stone, dean of the University of Chicago Law School has characterized Mr. Thomas' ideas as
"strange" and "further outside the mainstream of constitutional interpretation man Bark.*"4

        Legal scholars have explained mat mere are. no fixed "higher law" principles that can
override the Constitution. Indeed, as Professor John Hart Ely has noted: "natural law has
been summoned in support of all manner of causes in this country -- some worthy, some
nefarious - and often on bom sides of the same issue."75 Professor Gary McDowell recently
wrote: "To suggest mat the Constitution sprang from and rests upon the natural law teaching
of the Declaration of Independence is one thing; but to argue mat it is appropriate for judges
to claim recourse to mat body of law in deciding the cases mat come before them is quite a
different matter."7*

        Despite his belief in unwritten, natural law, Mr. Thomas has attacked one of die most
important Supreme Court decisions protecting rights not explicitly mentioned in die
Constitution, Griswold v. Connecticut" In Griswold. die Court ruled that die Constitution
protects die right of privacy- not because of higher, natural law superior to die Constitution,
but because die right of privacy is implicit in written Constitutional guarantees and traditions.
One pan of die basis for Griswold was die Ninth Amendment, which provides that rights
need not be explicitly enumerated in die Constitution to be protected. Notwidistanding his
belief in fixed principles of unwritten natural law not mentioned expressly in die Constitution,
however, Mr. Thomas has criticized Griswold because of its "invention" of the Ninm
Amendment, asserting diat die Ninth Amendment "will likely become an additional weapon
for die enemies of freedom."7" Mr. Thomas' views on die Ninth Amendment, particularly in
light of his views on natural law, are extremely troubling.

        In tact, Mr. Thomas* applications of natural law could result in dangerous and
dramatic reversals of Supreme Court precedents. Mr. Thomas has used natural law analysis
to severely criticize die Supreme Court's reasoning in Brown v. Board of Education* as
well as die right to privacy.10 He has praised as a "splendid example of applying natural
law" an article diat urged overturning Roe v. Wade and establishing a constitutional
imperative jgajosi abortion.*1 Mr. Thomas' belief diat natural lawrequiresdiat die
government be "color-blind" in all actions has led him so disagree with virtually every
Supreme Court decision diat approved of affirmative action, even in cases involving
intentional discrimination. In other instances, Mr. Thomas has suggested diat natural law
analysis protects economic liberty, and diat government regulation somehow violates natural

law.*2 Indeed, Mr. Thomas has severely criticized regulatory legislation such as minimum
wage laws."

           The natural law theme pervades Mr. Thomas' speeches and writings since die
beginning of 1987. Between January 1987 and April 1988, Mr. Thomas gave at least 11
speeches in which he discussed natural law. He has published at least eight articles that
argue for natural law analysis. The theme is constant, the endorsement is unequivocal. In
light of Thomas* criticism of fundamental Court precedents concerning privacy and civil
rights, as well as the important cases the Supreme Court will be deciding in these areas in the
future, Mr. Thomas* natural law views are cause for serious concern.

VL CONCLUSION

         When Clarence Thomas was nominated to the Court of Appeals 18 months ago, the
People For the American Way Action Fund expressed seriousreservationsbut stopped just
short of opposing his confirmation. Nominated to the Supreme Court, he must be held to a
higher standard. The power of a Supreme Court justice is infinitely greater. Lower court
judges are required to follow the guidance of the Supreme Court, and are subject to appellate
review. On the Supreme Court, particularly the Court under the leadership of Chief Justice
Rehnquist, the stricture of following precedent is largely removed, and there is no appeal.

         Based on a thorough examination of Mr. Thomas' record as a judge and government
official, and the opinions he has expressed in hundreds of articles and speeches, we believe
that, were he confirmed by the Senate, Clarence Thomas would pose a substantial threat to
the right to privacy and to efforts to combat discrimination. Mr. Thomas' record indicates a
willingness to overturn precedents involving fundamental individual liberties and civilrights.
His turbulent tenure at the EEOC and his oft-expressed distaste for the legislative branch
suggest mat he would join forces with those justices who willingly disregard legislative
directives in favor of their personal policy preferences.

        One of die key arguments die Bush Administration has highlighted in campaigning for
Clarence Thomas is that his experiences will make him a defender of victims of poverty and
discrimination. Mr. Thomas' personal history merits praise, but his public record contradicts
die Administration's assertion. We agree with Rep. John Lewis' response to that argument:
"Look at his record. He lias forgotten from whence he has come.'**

         On behalf of die Board of Directors and members of die People For die American
Way Action Fund, we call upon die United States Senate, in die exercise of its co-equal role
in die selection of Supreme Court justices, to reject die nomination of Clarence Thomas.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Congressman.
   Mr. Chambers.

                    STATEMENT OF JULIUS CHAMBERS

   Mr. CHAMBERS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for permit-
ting me to address the committee on behalf of the NAACP Legal
Defense and Educational Fund.

  I serve as director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, a
position previously held by retiring Justice Thurgood Marshall and
Jack Greenberg, who is now dean of Columbia University.

  The legal defense fund played a major role in litigating most of
the civil rights cases during the past 50 years. We have litigated
more than 500 cases in the U.S. Supreme Court, including many of
those that this committee discussed during these proceedings

  The CHAIRMAN. 500, you say?
  Mr. CHAMBERS. Yes. In addition to Brown v. Board of Education,
the legal defense fund represented the Griggs plaintiff. I personally
argued over eight cases in the U.S. Supreme Court, including Albe-
marie Paper Company v. Moody, Swann v.Charlotte-Mecklenburg,
Thornburgh v. Gingles, and the recent Houston Lawyers Associa-
tion case that was decided last term.

  With great regret, as I think exists among several others who
oppose this nominee, I urge you to reject this nomination and to
advise the President that Judge Thomas, based on the evidence
produced at these hearings, does not meet the standards for eleva-
tion to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  In summary, my reasons are: first, that the nominee, with no ar-
ticulated or supportable constitutional or judicial standards would
reject much of what this country has done to ensure that African-
Americans and other disadvantaged people will have an equal
chance in life. This position, as I will develop, is based on the writ-
ings and speeches of the nominee as well as my own personal expe-
rience.

  Second, even if we accept the nominee's recantations or explana-
tions offered during these hearings, the committee and the Senate
are left with a candidate who cannot possibly demonstrate qualifi-
cations or judicial attributes to serve on our highest Court.

  For more than 50 years, the legal defense fund has appealed to
the judicial system to ensure improved opportunities for minorities
and disadvantaged Americans. We have had marked success and
have convinced minorities that, despite its flaws, the Court offers a
reasonably fair and peaceful means for seeking equality. We have
raised hopes among African-Americans and others that whatever
their grievances, they can be fairly or sympathetically heard and
addressed in our judicial system. But these accomplishments and
the progress we have made would be seriously threatened by Judge
Thomas' elevation to the Supreme Court. He threatens and would
challenge the precedents established in the Court and in Congress
in practically every area of concern to us.

  For example, in voting rights, he questions the effects test, estab-
lished by Congress in 1972 and approved by the Court in Thorn-
burgh v. Gingles. He questions the affirmative obligations imposed
by the Court in Green v. New Kent County and Swann v. Charlotte-
                                      833

Mecklenburg, which I argued, for school districts to disestablish the
vestiges of past discrimination.

  He has soundly criticized litigation such as class action lawsuits
designed to bring about remedies to address systemic discrimina-
tion. He has problems with group or affirmative obligations estab-
lished to ensure equal opportunities for minorities in the work-
place.

  Since Brown, the Court and Congress have tried to develop fair
and effective means to make real Brown's promise of equality. The
civil rights remedies that exist today are the product of experience
drawn from a wide array of efforts, some successful and some
which have not been.

  For example, we have tried voluntary efforts like freedom of
choice, broad prohibitions as in the voting rights area, and threat-
ened damages as are available under the 1866 Civil Rights Act.

  Whatever steps were finally taken have come only after careful
analysis of the facts, the law, and proven experience. Judge
Thomas would discard all of this.

  Second, if we accept the nominee's statements during this hear-
ing at face value, the Senate and the committee would be left with
the fact that we have nothing here to determine whether the nomi-
nee has the qualifications, the judicial temperament to serve on the
Supreme Court. We have prepared an exhibit, an appendix A to
our submitted testimony, and I would like to call your attention to
it because it lists the 48 Supreme Court Justices who were appoint-
ed during the 20th century.

  In every instance here, the nominees possessed at least two
major qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge Thomas
possesses not one of those. We think when you make your compari-
son with this list with the qualifications that Judge Thomas has
presented, you too would agree that this nominee simply does not
have the qualifications to be elevated to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Rauh.

                   STATEMENT OF JOSEPH L. RAUH, JR.
  Mr. RAUH. I testify this afternoon for organizations of people de-
voted body and soul to the Bill of Rights. But I also testify for
myself.
  I had the honor and privilege to serve as last law clerk to Justice
Benjamin Cardozo and first law clerk to Felix Frankfurter, the two
great successors to the legendary Oliver Wendell Holmes. When
Senator Kennedy read Clarence Thomas' trashing of Oliver Wen-
dell Holmes last week, I was made ill. I felt not only Holmes but
Cardozo and Frankfurter, his great successors, were being trashed
as well.
  The years I spent with the Court in the 1930's were years when
Presidents reached out for the best person. Republican conservative
President Calvin Coolidge appointed Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, a
great Justice and ultimately the Chief Justice. His successor, Re-
publican conservative President Hoover appointed Justice Cardozo
                                      834

even though that meant two Jews and three New Yorkers on the
Court and knowing how liberal he was.

  The importance of that minority cannot be understated. What
happened was that the Brandeis-Stone-Cardozo minority on the
anti-New Deal Court saved the New Deal and the system under
which we lived by two things. One, they educated the public and
two, they restrained the majority.

  There is no such minority now. You have no such persons who
are going to restrain the Court or are going to educate the public to
what is wrong with the present system. Now, that was a time when
the Presidents reached for the best.

  President Bush has suggested, and I quote, that he has appointed
"the best person for the job." Why, he didn't even look for the best
person. They took the sitting judges and decided which one is best
for what we believe in--no abortion, no affirmative action, school
prayer, defendants' rights. This was a question of starting with sit-
ting judges and looking for those who would carry out their posi-
tion. There is no distinction in this man. How he can be called the
best person for the job when there is no distinction in anything he
has written that has been shown to us.

  He has the lowest rating--not only the performance in the ap-
pendix just offered the committee, but he has the lowest rating
from the American Bar Association of any nominee. There have
only been two that had unqualified votes. But Thomas, he not only
had unqualified votes, he didn't have a single well-qualified vote.
How could the President of the United States tell the people that
this is the best person for the job when he can't get 1 of 15 conserv-
ative lawyers to say he is well qualified?

  Even Carswell had a better record. Thomas has a worse record
than even Carswell. I can't see how the Senate can confirm some-
body who has a worse record, a worse evaluation than Carswell.

  And the hearing. The hearing is quite remarkable. The testimo-
ny is inconsistent, incredible, and inoperative. It was inconsistent.
You all heard the number of inconsistencies, but probably the basic
one is the inconsistency of testifying about dozens of cases that are
going to come before the Court and refusing to say where Roe v.
Wade stood. It is incredible. The idea that he has never discussed
with anyone Roe v. Wade--well, the word is incredible. I think
there are better odds on the existence of the tooth fairy than the
truth of that statement that he never considered or discussed Roe
v. Wade.

  Finally, it is inoperative. What he said is everything he has said
in life up to the time he went on the court is inoperative because
he was doing policy for the administration. Well, I think whichever
way you look at that, it is very, very damning.

  Well, in the 5 minutes--they are almost up--I only have this
final appeal to the committee. Don't approve this man. He will do
what he said he was going to do. He believes in the things--the
conversion at the hearing here is no answer for you. The last two
have done exactly what they said they were going to do on the
Court, and what we argued they shouldn't be on the Court for, be-
cause they would do just what they said. And this man will, too.

  Finally, you are the keeper now of the Bill of Rights. There is a
majority of the Court which is very prone to having an erosion of
                                             835

the Bill of Rights. Don't add one more. Don't take the historic voice
out of this country. The Supreme Court has been the greatest pro-
tector of the Bill of Rights in America. Don't take the last shot
here to complete the transition from the voice of liberty to now the
silence on the Bill of Rights.

  Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Rauh.
  Ms. Hernandez, welcome back.

                  STATEMENT OF ANTONIA HERNANDEZ

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Thank you, and thank you for giving me the
privilege to testify before you today. Not only do I represent the
Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund, but today I also represent
the Alliance for Justice, a coalition that represents legal, not-for-
profit organizations concerned with the administration of justice.
The alliance monitors judicial nominees and issues pertaining to
the Court.

  Because of the Nation's history of discrimination against Hispan-
ics and because of the U.S. Supreme Court's unique role for more
than 30 years in vindicating the civil and constitutional rights of
Hispanics, we Hispanics have placed a particular reliance on the
Supreme Court in assuring our civil and constitutional rights.
Whether the Supreme Court's decision in 1989, hostile to the civil
and constitutional rights of Hispanics, actually signals a Supreme
Court retrenchment or turning back the clock, I have little doubt
that the next person confirmed as an Associate Justice on the Su-
preme Court will, in fact, have a major impact on the future course
of Supreme Court adjudications.

  The reason for this determinative impact is obvious. The next
nominee confirmed by the Senate will be replacing Justice Thur-
good Marshall, whose fairness and compassion for civil and consti-
tutional rights were crucial to the rights of Hispanics.

  We have in our written document outlined the various reasons
for our opposition. What I will do with my time is concentrate on
two. The first matter deals with Judge Thomas' view of the equal
protection clause and its impact on our community, which is an
issue that I don't believe has been quite explored or discussed here
today.

  In reviewing Clarence Thomas' legal views on equal protection in
the context of school desegregation and segregation, it reveals his
preference to abandon the 14th amendment equal protection clause
and substitute instead his views of the 14th amendment's privilege
or immunities clause as paramount. Regardless of what freedoms
Judge Thomas might find to be encompassed within the privilege
and immunities clause, the fact of the matter is that his preferred
privilege or immunity clause only protects citizens, whereas the
equal protection clause protects any person.

  As you know, within the Hispanic community, a large portion of
our community are legal resident aliens, and a substantial percent-
age of our community are undocumented aliens. Some of the rights
given by the Court--and let me go further. Since the privilege or
immunities clause cannot and does not protect noncitizens, Judge
Thomas may very likely reject the Supreme Court's historical ap-
                                      836

plication of the equal protection doctrine to protect noncitizens in
cases running from Yick Ho v. Hopkins back in 1886, a San Fran-
cisco ordinance invalidating a San Francisco ordinance that out-
lawed Chinese laundries and declared that it violated the equal
protection clause, and also overrule Doe v. Plyler, which is a case
involving a Texas law that denied education to undocumented chil-
dren.

  In fact, had Judge Thomas rather than Judge Marshall been on
the Supreme Court at the time of Plyler, and had Judge Thomas
rejected the equal protection analysis in favor of his privileges or
immunities approach, MALDEF*s 5-4 victory would have been a 5-
4 loss.

  Now, I would like to deal with the testimony of Judge Thomas
and his 5 days and statements that he made. Apparently recogniz-
ing that many of the philosophical positions that he has taken in
his speeches and his writings were out of the mainstream, Clarence
Thomas appeared to pursue at least four strategies in his 5 days of
testimony before this committee.

  First, he occasionally reiterated and tried to defend several of his
previously stated philosophical views, particularly his opposition to
virtually all forms of affirmative action as unlawful and unconsti-
tutional. Second, he tried to modify and, in fact, to moderate some
of his most extreme views.

  Third, he refused to answer questions in a few areas altogether,
particularly with regard to whether he would overrule the constitu-
tional right to reproductive freedom. And finally and most sweep-
ingly, he argued that his past philosophical positions should be
deemed irrelevant to the confirmation process because they were
arrived at and presented when he was a policymaker rather than
in his current role as an impartial judge. This position lacks sub-
stance and credibility.

  Finally, in conclusion, presenting MALDEF's position in opposi-
tion to the confirmation of Clarence Thomas is not a task that I
had looked forward to at all. I know Clarence Thomas; I consider
him a friend. And as other witnesses have brought to the attention
of this committee, there is no question that he has many positive
qualities.

  Additionally, on matters of importance to Hispanics, there simi-
larly is no question that during his tenure at EEOC, he was acces-
sible to me and I have gotten to know him then in trying to deal
with him on the many matters that EEOC dealt with. He was sen-
sitive to our concerns and we did discuss that.

  He also was sensitive in supporting Spanish language forms and
brochures, and commendable here was his testimony in response to
Senator DeConcini about his opposition to English only. Neverthe-
less, in determining our position here, we at MALDEF had to look
at the entire picture in the context of a Supreme Court nomination
and we, in particular, had to look closely indeed at Judge Thomas'
legal and philosophical views about the civil rights and constitu-
tional provisions and about Supreme Court decisions interpreting
them, all of such importance to protecting and advancing the
rights of Hispanics. The big picture we found was not all very posi-
tive.
                                      837
  Based on his widely expressed legal and constitutional views
which are summarized herein, we reached the inescapable conclu-
sion that Judge Thomas should not be on the Supreme Court. We
accordingly urge the Senate to exercise its coequal role in the proc-
ess by not confirming Judge Thomas as an Associate Justice to the
Supreme Court.
  Thank you.

                           STATEMENT OF ANTONIA HERNANDEZ

         I am Antonia Hernandez, the President and General Counsel of the Mexican
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund ("MALDEF'). This Statement is
submitted on behalf of MALDEF in opposition to Senate confirmation of Clarence
Thomas as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

         In this Statement, I address hereafter three primary matters: (1) the background
of MALDEF's position on Clarence Thomas; (2) Judge Thomas' writings and speeches
antagonistic to civil rights laws and constitutional provisions which protect the rights of
Hispanics; and (3) Judge Thomas' testimony before this Committee.

L The Background of MALDEFs Position on Judge Thomas
         Because of our nation's history of invidious discrimination against Hispanics, and

because of the United States Supreme Court's unique role for more than thirty years
(1954-1988) in beginning to vindicate the civil and constitutional rights of Hispanics, we
Hispanics have placed particular reliance on the Supreme Court in assuring our civil and
constitutional rights.

        The history of discrimination against Hispanics in this country, particularly in the
Southwest and especially from the mid-Nineteenth Century to date,1 has been similar to

          1 This nation's discrimination against Hispanics dates back at least to the period following the 1848
Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, through which Mexico ceded to the United States territory which would become
the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas, and which would become parts of Nevada
and Utah. Article IX of that Treaty guaranteed all persons of Mexican igin continuing to reside in that
territory not only United States citizenship but also "the enjoyment of all the rights of the citizens of the
United States according to the principles of the Constitution,* including of course "free enjoyment of their
                                        841

that experienced by African Americans. We Hispanics have been subjected to
segregation in schools, in restaurants, and in hotels. We have been denied the
opportunity to serve on juries. We have been, and still are, denied employment, and
often treated badly when employed. And we have even been, and still are, denied the
most fundamental of rights, the right to vote for representatives of our choice.

        But we Hispanics, like African Americans in our country, were finally given hope
in 1954 by the United States Supreme Court. In fact, two weeks prior to the Supreme
Court's unanimous ruling in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. 347 U.S. 483
(1954) (holding school segregation unconstitutional), the Supreme Court in Hernandez v.
Texas. 347 U.S. 475 (1954), unanimously decided that Mexican Americans were protected
by the Fourteenth Amendment, and unanimously held that the exclusion of Mexican
Americans from juries in Texas violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection
clause. In subsequent years, it again was the Supreme Court - and thereafter also
Congress -- that continued to recognize some of our basic civil rights.

        This fight to establish our basic civil and constitutional rights has not been an easy
one. It in fact has required MALDEF attorneys to file and to litigate hundreds of
lawsuits. And a number of our lawsuits have ended up in the United States Supreme
Court.

        A prime example is the voting rights case of White v. Regester. 412 U.S. 755
(1973). In this case, a unanimous Supreme Court struck down Texas' imposition of a
multimember legislative district in Bexar County, a heavily Hispanic county where San

liberty and property." Despite these guarantees, what the once-Mexican population received instead was more
than a century of subjugation.
                                     842

Antonio is located. Based on such facts as the reality that only five Hispanics in nearly
100 years had ever been elected to the Texas Legislature from Bexar County, the
Supreme Court upheld our claim that the multimember district diluted the votes of
Hispanics in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court thus affirmed the
remedial redrawing of single-member districts.

        Apart from the Supreme Court's decision in White and its earlier decision in
Hernandez, few of our victories have been the result of unanimous decisions by the
Supreme Court. Instead -- and increasingly in the 1980s ~ we faced a divided Supreme
Court, a Court which in fact often was very closely divided on issues of special
importance to Hispanics.

        For example, in Plvler v. Doe. 457 U.S. 202 (1982), we challenged Texas' denial of
a free public school education to undocumented Hispanic children. These children were
Texas residents most of whom would eventually become legal residents, but who, without
an education, would become a permanent underclass. The Supreme Court in this case
agreed that Texas' policy was unconstitutionally discriminatory in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment. But the Court reached this decision 'hrough a bare 5-4
majority, with Justices Thurgood Marshall and Lewis Powell joining the majority decision
written by Justice William Brennan.

         Following the resignation of Justice Powell and his replacement by Justice
Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court -- within a matter of weeks in June, 1989 --
rendered, usually on five-to-four votes, a series of decisions devastating to the rights of
Hispanics, other minorities, and women to a discrimination-free workplace. These
                                                 843

decisions2 are, of course, well known to the United States Senate given the vast amount

of time that the Senate had to expend last year to try to restore prior law through the

Civil Rights Act of 1990 (S. 2104), legislation passed by the Senate on a lopsided vote,3

only to be vetoed by the President, and with the Senate thereafter falling only one vote

short of a veto override. In the meantime, the effect upon Hispanics of these recent

Supreme Court decisions has been particularly devastating in view of increased

discrimination against Hispanics, which was revealed by a recent government study

showing that as many as 19% of all employers are now engaging in discrimination against

"foreign-looking" or "foreign-sounding" employees and job applicants.4

          Whether the Supreme Court's decisions in 1989 hostile to the civil and

constitutional rights of Hispanics actually signal a Supreme Court retrenchment or

turning-back-of-the-clock on civil rights, I have little doubt that the next person confirmed

          2 These decisions, listed roughly in chronological order, include thefollowing: Wards Cove Packing
Co. v, Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 109 S.Ct. 2115, 104 L.Ed.2d 733 (1989) (reallocating burdens of proof and
redefining business necessity, among other things, in Title VII disparate impact cases); Martin v. Wilks, 490
U.S. 755, 109 S.Ct. 2180, 104 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989) (permitting "reverse discrimination" collateral attacks on
consent decrees at anytime); Lorance v. AT&T Technologies, Inc.. 490 U.S. 900,109 S.Ct. 2261,104 L.Ed.2d
961 (1989) (striking down EEOC charges as untimely under Title VII when filed shortly after the
discrimination affected the female charging parties); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union. 491 U.S. 164, 109
S.Ct. 2363,105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989) (eviscerating  1981 by limiting it to intentional discrimination only in the
formation of contracts); Jett v. Dallas Independent School District. 491 U.S. 701,109 S.Ct. 2702,105 L.Ed.2d
598 (1989) (further eviscerating  1981 in the public sector by subjecting it to the 'policymaker" constraints
governing  1983 lawsuits); Independent Federation of Flight Attendants v. Zipes. 491 U.S. 754, 109 S. Ct.
2732, 105 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989) (disallowing statutory attorneys fees to successful Title VII plaintiffs who had
to litigate for years against an intervening defendant's attack on their back pay and seniority remedies); cf.
Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio v. Betts. 492 U.S. 158,109 S.Ct. 2854,106 LEd.2d 134(1989)
(insulating discriminatory benefit plans from age discrimination challenges under the ADEA).

          3 Virtually identical legislation, H.R. 4000, was passed by the House by a similarly lopsided vote
of 272-154.

as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court will in fact have a major impact upon the
future course of Supreme Court adjudication: either at least occasionally respecting and
vindicating the civil and constitutional rights of Hispanics, or denying our rights
altogether.

         The reason for this determinative impact is obvious. The next nominee confirmed
by the Senate will be replacing Justice Thurgood Marshall, whose fairness and
compassion for civil and constitutional rights were crucial to the rights of Hispanics.

         With Justice Marshall no longer on the Supreme Court, and with the future of the
Supreme Court hanging in the balance, I am of course concerned about his possible
replacement, and I am particularly concerned about the legal philosophy of the person
nominated to succeed Justice Marshall.

II. Judge Thomas' Writings and Speeches Antagonistic to Civil and
         Constitutional Rights
         MALDEF has historically and consistently sought (quite successfully) to protect

and to advance the civil and constitutional rights of Hispanics through litigation and
advocacy: (a) by winning voluntarily-adopted and court-ordered goals and timetables and
other forms of affirmative action in employment; (b) by defending set-aside programs in
government contracting for minority business enterprises; (c) by urging increased
inclusion of Hispanics in higher education through effective affirmative action programs;
(d) by obtaining and now maintaining effective school desegregation remedies; (e) by
making the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause meaningful for noncitizens
                                        845

and particularly for undocumented children; and (f) by trying to hold on to (especially
for economically disadvantaged Latinas) the constitutional right to reproductive choice
and indeed to privacy itself.

        Through his lengthy paper trail of extrajudicial writings and speeches on civil and
constitutional rights, Judge Clarence Thomas has revealed an ideological conservatism
which differs little from that of Judge Robert Bork,5 and, of great importance to us,
solid philosophical positions in virtually all six of the foregoing areas. And in virtually all
such areas of great concern to Hispanics, Judge Thomas' positions are diametrically
opposed (or, possibly in the latter two instances, only potentially diametrically opposed)
to the positions which have been and continue to be advanced by MALDEF on behalf of
the civil and constitutional rights of Hispanics.

        A. Affirmative Action in Employment
         One of the most frequently-repeated themes in Clarence Thomas' writings and
speeches is his steadfast opposition to affirmative action in virtually all forms, including
affirmative action ordered by the courts to remedy proven past discrimination.
        Clarence Thomas' opposition to affirmative action is based on his belief that the
Constitution must in all circumstances be colorblind:

          5 Judge Thomas' ideological conservatism, as is explored more thoroughly infra at 6-24, has
frequently been compared with that of Judge Robert Bork particularly with regard to their mutual opposition
to Twentieth Century jurisprudence on affirmative action, on school desegregation, and on the Ninth
Amendment right to privacy. Given their mutual views, it may not be surprising that Judge Thomas beleives
to be "disgraceful" the fact "that Judge Bork is not now Justice Bork." Thomas, "Civil Rights as a Principle
Versus Civil Rights as an Interest," in Assessing the Reagan Years. 391392 (Cato Institute, 1988) (cited
hereafter as Assessing the Years).
                                        846

                           "I firmly insist that the Constitution be interpreted in a
                  colorblind fashion. It is futile to talk of a colorblind society
                  unless this constitutional principle is first established. Hence,
                  I emphasize black self-help, as opposed to racial quotas and
                  other race-conscious legal devices that only further and
                  deepen the original problem."6
Judge Thomas' views of affirmative action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, and of employment discrimination law in general, are the same as his view of a
colorblind Constitution:

                          "I continue to believe that distributing opportunities on
                  the basis of race or gender, whoever the beneficiaries, turns
                  the law against employment discrimination on its head. Class
                  preferences are an affront to the rights and dignity of
                  individuals - both those individuals who are directly
                  disadvantaged by them, and those who are their supposed
                 beneficiaries."7
Stated otherwise, in Judge Thomas' view, Title VII in fact makes affirmative action
unlawful. Although Title VII bars "employers from discriminating on the basis of race,

          6 Thomas, Letter to the Editor, Wall Street Journal. 23 (Feb. 20,1987). ee also. e.ft.. Thomas,
"The Black Experience: Rage and Reality,* Wall Street Journal (Oct. 12,1987). "Much of the current thinking
on civil rights has been crippled by the confusion between a 'colorblind society* and a 'colorblind Constitution.'
The Constitution, by protecting the rights of individuals, is colorblind."

          7 Thomas, "Affirmative Action Goals and Timetables: Too Tough? Not Tough Enough!," 5 Yale
Law <& Policy Review 402, 403 n. 3 (1987) (emphasis added) (cited hereafter as Yale Policy Review^

color, sex, religion, or national origin,"
                          "Unfortunately, this commitment to nondiscrimination

                 soon gave way to a system of group preferences.
                           T h e government encouraged and required employers

                 to institute the very practices that sponsors of the civil rights
                 law had observed 'are themselves discriminatory."'8
Accordingly, "group preferences" in any form "conflict with the law."9
        Given Judge Thomas' personal opposition to affirmative action, as well as his
above-illustrated legal views, it may not come as a surprise that he has formally criticized
as wrongly decided most of the Supreme Court's decisions approving various forms of
affirmative action. The most "egregious example," according to Judge Thomas, is the
Supreme Court's Weber decision in 1979 approving voluntary affirmative action.10 Also
worthy of his "personal disagreement with the Court" are four decisions on affirmative
action rendered in 1986 and 1987."

        Because all of these five decisions were rendered by the Supreme Court usually on

          9 Id. In a subsequent commentary, Clarence Thomas argued that the Supreme Court's contrary view
of the law, as set forth in its decisions upholding various forms of affirmative action as lawful under Title VII,
reflected the "politicization* of the Court:

                               'Let us look once more at the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as an
                    example of the way this process has worked. We note that Congress passed
                    a general law in relatively clear language. Subsequently, though, as in the
                    case of Title VII of the act, the law was interpreted in a very different way."

very close votes, and because Judge Thomas' vote (in place of Justice Thurgood
Marshall's vote) would have caused a contrary result in several of the cases and could in
the future cause a reversal of all of the cases, we briefly summarize below the five
decisions with which Clarence Thomas has to date voiced his personal disagreement:

                  > > United Steelworkers of America v. Weber. 443 U.S. 193 (1979). On
                  a 5-3 vote, the Court upheld as lawful under Title VII a private employer's
                  hiring and training program which reserved half of the skilled-craft jobs for
                  Blacks. The Court specifically noted that the program was designed to
                  remedy the severe underrepresentation of Blacks in the employer's
                 workforce in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of Title VII,
                  and that the program was temporary and did not unnecessarily trammel the
                  interests of white employees.
                  > > Local 28. Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC. 478 U.S. 421 (1986V On
                  a 5-4 vote, the Court upheld as appropriate relief under Title VII - in
                  order to remedy "egregious" and longstanding past discrimination by the
                  defendant trade union - a 29% minority membership and employment goal
                  to be achieved by 1987 or soon thereafter. In reaching this decision, the
                  Court expressly rejected the argument made by the federal government12
                  that Title VII remedies could benefit only identifiable victims of the

          12 Despite the title of this case - seemingly the EEOC (and the Justice Department) against a
discriminatory construction trade union - neither the EEOC nor the Justice Department supported the
numerical remedy in this case. As is set forth in their Brief for the United States in this case, the EEOC (then
chaired by Clarence Thomas) and the Justice Department in fact opposed the numerical remedy. Support for
the numerical remedy was provided instead by two other plaintiffs in the case (the State of New York and the
City of New York) and by a host of civil rights organizations.
                                        849

                 longstanding past discrimination.
                  > > Local 93. Firefighters v. Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501 (1986). On a 6-3
                 vote, the Court upheld as lawful under Title VII a consent decree (per
                 usual not containing an admission of past discrimination) requiring specified
                 promotions of minority employees to remedy historical
                 underrepresentation. This, the Court observed, is consistent with Congress'
                 strong preference for voluntary settlements of Title VII claims.
                  > > United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149 (1987). On a 5-4 vote, the
                 Court upheld as constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's equal
                 protection clause a court order requiring one-for-one (one Black for every
                 white) promotions for state troopers to remedy pervasive past
                 discrimination by the defendant law enforcement agency.
                  > > Johnson v. Transportation Agency. Santa Clara County. 480 U.S. 616
                 (1987). On a 6-3 vote, the Court upheld as lawful under Title VII a
                 voluntary affirmative action plan pursuant to which a female was given a
                 preference for promotion over an equally qualified male so as to
                 desegregate a job classification historically filled only by males. As in
                 Weber, the Court again noted that this plan was consistent with Congress'
                 objectives in enacting Title VII.
        The continued viability of each of these decisions, among others, as well as the
future of affirmative action in general, hang in the balance today.

         B. Set-Aside Programs in Government Contracting
         Similar to his disagreement with the Supreme Court's decisions approving
affirmative action in employment is Clarence Thomas' criticism of the Supreme Court's
decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick. 448 U.S. 448 (1980), in which the Court upheld as
constitutional a federal public works program which set aside 10% of the federal
contracts for minority business enterprises (MBEs). Disagreeing with this decision, Judge
Thomas claimed that the Supreme Court "reinterpreted] civil rights laws to create
schemes of racial preference where none was ever contemplated."13
        Nevertheless aware that Congress not only contemplated the MBE set-aside
program but in fact enacted it, Judge Thomas aimed his criticism at Congress as well. In
the same commentary quoted from above, Judge Thomas, after lambasting the Supreme
Court, stated:

                           "Not that there is a great deal of principle in Congress
                 itself. What can one expect of a Congress that would pass
                 the ethnic set-aside law the Court upheld in Fullilove v.
                 Klutznick?"14
        Unfortunately ~ from the perspective of MALDEF and of other civil rights
organizations - the constitutionality of federal MBE programs, now a matter of settled
law, may be revisited by a newly configured Supreme Court. Fullilove. a 1980 decision,
was decided on a 6-3 vote. A decade later, in Metro Broadcasting. Inc. v. FCC. 497 U.S.

    , 110 S.Ct. 2997, 111 L.Ed.2d 445 (1990), the Court upheld as constitutional the
FCC's minority preference policies in granting new broadcast licenses and in distress sales
of broadcast licenses, but this decision was rendered on a narrow 5-4 vote.13

                 A new Justice personally and philosophically opposed to affirmative action,
such as Clarence Thomas, could very well tip the balance to form a new Supreme Court
majority not only willing to strike down future federal programs but also willing to
overrule cases such as Fullilove and Metro Broadcasting.

        C Inclusion and Diversity in Higher Education
        In the Supreme Court's seminal decision on the legality and constitutionality of
race-conscious affirmative action, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke. 438
U.S. 265 (1978), a case involving the Davis Medical School's policy of reserving 16 of its
100 admission slots for minority students, the Court ruled 5-4 that the rigid reservation of
16 seats was impermissible without a showing that the school was remedying its own past
discrimination, but that reliance on race or ethnic origin as an important factor in the
admissions process was legally and constitutionally permissible in view of the interest of
institutions of higher education in attaining diverse student bodies.

          15 One year earlier, a 6-3 majority of the Supreme Court in City of Richmond v. Croson. 488 U.S.
469 (1989), struck down Richmond's MBE set-aside program as unconstitutional under the Fourteenth
Amendment The majority reached this result by applying the rigorous strict-scrutiny standard of review to
the set-aside program, by ruling that state and local governments could enact such programs only if they are
narrowly tailored to remedying identifiable past discrimination, and by distinguishing Fullilove based on the
greater deference given by the Court to Congress.

       In Metro Broadcasting, the four dissenters - Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices O'Connor, Scalia,
and Kennedy - argued that the same strict-scrutiny standard of review should be applied to Congress'
enactments, and that Congress' approval of the FCC minority preference policies thereby should be struck
down as unconstitutional.

         Although Clarence Thomas has not widely criticized the Supreme Court's majority

decision in Bakke - at least possibly because he was a beneficiary of the race-conscious

admissions program at Yale Law School16 - the Bakke ruling does not fit within his

legal philosophy compelling the Constitution to be colorblind. Although not widely,

Judge Thomas thus necessarily has criticized the Court's ruling in Bakke.

         In Judge Thomas' commentary quoted from frequently above, in which he initially

noted that it "is easy enough to blame the Court for 'voodoo jurisprudence,"'17 Judge

Thomas essentially argued that - at least since Brown v. Board of Education. 347 U.S.

483 (1954), if not also in Brown itself - the Supreme Court and then the lower courts

wrongfully moved from their intended judicial role of statutory and constitutional

interpretation to an improper role of political and social policymaking; and Judge

Thomas then sought to illustrate this alleged move into policymaking through reference

to four decisions with which he disagreed: Bakke and three other affirmative action

          16 As described in the opening paragraphs of a recent article in The New York Times. 1 (July 14,
1991):

                              "Judge Clarence Thomas, who came to prominence as a fierce black
                    critic of racial preference programs, was admitted to Yale Law School under
                    an explicit affirmative action plan with the goal of having blacks and other
                    minority members make up about 10 percent of the entering class, university
                    officials said.

                              "Under the program, which was adopted in 1971, the year Judge
                    Thomas applied, blacks and some Hispanic applicants were evaluated
                    differently than whites, the officials said. Nonetheless, they were not
                    admitted unless they met standards devised to predict they could succeed at
                    the highly competitive school."
This apparently was not the first time that Judge Thomas had benefitted from affirmative action, as years
earlier he reportedly had won "a race-based scholarship to attend college." Los Angeles Daily Journal. 1 (July
16,1991).
          17 Thomas, Assessing the Years. 392. Judge Thomas concluded this sentence as follows: "but
Congress must share a great deal of the blame." Id.

cases.18 Specifically with regard to its purported policymaking role on affirmative

action: "The Court has made rather creative interpretations of equal protection and

legislative intent in a number of civil rights cases beginning with Regents of the
University of California v. Bakke."19

        Although Bakke today seems to have been so correctly decided that it is a

component part of the fabric of American law, it is at least possible that Bakke could be

revisited by a newly configured, activist, anti-affirmative-action Supreme Court. In

addition, it is a virtual certainty that the Court within only a few more years will review

the legality and constitutionality of race- and ethnic-conscious scholarships for minorities.

These are matters which we would not want constitutionally colorblind Clarence Thomas

to be able to rule on.

        D. School Desegregation Remedies

        Any review of Clarence Thomas' legal position on school desegregation should

          18 In his analysis leading to his use of Bakke as an illustration of wrongful political and social
policymaking, Judge Thomas stated, in relevant pan:

                              There is no question that courts have entered the policymaking
                    process in an important way. But the founders purposely insulated the
                    courts from popular pressures, on the assumption that they should not make
                    policy decisions.

                                                                 
                              "When political decisions have been made by judges, they have
                    lacked the moral authority of the majority.

                                                                                         

                              "When they [the courts] have made important political and social
                    decisions in the absence of majority support, they have only exacerbated the
                    controversies they have pronounced on.

                                                                                        *

begin with a brief review of the Supreme Court's unanimous decisions in Brown v. Board

of Education. 347 U.S. 483 (1954) ("Brown I"), and in Brown v. Board of Education. 349

U.S. 294 (1955) ("Brown II"). This is because Clarence Thomas has criticized not only

the remedies for school desegregation but also the basis for the original Brown I decision

itself.

        In the initial 1954 decision, which was based upon and effectively compelled by a

long series of earlier Supreme Court decisions holding that racial segregation in higher

education was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment,20 the Court unanimously ruled: "Separate educational facilities are

inherently unequal." Brown I. 347 U.S. at 495. This unanimous ruling unquestionably
was based on the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.21

        Following rebriefing and reargument on the issue of remedy, the Court a year

later unanimously ruled that the public school systems were required "to effectuate a

transition to a racially nondiscriminatory school system" and that this transition was to

occur "with all deliberate speed." Brown II. 349 U.S. at 301.

        Clarence Thomas' quarrel with Brown I is not with its result but with the grounds

on which it was based. Because he firmly believes that African American school children

Gaines v. Canada. 305 U.S. 337 (1938). See generally Brown I. 347 U.S. at 492.

          21 As stated by the unanimous Supreme Court in Brown I. 347 U.S. at 495:
                              "We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of

                    'separate but equal' has no place. Separate educational facilities are
                    inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs and others
                    similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason of
                    the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws
                    guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment."

"can do quite well in their own schools,"22 Judge Thomas disagrees with the equal-
protection-of-the-laws premise of Brown I that separate is inherently unequal, and he in
fact disagrees with the Supreme Court's reliance in Brown I on the equal protection
clause at all.23

         Instead, according to Judge Thomas, Brown I should have been based on Justice
Harlan's constitutional colorblindness dissent in Plessv v. Ferguson. 163 U.S. 537 (1896),
which Judge Thomas believes was in turn based primarily on the Fourteenth
Amendment's privileges or immunities clause, which Judge Thomas in turn believes
incorporates or should incorporate principles of higher law or natural law.24

            2 3 See generally Thomas, "The Higher Law Background of the Privileges or Immunities Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment," 12 Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy 63 (1989) (cited hereafter as "Higher
Law"); Thomas, "Toward a 'Plain Reading' of the Constitution -- The Declaration of Independence in
Constitutional Interpretation," 30 Howard Law Journal 983 (1987) (cited hereafter as "Plain Reading").
         As Judge Thomas concluded in another writing, following a reference to Brown I: "The main problem
with the Court's opinions in the area of race is that it never had an adequate principle in the great Brown
precedent to proceed from." Thomas, Assessing the Years. 392-93.
            2 4 This sometimes-confusing and often-circular argument is set forth primarily in Thomas, "Higher
Law," and Thomas, "Plain Meaning." Although Judge Thomas' reasoning is not entirely clear to us, we
nevertheless attempt to summarize his views briefly here by quoting from several of his seemingly most
relevant statements.

                                    "Brown v. Board of Education would have had the strength of
                       American political tradition behind it if it had relied upon Justice Harlan's
                        [colorblindness] arguments instead of relying on dubious social science.
                       That case might have been an opportunity to revive the Privileges or
                        Immunities Clause as the core of the Fourteenth Amendment."
Thomas, "Higher Law," 68 (brackets added, footnote omitted).

                                    "Justice Harlan's reasoning, as we understand him, provides the best
                       basis for the Court opinions in the Civil Rights [sic] cases from Brown on."
Thomas, "Plain Meaning," 700.

                                   "Our best guide to the purpose behind the Privileges or Immunities

                                                                         *  *
                                    "It is not sufficiently appreciated that Justice Harlan's dissent
                       focused on both the Thirteenth and the entire Fourteenth Amendments -

          Among the problems with Clarence Thomas' approach to Brown I and its progeny

is the fact that his approach swims against the tide of enormous scholarly research

concluding that the equal protection clause is the core of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Also problematic are not only his willingness to reject the then-emerging equal protection

jurisprudence on which Brown I was based, see supra note 21, but also his apparent

willingness to reject the legal arguments advanced by all the parties in a case and to

legislate his own views instead.

          But the primary problem with Clarence Thomas' approach is that it seems to omit

the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause entirely from constitutional

jurisprudence.

          And if there can be no or only a few violations of the equal protection clause,

there then can be no or only few remedies therefor. And that seems to be the next step

                    in particular, the 'privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States'
                    clause. Justice Harlan's opinion provides one of our best examples of
                    natural rights or higher law jurisprudence. He brings us back to privileges
                    and immunities by constantly speaking of 'citizens' and then rights. For
                    example. Justice Harlan spoke of segregation as putting the brand of
                    servitude and degradation upon a large class of our fellow citizens, our
                    equals before the law. That Justice Harlan spoke of 'citizens' rather than
                    'persons' shows that he relied on the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather
                    than on either the Equal Protection or Due Process Clause, both of which
                    refer to persons. For Justice Harlan, the key to the Civil War amendments
                    was the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States.

                                                                                          

                              "In Justice Harlan's view, the original intention of the framers of the
                    Fourteenth Amendment was to bring about an equality of rights or
                    privileges and immunities exercised by United States citizens."
Thomas, "Higher Law,* 66-67 (footnotes omitted).

                              "In order to appreciate the subtleties of Justice Harlan's dissent, one
                    must read it in light of the 'higher law' background of the Constitution.
                    Justice Harlan understood, as did Lincoln, that his task was to bring out the
                    best of the Founders' arguments regarding the universal principles of
                    equality and liberty."
Thomas, "Plain Meaning," 701.

                                                                 17
                                        857

in Judge Thomas' approach:
                           "[Fourteen years after Brown I], in the Green v.

                  County Board of Education case, we discovered that Brown
                  not only ended segregation but required school integration.
                  And then began a disastrous series of cases requiring busing
                  and other policies that were irrelevant to parents' concern for
                  a decent education."25
         In a mere two sentences, Judge Thomas reflected both a serious misunderstanding
of school desegregation law and a severe disagreement with that body of law. First,
neither Brown I or Brown II "ended segregation" as both were followed by a more-than-
decade-long campaign of Massive Resistance. Second, the Supreme Court's remedy of
desegregation through integration commenced with Brown II. as pointed out above, and
not with Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430 (1968), in which a unanimous
Supreme Court merely held freedom-of-choice plans to be inadequate to satisfy the
mandate of Brown II in view of the decades upon decades of legally entrenched
segregation. Third, Judge Thomas' reference to the beginning of "a disastrous series of
cases requiring busing" merely emphasizes his disagreement with Swann v. Charlotte-
Mecklenburg Board of Education. 402 U.S. 1 (1971), in which the Court *eld that the
trial court did not abuse its remedial discretion in requiring redrawn school attendance
zones and altered feeder patterns (which in turn required some school buses to travel in
different directions) so as to remedy a prolonged pattern of unconstitutional actions.

          25 Thomas, Assessing the Years. 393 (footnote omitted).
                                                         18
                                        858

Finally, in view of the fact that Judge Thomas apparently would allow parents who care
about a decent education - all parents care about a decent education -- to trump
constitutional rights, he appears to prefer judicial policymaking of his own totally contrary
to the neutral constitutional principle reiterated by a unanimous Supreme Court in the
Little Rock case: that "constitutional rights ... are not to be sacrificed or yielded" because
of opposition to those rights, Cooper v. Aaron. 358 U.S. 1 (1958).

         The next generation of school desegregation cases moving toward the Supreme
Court involve the issue of when a federal court should relinquish jurisdiction and in effect
permit resegregation.26 There can be little doubt about Judge Thomas' position on this
crucial issue.

         E. Equal Protection for Undocumented Children
         The foregoing review of Clarence Thomas' legal views on equal protection in the
context of school segregation and desegregation reveals his ideological preference to
abandon the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause and to substitute instead
his view of the Fourteenth Amendment's privileges or immunities clause (including his
concepts of higher law and of natural law) as paramount. See supra note 24 and
accompanying text.
         Regardless of what freedoms Judge Thomas might find to be encompassed within
the privileges or immunities clause, the fact of the matter is that his preferred privileges

          26 See, e^g., Keves v. School District No. 1. Denver. 895 F2d 659 (10th Cir. 1990), cert, denied, 498
U.S. _ , 111 S.Ct. 951, 112 L.Ed.2d 1040 (1991).

                                                  19
                                        859

or immunities clause protects only "citizens,"27 whereas the equal protection clause
protects "any person."28

        Since the privileges or immunities clause cannot and does not protect noncitizens,
Judge Thomas may very likely reject the Supreme Court's historical application of equal
protection doctrine to protect noncitizens29 in cases running from Yick Wo v. Hopkins,
118 U.S. 356 (1886) (San Francisco ordinances effectively outlawing Chinese laundries
violate equal protection), to Plyler v. Doe. 457 U.S. 202 (1982) (Texas law which denies a
free public education to undocumented children violates equal protection). In fact, had
Judge Thomas rather than Justice Thurgood Marshall been on the Supreme Court at the
time of Plyler. and had Judge Thomas rejected equal protection analysis in favor of his
privileges or immunities approach, MALDEF's 5-4 victory in Plvler would have been a 5-
4 loss.

         F. Privacy and Reproductive Choice
         Because at least half of the community we represent is female, and because most
Latinas are economically disadvantaged and disproportionately at or below the poverty
line, MALDEF for more than a decade has sought to preserve the constitutional right to

          27 The privileges or immunities clause provides: "No State shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States." U.S. Const. Amend. XIV  1
(emphasis added).

          28 The equal protection clause provides in relevant part: "nor shall any State ,,. deny to any person
within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U.S. Const. Amend. XIV  1 (ellipsis and emphasis
added).

          29 Since Judge Thomas finds it inappropriate to apply the equal protection clause to protect African
Americans (for whom the Fourteenth Amendment was primarily designed), it would be difficult indeed, and
certainly legally inconsistent, for him to extend the equal protection clause to noncitizens.

                                                        20

reproductive choice. We thus have been most skeptical about Supreme Court nominees
who question continuation of the right to choice based on the constitutional right to
privacy. Clarence Thomas is such a nominee.

         In his "Higher Law" article published in 1989, Judge Thomas introduced his
philosophical objection to a Ninth Amendment right to privacy as follows:

                          "The current case provoking the most protest from
                 conservatives is Roe v. Wade. 410 U.S. 113 (1973), in which
                 the Supreme Court found a woman's decision to end her
                 pregnancy to be part of her unenumerated right to privacy
                 established by Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)

                          "I elaborate on my misgivings about activist judicial use
                 of the Ninth Amendment in Thomas, 'Civil Rights as a
                 Principle Versus Civil Rights as an Interest,' in Assessing the
                 Reagan Years. 398-99 (D. Boaz ed. 1988)."30
        In the 1988 publication, Judge Thomas expressed more than just his "misgivings"
about the Ninth Amendment right to privacy. He began as follows:

                          "I cannot resist adding a note here to the recent
                 discussion of the meaning of the Ninth Amendment (The
                 enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
                 construed to deny or disparage others retained by the
                 people.'). It relates directly to our theme of civil rights and

         30 Thomas, "Higher Law," 63 n. 2 (ellipsis and emphasis added).
                                                                21
                                        861

                 the courts. Some senators and scholars are horrified by
                 Judge Bork's dismissal of the Ninth Amendment, as others
                 were horrified by Justice Arthur Goldberg's discovery, or
                 rather invention, of it in Griswold v. Connecticut. But the
                 Ninth Amendment has to be considered in its context at the
                 founding."31
Judge Thomas thereupon argued that "the Constitution is a document of limited
government," that Supreme Court recognition of any unenumerated right in the Ninth
Amendment would "give to the Supreme Court certain powers to strike down legislation,'
that such power in essence "would seem to be a blank check" for the Court to discover
any right and to require "Congress to raise taxes to enforce this right," that accordingly
"[m]aximization of rights is perfectly compatible with total government and regulation,"
and that, therefore, "[f]ar from being a protection, the Ninth Amendment will likely
become an additional weapon for the enemies of freedom."32
        Apart from Judge Thomas' "misgivings" about, if not disagreement with, the
Supreme Court's "invention" of the Ninth Amendment right to privacy, even more
controversial have been his printed remarks on natural law in a speech delivered a year
earlier at the Heritage Foundation. In that speech, Judge Thomas quoted approvingly
from John Quincy Adams:

                          "Our political way of life is by the laws of nature, of

          31 Thomas, Assessing the Years. 398 (emphasis added, footnote omitted).
          32 Id. (brackets added).

                                                        22
                                         862

                    nature's God, and of course presupposes the existence of

                    God, the moral ruler of the universe, and a rule of right and

                    wrong, of just and unjust, binding upon man, preceding all

                    institutions of human society and of government."33

He also stated that the "need to reexamine the natural law is as current as last month's

issue of Time on ethics," and, most controversially, that "Lewis Lehrman's recent essay in

The American Spectator on the Declaration of Independence and the meaning of the

right to life is a splendid example of applying natural law."34

          As is set forth in footnote 34 below, the core of Mr. Lehrman's argument is that,

          3 Thomas, "Why Black Americans Should Look to Conservative Policies," 9 (Heritage Foundation,
1987) (cited hereafter as "Conservative Policies").

          34 Id. at 8. In view of Judge Thomas' endorsement of the essay by Lewis Lehrman, a well known
right-to-life activist, it maybe worth quoting from that article here:

                    "May it be reasonably supposed that an expressly stipulated right to life, as
                    set forth in the Declaration [of Independence] and the Constitution, is to be
                    set aside in favor of the conjured right to abortion in Roe v. Wade, a
                    spurious right born exclusively of judicial supremacy with not a single trace
                    of legal authority, implicit or explicit, in the actual text or history of the
                    Constitution itself?

                               "Are we finally to suppose that the right to Hie of the child-about-
                    to-be-born -- an inalienable right, the first in the sequence of God-given
                    rights warranted in the Declaration of Independence and also enumerated
                    first among the basic positive rights to life, liberty, and property stipulated
                    in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution - are we,
                    against all reason and American history, to suppose that the right to life as
                    set forth in the American Constitution may be lawfully eviscerated and
                    amended by the Supreme Court of the United States with neither warrant
                    nor amendment directly or indirectly from the American people whatsoever?
                    Is it not a biological necessity, if it were not manifestly plain from the
                    sequence of the actual words in the Declaration and in the constitutional
                    amendments themselves, that liberty is made for life, not life for liberty? Is
                    it to be reasonably supposed that the right to liberty is safe if the right to
                    life is not first secured; and, further, is it to be maintained that human life
                    'endowed by the Creator' commences in the second or third trimester and
                    not at the very beginning of the child-in-the-womb?"
Lehrman, "TheDeclaration of Independence and the Right to Life," The American Spectator. 21,23 (April,
1987) (brackets added, emphasis in the original).

                                                                23
                                     863

as a matter of natural law, fetuses are entitled to constitutional protection to life from
the moment of conception. This argument, if enshrined in law, would justify more than
just overruling Roe v. Wade. 410 U.S. 113 (1973), as it would also impose a constitutional
prohibition on abortion. States would no longer have even the authority that existed
prior to 1973 to permit abortion.

         Given Clarence Thomas' hostility to any unenumerated rights in the Ninth
Amendment combined with his express endorsement of Mr. Lehrman's essay as "a
splendid example of applying natural law," confirmation of Judge Thomas as Justice
Thomas could lead not only to the elimination of the constitutional right to reproductive
choice but also to the elimination altogether of the constitutional right to privacy.

HI. Judge Thomas' Testimony Before This Committee
         Apparently recognizing that many of the philosophical positions that he had taken

in his speeches and his writings were not only out of the mainstream but often extreme,
Clarence Thomas appeared to pursue at least four strategies in his five days of testimony
before this Committee: first, he occasionally reiterated and tried to defend several of his
previously-stated philosophical views (particularly his opposition to virtually all forms of
affirmative action as unlawful and unconstitutional); second, he tried to modify and in
fact to moderate some of his most extreme views; third, he refused to answer questions
in a few areas altogether (particularly with regard to whether he would overrule the
constitutional right to reproductive choice); and, finally, and most sweepingly, he argued
that his past philosophical positions should be deemed irrelevant to the confirmation

                                                        24
                                        864

process because they were arrived at and presented when he was a policy maker rather
than in his current role as an "impartial" judge. To at least several and maybe to many
Members of this Committee, parts of Clarence Thomas' testimony accordingly bordered
on being unbelievable.

         Most problematic to me is Judge Thomas' argument that his past philosophical
views should now be disregarded. That is an argument which itself must be disregarded.
Because his past philosophical views were freely arrived at by Clarence Thomas, because
those views were voluntarily delievered in speeches and voluntarily presented in
numerous writings, because those views form at least part of the reason he was
nominated in the first place, and because no nominee can or is expected to shed his or
her philosophical views upon nomination to the judiciary, Clarence Thomas' past
philosophical views are of crucial importance to the determination of whether he should
be confirmed by the Senate. And it is precisely because of his widely-expressed past
philosophical views that we urge the Senate not to confirm Clarence Thomas.

        A. One area in which Judge Thomas did not alter his views in his testimony
before this Committee concerns his widely expressed legal view that race-based or
gender-based affirmative action goals, timetables, or preferences of any kind in
employment are unlawful and unconstitutional. Although he maintined this legal position
at the outset of his testimony under questioning by Senator Spector (on Wednesday,
September 11), he sort of conceded in response to questioning by Senator Spector and
by Chairman Biden (on Friday, September 13) that such policies might sometimes be
okay, but only from a policy viewpoint; Judge Thomas declined to give even tentative

                                                        25
                                    865

approval in a legal context. His consistent speeches and writings, of course, leave no
doubt about Judge Thomas' position from a legal viewpoint.

        Supreme Court adjudication in this area hangs in the balance today. Judge
Thomas should not be confirmed.

         B. In the area of congressionally-enacted MBE set-aside programs and similar
federal programs, Judge Thomas here too did not alter his prior views about the
unconstitutionally of such programs. Although he agreed in his testimony (on Monday,
September 16) that the Supreme Court, in such decisions as Metro Broadcasting, has
accorded more deference to Congress than it has to the states in this area, Judge
Thomas declined to state his legal view. But his legal philosophy here is also well known
from his speeches and writings.

         Given that Metro Broadcasting was decided barely more than a year ago on a 5-4
vote with Justice Marshall in the majority, Supreme Court adjudication in this area also
hangs in the balance today. Judge Thomas should not be confirmed.

         C. On the matters of inclusion and diversity in higher education, Judge
Thomas only slightly altered his previously-expressed legal criticsm of the Supreme
Court's approval of race- and ethnic-based affirmative action programs. As a beneficiary
of such a program at Yale Law School, he conceded under questioning by Senator Brown
(on Wednesday, September 11) and by Senator Kennedy (on Thursday, September 12)
his approval of Yale's affirmative action program, but again only from a policy
perspective, not from a legal viewpoint. And, under questioning by Senator Simon (on
Wednesday, September 11), Judge Thomas similarly voiced approval of race- and ethnic-

                                                        26
                                        866

based scholarships, but only from a policy perspective, not from a legal perspective. His
legal philosophy opposing all forms preference, again, are well known.

         Given that Bakke was a 4-1-4 decision rendered in 1978 - with Justices Marshall,
Brennan, and Powell casting key votes -- the legality and constitutionality of inclusive
affirmative action plans in higher education, and even of essential race- and ethnic-based
scholarships, may hang in the balance today. Judge Thomas should not be confirmed.

         D. As to his legal views on school desegregation remedies, Judge Thomas
somewhat expanded upon his previous criticism of several Supreme Court decisions by
stating to Senator Spector (on Monday, September 16) that the remedies must be related
to improving the quality of education, thereby at least implying that he continues to
oppose such desegregation remedies as integrating students and integrating faculty as a
bottom-line principle of having not African American schools, Hispanic schools, and
Anglo schools, but just schools.

         Resegregation issues are currently pending before the Supreme Court, and cases
presenting similar issues will be reviewed hereafter. Judge Thomas should not be
confirmed.

         E. As far as I'm aware, Judge Thomas was not asked about and did not testify
about his stated preference for the privileges or immunities clause, rather than the equal
protection clause, as the "core" of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equality
under law. Because the privileges or immunities clause applies only to "citizens," whereas
the equal protection clause protects "any person," his preferred approach to Fourteenth
Amendment decision-making is especially troubling to me.

                                                        27
                                        867

        Fourteenth Amendment cases involving discrimination against noncitizens come
before the Supreme Court quite frequently. Again, Judge Thomas should not be
confirmed.

        F. Finally, on the issue of reproductive choice, Judge Thomas during his
testimony repeatedly sought to distance himself from some of his previously-expressed
views (by, for example, at least recognizing a constitutional right to privacy in the liberty
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and by claiming that he never intended his belief
in natural law to be used in constitutional adjudication), but he repeatedly refused to
comment on his view of the constitutional right to choice. This is something that the
Senate and the American people have a right to know.

         Given that the constitutionality of the right to reproductive choice is certain to be
reevaluated by the Supreme Court, given that his vote on this issue could be crucial to its
outcome, and in view of his previously-stated antagonism to the right to choice, Judge
Thomas should not be confirmed.

Conclusion
         Presenting MALDEF's position in opposition to the confirmation of Clarence

Thomas is not a task that I have looked forward to at all.
         I know Judge Thomas. I consider him a friend. And, as other witnesses have

brought to the attention of this Committee, there is no question that he has many
extremely positive qualities.

         Additionally, on matters of importance to Hispanics, there similarly is no question

                                                        28
                                        868

that, during his tenure at the EEOC, he was accessible to me in my various roles at
MALDEF, and that he was accessible to others too. He also was sensitive to matters of
particular concern to Hispanics. Illustrative was his support for Spanish-language forms
and brochures. And commendable here was his testimony in response to Senator
DeConcini (on Thursday, September 12) about his opposition to English-only policies
which affect Hispanics so negatively.

         Nevertheless, in determining our position here, we at MALDEF had to look at the
entire picture in the context of a Supreme Court nomination, and we in particular had to
look closely indeed at Judge Thomas' legal and philosophical views about the civil rights
laws and constitutional provisions, and about Supreme Court decisions interpreting them,
all of such importance to protecting and advancing the rights of Hispanics. The big
picture, we found, was not at all a positive one.

         Based on his widely-expressed legal and constitutional views, which are
summarized herein, we reached the inescapable conclusion that Judge Thomas should
not be, and cannot be, on the Supreme Court. We accordingly urge the Senate to
exercise its co-equal role in this process by not confirming Clarence Thomas as an
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

                                        The Alliance opposes the nomination of
                       pjtct    Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. In a
                                statement released July 29, 1991 (see attached),
                                the Alliance concluded that Judge Thomas'
                                extensive record as head of the Equal Employment
                                Opportunity Commission and his writings and
                                speeches demonstrated a stubborn unwillingness to
                                enforce federal law consistent with Congressional
                                intent and a judicial philosophy that threatens to
                                undermine constitutional protections. After
                                closely following Judge Thomas' testimony before
                                the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Alliance
                                remains firmly convinced that the nominee's views
                                pose a threat to individual rights and liberties.

                                        At his confirmation hearings, Judge Thomas
                                adopted a strategy to disavow past statements that
                                were either controversial or inflammatory. In
                                doing so, he was asking the Senate to disregard
                                his prior positions in evaluating his fitness for
                                the Supreme Court. It should categorically reject
                                that request. President Bush nominated Judge
                                Thomas for the Court precisely because of his
                                record as an outspoken partisan for conservative
                                causes. He should not be allowed to disown that
                                record now.

SUMMARY OF JUDGE THOMAS' RECORD

         Before he was appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit,
Judge Thomas compiled an extensive record. As summarized more
fully in the attached opposition statement, that record displays
a defiance of the rule of law and an excessively narrow role for
the courts in protecting individual rights and civil liberties.

         Judge Thomas' tenure as chairman of the EEOC was marked by
an overall disdain for the nation's civil rights laws. As
chairman, he imposed his personal views of anti-discrimination on
the agency--contrary to the will of Congress, the overwhelming
weight of Title VII case law, and the traditions of the agency
itself. He took numerous positions that weakened the EEOC's
commitment to enforcement of the law and proved inimical to the
rights of workers.

         In addition, before his nomination, Judge Thomas
consistently advocated a very limited, at times radical, role for
the courts. He passionately spoke of natural law and economic
rights. He lamented the "willfulness . . . of run-amok judges"
and criticized numerous civil rights precedents, labeling them
"rather creative interpretations of equal protection and
legislative intent . . . " (Speech before the Cato Institute,
October 2, 1987, at 7 ) . Prior to the hearings, he did not speak
of evolving constitutional standards. Rather, he scorned "the
nihilism" of Oliver Wendell Holmes, rejected the judicial
philosophy of William Brennan, and praised the opinions of
Justice Scalia.

CREDIBILITY

        Judge Thomas' testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee exacerbated the Alliance's concerns about his record
and his fitness for the Supreme Court. Riddled with
contradictions, disavowals, and evasions, it lacked both candor
and credibility.

        Contradictions: Judge Thomas' contradictions are most
starkly indicated in his comments on natural law. Before
confirmation, Judge Thomas wrote that "[t]he higher-law
background of the American Constitution, whether explicitly
invoked or not, provides the only firm basis for a just, wise and
constitutional decision." "The Higher Law Background of the
Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment," 12
Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy 63, 68 (1989) (emphasis
in original). However, in the very first round of questioning
before the Committee, Judge Thomas stated "I don't see a role for
the use of natural law in constitutional adjudication."
                                     871

(September 10, 1991, Tr. at 137).

        If Judge Thomas had changed his mind about the role of
natural law in constitutional adjudication, he had ample
opportunity during the hearings to say so and explain the
reasons. Instead, he blatantly and inexplicably contradicted
prior, unequivocal statements. Only after much prodding by
Chairman Biden did Judge Thomas finally admit that natural law
does impact the adjudication of cases, "[t]o the extent that the
Framers believed." (September 12, 1991, Tr. at 43-44). By that
time, his inconsistencies had inescapably clouded any
understanding of his judicial philosophy.

        Disavowals: Some of Judge Thomas' remarks during his
testimony can be categorized only as outright disavowals of past
positions. A glaring example of this is his comment about
Johnson v. Santa Clara County Transportation Agency, which upheld
an employer's voluntary affirmative action plan designed to bring
more females into traditionally and overwhelmingly male-dominated
positions. Judge Thomas, while he was Chairman of the EEOC,
harshly criticized the Supreme Court decision, praising instead
Justice Scalia's dissent. Of the dissent, he stated "I hope [it]
will provide guidance for lower courts and a possible majority in
future decisions." (Speech before the Cato Institute, April 23,
1987, at 20-21). When Senator Kennedy asked him why he was
urging lower courts to follow the dissent, Judge Thomas replied
that "in using the word 'guidance,' I suggested . . . we look at
the opposite side of the argument." (September 12, 1991, Tr. at
80). Dubious at best, that explanation shows no recognition of
the message the statement was sending to judges.

         Evasions: The right to privacy and the Supreme Court's role
in preserving it has been a burning public issue in this country
for the past decade. Yet, on no issue was Judge Thomas more
evasive. He quickly stated his belief in a right to marital
privacy, which he had to do in order to pass even minimum
scrutiny by the Committee. However, marital privacy is the only
privacy right that Judge Thomas unequivocally recognized as
constitutional. He flatly refused to comment on Roe v. Wade, the
landmark case recognizing a woman's fundamental right to choose
to terminate her pregnancy. He even said he did not have a
personal opinion on Roe. (September 11, 1991, Tr. at 105-106).

        Moreover, the evasiveness of Judge Thomas' testimony on
personal privacy went beyond Roe. He painstakingly circumvented
Chairman Biden's questions about the fundamental right to privacy
of single persons. Even when Chairman Biden pulled from him a
"yes" to the question of whether he believed the Constitution
protects a single individual's right to privacy in the area of
procreation, Judge Thomas felt compelled to add "I have expressed
on what I base that, and I would leave it at that." (September
13, 1991, Tr. at 120). At a minimum, this is not the kind of
                                     872

answer that instills confidence about Judge Thomas1 views of the
right to privacy outside the marital relationship.

         Finally, Judge Thomas avoided questions on the controversial
White House Working Group on the Family report, which criticized
as "fatally flawed" a number of Supreme Court right to privacy
cases, including Roe. Although Judge Thomas was the highest
ranking Reagan Administration official on the Working Group, he
said he never read the report and did not realize it contained
criticism of numerous privacy cases. He gave a similar
explanation in avoiding questions about Lewis Lehrman's anti-
abortion article. His explanation -- that he had not reviewed
the article in preparation for his testimony, despite the highly
publicized controversy it generated after his nomination --
implies willful evasion. More importantly, it trivializes an
issue that is of primary concern to the American public.

         In an attempt to explain the inconsistencies in his
testimony, Judge Thomas stated that his past statements and
positions were taken as a policymaker, not as a judge, and
therefore should be discounted. He implied that they were of
little relevance to the question of what judicial philosophy he
will bring to the Supreme Court. That is utterly untenable. A
person cannot -- and should not -- shed his personal philosophy
when he or she dons a black robe. Personal philosophy is the
most relevant evidence of judicial philosophy. Judge Thomas1
failure to recognize the inseparable link between the two only
casts further doubt on his fitness for the Court.

THE NEED FOR MODERATION

        The departure of Justice Thurgood Marshall from the Supreme
Court represents a pivotal point in the history of the Supreme
Court. Led by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Supreme Court has
embarked on a brazen course to overturn significant
constitutional protections with which it ideologically disagrees.
It was disturbing and ironic that as Justice Marshall was
bringing his Court tenure to a close, Chief Justice Rehnquist was
"send[ing] a clear signal that essentially all decisions
implementing the personal liberties protected by the Bill of
Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment are open to reexamination."
(Marshall, J., dissenting in Payne v. Tennessee).

        The Court's present course makes it imperative that the
Senate halt the ideological court-packing plan of the Reagan/Bush
Administrations. The Senate should insist on a nominee who will
bring moderation to an increasingly monolithic Court out of step
with the American people. Judge Thomas is not that nominee.
                                    873

CONCLUSION

        Justice Thurgood Marshall brought to the Supreme Court an
extraordinary sensitivity and insight to the plight of those
suffering injustice. Conversely, Judge Thomas has displayed a
disrespect for the law and an indifference to the very
individuals he was entrusted to protect. An individual who
throughout his career overlooked the most vulnerable in our
society and openly flouted the law presents too great a risk of
reversing this country's progress towards equality and justice.
Given the current course of the Court, which has declared open
season on standing precedents, the country cannot afford to give
Judge Thomas the benefit of the doubt on his longstanding, but
recently disavowed, record.

                                  CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION - OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM

                                          Just 43 years old, Judge Thomas, if confirmed, will
                                  likely be a powerful and influential voice on the Supreme
                                  Court for decades. Unfortunately, his writings, speeches,
                                  and public comments portray a Constitutional philosophy that
                                  is dangerously out of the mainstream.

                                           In his writings and speeches, Judge Thomas displays an
                                  inclination toward an extremely restrictive philosophy. For
                                    875

example, he has severely criticized Griswold v. Connecticut, which upheld
the rights of a married couple to use birth control and recognized the
constitutional right to privacy. He has also mocked the Supreme Court's
use of the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses
as "extremely creative. . . . The Court has used them to make itself the
national school board, parole board, health commission, and elections
commissioner, among other titles." (1988 Speech to Wake Forest University).
Such a view shows no recognition of the vital barrier the 14th Amendment
imposes to protect the disadvantaged from unlawful government action.

        Judge Thomas also displays a strong adherence toward "natural law"
theory, which he says stems from a belief in "the laws of nature and of
nature's God." (Speech to the Pacific Research Institute). He has used
the natural law theory to repudiate the reasoning in Brown v. Board of
Education, which struck down the "separate but equal" doctrine. More
startling, however, are his comments on natural law and a women's
Constitutional right to choose. His views on choice were telegraphed when
he praised an article proclaiming that a fetus has a Constitutional right
to life as a "splendid example of applying natural law." (1987 Speech to
Heritage Foundation). This comment indicates more than just a likely vote
to overturn Roe. It implies that Judge Thomas believes the Constitution
actually forbids abortion. Under this reading, states would not be free to
enact laws protecting a woman's right to choose.

        Judge Thomas' views on economic liberties also illustrate a Constitu-
tional vision out of the mainstream. He describes economic liberties as
"protected as much as any other [Constitutional] rights." The economic
rights doctrine was routinely invoked from 1905 to the mid-1930s by the
Lochner-era Court to strike down legislation setting limits on work hours
and minimum wages, barring child labor and protecting the right of workers
to organize. However, the doctrine has been discredited for decades. Will
Judge Thomas, in the name of natural law, revive the economic rights
doctrine, at least in some form, and strike down laws designed to protect
the environment, eradicate discrimination, or enhance worker health and
safety? Some of his writings point to an affirmative answer.

        Finally, Judge Thomas has hinted at a predisposition for judicial
activism reminiscent of that of former Judge Robert Bork. In a 1987 speech
at the Cato Institute, he showed signs that he would willingly overturn
Supreme Court precedent on Constitutional Issues. In criticizing Johnson
v. Transportation Agency of Santa Clara County (1986), which upheld an
employer's right to establish a .gender-conscious affirmative action policy,
he commended "Justice Scalia's dissent, which I hope will provide guidance
for lower courts and a possible majority in future decisions."

LACK OF COMPASSION

        Many have argued that Judge Thomas' background and life experience
have provided him with a sensitivity and insight to the concerns of the
poor and disadvantaged in our society. They believe that Judge Thomas will
therefore bring diversity to the Court that would otherwise be lacking with
the departure of Justice Marshall. Unfortunately, while his life
experience is inspirational to all Americans, his record displays an

                                                                   -2-
                                     876

animosity to views different from his own and a disregard for the needs of
others.

        For example, Judge Thomas repeatedly attacks the leaders of the civil
rights community and denigrates their contributions to the fight for
equality. He has stated that "[a]ll too often, the players in [the civil
rights] arena intentionally distort and misinform. The tendency is to
exploit issues rather than solve problems." (1986 Speech at the North
Carolina Affirmative Action/EEO Conference). He has also commented:

                 "[A]s long as the convenient and unflattering history of this
                 country can be trotted out to support so-called progressive
                 policies, politicians who thrive on creating miseries that can
                 only be solved by them and government and civil rights groups who
                 are adept at the art of generating self-perpetuating social ills,
                will continue to beat back the voices of reason."

(1986 Speech to Associated Industries of Cleveland).

        His indifference towards his sister's plight underscores the concerns
about his regard for the needs of others. A single parent, his sister
worked two minimum wage jobs while an aunt took care of ber children. When
the aunt became ill and could no longer take care of herself or the
children, Judge Thomas' sister had to quit her jobs and resort to
governmental assistance. She is currently back in the workforce, and no
longer on such assistance. However, Judge Thomas publicly depicted his
sister as lacking initiative and so dependent on welfare that she "gets mad
when the mailman is late with her welfare check." (Washington Post,
December 16, 1980). He added that "[w]hat's worse is that now her kids
feel entitled to the check, too. They have no motivation for doing better
or getting out of that situation." This, too, is a distortion. Her oldest
son recently served in the Persian Gulf War, and her other son is a
carpenter. One of her daughters was recently laid off from her job in a
bakery, and the youngest daughter is still in school. (Los Angeles Times,
July 5, 1991).

LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE RULE OF LAW

        Judge Thomas' tenure as chairman of the EEOC was marked by strife and
confrontation with Congress and an overall disdain for the nation's civil
rights laws. As chairman, he imposed his personal views of anti-discrimi-
nation on the agency, contrary to the will of Congress, the overwhelming
weight of Title VII case law, and the traditions of the agency itself.

        Congress created the EEOC with the mission to eradicate prejudice and
inequality of opportunity in the workplace. Established under Title VII of
the historic, bipartisan Civil Rights Act of 1964, the EEOC was intended to
be the advocate for workers against biased employers. As the agency
matured, its enforcement powers and mandate were strengthened by both
Congress and the executive branch. By the late 1970s, the EEOC was the
lead agency in coordinating all federal equal employment policies and
procedures.

        As chairman, Judge Thomas took numerous positions which weakened the
EEOC's commitment to enforcement of the law and proved inimical to the
rights of workers. For example, in several cases under the Age

                                                                   -3-
                                     877

Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) -- intended by Congress to outlaw
discrimination against older workers -- Judge Thomas urged the Commission
to side with employers, or not to litigate on behalf of victims, despite
overwhelming evidence of discrimination. He proposed regulatory measures
under the ADEA that limited the scope of its protections. In addition, the
agency allowed possibly over 13,000 age discrimination complaints to lapse
by failing to investigate them before the two-year time limit ran out for
filing suit in federal court. Congress bailed him out by extending the
time limit for such cases. However, Judge Thomas still failed to act
responsibly to correct the problem. He allowed several thousand more ADEA
complaints to expire, again requiring Congress to intervene.

        In addition, Judge Thomas effectively dismantled the agency's systemic
litigation operations, a component of EEOC litigation to combat broad,
institutional patterns and practices of discrimination. In an agency
reorganization, he split the systemic unit among several divisions, which
resulted in the unit's loss of Independence and power. In March 1985, a
bipartisan group of forty-three members of the House of Representatives
wrote that a retreat from systemic litigation "would be in direct contra-
diction of the original intent of Congress" in passage of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and the 1972 amendments and would result in the agency losing
important tools of enforcement.

        Judge Thomas also sought to dilute EEOC rules that were the collabora-
tive product of five federal agencies. The rules, known as the Uniform
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, bar employers from using
hiring practices that effectively hinder the employment of qualified women
and minorities. He often stated that the rules subverted the intent of
Title VII, even though they were consistently supported by Congress. Judge
Thomas dropped his plans after House members criticized them.

        In the area of affirmative action to remedy past discrimination, Judge
Thomas abandoned the agency's longstanding policy of encouraging the use of
goals and timetables for hiring qualified women and minorities, despite
approval of their use by Congress and all of the courts of appeals
addressing the issue. Only when the Supreme Court issued three decisions
upholding the policy did Judge Thomas reluctantly agree to reinstate it.
However, he continued to send contrary messages to victims and to the
business community by publicly and repeatedly criticizing affirmative
action. Finally, Judge Thomas abdicated all responsibility for enforcing
the EEO laws in the federal government, the nation's largest employer, by
issuing an order that shifted the responsibility to agency heads, some of
whom, such as then-Attorney General Ed Meese, balked at complying with
federal sector affirmative action plans.

        Judge Thomas' lack of respect for the rule of law was such that in
June 1989, the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations sent a letter to
President Bush questioning Thomas' qualifications for a federal judgeship.
It stated that "people cannot properly take an oath to enforce certain laws
and, once in office, work consistently to undermine them." In addition,
fourteen chairs and high-ranking members of committees in the House of
Representatives with oversight responsibility for the EEOC wrote to the
U.S. Senate in July 1989 that Judge Thomas' "questionable enforcement
record frustrates the intent and purpose" of Title VII of the 1964

                                                           -4-
                                 878

Civil Rights Act and that he had "demonstrated an overall disdain for the
rule of law."

HOSTILITY TOWARDS CONGRESS

        Concerns about Judge Thomas' open-mindedness are compounded by his
contempt for the role of Congress as it has evolved over 200 hundred years.
Almost from the start of his tenure at the EEOC, Thomas attacked members of
Congress. Instead of seeking to work with Congress and the public, Thomas
created a climate completely counterproductive to forging new approaches to
eliminating employment discrimination.

        The nominee's hostility towards Congress is starkly reflected in his
writings and speeches. In a 1988 speech at Wake Forest University, Thomas
accused Congress of being "an enormous obstacle to the positive enforcement
of civil rights laws that protect individual freedom." Thomas stated that
Congress is actually run by subcommittee members and zealous staff members
who, "in obscure meetings, . . . browbeat, threaten and harass agency heads
to follow their lead." He adds that Congress no longer stands for a
deliberative body which legislates for the common good or public interest.

        In a 1989 law review article, Judge Thomas condemned Congress for
examining potential abuses of power by the executive branch, stating that
the legislature is "out of control" and that "numerous congressional
investigations in recent years . . . seem little more than attempts to
embarrass the White House." (Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, vol.
12, no. 1.)

        Judge Thomas' disrespect for the rule of law and hostility towards
Congress raises serious questions about his understanding of the separation
of powers and his qualifications to interpret statutory laws. On the
Court, Judge Thomas will be called upon to revisit precedents and decide
many issues involving legislative intent on numerous federal statutes
protecting the environment, consumers, public health and safety, and civil
rights. His EEOC record and writings and speeches indicate that he is
likely to bring his own personal views to bear on those issues, rather than
a loyalty to the law.

CONCLUSION: THE NEED FOR MODERATION

        For the American people to have faith in the Supreme Court, the Court
must be perceived as a balanced, open-minded institution. With the
departure of Justice Marshall and the nomination of Judge Thomas, the
American people face the prospect of a monolithic Court dominated by
conservative philosophy lasting well into the twenty-first century. That
prospect must not materialize. It is time for the Senate to draw the line
and insist that the Court reflect the rich texture and complexity of
American society itself.

        Contrary to public announcements, both the Reagan and Bush
Administrations have sought to appoint judges intent on making law rather
than interpreting it. Their success thus far was illustrated by the 1990
term, which revealed a Court all too eager to abandon prior precedent in
order to advance the Reagan-Bush conservative platform.

                                                           -5-
                                     879

        The Court's deferential philosophy presents a grave danger to the
rights upon which Americans have come to rely. The judiciary is the only
branch of government able to ensure that the liberties of all Americans are
protected, including those who do not always have a voice in shaping the
policies of Congress and the executive branch. The Court must be more than
a compliant, politicized arm of the executive branch. By insisting that
the President appoint an individual who will bring moderation to the Court,
the Senate can ensure that the Court will remain independent and will
reflect the diversity of viewpoints representative of American society.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Ms. Hernandez.
   Mr. Lucy.

                      STATEMENT OF WILLIAM LUCY

   Mr. LUCY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
My name is William Lucy. I am here today as president of the Coa-
lition of Black Trade Unionists, an organization of rank-and-file
members of trade unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO. I am here to
urge that the damage, the past injustices, and the insensitivity
heaped upon workers in general and black workers in particular
who sought redress and fairness before Mr. Thomas as a policy
maker and implementor will not be disregarded.

  For the past week, you have questioned the nominee. Like many
of you, I sat while Mr. Thomas asked to be given high marks for
his personal achievements, to be forgiven for his omissions, and for
you to totally ignore any shortcomings in his record.

  The American Bar Association, from among the options avail-
able, chose to designate Mr. Thomas as "qualified." While this is
no small achievement, this rating for a Supreme Court vacancy
would not be acceptable in a colorblind process. If "qualified" or
"average" becomes acceptable, let us all understand that it is ac-
ceptable only because the candidate is black and replacing a black.

  As we review some of Mr. Thomas' speeches and writings, we
must be concerned about his views, views such as those expressed
in his article in the Yale Law and Policy Review. Mr. Thomas
wrote:

   I continue to believe that distributing opportunities on the basis of race or gender,
whoever the beneficiaries, turns the law against employment discrimination on its
head. Class preferences are an affront to the rights and dignity of individuals, both
those individuals who are directly disadvantaged by them and those who are their
supposed beneficiaries.

  While it is clearly possible for the nominee to be misquoted or
misunderstood, Mr. Thomas' views in this case can't be faulted for
lack of clarity. His is the bedrock argument used by those who
raise the cry of reverse discrimination. It seems to me that you
cannot hold the notion of reverse discrimination without accepting
the fact of basic discrimination, which is what the EEOC was cre-
ated to deal with.

  And yet, while chairman of that agency, Mr. Thomas put far
more emphasis on reverse discrimination than on its unavoidable
root. According to Mr. Thomas, and I again quote,

  The government cannot correct the wrongs of the past. There is no government
solution to ending discrimination and we should not attempt to remedy longstand-
ing, historic cases of discrimination against a group of people.

  These words lead only to the conclusion that he does not believe
that government should step in to help injured parties in cases of
systematic and institutional discrimination, that individuals must
seek legal redress strictly on their own.

  Mr. Thomas cannot possibly believe that black people, women or
other ethnic groups suffer systematic discrimination as individuals.
His statement opposing class action remedies strongly suggests
that he believes that institutions should not be held accountable
for their discriminatory behavior and should not be forced by gov-
ernment to change that behavior. Mr. Thomas leaves us with this
                                      881

absurdity: a wrong that affects millions should be dealt with on a
one-by-one basis.

  We further believe that Mr. Thomas has demonstrated a striking
lack of understanding of women workers. His belief that women
decide to fill jobs of lower status and lower pay than men in order
to accommodate family life reflects a total lack of understanding of
the realities of working women, and particularly those single par-
ents who head households.

  Women today, and particularly black women, are not exercising
an option when they go to work. They work because they have to,
and every dollar taken from them by gender-based wage discrimi-
nation denies them economic justice. The failure of the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission under Mr. Thomas' leadership
to even investigate thousands of complaints alleging gender-based
wage discrimination in violation of the Equal Pay Act and Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act reflects flagrant disregard for the serious
problems that Congress had sought to remedy.

  Assuming Mr. Thomas believes what he says that government
cannot correct the wrongs of the past and that there is no govern-
ment solution to ending discrimination in the workplace, as a black
male I have a difficult time and would have a difficult time placing
before Mr. Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice the most critical
question affecting blacks and other minorities--economic exploita-
tion and systematic denial of opportunity.

  During the last 10 or 12 years, we have witnessed implementa-
tion of policies designed to roll back progress towards the equality
that our Nation achieved at great cost. In the course of this re-
treat, millions of hard-working Americans, without regard to sex,
age, race or creed have sought the protection of the EEOC only to
become frustrated by appointees who refuse to carry out the mis-
sion that Congress assigned the agency.

  Mr. Chairman, you and members of this committee must evalu-
ate a man who either did things he did not believe in or believed in
things he did not do. Whichever the case, many workers have paid
a high price in consequence.

  Mr. Chairman, if the EEOC had been headed by a conservative
who was white who so singly failed to uphold the mandate of that
agency, that person's name would not be before you today as a
nominee.

  Thank you.

BEFORE THE

         UNITED STATES SENATE
COMMITTEE O N THE JUDICIARY

SEPTEMBER 1 9 , 1 9 9 1
                                        883

       Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
I am William Lucy, President of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists (CBTU) and
Secretary-Treasurer of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal
Employees (AFSCME). I am extremely pleased to have this opportunity to come before
you today to share my thoughts on the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the
U.S. Supreme Court

       I am here representing the views of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists. The
CBTU represents the views of concerned workers, but particularly Black workers. We
decided to oppose this nomination for a number of reasons. Most importantly, we
believe mat as a Supreme Court Justice, Judge Thomas would not act in die best
interest of the working men and women in this country, particularly Black workers.
His questionable public record as an official at the Department of Education and as
Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), his limited
judicial qualifications, his numerous writings and speeches, indeed his entire
professional background, leave us with uneasy feelings about what his confirmation
could mean for the men and women we represent. Moreover, we believe that the
content of his character is of grave importance - not the color of his skin or the
numerous barriers he has overcome to reach his current status in life. All of this is
of little consequence in determining his qualifications to sit on the Supreme Court.

        Once we take a closer, more objective look into the public record of Judge
Clarence Thomas, which Mr. Chairman, you spent the better part of last week doing,
we must now ask ourselves what he actually accomplished as an official at the
                                        884

Department of Education and die EEOC. I believe an examination of his public record
and indeed his testimony last week reveal that he did not carry out his agencies'
mandates. Instead Judge Thomas ran the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) at the
Department of Education and the EEOC, based on his own opinions and philosophy,
not on prevailing law. If we find that my belief is true, that his public record is so
unsatisfactory, then we have to ask ourselves, "why are we, in effect, rewarding him
for poor performance and why are we even considering this man for a seat on the
Supreme Court?" Judge Thomas must be held accountable for what I believe is an
unsavory record.

       Judge Thomas went to the OCR in May of 1981. At the OCR Judge Thomas was
charged with enforcing laws barring discrimination in education. It was his
responsibility to enforce the laws that require institutions receiving federal funds to
refrain from discriminating on the basis of race, sex or disability. Before Judge
Thomas' arrival civil rights groups had successfully filed a court suit, Adams v. Bell
against the Department (then HEW), resulting in a settlement requiring the OCR to
investigate complaints, conduct compliance reviews and initiate enforcement action in
accordance with specific time frames. This settlement set the atmosphere in which
die OCR was mandated to operate.

       Judge Thomas did not follow the terms of the settlement and admitted that he
was violating the court-ordered requirements for processing civil rights cases. A
hearing was held to investigation Judge Thomas' failure to comply with the court
                                        885

order. When the judge asked Judge Thomas: .

        "...But you 'regoing ahead and violating those time frames; isn't that true? You 're
        violating them in compliance reviews on all occasions, practically, and you're
        violating them on complaints most of the time, or half the time; isn't that true?

Judge Thomas responded:
        That's right

Judge asked:
        5b aren'tyou, in effect substitutingyour judgmentas to whatdie policy should be
        for whatthe court order requires? Thecourt order requires you to complywith
        this 90-day period; isnt mat true?

Judge Thomas responded:
        That's right.."

        Ultimately, a federal judge cited that the OCR was guilty of misinterpreting and
inadequately enforcing Tide DC,the statute which prohibits gender discrimination in
federally-funded education programs and institutions. Judge Thomas' tenure at the
OCR resulted in students being assigned to classes for the mentally retarded because
of their race or national origin, a suspension of the processing of improper job
discrimination complaints against me handicapped by universities and, long delays in
                                        886

the handling of discrimination complaints.

       Judge Thomas brought his own perception of the law and established policy
with him to the EEOC. It was Judge Thomas' responsibility at the EEOC to enforce
federal laws that prohibit employment discrimination on die basis of sex, race, national
origin, religion, and age. Judge Thomas, however, ran the EEOC based on his own
opinions and philosophy and not on the prevailing law. He ignored the authority given
the EEOC to vigorously attack widespread institutional patterns and practices of
discrimination in the workplace. Instead, he eliminated or attempted to eliminatefrom
the Commission proven mechanisms for enforcing federal antidiscrimination law.

       Particularly troubling about Judge Thomas' tenure at the EEOC is his attempt
to weaken the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures which are based
on a unanimous decision by the Supreme Court in Grigps v. Duke Power Company in
1971. These guidelines were designed to help employers comply with federal
antidiscrimination laws when implementing tests for the purposes of hiring and
promotions. Griggs prohibits the use of employment criteria that have a disparate
impact on women and minority workers x>r applicants unless the criteria are proven
to be job-related. Griggs has played a critical role in removing barriers that have
historically limited job opportunities for women and minorities. Fortunately, criticism
by certain Members of Congress prevented Judge Thomas from weakening the
guidelines.
                                        887

        Judge Thomas criticized the EEOC's reliance on class action litigation and
severely weakened the litigation unit at the EEOC specifically created to address
systematic discrimination in the workplace. He reduced the number of attorney's
assigned to this unit by half. And, he eliminated the system for identifying systemic
cases. In 1980, before Judge Thomas arrived at the EEOC, the Commission filed 218
class action suits. In 1989, Judge Thomas' last year at the EEOC, the Commission filed
only 129 class action suits. Judge Thomas wrote in the Yale Law and Public Policy
Review in 1987, in an article "Affirmative Action Goals and Time tobies: Too Tough?
Not Tough Enough!" that "emphasis on 'systemic' suits led the Commission (prior to
his appointment) to overlook many individuals who came before their offices to file
charges and seek assistance."

        Unfortunately, Judge Thomas also relaxed its enforcement of individual cases
at the EEOC. Under Judge Thomas individuals were unlikely to receive any type of
remedy to their claims. In fact, in 1980 settlement rates were over 30 percent while
in 1989, under Judge Thomas, settlement rates were down to 14 percent. Cases were
inadequately investigated and the number of cases where the claimant received no
remedy at all doubled. A 1988 General Accounting Office study found that this
change in the Commission's success rate was due to cases not being fully investigated.
Basically, people were denied their rights under the law to have discrimination claims
adequately investigated.

                                        888

       Judge Thomas has also repeatedly questioned the effectiveness of affirmative
action policies. He used his position at the EEOC to dismantle affirmative action
programs which had proven to be effective and which helped to protect the rights of
women and minorities from discriminatory practices in the workplace.
The use of goals and timetables for the training, hiring, and assigning or promoting
of qualified women and minorities was an important aspect of the EEOC affirmative
action program. In 1984, Judge Thomas announced that the EEOC would discontinue
its use of goals and timetables. He did so in spite of substantial evidence that goals
and timetables had benefitted women and minorities and in spite of several Supreme
Court decisions upholding the use of goals and timetables. During his reconfirmation
hearings as EEOC chair, Judge Thomas promised to discontinue his attack on goals
and timetables. He returned to the EEOC and continued his attack on the
Commission's affirmative action policies including goals and timetables. Judge
Thomas wrote in a publication titled "Assessing the Reagan Years," in 1988, that "I am
confident it can be shown, and some of my staff are now working on this question, that
blacks at any level, especially white collar employees, have simply not benefitted from
affirmative action policies as they have developed."

       Judge Thomas' record shows that although he had sworn to uphold the
prevailing laws against employment discrimination, he continued to write and give
speeches showing his opposition to affirmative action. Judge Thomas also continued
to criticize important Supreme Court decisions dealing with combatting discrimination
in the workplace.
                                       889

        UnitedSteelWorkers v.Weber (1979) is aparticularly important decision because
it encourages and allows employers to take voluntary action to correct past
discriminatory practices without employees or the government entering into litigation.
Judge Thomas in five speeches in 1982 and 1983 supported the decision in Weber.
Then in a speech in 1987 to the Cato Institute, Judge Thomas announced that he
disagreed with the Court's findings in Weber. Judge Thomas flipped-flopped on one
of the most important Supreme Court decisions dealing with discrimination in the
workplace.

        In FuHilove v. Klutznick (1980) the court held that Congress had a constitutional
right to correct past discrimination by passing appropriate legislation. The case dealt
with a set-aside program enacted by Congress to alleviate historic discrimination
against minorities in the construction industries. The Court found that Congress'
response was appropriate in enacting the set-aside program in response to proven
charges that minorily businesses had historically been denied contracting opportunities
because of unfair procurement practices. Judge Thomas criticized the decision in a
paper titled Assessing the Reagan Years in 1988 by saying:

        "the Court reinterpreted civil rights laws to create schemes of racial preference
        where none was ever contemplated."
                                        890

        Judge Thomas also criticized Johnson v. Transportation Agency. Santa Clara
County (1987), where the Supreme Court upheld Santa Clara County's voluntary
affirmative action program which was implemented to correct historic
underrepresentation by women in certain well paying jobs. The Court said that the
county's plan to consider gender and ethnicity when choosing among qualified
candidates was acceptable when these groups were underrepresented. Judge Thomas
wrote in a New York Times article titled, "Anger and Elation at Ruling on Affirmative
Action,":

         "It's just social engineering, and we ought to see it for what it is. I don't think
         the ends justify the means, and we're standing the principle of
         nondiscrimination on its head - it's simple as that - and we're standing the
         legislative history of Title VII on its head."

         In Local 28. Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC (1986), the court held that race
conscious remedies such as goals and timetables may be used to correct intentional
racial discrimination. The case involved flagrant and long-standing intentional
discrimination against Black workers as well as a disregard of federal court orders.
Early in 1987, Judge Thomas appeared to agree with the decision. Later that year
Judge Thomas grouped Sheetmetal Workers with Weber and subsequent cases all
together saying that they were all mistaken applications of Tide VII. Judge Thomas
later wrote in a 1987 law review article,
                                         891

       "I continue to believe that distributing opportunities on the basis of race or
       gender, whoever the beneficiaries, turns the law against employment
       discrimination on it head...I think that preferential hiring on the basis of race
       or gender will increase racial divisiveness, disempower women and minorities
       by fostering the notion that they are permanently disabled and in need of
       handouts, and delay the day when skin color and gender are truly the least
       important things about a person in the employment context."

       Judge Thomas also brought a strong and inappropriate pro-business bias to his
role as Chairman of the EEOC. When elderly employees of the Clorox Corporation
came before the EEOC because they were being fired and replaced with younger,
lower paid workers, Judge Thomas refused to investigate their complaints. He said,
"This is a standard practice in industry." It may have been standard practice in
industry, but EEOC regulations clearly state that economic necessity is not a legal
justification for such a practice. Judge Thomas, therefore, chose to ignore the
Commission's own regulations while placing his opinions before the law.

       The elderly suffered many undo hardships under Judge Thomas at the EEOC.
He sat on over 13,000 age discrimination cases until Congress found it necessary to
rescue these victims of age discrimination. The EEOC, under Judge Thomas, also
failed to rescind regulations that allowed employers to stop making pension
contributions for workers over the age of 65. Congress stepped in to pass a law
                                       892

specifically requiring employers to make pension contributions for employees over age
65. The EEOC continued its insensitivity towards older workers by failing to issue
the regulations after Congress passed remedial legislation.

       Judge Thomas' record shows a deep insensitivity towards the rights of the
elderly in the workplace. He failed to enforce federal age discrimination laws while
taking positions even in defiance of the Congress, which went against the economic
interests of older workers.

       We must take a close look at Judge Thomas' personal opinions when examining
his policy decisions. His opinions on women are particularly insightful when
reviewing his policies towards women at the OCR and the EEOC. Judge Thomas
embraced an analysis of working women, written by a right wing academic, that denies
the existence of sex discrimination and rejects the notion that such discrimination
plays a part in women working in lower paying, lower status jobs. This analysis
suggested that women were in jobs of lower pay and lower status than men because
they made decisions about employment in order to accommodate their roles as wives
and mothers, and, further, that any inequities which exist between men and women
in the workforce are due to women's behavior -- opting for jobs which allow them
more flexibility. The analysis went on to say that Black women did better in the work
force than white women, a notion which is totally incorrect. Judge Thomas told
readers of the November 1987 issue of Reason Magazine that, "I consider the author

                                                        10
                                       893

of this concept not only an intellectual mentor, but my salvation as far as thinking
through these issues." Judge Thomas went on to say in the Lincoln Review in 1988 that
the above-mentioned analysis on working women is:

        "...a useful concise discussion of discrimination faced by women. We will not
        attempt to summarize it except to note that by analyzing all the statistics and
        examining the role of marriage on wage-earning for both men and women, the
        author presents a much-needed antidote to cliches about women's earnings
        and professional status."

        Mr. Chairman, women in our society today, most women, and Black women
particularly, work out of necessity, not because they are exercising an option. Judge
Thomas apparently is not aware of this fact. I am alarmed that someone who believes
that gender discrimination does not exist may sit on the Supreme Court and judge sex
discrimination cases which may come before the Court.

        It is from this point of reference, or perhaps this lack of understanding about
a fundamental aspect of the lives of working women, which we must view Judge
Thomas' disturbing public record on women in the workplace. The EEOC, under
Judge Thomas' leadership, rejected the concept of "pay equity" eliminating the hopes
of many women in seeking comparable pay with their male counterparts. Major labor
unions took Judge Thomas to task in an effort to remedy discrimination based on sex.

                                                        11
                                        894

His failure to investigate large numbers of complaints alleging gender-based wage
discrimination in violation of the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, prolonged the exploitation of millions of working women.

       Judge Thomas' actions were particularly harmful to women of color, particularly
Black women, who are often crowded in die lower paying, female dominated jobs.
Federal civil rights laws provide the necessary means for addressing this inequity. The
EEOC, under Judge Thomas, did not adequately enforce the applicable laws. In fact,
wage discrimination complaints were mishandled and many were not investigated at
all.

       As a representative of working men and women of this country, particularly
Black working men and women, I am extremely disturbed by Judge Thomas' record
with regards to fair employment and equal opportunity for women, the elderly and
racial and ethnic minorities. The thought that government should not intervene on
behalf of all working people does not reflect the true story of the labor movement in
this country.

       Judge Thomas' record shows us that he does not have a commitment to equal
justice under the law and he does not endorse equal employment opportunities. I do
not see anything in his record that convinces me that Judge Thomas should be
confirmed to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court -- not his ABA rating, not his performance

                                                        12
                                       895

at the Department of Education, and certainly not at the EEOC. I reject Judge Thomas'
assertion that we should not judge him on his record, a record that has damaged the
lives of so many people who were victims of discrimination. I, therefore, urge the
members of the Committee to reject the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the
U.S. Supreme Court.

       Thank you.

                                      896

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you all very much. Mr. Chambers, let me
begin with you, if I may. It was obviously a comprehensive brief
filed with the committee. You say on page 8--and I realize you
didn't have the opportunity to read all that is in here, but I had a
chance to read it.

   You said,

   It is argued in support of Judge Thomas that he is merely a judicial philosophy,
but these and other similar remarks are not judicial and involve no philosophy.

Judge Thomas does not reach these conclusions,

  Referencing things you have said in the previous seven pages,

  By any general legal methodology that might be characterized as conservative or
by any methodology that could plausibly be characterized as legal at all. There is no
analysis of the language of relevant statutory constitutional provisions or regula-
tions, no discussions of precedent, no consideration of Congressional debates or re-
ports, no evaluation of experience of lower courts. There is in these and other state-
ments no pretense that Judge Thomas arrived at his conclusion by conventional
legal analysis. His evaluation of legal decisions follows directly from his personal
ideological preferences about the matter at issue.

  Now, let me ask you, does not that lend credibility to his asser-
tion that these were just musings of a--how does he phrase it, part-
time political theorist, and that they were not notions that were
born out of a view of the Constitution that would lead him to those
conclusions by applying whatever methodology he has to the Con-
stitution?

  Mr. CHAMBERS. Mr. Chairman, I think they would suggest more a
lack of appreciation by the candidate on the proper basis for going
through, analyzing legal judicial issues. What we get when present-
ed with a number of facts--and when we look at history and when
we look at where Congress, for example, in the voting rights area
goes through and says that based on this evidence, it is imperative
that we enact an effects test in the voting rights area, he condemns
it without any kind of analysis.

  And rather than talk about whether it is just a muse, I think
more it is a question about the candidate's ability or judicial quali-
fications for serving as a Justice of the Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. In exhibit A that you submitted, you indicated
that each of the Justices--and exhibit A, for the record, is a listing
beginning with Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who served on the
Court from 1902 to 1932, going all the way up through Justice
Souter.

  Mr. CHAMBERS. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. And you list the qualifications as they are from
your perspective of Judge Thomas.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, you said each of these people possessed two
qualifications, and I thought I was listening closely. I didn't hear
what those two qualifications were.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. They differed. We have in footnote 5 on page 12
of the submitted text listed 7 of the important qualifications we
think that the nominees--each of the nominees possessed at least 2
of these qualifications.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Mr. CHAMBERS. They are identified in footnote 5 on page 12.
                                         897

  The CHAIRMAN. A substantial law practice either in the private
or the public sector generally covering more than 10 years. You
would suggest he does not have that, I assume.

   Mr. CHAMBERS. That is correct.
   The CHAIRMAN. Extensive legal scholarship or teaching; you
would argue he does not possess that. Significant experience as a
judge generally for five or more years; he clearly does not have
that. The highest level of expertise in a particular area of law; he
does not argue that.
   Mr. CHAMBERS. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. Superior intellect. You have made a subjective
judgment that he does not possess that, is that correct?
   Mr. CHAMBERS. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. Ability to persuade and lead; generally outstand-
ing achievement over the course of his career. "These are, in our
view," quoting your report in footnote 5, "the most important
qualifications to stand out in reviewing the more than 120-year
span by the legal careers of 20th century judges."

   I understand what you are saying now.
   Let me go to you, Ms. Hernandez. You make a very telling point
that all the focus, at least all of my focus on the equal protection
clause in these hearings has related to the question of whether or
not he was using that to avoid dealing with whether or not single
individuals had a right to privacy. I think it is important for the
record that you restate it. You raise the point that since many
people that you represent are not American citizens and are, to use
your phrase, if I am not mistaken, undocumented aliens, that argu-
ably, based on his view of the equal protection clause, they would--
to put it in laymen's terms, not be equally protected under the
Constitution as American citizens are protected. Is that the point
you are making?

   Ms. HERNANDEZ. Well, it is even more than that, and let me re-
state it. The benefits and privileges guaranteed by the Constitution
differ, and there are different protections whether you are a citi-
zen, whether you a legal resident alien, and whether you are non-
documented individual. And the equal protection, if you look at the
14th amendment, there are two clauses, and very little attention is
given to those clauses. One is the equal protection that clearly says
every person, and then it goes to

   The CHAIRMAN. And your argument is that he relies more on
privileges and immunities, which applies to American citizens?

   Ms. HERNANDEZ. Only. And in reading some of his writings, if
you understand, he would--and he argues that Brown, too--he
doesn't quarrel with the conclusion of the Brown decision. He quar-
rels with the reliance of the Court on the equal protection. He feels
that it should rather be the privilege or immunities clause. And if
you carry that argument through its conclusion and if his view
were to prevail, the impact to the immigrant community, whether
they be Asian, Hispanic, Ethiopian, Polish, whatever, will be signif-
icant, because the privilege or immunity says "every citizen." And
as you know, the Supreme Court has just ruled on a case involving
Hispanics and the issue of citizenship.

   It is an issue that comes up quite a bit for our community.
                                      898
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, my time is up. Let me ask you this ques-
tion. I realize that--well, I won't characterize it. Let me ask you
this question. When he made the two speeches that I am aware of
where he talks about the privileges and immunities clause being of
greater consequence than it has been recognized to be, from his
perspective, and when he argues that its application in Brown
would have been appropriate, do you believe that his argument was
based on and that he understood that its application might ex-
clude--following his logic, exclude individuals who are not Ameri-
can citizens? Or do you believe he was just making a point to sus-
tain his overall argument relative to black America and desegrega-
tion? Or does it matter?
  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Well, one, I do not know. Two, it does not
matter. If a certain individual places such importance on those
matters which are critical to the interpretation of law and does not
think through the implications that that would have to a broad-
based, diverse community that this country is, then I would ques-
tion, once again, the qualifications of that individual to say such
matters. And I would urge that this issue be further looked into
because, from my community's perspective, it is an additional
factor that very directly impacts our community.
  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate your testimony and your answering
my questions.
  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Let me reserve my time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  I want to join in welcoming this panel of witnesses. They have
been in the vanguard of so many important efforts to ensure our
freedoms and our equalities. I have had, as other members of the
panel, the good opportunity to work with many of them for over a
very considerable period of time, and this country is in debt to
many of them for all of their tireless work on behalf of the Bill of
Rights and the Constitution.
  Mr. Chambers, you are aware of the time restraints that we
have. I would like to cover a few areas. Judge Thomas criticized
some of the Supreme Court decisions, primarily in the areas of
voting rights. We had an exchange with him there. It was really
unclear from the exchange what he was really driving at.
  In your own study, were you able to determine the nature of the
criticisms and the value of the criticisms of Supreme Court hold-
ings, particularly in regard to the voting rights cases?
  Mr. CHAMBERS. Senator Kennedy, the best that we have been
able to determine was his statement here that he disapproved of
the effects test and he disapproved of the types of districting or
remedies that the courts were directing in voting rights cases.
  It wasn't clear why he disapproves of the effects test except his
continued questioning of the possible use of statistics to establish a
violation. And under the effects test, if one demonstrates that a
certain practice results in a deprivation, one makes that showing
frequently through the use of statistics.
  In terms of the remedy, the remedies, of course, of the record
have been the only ones the courts have found effective. Exactly
why he disapproves of those remedies, again, unless he is raising
                                      899
some question about race, it isn't clear--under any circumstance.
Again, this goes to his qualifications, I think.

  He offers no alternative. He concedes that blacks have been de-
prived of voting opportunities. He concedes that the Senate and the
Congress were looking at real practices when it was necessary to
enact the 1972 amendments, and yet offers no remedy that would
provide meaningful opportunities for minorities to participate in
the electoral process.

  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Rauh, you have been very much involved,
as most of the panel has, in the fashioning and shaping of various
civil rights legislation. The key element of all of the legislation are
remedies.

  Going back to I guess even the 1957 Act, maybe even go back
even further, but the importance of remedies in ensuring that the
rights are going to be achieved and his approach as a case-by-case
means, where would we really be if we had used a case-by-case ap-
proach in the various important pieces of legislation which have
been accepted by the country, that had bipartisan support? When
you look at public accommodations, the housing, the voting rights,
the whole range of difference, where would we be as a society if we
accepted or the Supreme Court accepted that route to try and
remedy the discrimination in our society?

  Mr. RAUH. We wouldn't have the right to vote in any serious
sense. What happened in 1957 was, because it was on an individual
basis, the law failed even though we all supported it because we
wanted a civil rights law. In 1960 and 1964 there was tinkering,
but it was always on a retail basis.

  The whole thing changed in 1965 when it was on a wholesale
basis. What happened in the 1965 law was that they said the Fed-
eral Government will register the people if these States continue to
discriminate. The whole problem--I think one of the witnesses said
it this morning. The distinction between wholesale and retail en-
forcement of the civil rights law is the distinction between success
and failure.

  Senator KENNEDY. MS. Hernandez, it is good to see you back here
again, and I commend you for your testimony.

  The point that Judge Thomas makes--and I don't know whether
Mr. Lucy will make a comment on this--is that given his particu-
lar background, he has a particular sensitivity. I mean, no one
really disputes what has been an extraordinary life experience
which he has had and admire his own personal determinations for
self-improvement.

  But you, Ms. Hernandez and Mr. Lucy, why doesn't that in and
of itself--I think there are probably millions of Americans who
have been watching these hearings and say, well, that is right, that
will give him an insight in terms of the concerns for whether it is
women, women of color, or minorities. Why doesn't that kind of
emphasis or that kind of thrust give you a sense of confidence as to
how the nominee might vote on questions of equal protection?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Well, they haven't to date, and I must say that
it is most commendable. Most Americans can relate to the strides,
to the efforts, to the determination. I myself as an immigrant am
familiar with that.
                                      900
  But one must look to the person and what he or she has done
with that experience, and to date he doesn't have a clean slate. He
has been in positions of power. He has been in positions of author-
ity. He has been in a position to influence policy in a way that it
would impact other people similarly situated. And we have the
record on what he has done in those instances.
  Mr. LUCY. I would certainly have to, Senator, support what was
just said. In his public record as a public official, as a policymaker
or policy implementor, he has never shown the kinds of sensitivity
that ought to flow out of that past experience.
  One of the Senators earlier on mentioned the fact that the polls
show his--not necessarily approval rating but openmindedness
waiting to hear. By and large, minorities want to be fair. But when
you look at the record, his record doesn't suggest that he under-
stands that.
  I think, as he indicated, he believes discrimination exists. I think
he is honest about that. But I think he believes it exists as it im-
pacts on individuals as opposed to on groups.
  I would so eagerly want to say to him, Senator, that when the
sign said "No Irish Need Apply," that didn't mean Mr. O'Reilly or
Mr. O'Rourke. That meant all. And he doesn't seem to grasp that
even coming out of his own background. His resistance to class
action remedies for the purpose of changing behavior strongly sug-
gests that he thinks it is an individual personal situation.
  Senator KENNEDY. My time is up, and I promise I won't ask a
question of the next panel if I can ask Mr. Lucy the last one. But
he will, I imagine, point out that the Constitution protects individ-
uals, not groups.
  Mr. LUCY. Well, certainly you would think that he would be
aware of that in his own role and would have made more effort in
his policymaking role to really apply the class action pursuit that
had been given to them under the authority of the EEOC.
  I would only add, Senator, that on the trade union side we are
representing those who theoretically come through as beneficiaries
of this entire civil rights-equal opportunity set of laws.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Welcome to this panel. I know many of you and have worked
with many of you. And I have disagreed with many of you. I have
always enjoyed that, and I mean that. Antonia Hernandez, you and
I worked long and hard with the immigration issues, and I think
that we would both agree that we have been fair with each other
and always direct. And I have great respect and rich regard for
you.
  And I have known John Buchanan for many years. I do not
know the other folks as well, but I know, indeed, of your reputation
as well and have had you testifying here, the chairman has.
  So you speak powerfully in opposition to Clarence Thomas. I un-
derstand that. I guess I would ask a question of Ms. Hernandez be-
cause I know her well. We have worked together on serious issues
with immigration reform, illegal immigration. We have often, as I
say, disagreed, but we have done so in a very honest and candid
                                      901
and straightforward manner. And yet one part of your testimony
caught my eye.

  On page 6, it was the point of--you state, "Clarence Thomas' op-
position to affirmative action is based on his belief that the Consti-
tution must in all circumstances be colorblind." You then recite a
number of cases you believe would be overturned if Clarence
Thomas were on the Supreme Court.

  My question is this: What is wrong with a colorblind society? Is
that not what we have been seeking in this quest for perfection for
decades?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. YOU are absolutely right. That is what we have
been seeking and that is what I, more than anyone, want to have a
society where the color of my skin or the gender is not an impor-
tant factor, but my character.

  The fact of the matter is that we are not dealing in a perfect
world and we are dealing with a society that still has discrimina-
tion, it is much more difficult, it is much more subtle, and we must
deal with societal discrimination.

  The interesting thing--you were not here when I mentioned it--
is I know Clarence very well. I worked with him when he was in
the AK. I discussed his philosophy and point of view and his oppo-
sition to class remedies and tried to come up, as you know, I tried
to come up with ways to deal and come up with solutions and ways
we could prepare society and the legal profession in dealing on a
one-to-one basis.

  It is OK to believe in the goal of equality. It is not OK not to face
reality and understand the discrimination that exists and attempt
to deal with it. I am sometimes troubled by how we as a society
zero in on this whole issue of dealing with problems on an individ-
ual basis when it deals with discrimination, and not dealing with
situations on an individual basis in other matters.

  When you deal with the banking situation, you don't say, well,
we are going to deal with, you know, fraud or mismanagement or
problems in regulation on a one-to-one situation. You look at what
is causing the problem, you see if it is systemic, you see if it is
larger than that one situation, and you pass policies so that it
doesn't happen. Yet, when you are dealing with discrimination, all
of a sudden it has to be 1 on 1 as it comes up and not having the
systems to deal with those fortunate enough to go to an AK or to
other agencies who protect their rights.

  Senator SIMPSON. We have heard Martin Luther King's name
brought into this debate over these days many times, on both sides,
interestingly enough, but the greatest civil rights leader, I think
many would agree, was Dr. Martin Luther King and he asked only
that he and his children be judged "based on the content of their
character, and not on the color of their skin," and isn't what he
was asking for was a colorblind judgment, and isn't that just exact-
ly what Judge Thomas is advocating?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. I also advocate that, but the fact of the matter
is that we do not have that today and we must deal with that.

  Senator SIMPSON. I think Judge Thomas has said that. But to
have him criticized on that basis, I don't understand that. That es-
capes me. I think that is what people have been talking about.

  Well, did you set a quick clock on me?
                                         902

   The CHAIRMAN. We sure did. We gave everyone else 15 minutes,
and you 5. [Laughter.]

   No, Senator, we are giving everyone 5 minutes.
   Senator SIMPSON. Oh, it is because Howard is done, is that it?
  The CHAIRMAN. That's it. [Laughter.]
   Senator SIMPSON. Well, I will come back. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  Welcome to the panel. I appreciate the effort that you put in in
analyzing this Judge, I must say, you have spent more time study-
ing his opinions than I have, although my staff has spent a great
deal of time analyzing them.
  I am really interested in the comparison, Ms. Hernandez, that
you make regarding the privilege and immunities clause of the
14th amendment and the equal protection clause. I specifically
went to Judge Thomas, when it was my turn, and asked him
whether or not he accepted, understood and would follow the three
tests used by the Court under the equal protection clause of the
14th amendment. We discussed the three and the heightened scru-
tiny test, and he said yes, he understood it, that it did apply to
alienage, as well as gender, and yet that doesn't satisfy you, is that
correct? And can you make the distinction why, if he accepts those
three standards, that the question of undocumented aliens would
not fall into that intermediate scrutiny, assuming that we can be-
lieve him that he does accept that, that is what he told us?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Well, there are two points. One is that the Con-
stitution does distinguish, even if you just take the equal protection
clause of the 14th amendment, there are distinctions in coverage
between a citizen, a legal resident, and very few benefits to an un-
documented person.

  What we are really talking about is the difference between citi-
zens and legal resident aligns, and the Court has spoken on those
issues. In granting certain rights to legal resident aliens, they did
not give the strict scrutiny, they found an in-between.

  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, they found the intermediate scrutiny,
right?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. That is assuming that you accept the equal pro-
tection clause. The problem that we have is in reading Clarence
Thomas' writings, he would hold the privilege or immunities clause
supreme and paramount above the equal protection clause, and if
his legal philosophy and constitutional philosophy is that and you
carry it in a consistent manner, it is very clear what it says.

  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, and that is partly from his article in
the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, is that right, the
article that he wrote in 1988

   Ms. HERNANDEZ. Yes.

  Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. Entitled "The Higher Law
Background of the Privilege and Immunities Clause of the Four-
teenth Amendment." Is that where that comes from?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. That is part of it.
  Senator DECONCINI. I did not get into the distinction here that
you make, and I appreciate it, but I did go to the 14th amendment
equal protection clause, and I was satisfied, whether you agree
                                         903

with him anyplace else. This is because he recognized the three
tests, and particularly the intermediate scrutiny test and that it
applied to aliens. I didn't ask him if it applied to nondocumented
aliens, but the question was aliens, and maybe I should have been
astute enough to be more precise, nevertheless he accepted that as
a given in our constitutional interpretation and had not only no
quarrel with it, he supported it.

  So, I came away, quite frankly, far more satisfied than I did
when Bork for a long time failed to recognize the three tests, until
the Senator from Massachusetts finally got him to change his posi-
tion, I thought. To me, this man did satisfy that, but the distinction
you make, I see it, but I cannot agree with it. I just don't under-
stand how you can make that fine distinction, when he clearly said
that he accepted the intermediate scrutiny for aliens.

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. The distinction I would like to have made is not
so much as to the Equal Protection Clause, but as to what he be-
lieves should be supreme with the Fourteenth Amendment, the
Equal Protection Clause or the Privilege of Immunities, because if,
in fact, he believes it is the Equal Protection Clause, then your
questions and his answers follow, as he is talking about that specif-
ic one.

  Senator DECONCINI. Yes.
  Ms. HERNANDEZ. If it is the privilege of immunities, and he says
that I would argue that--if he were to argue that the privilege or
immunities clause should be supreme, then whatever his views are
on the equal protection are irrelevant.
  Senator DECONCINI. And your point is in the article he makes
that argument?

   Ms. HERNANDEZ. Yes.

  Senator DECONCINI. And so, based on that article, not on his tes-
timony here, you conclude that his view, if confirmed on the Court,
will be that the privilege and immunities clause is supreme and,
therefore, the equal protection clause and these three tests would
fall as it deals with aliens, that is your position?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Exactly.
  Senator DECONCINI. OK.
  Let me ask any member here, I have struggled with this a great
deal, as I struggled with Bork. I don't think anything is more im-
portant than what we do here, and we may make mistakes, as you
all thought we did on Souter, but I struggled with that one and I
struggled with Bork.
   I gather, from looking at your testimony here, you compare
Judge Thomas' judicial philosophy with that of Robert Bork, is that
correct, or am I incorrect? Does anyone want to say that is not--do
you consider him of the same philosophical bent, Mr. Rauh or Mr.
Chambers?
   Mr. RAUH. I will try to answer that. I don't think you can say
that the thing is the same, except if you want to mean how far to
the right have they gone, because they have gone in different ways.
   I bet I am the only person in this room that has read Bork's book
that came out afterwards. Have you read it, Senator?
   Let me say what I think. He has very strong views, but he
wouldn't necessarily be the same as Thomas. For example, in the
book he takes the position that the only real self-restraint of a
                                      904
judge is not the Frankfurter restraint that you hold the statute
presumptively constitutional, he says that isn't his restraint. His
great restraint is simply that a judge has got to say no in certain
circumstances. In other words, I think if you try to compare

  Senator DECONCINI. It is not a matter of degree and area.
  Mr. RAUH [continuing]. If you try to compare the two, don't do it
on some specifics. I think if you want to go back over that book
with me, you will find that in specifics it is different, but in general
attitude I think you would find they are very similar, and I
think
  Senator DECONCINI. MS. Hernandez, you said in your statement
that they reveal an ideological conservatism which differs little
from that of Judge Bork.
  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Yes, and what we meant in that is that a cer-
tain set mind and view of the world, notwithstanding his testimo-
ny, and if you look at the latter part of my testimony, we review
his statements during the last 5 days, that he has very strong
views on the world, on life and how he views the world, and I think
it is unreasonable to expect or ask of a person, notwithstanding
what happened here, that that person is going to change.
  People that go into the courts do not change, you don't want
them to change.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. I know that my time is up.
Thank you. I just want to note that, you know, unlike Bork,
Thomas stated that he recognizes the right of privacy as a constitu-
tional right. Bork didn't recognize that. I find that a big distinc-
tion. Maybe you do not, but I find that a big distinction.
  He comes up with the three-tier test in the equal protection
clause of the 14th amendment. Bork had real problems with that,
under careful scrutiny from a number of us. So, I see a great differ-
ence. I still respect your feelings that he should not be on the Su-
preme Court, but I see a great difference between these two.
  My last comment, Mr. Chairman, I wonder, really, if the panel
thinks that President Bush could appoint anybody that you would
support. Based on President Bush's very strong conservative bent
and philosophy, it appears to me that, you know, you have to take
what you have, and we might do this for months and months, if we
turn this one down, because I do not see any movement on the
President or any indication that you are going to see somebody a
whole lot different.
  Mr. RAUH. Let me say in answer to that, may I please, Sena-
tor
  Senator DECONCINI. It is more gratuitous than anything else.
  Mr. RAUH [continuing]. That there is a difference here. If this
nominee were turned down, the threat often used on us is, well,
you will get somebody worse. Well, there is precedent for beating
the second person and getting somebody much better, and the
precedent is Haynsworth, Carswell and Blackmun. We got a very
excellent judge by the fact that the Senate, in its wisdom, turned
two persons down.
  I do not believe the President, as a matter of politics, is going to
take it on a third time. I think if President Nixon had to appoint a
Harvard suma cum laude with moderate views in Blackmun, I
think President Bush would not want a third struggle. The ques-
                                      905
tion is is this Senate ready to turn down a Thomas and someone of
that ilk. I think the third time would be the charm, as it was in the
Blackmun case.

  Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chairman, can I respond? You know, mem-
bers of this committee have repeatedly expressed something of a
redemption theory in terms of Clarence Thomas, notwithstanding
his writings, because of his origins, because of what he said about a
different attitude if he reached the Court, that he would be differ-
ent.

  And I want to express a redemption theory so far as the Presi-
dent is concerned. I think many of us who are concerned about
such things believe that the Federal judiciary over the last 10 years
has been filled with ideological conservatives to an extent that
Franklin Delano Roosevelt never dreamed of, on the other side.

  I think--I can't prove it sitting here, Mr. Chairman, but I think
there is significant evidence that that process has taken place in
the Court itself, and its sea change in 1989 would reflect that
change.

  The President is replacing the towering figure of Thurgood Mar-
shall, truly an exclamation point. He appears to have done so with
someone who is a long series of question marks. He could decide to
attempt to replace a Thurgood Marshall with a towering figure.
The Court already has a strong conservative leaning. But think of
the strength he could give the Court, and think of what it would
mean to the President in terms of statesmanship in terms of histo-
ry if he were to decide, wait 1 minute. Maybe we have done enough
of this. Maybe it is time to truly look through that large pool of,
yes, black Americans who might be persons of more clearer stat-
ure, longer experience, clear track record, and decide to make an
appointment that is truly statesmanlike.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU have a lot more faith in President Bush
than I do, Mr. Buchanan, I must say.

  Mr. BUCHANAN. Well, it is the redemption theory, Senator.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. May I briefly respond to that too? And first going
to the question by Senator DeConcini about the similarities be-
tween Judge Thomas and Judge Bork.
  I think, as Mr. Rauh mentioned, they may differ in some areas
or in some degrees, but I think the adamancy and the position that
they are advancing and the unwillingness to look at approaches
that are necessary in order to provide some meaningful relief, as in
the race area, they are pretty much together.
  And I think it is pretty clear from Judge Thomas' writings,
speeches and action that he would come out in a sitting with the
Court that would be at odds with many of the precedents that the
Court has adopted.
  But finally in that connection, on the equal protection clause
that you are talking about, one also has to remember that there
are three tiers, and one of those tiers provide very limited relief.
And, in the alien situation there is a real problem in terms of the
kind of protection that is there.
  And finally, I think when we look at a candidate like this we
make a decision on the basis of the qualifications of the candidate.
Regardless of what the President may do tomorrow, we are faced
now with a candidate.
                                      906
  Senator DECONCINI. I agree.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. We have to make a decision whether he is quali-
fied for the position.
  Senator DECONCINI. That is a fair point, in my judgment.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am sorry to take as long as I did.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. With the permission of my col-
leagues, I would like to just follow up.
  Mr. Rauh, you said earlier that, something to the effect that
there should be balance on the Court, and you pointed to the Roo-
sevelt era and you mentioned Hoover, pre-Roosevelt, you men-
tioned and Calvin Coolidge and who they appointed.
  Do you think you would be here if the Court had six liberals and
the President nominated Judge Scalia, knowing what Judge Scalia
thinks and how he views the world? Would you be here supporting
or opposing Judge Scalia?
  I have never heard anybody talk about Judge Scalia's qualifica-
tions. I have incredible difficulty with Judge Scalia's methodology,
personally. But I never heard anybody talk about his qualifications
as being in jeopardy.
  Would you be here opposing Judge Scalia? It is a tough hypothet-
ical, but.
  Mr. RAUH. I don't think the exact case has ever come up, but it
may have. The reason I say I don't think that the exact case has
ever come up, it hasn't come up for liberals. I think it came up for
the Republicans in the Senate in 1932. The conservative Republi-
cans in the Senate, I think they had that, because you had a con-
servative Court in 1932 and you had a liberal appointed, which is
the exact opposite of the case you gave me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. That is why I asked the question.
  Mr. RAUH. And I think the Republicans in that instance aced
with great dignity. Indeed, Senator Watson of Indiana--am I right?
  The CHAIRMAN. I don't know.
  Mr. RAUH. I think he was the majority leader. And he said to
Hoover, "The best appointment politically is the best man," and, in
fact, a liberal was confirmed there.
  I can't--I want to give you an honest answer about Scalia there.
I think I would feel that that was a pretty bad appointment. But I
really think if there were six liberals this panel wouldn't be here.
  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate that.
  I am sorry. The Senator from Pennsylvania, I believe, is next.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Within a short round, it is hard to cover much ground that this
very distinguished panel has articulated in both the written state-
ments and their oral testimony. Let me start with the qualification
and background issue that Mr. Chambers writes about. And he lists
a litany, one of which is the ability to grasp the intricate relation-
ships and ramifications of a decision that is an integral part of the
mosaic of Federal law, one among many qualifications. And he
compared Judge Thomas to 48 Supreme Court Justices appointed
in the 20th century and find him coming out lacking.
  And, I wonder as I go through it if any really measure up except
for the two that Joe Rauh talks about having clerked for--Benja-
min Cardozo and Felix Frankfurter. And I think back on the testi-
mony given here, Chief Judge John Gibbons from the Third Cir-
                                      907
cuit, a very distinguished jurist who knew Judge Thomas for many
years, or they sat on the board of Holy Cross and had some de-
tailed of the individual and his legal qualifications, read all of his
opinions before coming to testify. And you had Professor Drew
Days of the Yale Law School who, although he opposed Judge
Thomas, thought he was educationally and intellectually qualified.
And then you had Dean Calabrese of the Yale Law School who was
at Yale in the teaching field, although he did not have Clarence
Thomas as a student when he was at Yale, and all of those individ-
uals give him pretty high marks in terms of base qualifications.

  Why should we not accept their approach, Mr. Chambers, as op-
posed to your analysis?

  Mr. CHAMBERS. Well, first of all, Senator Specter, I listened to
some of that testimony and I am not certain how high a mark they
gave him, but let's make that assumption. But I ask you to look at
the Justices we have listed here in this exhibit, at the litigation ex-
perience or practice of law experience, at the teaching experience,
at the judicial experience they have had, at the status they had ob-
tained in the legal field, and make a comparison with Judge
Thomas.

  I think if one wants to look at the Constitution and talk about
what the standard is as what we have developed to judge candi-
dates for the bench for, and in that instance I think the ABA said
that Judge Thomas was qualified.

  But, if we are trying to develop a Court, or preserve a Court that
has been responsive to the issues that have been brought before it,
that had people who were really exceptional as we collect here in
this exhibit, Judge Thomas doesn't measure up, and that is what
we are presenting with this exhibit.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you would disagree with Dean Calabrese
who said that he at least may not measure up to the Cardozo-
Holmes standard, but Dean Calabrese insisted that he at least
measured up, if not better than, the other recent appointees.

  But you would disagree with that as well?
  Mr. CHAMBERS. Again, I would call your attention to this exhibit,
and according to this exhibit and looking at the objective standards
we are trying to use in the exhibit, the answer is no.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, your exhibit picks seven standards, but
you might pick some others. You might pick a totality. But I would
be interested in the answer to that question as to your agreement
or disagreement with what Dean Calabrese said, that Judge
Thomas is at least as good as the recent appointees.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. AS the recent?
  Senator SPECTER. Appointees to the Supreme Court of the United
States.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. If that is what Dean Calabrese said, I would
think that that is not the way I would evaluate Judge Thomas'
qualifications.
  Senator SPECTER. I would like to discuss a number of the areas
with you, but the yellow light is on, so let me instead turn to Mr.
Lucy on one question.
  Mr. Lucy went to the Yale article which Judge Thomas wrote,
the Yale Law and Policy Review, and picked out his writings on
Judge Thomas' disagreement on affirmative action. I note there
                                      908
that Judge Thomas has opposed affirmative action most of the
time, except to a very limited extent on preferences in education,
and he has opposed the class preferences because he says that for
the minorities whom they benefit--and this is what you had read--
they foster the view of disability or being in need of handouts, and
for the individuals who are being replaced they promote a feeling
of being replaced by someone who doesn't have as high test scores.
And then he emphasizes the point of increase on racial divisive-
ness. Those are in the context of footnote 3 that you cited.

  Now, whether or not you agree with his conclusion that affirma-
tive action is undesirable, when you take his reasons for being op-
posed to that, would you not say that there was at least a reasona-
ble basis for his conclusion?

  Mr. LUCY. I think, Senator, if you look at what the serious prob-
lems are that caused the establishment of EEOC itself and some of
the provisions of the law, the question of whether affirmative
action is designed to bring about remedies or designed to prevent
others from being injured, Mr. Thomas placed more emphasis on
the issue of reverse discrimination than on carrying out the man-
date of his agency. And whether or not he had a reasonable basis
for that judgment may well be true. I can't say what was the basis
of his concern.

  But the basis of my concern, and for millions of other workers, is
that there be some process by which fairness can be brought to
those who have been disadvantaged by systematic discrimination,
and the charge of EEOC it would seem to me is not only to pro-
mote affirmative action as a remedy for past discrimination, but
also to be fair in providing remedies where it has been established
that there has been injury to groups.

  My reading of Mr. Thomas is that it was defensive of (a) the indi-
vidual injury to individuals, and a defense against reverse discrimi-
nation.

  Senator SPECTER. If I just might make one comment in closing,
because my time is up. Not saying that I agree with Judge Thomas,
but I think he does more than focus on reverse discrimination. He
focuses very hard on discrimination. He has said some very power-
ful things about believing that discrimination was as bad in 1987
when he made his speech as it was when Chief Justice Taney decid-
ed Dred Scott, but he deals with discrimination on an individual
basis. And when he comes to the group action he finds as a policy
decision these factors which lead him to a contrary conclusion.

  Mr. LUCY. Well, Senator, I would only say that these provisions
were not put into the law just sort of willy-nilly. There was a great
deal of discussion, debate, and I am sure thought by those in the
Congress who, in fact, enacted the legislation, and I am sure they
concerned themselves with the possibilities of others being injured
as a result of, not preferential treatment, but really affirmative
action to correct past wrongs.

  Again, I think this is much more of an instance of Mr. Thomas
assuming and asserting his judgment as opposed to the intent of
the law to start.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Senator Simon.
                                      909

  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I welcome the
panel and I thank you for your testimony. Just a few comments
and then a general question. If you were to list who were the
giants in the field of civil rights and civil liberties in this century,
Joe Rauh would be one of them, and when Joe Rauh tells that
today--and I think you are saying that no matter what happens
with this nominee--the keeper of the Bill of Rights is Congress, I
think that is something we have to weigh very, very carefully, and
I believe that to be the case.

  In commenting on my colleague Senator DeConcini's comments
that he can't imagine George Bush nominating someone with dif-
fering views, it is interesting that every Republican President, from
Calvin Coolidge through Gerald Ford, has nominated a Supreme
Court Justice with views more liberal than the President. And
President Kennedy nominated Justice White, and Harry Truman,
who certainly wasn't short on strong views, nominated a Republi-
can Senator from Ohio, Justice Burton.

  So this idea of balance on the Court and that the Court and the
law should not be a pendulum swinging back and forth has some
historic precedent.

  Ms. Hernandez, I think the point that you make on privileges
and immunities is important. The Constitution in a great many
places makes distinctions between persons and citizens, and we
have had court decisions that are not good court decisions because
we have not recognized the rights specifically of people who are
here legally. I think of the action taken when we were involved
with Iran and the hostages were taken, where I think an unfortu-
nate decision was made by the appellate court.

  And then finally this is my question to all of you. I recognize
that there is a difference between Judge Bork and Judge Thomas
in terms of the basis for arriving at decisions, natural law being
one, the area of privacy, for example, being another.

  But my question to each of you would be this: Judge Bork, who
was turned down 9-5 by this committee--can you think of any spe-
cific decision of the Court where Judge Thomas might have voted
differently than a Judge Bork would have voted had either been in
the Court?

  Mr. RAUH. Well, there is a basic difference between their views
on self-restraint. I didn't say it very well when I was talking about
their differences before. Judge Thomas believes, he says, in self-re-
straint, but he doesn't believe in original intent. Judge Bork--and
that is why I mentioned the book--says in the book the only re-
straint that matters is original intent, which is, I think, ridiculous,
since the greatest exponent of self-restraint, Justice Frankfurter,
was not a believer in original intent.

  So they do have differences in their purposes and in their princi-
ples of constitutional interpretation. They may come out the same
way, but they do have a substantial difference. One says self-re-
straint; the only thing that matters is original intent. The other
says, no, it is a withholding of your views as against the views of
the Congress. And so I would say there are differences, but as Mr.
Chambers pointed out, they are small differences and they would
most times come in the same place.
                                      910
  Senator SIMON. And I would be interested in hearing from the
others, but if you take one view of privacy and another view of pri-
vacy, whether the Constitution has it, but you come out the same
on Roe v. Wade, the net result for the American public is the same.
  Mr. BUCHANAN. I think it is very important, Senator. I think in
terms of a fundamental threat to our liberties, the rights and liber-
ties of the American people, it ends in the same place. They may
have differences in philosophies, but the mind set or at least the
gamble the Senate is taking with the rights and liberties of the
American people is very troubling indeed.
  And may I add one footnote on affirmative action, since it has
been such a subject throughout these hearings? We white males,
like me and like every member of this panel, have had an affirma-
tive action program going for centuries. We have had preferences
that we have enjoyed for centuries throughout American history,
and it is only very recently in this century that we have gotten
around to extending some affirmative action, or at least some re-
dress to black Americans, to women.
  One specific example is the Vietnam war. That was a wonderful
affirmative action program. The sons of the rich and the powerful,
in preponderance, were able to get into the guard and the reserves,
and I was here and I well remember, and I think that can be clear-
ly documented. The people who had to go to Vietnam and fight and
kill and be killed were disproportionately poor and minority.
  Well, that is a different kind of affirmative action program, but
if we waited for a case-by-case basis to redress historic injustices
done to the black community in my State of Alabama and through-
out the country and to women through the centuries, we would be
to the year 2200 getting to first base.
  If you can't have class action--blacks are discriminated against
as a class in the United States, regardless of individual differences;
women were here and many other places. If we can't deal with it
on a class action basis, we can never solve the problem. So I find
the danger to the liberties of the people just as great in one case as
the other.
  Mr. LUCY. Senator, if I can just add maybe an extension on the
question of economic justice, be it for black males, black workers or
workers in general, but particularly with regard to women work-
ers--and while I don't want to quote Mr. Thomas out of context, at
least his description of the economic question was when he made
the statement that comparable worth or pay equity was loony
tunes, sort of reflecting the fact that he does not believe that the
value of work of women will ever equal the value of work that
males contribute. And this by itself in 1991 is the critical issue con-
fronting female workers in the workplace, and particularly as sta-
tistics show our society moving toward substantial numbers of
single-headed households by women.
  As I said in my testimony, any dollar denied them by gender-
based wage discrimination is almost a denial of economic justice.
And on that point alone, I think he is so far out of the mainstream.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. Senator, for African-Americans, I was thinking
really as you raised that question--I don't think in the race area
that there would be very much difference in the outcome in deci-
sions between Judge Bork and Judge Thomas. In fact, there is from
                                      911
several of Judge Thomas' writings suggestions that he may come
out worse in several instances than Judge Bork, and that is one of
the concerns that we have.

  As I indicated earlier, we have been before the Supreme Court
now over our 51-year history over 500 times and we have gotten
different results coming out of there, and most of those cases now
would be questioned by Judge Thomas, as made clear by his writ-
ings and comments.

  So I don't see that much difference in the outcome and, in fact, I
would be more concerned that Judge Thomas would come out more
adversely to the causes that we are raising than Judge Bork.

  Senator SIMON. SO if I may follow through, it would be, in your
opinion, inconsistent for me to vote against Judge Bork and for
Judge Thomas?

  Mr. CHAMBERS. That is quite correct.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you all very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I have a few more questions, as does my
friend from Wyoming, is that correct?
  Senator SIMPSON. I do, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask my question; I actually have one
question. I thought the most compelling testimony that we have
heard today--we all have a different view; it is subjective, obvious-
ly--was the testimony of Faye Wattleton and Kate Michelman this
morning.
  I am wrestling with what you all have said in one form or an-
other, the issue of credibility. You have all either said it directly
like the Congressman has, or indirectly like Ms. Hernandez has.
She is obviously going to be Secretary of State in somebody's ad-
ministration. [Laughter.]
  I am trying to be as precise as I can be because, Mr. Chambers, I
don't think there is any correlation between Judge Bork and Judge
Thomas in terms of their methodology. They may come out the
same place, but they are fundamentally different.
  As a matter of fact, as Mr. Rauh can tell you, in Mr. Bork's book
he reserves an entire chapter for people who think like Judge
Thomas, talk like Judge Thomas, use the rationale Judge Thomas
does for his brilliant ridicule, and he is a brilliant fellow and his
ridicule is real and it is compelling.
  Judge Thomas--everything he has said and written is a rejection
of the positivist view of the Constitution. So I don't see how anyone
can possibly say they are in any way related in terms of how they
approach interpreting the Constitution.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. The question, though, was whether there would
be any different in the results of the decisions.
  The CHAIRMAN. I see, OK, but we don't have a disagreement, do
we, on from whence they begin their analysis as being so funda-
mentally different? I mean, they are as different as any two nomi-
nees. I have been here not that long, 19 years. I have been here for
a while and I know of no two who have evidenced a view that is so
diametrically opposed.
  The words "natural law" do not emanate from the lips of Judge
Bork. I mean, it never even--you know, it is the ultimate legal sac-
rilege, if there is such a thing.
                                      912

   Mr. CHAMBERS. Senator Biden, the question again goes to the
second point that I was trying to raise in the testimony about the
qualifications of the candidate.

   The CHAIRMAN. That is what I want to get to.

   Mr. CHAMBERS. OK.

  The CHAIRMAN. OK. That is what I want to get to in my ques-
tion. Now, I want to stick, actually, with the question of credibility
first. One of the arguments Judge Thomas raised, one of the state-
ments Judge Thomas would counter with, I say to Mr. Rauh and
all of you, whenever I would press him on any of the number of
speeches that he made--and I think I have read as many as
anyone in this room, including my staff, and I know they have read
all of them.

  He would say something along the following lines: well, if I
wished to say what you are asserting, I would have explicitly said
it. For example, in the Lehrman quote, in the footnote that he
refers to, in the Cato speech where he says, do you want to under-
stand why I criticize Roe? Go look at my--and then he goes back
and there is this labyrinth he takes you through. I wondered
whether he ever wrote the footnote or someone else wrote the foot-
note for him. I don't say that critically. A lot of footnotes are writ-
ten for a lot of people, including Justices.

  You wrote a hell of a lot of footnotes, Mr. Rauh, for brilliant Jus-
tices, I suspect. I do not suspect they were brilliant; they were bril-
liant, but I suspect you may have written some of those footnotes.

  Having said that, how do you respond to the assertion by Judge
Thomas that "If I wanted to criticize Roe, I would have criticized
Roe. Why would I not have just criticized Roe way back in 1981
and 1982 and 1983? Why didn't I just say by the way, this is not
just a splendid example of the application of natural law; this is
also a view held by Mr. Lehrman that I believe is correct, and I
think Roe is a wrongly decided decision, and I think it should be
overturned"?

  Why would a man like him have not said that 6, 8, 9 years ago
when he was making some of these speeches--not all of them; some
of them are as late as 1987, 1988--why would he not have done
that?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Well, let me try
  The CHAIRMAN. But you know him, so maybe I'll start with you,
Madam Secretary.
  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Let me try by saying that most of his writings,
his speeches, centered around his chairmanship of the EEOC and
battling those issues and speaking on his philosophy and point of
view dealing with the matter at hand.
  Some of his articles and speeches when he left the area of affirm-
ative action or where he left the area of his views when he was
with the Department of Education, and he commented on an arti-
cle that he liked in the speeches that he made, it was that indirect
comment. I think that it was lack of opportunity as far as his abili-
ty to speak on the many issues of the day. He was preoccupied, and
his hands were full with the issues at hand.
  But we listened very carefully to his testimony, and if you lis-
tened very carefully, and particularly a couple of times when you
tried to push him, even when he conceded on certain policies, and
                                      913
we were very careful in his response--in fact, let me give you an
example on the legal position on his testimony to Senator Specter,
dealing with goals and timetables, and you got some comments
there.

  He sort of conceded in his response that such policies might
sometimes be okay, but only from a policy point of view. He de-
clined to give even his tentative approval from a legal perspective
which is what he was going to be called to deal with as a judge and
has been called to deal with as a judge. And when he conceded
when pushed, it was from a political point of view.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I understand that--and I know my time is
up--but one of the things that I'm trying to get at here is to try to
deal with some precision about what he did say and what he didn't
say. And there is no question--in my view, there is no question--
that there was an overwhelming effort on the part of Judge
Thomas, I suspect--I'd be willing to bet anything--at the direction
of the White House not to answer anything about the law, period,
if you could avoid it--anything. That's one issue, whether or not
we should "allow a nominee to get away with that", quote-unquote,
and that is something we are going to have to decide as a matter of
policy here in this committee.

  But that is not the same as saying that because he didn't speak
to the law, his views on the law are able to be clearly arrived at by
this panel or anyone else listening from what he didn't say.

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. That's true.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO that's the only point I'm trying to make
sure--I have to deal with, in determining whether to vote for or
against him, his credibility in terms of whether he is telling me
what he is thinking; whether or not we should, at what point, is
this the time--we keep changing the standard as we go, legitimate-
ly, in my view--that is, as more nominees stonewall, this commit-
tee, at least some of us, get more upset about the stonewalling, for
example. Justice Scalia answered nothing at all, zero, zip, nothing.
Two members of this Committee said, "Oh, no, we're not doing that
again." Each nominee is answering a little more. Whether they
answer enough or not is a different question.
  I'm trying to focus on what he said in his writings, and as I
looked at every one of them, the worrisome passages of all of his
speeches have been throwaway lines or paragraphs, almost all of
them without any connection to the subject matter of the speech,
almost without exception.
  Now, the privileges and immunities speech by itself is something
to worry about on its face, and you made that point very well. But
all the lines we have heard so much about today--not today, but
that I have raised; I think I was the first one to raise them--all of
them are in the context of a single paragraph dropped at the begin-
ning or the end of a speech unrelated to the paragraph.
  When I questioned him at length about Professor Epstein, what
worried me most about it after I listened to him wasn't that he
agreed with Epstein, but that he didn't know what Epstein was
saying.
  So--and I'm going to stop talking here--but you understand the
dilemma that I have and that I want you to speak to, and that is
that the man said, look, if I wanted to say Epstein's notion of the
                                      914
fifth amendment and the takings clause was correct, why wouldn't
I have gone on one more paragraph and said it? If I wanted to
make the case that Macedo was right, why would I have quoted
Macedo the way I did and then spent a significant portion of the
speech pointing out that Macedo had gone too far? If I wanted to
make my point known on Roe, why would I have complemented,
for any reasons other than I stated, this splendid application of
natural law by Lew Lehrman in Lehrman Hall of the Heritage
Foundation and then never again mention abortion?

  Is it that this man 9 years ago thought, "I want to get to the Su-
preme Court, and I'd better not say anything"? Could he have been
that--how can I say it--optimistic about his future?

  Mr. RAUH. NO, that isn't the point, Senator. You are making a
good point, but I think you are wrong. I think the words "splendid
application of natural law" are a statement of fact, and if you

  The CHAIRMAN. Let's assume they are, Joe, for the sake of discus-
sion.

  Mr. RAUH. Let me go on, please.
  The CHAIRMAN. Sure.
  Mr. RAUH. If you were making a speech to someone, you
wouldn't use those pedestrian words--"I think we ought to over-
rule Roe v. Wade."That's not the way a speech is constructed. It is
constructed in a way that
  The CHAIRMAN. That's the way he talks in his speeches, though.
  Mr. RAUH [continuing]. There is a certain elegance which, if you
are a natural law freak, as he was at that time
  The CHAIRMAN. I am one of those natural law guys, you know--I
think, by the way, Frankfurter was, too.
  Mr. RAUH. I'm not saying what he said here; I'm saying what he
said there. To say that's a "splendid application of natural law" is
the best way to say the overruling of Roe v. Wade. He said some-
thing worse, though, because if that memorandum was right, then
abortion is murder, and maybe he didn't want to go quite that far.
But if you start parsing it and saying, "Oh, I am for the repeal,"
then the next question will be, "Well, are you also for the other
half of this memorandum, which says abortion is murder?" I
just
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, at least you admit it raises the question
that he might not have been for the whole memorandum. The only
point I am making is that it doesn't seem clear because he is very
explicit about other things he says. He is very explicit when he
talks about issues relating to affirmative action. He doesn't mince
words in his speeches. He is very explicit about the privileges and
immunities clause. He doesn't mince words.
  And I am in a quandary, a sincere quandary, as to why, if these
phrases were as troublesome as they could be from my perspective,
why he didn't--one of the things he said to us was, "Look, if I
meant to say it, I'd say it." He said it other places. I don't know
whether that is compelling, but at least it has me thinking, and I
wondered.
  I've got to yield now to my colleague. But I want to point out
that when I was talking about natural law in Bork, you all were
applauding. I want to remind you all of that. When I talked about I
derive my rights not from a piece of paper, you all thought that
                                      915
was pretty good back then. So all of a sudden, natural looks like
it's just a matter of how you apply natural law and what your
framework is, from my perspective. But at any rate, you all
thought that was pretty good back then to take on Bork's positivist
view that there was no such thing as unenumerated rights--"you
all" I use in an editorial sense; not any one of you in particular.

  With that, let me yield to my colleague from Wyoming.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I do indeed remember that, but
I can understand your frustration because it was a different recep-
tion to those remarks.
  But just quickly, we want to get on, and I have not delayed the
issue; I've taken just maybe 20 minutes all day, but I'll take these
5.
  It really is fascinating to me to hear this continual reference to
the word "balance"--balance, balance, balance. It is my opinion
that no nominee could ever pass your test of George Bush, and I
wouldn't be too sure about the views of Clarence Thomas and
George Bush and where they'll end up when it's all up on the
scorecard. I wouldn't go into that one at all.
  But I don't think any nominee could be both conservative and
the best person in your view, period. That's the way it is, and we'd
just as well maybe start from there. But if you really do believe in
balance--and you said you did--what about the balance in the U.S.
House of Representatives where, under the remarkable preponder-
ance of Democrats, nearly all of my life there has been no balance
whatsoever? How about a little balance there?
  Does anyone--I'm sure that's an absurd idea, but I just thought
I'd throw it in. We have an abused minority over there called Re-
publicans. Don't you think it would be good to unleash them and
allow them to have a little staff and do the other things that other
people get to do in society, and that is produce papers and writings,
and it's called "balance".
  What do you think of that absurd and totally nutty idea?
  Mr. RAUH. Well, it's only nutty because of the fact that one is an
appointed body and the other is an elected body. The appointed
body, it is easy to have balance. The elected body, it is much harder
to have balance.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, Joe, I would say--and I know you have a
bit of disregard, I would say, for Presidents Reagan and Bush--
they went out and told the American people when they ran, as
they campaigned for President, that if they were nominated and
elected that they would nominate judicial candidates who shared
their views. That's exactly what they said when they were out on
the stump. They were elected, they made the appointments, and
they were reelected based sometimes on those appointments. So
that's the way that is, too.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. But the Senate didn't run on that same platform,
and the Senate has a constitutional responsibility as well.
  Senator SIMPSON. Of course.
  Mr. CHAMBERS. SO when the President makes his nomination,
one hopes that the Senate exercises its responsibility.
   Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think we have. I have been here under
Presidents of the Democratic faith and the Republican faith, and I
don't think I ever got tangled up in any judge of Jimmy Carter on
                                          916

any issue except were they competent, capable, had judicial tem-
perament, and so on. This is bizarre. This guy is a conservative.
You don't like him

   Mr. RAUH. Jimmy Carter didn't have an appointment to the Su-
preme Court.

   Senator SIMPSON. I know. There were many judges that Jimmy
Carter appointed to the Federal district court, and some I helped
get through, to the detriment of my own party support.

   But I think there is one that has to be settled, because I have
heard Mr. Lucy now speak several times on this issue of women in
the workplace. Let's get to that.

   On page 11 of your testimony, you speak of Judge Thomas' "dis-
turbing record on women in the workplace". That is your quote.
Then you give an example of his record, and you say the following:
"the EEOC under Judge Thomas' leadership rejected the concept of
pay equity, eliminating the hopes of many women in seeking com-
parable pay with their male counterparts."

   Now, every one of us in Congress knows that "pay equity" is a
euphemism for "comparable worth". The comparable worth doc-
trine attempts to intervene in the marketplace and decides that
nurses and truck drivers, for example, ought to be equally paid,
with absolutely no attention at all paid to supply and demand or to
other relevant economic and social factors.

  My question is this. You speak of Thomas' criticism of compara-
ble worth as if this were a mainstream, well-accepted concept, this
comparable worth. And yet most Federal courts have been abso-
lutely unwilling to extend title VII to cover comparable worth
claims. We have case-after-case in the Federal court rejecting com-
parable worth--not just Clarence Thomas. Let's get serious here.
The following cases have rejected comparable worth's validity
under title VII of the Civil Rights Act: Christianson v. Iowa was
the eighth circuit; Lemons v. City of Denver, the tenth circuit;
Spaulding v. University of Washington, the ninth circuit.

  Aren't you really, honestly asking Judge Thomas to endorse an
agenda of yours which is already shown to be out of the main-
stream by every court that has yet dealt with it?

  Mr. LUCY. Well, Senator, that's not quite true, I think, and while
I don't know every specific case you cited, most of the opposition to
comparable worth flows from the economic consequence of in effect
supporting it.

  What we have, and particularly at State and local Government
levels, and particularly within the marketplace, is systemic dis-
crimination against female workers.

   Second, you've got the notion, appearing to flow from Mr.
Thomas' own comments, that women make employment judgments
on the basis of family life as opposed to the need to work.

   Comparable worth and the evaluation of the relevant value of
jobs--there is a procedure that can supply the proper analysis. And
if that analysis is justified, then support of it and decisions support-
ing it ought to be justified. I don't know the cases you cited, but by
and large the resistance is the resistance to change to make eco-
nomic justice in the marketplace for female workers a reality. And
whether it is Mr. Thomas or even the courts, the fact is systematic
                                      917
discrimination exists against female workers in the workplace, be
it the public sector or be it the marketplace.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I am just saying to you that comparable
worth is so complex, so difficult to deal with

  Mr. LUCY. SO is discrimination, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON [continuing]. That the courts haven't decided to
do it at all. It can't be dealt with.
  Mr. LUCY. But that's the point.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, the point is that to put that all on Judge
Thomas, eliminating the hopes of women, you have to talk about
every other court and talk about us--we can't deal with it. Compa-
rable worth in this body would be like an impossible dream to
figure out what to do with comparable worth. We all agree that
women should have these rights. Who challenges that? It's trying
to put it together
  Mr. LUCY. But Senator, could we not have found a different way
to describe it? I mean, Mr. Thomas' comments of "loony tunes'
does not quite reflect----
  Senator SIMPSON. What did you say?
  Mr. LUCY. His comment was that the concept was "loony tunes".
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, there are a lot of Congressmen who feel
the same thing about comparable worth, that it is "loony tunes",
but there are a lot of them who think that women should have the
same equity in pay as men, but they don't know how to get to it,
and they can't get it through this crazy business of whether nurses
and truck drivers and not paying attention to the other issues can't
even be decided. It can't, or we'd have done something about it
long ago. And they tried.
  But finally, many people have asked why do these judges, these
potential nominees do this. Why are they mute? Why do they duck
these questions? That answer should well be understood after what
happened to Judge Bork. Who can even challenge that? The man
was on the bench for 5V2 years, and I never heard a single com-
ment about his 5V2 years on the bench while I sat here for days.
All I heard about was some goofy Indiana Law Review article writ-
ten in 1971, and I had to watch that and then to watch the adver-
tising that came in the face of this man, and see where it came
from--powerful, hysterical, extraordinary national television, irre-
sponsible beyond comprehension. And you are wondering why
nobody is going to say anything. I have a thought for you all: Stop
smearing them, stop ridiculing them, stop tearing their past lives
to shreds and their past comments to shreds, made when they were
10, 20, 30 years back down the line, and they will start talking.
Until then, they won't--and who would?
  Mr. RAUH. IS that a question?
  Senator SIMPSON. That's not a question.
  The CHAIRMAN. Are you finished, Senator?
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes, I am, all finished, for the day, or for a
while. I may rise again.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I just want to welcome you distinguished people to this hearing.
We thank you for your presence. I have no questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
                                          918

   Folks, thank you very much. We appreciate it. It was very en-
lightening.

   Mr. RAUH. Thank you very much.
   [Pause.]
   The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order.
   I am sorry--I kept you waiting because I was waiting for the
fourth panelist, who I am told is not here now.
   Our next and patient panel is made up of Dr. Julius Becton, Jr.,
president of Prairie View A&M University. Welcome, Doctor.
   We welcome also Dr. Jimmy Jenkins, chancellor of Elizabeth
City State University, and Yvonne Thomas of Zeta Phi Beta Sorori-
ty.
  Welcome, all three. We are anxious to hear what you have to
say. Obviously, our interest in the previous panels is one of the rea-
sons why we are as late as we are, but we are here to hear what
you have to say, and we will stay here. So we appreciate very much
your patience.
  Have you concluded how you would like to begin, or should we
begin in the order you have been called?
  Mr. BECTON. YOU are more senior than I am, you've got more
tenure. What do you want to do?
  Mr. JENKINS. I'll go first.
  Mr. BECTON. I knew they'd do that to me.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right, Chancellor, you begin, please.

STATEMENTS OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF JIMMY JENKINS,
  CHANCELLOR, ELIZABETH CITY STATE UNIVERSITY, NC;
  YVONNE THOMAS, ZETA PHI BETA SORORITY, AND JULIUS
  BECTON, JR., PRESIDENT, PRAIRIE VIEW A&M UNIVERSITY

  Mr. JENKINS. Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of this
august body, ladies and gentlemen, I am both honored and hum-
bled by this opportunity to come before you and this Nation to
voice my views on whether or not Judge Clarence Thomas should
be confirmed as an Associate Justice of our Nation's highest court.

  I am honored because this chancellor of a small university in
North Carolina called Elizabeth City State University, which this
year is celebrating its 100th anniversary, was selected.

  The CHAIRMAN. Congratulations.
  Mr. JENKINS. I am humbled because I realize that what I say
here today may have some influence on your decision to affirm or
reject Judge Thomas as the nominee with all of the ramifications
your decision has for our Nation now and in the future.
  I have come to express my support of Judge Thomas as the
second such nominee in the history of America's highest court. Let
me quickly say to you that my support of Judge Thomas is not
based upon a personal association. Judge Thomas and I have never
met. My support is not based upon a party affiliation, since I am a
registered Democrat. My support is not based upon the notion that
he and I agree on every aspect of the philosophies that have
molded his character.
  I am here this evening, Mr. Chairman and members of this body,
because Judge Thomas is widely acknowledged for his philosophy
                                      919
of self-help as relates to the African-American struggle for justice
and equality.
i As the leader of a historically black university and a representa-
tive of 117 HBCU's in this country, our very existence is a shining
example of our belief in self-help. Education has always been
America's trump card in dealing with its problems. From Sputnik
to the age of computers to the sexual revolution, we have turned to
our schools to provide solutions to complex problems.

   One hundred years or so ago, when African-Americans were
unable to attend historically white institutions, in the spirit of self-
help, the HBCU's were born. Clarence Thomas has consistently ex-
pressed his admiration for HBCU's. In a speech given at Clark Col-
lege in Atlanta, GA in 1983, he reiterated his support of HBCU's.
Quoting from his speech, Thomas said: "I recognize that historical-
ly black colleges have produced 50 percent of the black business ex-
ecutives, 75 percent of the black military officers, and 80 percent of
the black physicians in this country. Even though traditionally
white institutions are now open to everyone, black higher educa-
tion institutions produce more than three-fourths of the black grad-
uates. I refuse to pursue desegregation policies which penalize
black colleges. They were not the ones doing discriminating. Realiz-
ing the importance of the continuing contribution of black colleges,
I approach enforcement with great care. I insist that the State
plans have as a major objective the enhancement of black institu-
tions. This means better libraries, better programs, upgraded facul-
ty and more funds. In that way, equality of educational opportuni-
ty was best realized."

   Historically black colleges and universities benefited from
Thomas' support when in 1983, as chairman of the EEOC, he
signed a $42.5 million agreement with General Motors Corp. in the
largest nonlitigation settlement in EEOC history, resolving hun-
dreds of employment discrimination claims. Additionally, the
agreement provided for more than $10 million in endowments and
scholarships to increase educational opportunities for minorities
and women. HBCU's received almost 50 percent of the funds allo-
cated, another example of Thomas' philosophy of enhancing these
institutions.

   If Clarence Thomas is confirmed as an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court, he may have an opportunity to participate in the
high court's deliberation on the case of Ayers v. Mabus. This case
threatens the existence of public HBCU's unlike any other case in
recent memory.

   As an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas
will have an opportunity to influence and to vote according to the
position he espoused in 1983, and I quote again:

   Within a month of taking that job, I was terrified by the possible effects of the
desegregation efforts on black colleges. How will desegregation policies which ulti-
mately eliminate black colleges help black people? They worked to keep those insti-
tutions alive and vital. Let us continue to do so.

   The nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas is not just about the
filling of a vacant seat on the High Court. This nomination is also
about democracy. The New World Order that is evolving has as its
catalyst the cry for democracy as nation after nation focus atten-
tion on America as the preeminent role model. If we are to truly

         56-271 O--93 30
                                         920

provide a meaningful example, we must come to understand that
democracy is more than the right to vote, freedom of religion, free-
dom of the press, or even freedom of speech. If the spirit of our
Constitution is to truly be embodied in our democracy, we must
have fair representation in all aspects of our society. That includes
all three branches of the government. It is through fair representa-
tion that our youth, coming from diverse cultural backgrounds,
find role models and acquire the motivation for upward mobility.
As an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas
will be that fair representation for African-Americans.

  With a background evolving out of Pin Point, GA, which has
been vividly and emotionally described by Thomas himself and
others who were his peers, to assert that when the cases that offer
an opportunity for redress of the ills of poverty and illegal racial
discrimination are placed before him that he would be indifferent,
vote to maintain the status quo, or even worse, seek to turn the
clock back, I believe is ludicrous. We may be singing different
songs, but we are all singing from the same hymnal.

  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for let-
ting me share this moment in history and for the opportunity, as a
scholar of a historically black university, to express my support for
Judge Clarence Thomas, who has consistently expressed his sup-
port for HBCU's, to be an Associate Justice of the United States
Supreme Court.

  Thank you.
  Senator HEFLIN [presiding]. Senator Biden is out of the chair,
and I want to hear Ms. Thomas because I've still got things that
keep competing with my time, and so if you don't mind, Dr. Becton,
I am going to call on Ms. Thomas.
  The light system is working, and if you can limit it to 5 minutes
or we won't be out of here until 3 in the morning.
  Ms. Thomas.

                     STATEMENT OF YVONNE THOMAS

  Ms. THOMAS. Good evening, distinguished members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee.

  I am Yvonne Thomas, a lifelong resident of the great State of
Alabama. I was born and reared in Mobile, AL. I received my un-
dergraduate education at Alabama State University in Montgom-
ery and received my master's degree from the University of Ala-
bama in Birmingham.

  For the past 27 years I have lived in a place with a name well
known to many--Selma, AL. As you see, I am truly a product of
the State.

  I am here today representing Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., to
speak in strong support of the nomination of Judge Clarence
Thomas.

  Zeta Phi Beta Sorority was founded in 1920 on the campus of
Howard University in Washington, DC. The sorority now encom-
passes over 75,000 black American women with more than 500
graduate and college chapters across the country. Our members
come from various walks of life. We are educators, students, enter-
tainers, corporate executives, entrepreneurs, lawyers, and judges.
                                      921
  Zeta Phi Beta Sorority is committed to making a positive impact
on the future of our children, and we do this by serving as mentors,
assisting in providing educational opportunities, and helping to de-
crease the effects of the social ills which plague our communities.
  Zeta Phi Beta sponsors numerous scholarships through our na-
tional foundation. Through our Stork's Nest Program, we provide
prenatal care for indigent mothers. As another example of our in-
volvement, we recently initiated a drug and substance abuse pro-
gram for collegiate students.
  In addition, Zeta Phi Beta has joined with many African-Ameri-
can organizations to address "the black male crisis ' and have made
this issue our national project for 1991. Through these and other
programs we are demonstrating our commitment to improve our
community.
  Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc. is a member of the Leadership Con-
ference on Civil Rights. We are, however, on record with the con-
ference as nonconcurring with their position as it relates to the
confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas. We believe that Judge
Thomas is qualified to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. As pointed
out by the American Bar Association, Judge Thomas has the judi-
cial temperament, the integrity, honesty, intelligence, and inde-
pendence necessary to serve on our Nation's highest court. We
agree and urge his confirmation.
  We are particularly concerned about the opposition to Judge
Thomas. In many instances, there appears to be a double standard
being applied to Judge Thomas. In addition, some who oppose him
have said they are concerned because they think now that he has
made it, he has forgotten from whence he came and who helped
him get there.
  We believe that in action and words, Judge Thomas has demon-
strated over and over again that he has not forgotten. Anyone who
makes a statement such as the one made by Judge Thomas when
he said that he "was raised to survive under the totalitarianism of
segregation, not only without the active assistance of government
but with its active opposition." Judge Thomas added that he was
"raised to survive in spite of the dark, oppressive cloud of govern-
mentally sanctioned bigotry."
  Mr. Chairman, he has not forgotten. Judge Thomas is living
proof of the awesome accomplishments of the civil rights move-
ment. Judge Thomas has acknowledged the fact that he is a direct
beneficiary of the civil rights movement.
  Judge Thomas wrote in Integrated Education that "many of us
have walked through doors opened by the civil rights leaders; now
you must see that others do the same. As individuals who have re-
ceived the benefit of an education which was probably denied your
fathers and mothers, and in some cases, sisters and brothers, you
must devise a plan for a civil rights movement for the future."
  In a speech at Savannah State College, Judge Thomas said, "We
cannot forget the blood of the marchers, the prayers and hope of
our race."
  Mr. Chairman, these are not the words of a person who has for-
gotten.
  Critics seem to believe that just because Judge Thomas has
chosen a different road than they, that he must have forgotten
                                      922

where he began. In a speech to Holy Cross College on March 24,
1984, Judge Thomas did not forget when he said,

   Through my radical days, through my days at New Haven Legal Assistance,
through the summer working under a grant from the Law Students Civil Rights Re-
search Council, I did not forget. Through Holy Cross and Yale, I did not forget. As
assistant attorney general and assistant secretary, I did not forget. As chairman of
EEOC, I cannot and will not forget. I can never forget the agony of discrimination--
the humiliation of prejudice.

  In that speech, he went on to say,

  I am an American--a black American. Nothing hurts me so much as the suffer-
ings of my race. I firmly believe that the sufferings and the problems we face are so
great that all who recognize them must look for solutions. We need new ideas in our
arsenal of weapons to fight discrimination. At no time must we allow ourselves to
believe that we must agree on every issue. We are not robots. We are a creative,
resilient race. Just as we are different, we have different ideas and different opin-
ions.

  In these complex and troubled times, no one person or organiza-
tion can claim to have the only answer to solve our problems. If
they did, why are we still in this predicament?

  As I mentioned earlier, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority has made the
"black male crisis" our national project in 1991. We can think of
no better message to send to our black youth than Judge Clarence
Thomas. He should be the role model for those youth who have lost
all hope and have lost the ability to dream dreams.

  Yes, hard work, integrity, honesty, and intellectual independence
are valued in this society. Let Judge Thomas' appointment to the
U.S. Supreme Court show how much.

  The women of Zeta Phi Beta most definitely are in favor of the
nomination of Judge Thomas. We know without question that he is
exceptionally qualified to serve on the highest court of this Nation.
We know he will not forget our shared life experience as African-
Americans in this society. Nor do we fear that he will fail to hear
the pleas and cries for fairness by all persons.

  Thank you.

Judge Thomas Is living proof of the awesome accomplishments of the civil rights
movement Judge Thomas has acknowledged the fact that he is a direct beneficiary
of the dvH rights movement Judge Thomas wroteIn Integrated Educationthat"many

a speech at Savannah State College, Judge Thomas said: " We [cannot] forget the
blood of the marchers, the prayers and hope of our race." Mr. Chairman, these an not
the words of a person who hasforgotton.

Judge Thomas has demonstrated his compassion and deep commitment to the youth
of this country. No, he has not called a press conference or Issued news- releases
every time that he has helped a Mow human being. Instead he has worked quietly
and continuously to help those less fortunate, such as Ms 12 year old pen pal Horn
Georgia. Throughhis personal Interaction, Judge Thomas has Inspired both a young
black male and his mother to work hard to help the son reach his goal of becoming a
doctor. By his example, he has given this young man hope: if Clarence Thomas can
rise from the poorest of conditions in Pin Point, Georgia, to graduate from Yale Law
Schoolandbe nominated for the Supreme Court,mis young man can becomewhathe
                                            927

dreams to be.

Critics seem to believe that just because Judge Thomas has chosen a different road
than they, that he must have forgotten where he began. In a speech to Holy Cross
College on March 24,1984, Judge?Thomas did not forget when he said, "Through my
radical days, through my days at New Haven Legal Assistance, through the summer
workingundera grant from the Law Students Civil Rights Research Council, LMngL
foroet Through Holy Cross and Yale, Idldnotforaet. As Assistant Attorney General
and Assistant Secretary, I did not forget As Chairmanof the EEOC, I cannot andwill
not forpet I can never forget the agony of discrimination - the humiliation of
prejudice." In that speech he went on to say, 7 am an American - a black American.
Nothing hurts me so much as the sufferings of my race. I firmly believe that the
sufferings and the problems we face are so great that all who recognize ttmrmust
look for solutions. We need new* Ideas In our arsenal of weapons to fight
discrimination. At no time must we allow ourselves to believe that we must agree on
every Issue. We are not robots -we are a creative, resilient race. Just as we are
different we have different Ideas and differentopinions."

Mr. Chairman, he lias not forgotten how his grandfather was called boy or that his
grandmothercould not use certainrest rooms. Letme bring something to the attention
                                       928

of his critics whosaythatthe judge hasstated thatthe government hasno role to play
in eliminating discrimination. In a speech at an EEOC seminar on December 6,1983,
Pittsburgh, JudgeThomas declared that Tie Federal governmenthas always had bot
a profound mom obligationand a constitutional duty to protect Individual rights.
Increasingly that Ideal has gained the forceof the law. But, In the wordsof Frederick
Douglas, 'Power concedes nothing without a demand.' And, even the government di
not move decisively until the thunderous demand ot protest against Injustice could, no
longer, be ignored."

In mem complexand troubled times, no oneperson or organization canclaimto have
the only answer to solve our problems. If they did, why are we stU In this
predicament?

As I mentionedearlier, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority has madethe Black Male Crisis our

   Senator HEFLJN. Dr. Becton.

                   STATEMENT OF JULIUS BECTON, JR.

   Mr. BECTON. I am delighted to return briefly to this chamber. My
name is Julius Becton, and I am president of Prairie View A&M
University, part of the Texas A&M University System. And I
might add that I have a plane to catch in about 35 minutes.

  I am here to support the President's nomination of Clarence
Thomas to the Supreme Court.

  Prior to arriving at Prairie View in 1989, I directed the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, and before that, director of the
Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance in the Agency for Internation-
al Development. Prior to that, I served in the Army almost 40
years.

  It was during my tenure at FEMA that I first met Judge Clar-
ence Thomas, when he was the head of the EEOC. We were among
the very few black political appointees holding key Government po-
sitions at that time.

  The value, I hope, of my testimony today lies in my personal
belief in Judge Thomas as a man and as a compassionate civil serv-
ant. I recommend him as a Supreme Court Justice for several rea-
sons.

  I know him to be a good man, a many who sincerely wishes to
employ his authority as a civil servant for the betterment of socie-
ty. This includes his desire to promote the advancement of minori-
ties without infringing on the rights of the majority.

  This point is particularly critical in order to avoid reverse dis-
crimination, with the resulting backlash that goes with it. Too pro-
longed, too concentrated an effort to make up for past injustices
can create new injustices.

  As a footnote, in my judgment, such making up for the past can
also stifle individual initiative because we look to someone else,
usually government, to solve problems that are within our own
power to solve.

  Equal treatment, not preferential treatment, is what Judge
Thomas is all about.

  I would like to mention a few initiatives and actions of Judge
Thomas that recommend him as an effective judge and administra-
tor.

  As head of the EEOC, Judge Thomas enforced the laws against
employment discrimination. The office went to court 60 percent
more often than was done in previous years.

  His record on the Federal appeals court shows judicial restraint
rather than activism.

  There are two specific efforts in which Judge Thomas participat-
ed that illustrate a concern for the advancement of minorities--the
Minority Leaders Fellowship Program and the General Motors
agreement.

  In 1989, Judge Thomas encouraged the Washington Center to es-
tablish a Minority Leaders Fellowship Program whose concept is to
identify outstanding minority students who could benefit from an
internship in Washington, DC.
                                      931

  As chairman of the EEOC in 1983, Clarence Thomas signed a
$42.5 million 5-year agreement with General Motors Corp., which
was the largest nonlitigated settlement in EEOC history.

  Thirty-nine HBCU's, or historically black colleges and universi-
ties, received endowments as a result of his actions to enhance the
educational opportunities for students in the engineering and tech-
nological fields. Prairie View A&M University was one of those in-
stitutions aided through Judge Thomas' efforts. We received
$250,000.

  It is clear, at least to me, from these and other examples, that
Clarence Thomas has been concerned for quite some time about
correcting minority injustices by taking positive actions to resolve
them. I believe we all can agree that men and women of good will
can agree on the goal of helping minorities yet differ on the means
of achieving that goal. Their differences may be the result of oppos-
ing political philosophies, or based on a preference for alternative
strategies.

  I can empathize with the committee and your responsibility in
this hearing. You must offer your best advice and consent--not
your rubber stamp--in the matter of Clarence Thomas' nomination
to the Supreme Court. Therefore, I would urge that partisan poli-
tics be put aside in deciding on this lifetime appointment, just as a
justice must put aside mere personal predilections.

  Which leaves us with the evidence of the man himself: Clarence
Thomas' background, his service to his country, his recorded opin-
ions and actions. We all want good men and women on the Su-
preme Court in the sense that they have the intellectual compe-
tence to make crucial judgments on behalf of the Nation, and in
the sense that they have the moral values and conscience to guide
them through those difficult issues. It is appropriate that we
demand a high calibre individual for this position, for the justices
must distill a lifetime of education and experience and thought
into their judgments, yet they must look beyond themselves as in-
dividuals to the Nation's higher agenda.

  In this sense, Clarence Thomas would unquestionably serve this
country well on the Supreme Court.

  Thank you, sir.

                                                 The Senate Judiciary Committee

                                                          Washington, D.C.
                                                  Thursday, September 19,1991
    My name is Julius Becton, and I am president of Prairie View A&M University
in Texas-which is my alma mater, I am proud to say. I am speaking to you
today to recommend Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.

    Prior to arriving at Prairie View in 1989,1 directed the Federal Emergency

Management Agency and the U.S* Foreign Disaster Assistance,Agency for
International Development. Prior to that, I served in the U.S. Army foju40
years.

    It was during my time at FEMA that I knew Judge Clarence Thomas, when he
was head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We were among
the very few blacks holding key government positions at that time, and we
naturally became acquainted.

    The value of my testimony today lies in my personal familiarity with Judge
Thomas as a man and as a compassionate civil servant.

    I recommend Judge Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice for several reasons:
     I know him to be a good man--a man who sincerely wishes to employ his
authority as a civil servant for the betterment of society. This includes his
desire to promote the advancement of minorities, without infringing on the
rights of the majority.

                                                        --more--
                                         933

                                                           2.
        -- This point is particularly critical in order to avoid reverse

            discrimination, with the resulting backlash that goes with it. Too
             prolonged, too concentrated an effort to "make up" for past injustices
             can create new injustices.
        - As a footnote, in my judgement, such "making up for the past" can also
             stifle individual initiative, because we look to somebody else, usually
             government, to solve issues that are within our own power to solve.
        - Equal treatment not preferential treatment-is what Judge Thomas is
             about.
     I would like to mention several initiatives and actions of Judge Thomas
that recommend him as an effective judge and administrator:
         1. As head of the EEOC, Judge Thomas enforced the laws against
             employment discrimination. The Office went to court 60% more often
             than it had in previous years.
         2. His record on the federal appeals court shows judicial restraint,
             rather than activism. This merely means that his judgements were
             based on close readings of the law.
         3. His views of Brown vs. the Board of Education indicate that he is not in
             disagreement with the court's decision but that he finds the "natural
             law" approach of "inalienable rights" a stronger legal basis for a
             colorblind society than sociological data.
                                   934

                                                   3.
4. There are two efforts Judge Thomas participated in that illustrate a

    concern for the advancement of minorities:
    a. The Minority Leaders Fellowship Program:
    Judge Thomas encouraged the Washington Center to establish a
    Minority Leaders Fellowship Program in 1989.
    -- The concept of this program is to identify outstanding minority

         students who can benefit from an internship in Washington, D.C.
    -- Home institutions give the students academic credit, waive

         tuition and grant a $1,000 living stipend. The Washington Center
         provides scholarship funding for tuition and housing fees.
    -- Judge Thomas helped create the program's advisory board, which he
         served on, and he worked to design the program, identify speakers,
         and arrange a start-up endowment of $285,000.
    - The first $200,000 was set aside as an endowment, with $85,000
         providing assistance to students in the 1989 program.
    -- Mr. Bill Burke, President of the Washington Center, has said,
         " Mr. Thomas supported our program and encouraged us to do what
         we could to provide access to these minority students."

                                               -more--

                                                           4.
            b. The General Motors Agreement:

                As Chairman of the EEOC in 1983, Clarence Thomas signed a $42.5
                 million, five-year agreement with General Motors Corporation.
            - The largest non-litigated settlement in EEOC history, the agreement
                 resolved hundreds of employment discrimination claims against GM.
            - In addition, General Motors agreed to provide over $10 million in
                 endowments and scholarships for educational opportunities for
                 minorities and women--particularly in engineering and
                 technological fields where minorities have been underrepresented.
             - Many historically black universities received endowments, and
                 another $1 million in grants was provided to trade and technical
                 schools.
             ~ Prairie View A&M University was one of these institutions aided
                 through Clarence Thomas' efforts.
             - A grant of $250,000 was given to the university, and the same
                 amount was provided for a total of 39 universities, plus $50,000
                 going to Columbia University and $500,000 to the University of
                 Tulsa's Minority Business Development Center.
    It is clear from these and other examples that Clarence Thomas has been
concerned about correcting minority injustices by taking positive actions to
resolve them

                                                            5.
    We can all agree that men and women of good will can agree on the goal of
helping minorities yet differ on the means of achieving that goal.

        - Their differences may be the result of opposing political philosophies,
             or based on a preference for alternative strategies.

    I sympathize with the committee's responsibility in this hearing.
         -- You must offer your best advice and consent-not your rubber stamp,
             in the matter of .Cla/ence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court.
         -- Therefore, I would urge that partisan politics be put aside in deciding
             on this lifetime appointment, just as a justice must put aside merely
             personal predilections.

    Which leaves us with the evidence of the man himself: Clarence Thomas'
background, his service to his country, his recorded opinions and actions. (Let
me note that a man against the advancement of minorities would not have
played the crucial role that Clarence Thomas played in the Washington Center
program or the General Motors settlement.)

    We all want good men and women on the Supreme Court,
         - in the sense that they have the intellectual competence to make
             crucial judgements on behalf of the nation,
         - and in the sense that they have the moral values and conscience to
             guide them through difficult issues.

                                                           6.
    It is appropriate that we demand a high calibre individual for this position.
For the justices must distill a lifetime of education and experience and thought
into their judgements-yet they must look beyond themselves as individuals to
the nation's higher agenda.
    In this sense, Clarence Thomas would unquestionably serve our country well
on the Supreme Court.

  Senator HEFLIN. Thank you, Dr. Becton.
  I understand that Senator Biden wants some questions, but I will
go ahead right now.
  Senator Thurmond, do you have some questions?
  Senator THURMOND. I haven't asked any.
  Senator HEFLIN. I think we would excuse you, Dr. Becton, if
you--of course, the choice is yours--if you want to make that
plane.
  Mr. BECTON. I certainly would like to make that plane because I
have a board to face tomorrow morning in Texas.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, we will be glad to excuse you, and we
thank you for your testimony.
  Mr. BECTON. Thank you.
  Senator HEFLIN. Senator Thurmond?
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much.
  I want to welcome this panel here. I think you all made excellent
statements, and I appreciate your taking the time to come here
and testify on behalf of Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court.
  Now, without going into a lot of detail, I want to ask you the
same two questions I have asked many times through these hear-
ings. Do you feel that Clarence Thomas has the integrity, the pro-
fessional competence, and the judicial temperament to make a good
member of the U.S. Supreme Court?
  If you will answer that, Dr. Jenkins. I then would ask Ms.
Thomas.
  Mr. JENKINS. I do, Senator.
  Ms. THOMAS. I do, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. The other question is do you know of any
reason why Clarence Thomas should not be confirmed by this Com-
mittee and the Senate for the Supreme Court?
  Mr. JENKINS. I do not, Senator.
  Ms. THOMAS. I do not, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. Are you convinced from all that you know
about Clarence Thomas that he is well qualified to be an excellent
member of the Supreme Court of the United States?
  Mr. JENKINS. Yes, we do, Senator.
  Ms. THOMAS. Yes, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. That is all the questions I have. I want to
thank you very much for your appearance here. I think you made
good witnesses.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much, and I personally apolo-
gize for not being here. I was on the--right inside that door there
is a little phone booth, and I was on the telephone doing what I am
sure a lot of parents are doing, responding to a call from my son in
college. He called, he wanted to know if he should send me money.
That was the reason for the call. [Laughter.]
  But I sincerely apologize.
  And I know, Chancellor, you fully understand about college stu-
dents.
  Mr. JENKINS. Yes, sir, I fully understand.
  The CHAIRMAN. But I do appreciate your testimony. Thank you
both. Ms. Thomas, thank you very much for coming and taking the
time. Appreciate it.
  Our next panel
                                      939

  Senator HEFLIN. Senator Specter may have some questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Oh, I beg you pardon. I was told by the staff that
they were ready to break. I am really sorry.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask
one very brief question of each witness.
  The CHAIRMAN. Please.
  Senator SPECTER. Dr. Jenkins, you were here and heard the testi-
mony of the last panel, I believe.

   Mr. JENKINS. Yes, I was.

  Senator SPECTER. Because I know you have been patiently wait-
ing. There were some very strong testimony given by Mr. Julius
Chambers on behalf of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and his
essential position was that George Thomas was not qualified by
comparison to all of the 48 nominees who have been seated in the
Supreme Court, and he took strong exception to Judge Thomas'
views on education cases and voting rights cases, saying that Judge
Thomas had dismissed major decisions which had protected Afri-
can-Americans without regard to the historical background.

  If you have any comment or something to say on behalf of Judge
Thomas on those issues, I would be--I think the panel would be in-
terested to hear them.

  Mr. JENKINS. Senator, I would simply say to you that I am here
this evening because I find in the technical sense no reason to
question Judge Thomas' capabilities, and, in fact, worthiness to sit
on the Supreme Court, one.

  Two, I think there is a great deal of misinformation, and perhaps
even confusion, in terms of his interpretation or his view on vari-
ous issues that have been discussed here today. But I do know
clearly that in 1983 at Clark College in Atlanta, GA, he gave a
very moving speech about his concern for the survival of historical-
ly black colleges and universities, and he talked about the need to
not only protect those institutions, but he talked about the need to
enhance them so that they could continue to do the valuable job of
turning out black professionals in our society.

  And I am here this evening, sir, as a college president to actually
support that concept, because I believe that what we do is the very
best example of self-help. We are--we were there and we were born
because at some time in history we were not allowed to attend the
historically white institutions. And, in that best spirit, we orga-
nized and established the historically black colleges and universi-
ties.

  So, in a real sense I believe that our continued existence is the
shining example of self-help and helping America to solve its prob-
lems.

  Senator SPECTER. MS. Thomas, the comments made by Mr. Wil-
liam Lucy, president of the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists,
went to the issue of affirmative action. And Mr. Lucy was critical
of Judge Thomas on the ground that Judge Thomas was not help-
ing the group of African-Americans by refusing group help but
only interested in individual, specific cases of discrimination.

  And I would be interested if you agree with Judge Thomas who
generally opposes affirmative action, and how you would assess
that position of Judge Thomas' in terms of the interest of the Afri-
can-American community.
                                      940

  Ms. THOMAS. Senator, I am here in behalf of my sorority, and my
sorority has endorsed Judge Thomas very highly on his, maybe,
past contributions he has made to the Court and courts and what
have you.

  At this time I wouldn't want to say anything that my sorority
wouldn't approve of me saying. But we are on record as being sup-
portive of Judge Thomas and his works, and his contributions he
has made to the courts.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much. Thank you both.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. And, Chancellor, con-
gratulations on your 100th year.
  Mr. JENKINS. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. I wish your institution 100 more. I imagine you
will be seeing a fair amount of former Congressperson Bill Gray.

   Mr. JENKINS. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. I know he will be knocking on our doors to make
sure we are involved in--our doors, meaning us individually. He
has not been disinclined to ask for contributions for black colleges.

  Mr. JENKINS. Well, let it be noted, sir, that while we certainly
are in support of what Congressman Gray would be doing with the
United Negro College Fund, I represent a public black university
and we do not benefit from the funds of the United Negro College
Fund.

  The CHAIRMAN. Oh, you don't? Is that right?
  Mr. JENKINS. I think that that should be made very clear be-
cause I do believe that in a national sense people believe that such
a contribution contributes to all of the historically black colleges
and universities. That is not true, and that is not to create any con-
fusion or to not continue to wish the United Negro College Fund
well. It is simply to correct the record and let people know that we
do not benefit.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I am glad you told me that. I thought you
were a private institution.
  Mr. JENKINS. NO, we are a public institution.
  The CHAIRMAN. I see Senator Simon has come, and I hope he has
no questions. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMON. Just one.
  Ms. THOMAS. Mr. Chairman, excuse me. If I may interrupt you?
  The CHAIRMAN. Surely.
  Ms. THOMAS. I have a plane to catch.
  The CHAIRMAN. Please go. Go.
  Senator SIMON. YOU go right ahead.
  The CHAIRMAN. We don't pay attention to Simon anyway. We
don't.
  I am only kidding, obviously. I hope we haven't kept you too
long. And when you walk outside and you hear drums beating,
what you are hearing is, I was asked permission by the distin-
guished Senator from Alaska whether or not a festivity that was
being put on by the State of Alaska in the rotunda here in this
building would be able to go forward, notwithstanding the fact this
hearing was underway. It has been planned for sometime. I don't
think it is in any way interfering with any of the witnesses or us.
So, if you open the door, though, and you walk outside, it is not
                                      941

because you have suffered a long day. It is, in fact, there is an in-
teresting ceremony going on outside, and a number of Native
Americans and Eskimos are putting on folk dances outside the
door.

  Mr. JENKINS. I understand.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator.
  Senator SIMON. Yes. Dr. Jenkins, your school does not benefit di-
rectly from the Historically Black Colleges Act, I gather.
  Mr. JENKINS. Well, we were talking about the United Negro Col-
lege Fund.
  Senator SIMON. I understand.
  Mr. JENKINS. Right.
  Senator SIMON. But I am talking about the title under the
Higher Education Act.
  Mr. JENKINS. Oh, definite. Yes, sir, we do.
  Senator SIMON. YOU do?

   Mr. JENKINS. Yes.

  Senator SIMON. NOW, what would your attitude be toward the
nominee if you believed he would rule that unconstitutional?

  Mr. JENKINS. Well, Senator, let me say that I have prefaced my
statement, and indeed the motivation for my being here this
evening was due to the fact that the cases that I cited, as an exam-
ple the one with the General Motors settlement, as another case in
point, the one in which he spoke about the worthwhileness of these
institutions and why they should continue to be enhanced with
funds, led me to believe that he would not take such a position.

  Senator SIMON. I don't think there is any question that he be-
lieves these institutions do a good job.

  Mr. JENKINS. And that they should also be enhanced with addi-
tional funds going to them for upgrading libraries and other facili-
ties on the campuses.

  Senator SIMON. OK. But the question is additional funds. And, if
I may read from one of the things he has written.

  "I firmly insist that the Constitution be interpreted in a color-
blind fashion," and then he criticizes in this same writing "race
conscious legal devices."

  Now, it is pretty hard for me to read that and not come to the
conclusion that he would have serious problems with something
that is very vital to a great many institutions in this Nation that
are performing a huge service to the African-American community
as well as to the Nation.

  I just mention that because it is pretty difficult to read this and
not come to the conclusion that if there were a matter before the
Court he would rule it unconstitutional.

  Mr. JENKINS. I understand your statement, Senator. I would
simply say to you that because of the business that I am in certain-
ly I would not be amenable or acceptable in terms of looking at a
person who may take a position different from the position that I
take in terms of the fact that these institutions are treasures and
deserve to be preserved, but not only that, to be enhanced, and I
simply go by the statements that he has made in the past about
these institutions. I look also at this own background, and I draw
the assumption that given the opportunity to redress past discrimi-
                                         942

nation as relates to these institutions that he would opt for the side
of guaranteeing that these institutions would continue to survive.

   Senator SIMON. Thank you very much. I hope you are right, and
I thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Thank you very much, Chancellor.
   Mr. JENKINS. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Again, congratulations on your 100th.
  Mr. JENKINS. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you play Delaware State?
  Mr. JENKINS. NO, I do not, Senator.

  The CHAIRMAN. They are tough.
   Now, our next panel, we have combined two panels of witnesses
who are testifying in opposition to Judge Thomas' nomination, and
these witnesses are:
  Sharon McPahil, on behalf of the National Bar Association. Ms.
McPahil is president of the Detroit, MI, Chapter of the National
Bar Association. Welcome, Ms. McPahil.
  Adjoa Aiyetoro, National Director, National Conference of Black
Lawyers, welcome.
  Ms. AIYETORO. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did I pronounce it correctly?
  Ms. AIYETORO. Yes, you did. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. William Hou, Chair of the Legislative Com-
mittee for the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association.
Welcome, Mr. Hou.
  Mr. Hou. It is pronounced Hou.
  The CHAIRMAN. HOU. YOU may call me Bidden, if you would like.
[Laughter.]
  Ms. Leslie Seymore, vice chairperson of the National Black
Police Association. Welcome. Daniel Schulder, director of legisla-
tion for the National Council of Senior Citizens; Naida Axford,
president of the National Employment Lawyers Association; Rever-
end Bernard Taylor, chairman of the Black Expo Chicago, which
works with minority entrepreneurs. We have added Reverend
Taylor to this panel to accommodate his travel schedule, but appar-
ently we were not fully able to accommodate his travel schedule,
because he is not here, so what we will do is enter his statement in
the record.

  Senator SIMON. Yes, I was going to say he was here earlier.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know he was, and I wasn't being facetious
when I said that. I am sorry we were unable to get him on in time.
  Why don't we begin in the order you have been called on, unless
you have worked out as a panel a different way to proceed.
  Ms. McPahil, if you will begin first, please.

  Ms. MCPAHIL. Thank you.
  Chairman Biden, Senator Thurmond, members of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, I was going to say good afternoon, but good
evening. My name is Sharon McPahil. I am president of the Na-
tional Bar Association--a small correction, not the Detroit Chap-
ter, of the National Bar Association. We have approximately 73
chapters.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are president of the entire
  Ms. MCPAHIL. I am the national president, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have had the pleasure to speak to the National
Bar. It is quite an organization, and I apologize. I didn't realize--
we are going to fire three staff persons for that. All kidding aside, I
apologize.
  Ms. MCPAHIL. NO problem. Thank you.
  I am also a division chief in the Wayne County Prosecutors
Office, in Detroit, ML
  I am pleased to have this opportunity to come before you in my
first appearance before this committee as president of the NBA. I
have only been president for approximately 3 weeks. I appear
before you today on behalf of the National Bar to give voice to the
views and opinions of our members with regard to the nomination
of Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.
  The National Bar Association is the oldest and largest minority
bar association. We were founded in 1925, and we consist of a net-
work of approximately 14,000 African-American lawyers, jurists,
scholars and students. We have affiliate chapters throughout the
United States and in the Virgin Islands.
  Our purpose, among other things, is to advance the science of ju-
risprudence, to uphold the honor of the legal profession, to promote
social intercourse among the members of the bar, and to protect
the civil and political rights of all citizens of the United States.
  My term as president commenced August 10, 1991. On August 5,
after 7 hours of deliberation, the National Bar Association voted by
a very narrow margin to oppose the confirmation of Judge Thomas.
Our delegates voted 45 percent in opposition to the nomination, 44
percent in support of the nomination, and 11 percent to remain
neutral on his possible confirmation.
  As you can imagine, it was very difficult for us to make a deci-
sion about Judge Thomas. Never before in my memory has an issue
so troubled the association. As a group, we are always pleased
when one of our members is recognized for his achievements, and
we are especially pleased when one is given this unique opportuni-
ty to serve in one of the most powerful positions in this Nation.
  We are also cognizant of our responsibility to objectively assess
and present our views on the conformation of a Supreme Court
                                      944

nominee, who will have the ability to opine on matters that will
touch the lives of all Americans.

   Our analysis required us to be mindful of the impact that Judge
Thomas' philosophy might have on his ability to protect the inter-
ests of all Americans, particularly the disenfranchised, the poor,
and those who might otherwise not have a voice on the Supreme
Court. The decision was made even more difficult, because Clar-
ence Thomas is a member of our association.

  As we searched for consensus on this issue, there was unanimity
in our view that this confirmation hearing is also about the count-
less African-American people and other minorities who live in sub-
standard conditions, it is about the homeless, the crack babies and
the pregnant women who may not have a right to hear of their op-
tions regarding their reproductive rights.

  Finally, it is about those minorities in the United States who
look around every day and have to know that they don't matter to
some of the Justices who sit on the Supreme Court, who have
never had to face the obstacles that someone like Clarence Thomas
encounters on a daily basis.

  It is clear to the members of the National Bar Association that
equal opportunity is not the reality of this land, despite the pletho-
ra of court decisions and statutes to the contrary. From unskilled
jobs to the vice presidencies in major corporate America, we are
both under and unrepresented.

  Many delegates at our convention noted that the daily indigni-
ties that we suffer, as African-American attorneys, are pervasive,
and, thus, you can be assured that the problems of African-Ameri-
cans with less formal education and less affluence are even greater.

  Much like the problem that an African-American person in a
suit has in hailing a taxi, America's well-suited minorities every
day confront the subjective bias of white America. Given that sen-
sitivity, many of our delegates believed that when a person of color
is nominated, that fact alone is reason to support him.

  As our delegates debated this issue, it became clear that many
thought that the views articulated by Judge Thomas were contrary
to the traditional dogma of civil rights organizations. Some believe
that the National Bar, as a matter of integrity, in light of its histo-
ry of being at the forefront of the civil rights struggle, was duty-
bound to oppose him. It is in this context that the National Bar
Association was so closely divided in its vote to oppose the confir-
mation of Judge Thomas.

  The subliminal message of most of those who spoke during the
debate is not as conflicted. We pray that he will hear his grandpar-
ents' whispers, if confirmed, and his mother's voice as he struggles
to balance the twin debts of gratitude to those who afforded him
the opportunity to be considered for this honor, this appointment
to the Supreme Court, and to those who brought him here.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Ms. McPahil.
  Your organization is, in fact, one of the premier organizations of
the country, and it must have been very difficult.

   Ms. MCPAHIL. It was.

  The CHAIRMAN. But we thank you for being here.

                    STATEMENT OF ADJOA AIYETORO

  Ms. AIYETORO. Thank you, Chairman Biden.
  Chairman Biden and members of the Judiciary Committee,
thank you for allowing the National Conference of Black Lawyers,
through me as the director, to present this testimony before the
committee.
  The National Conference of Black Lawyers is an organization of
lawyers, judges, legal workers, and law students that was formed in
1968, specifically for the purpose of advocating for the rights of
black people specifically, and people of color, the poor and the dis-
advantaged generally.
  The organization has participated on all levels of advocacy, in-
cluding litigation and public education. You have our written testi-
mony.
  The CHAIRMAN. And it will be placed in the record, the entire
testimony.
  Ms. AIYETORO. Thank you very much.
  Our testimony discusses our position more fully than I will be
able to do in the 5 minutes allotted. I would like to briefly address
two main issues, however, in opposition to Judge Thomas' nomina-
tion.
  First, it is important that the significance of the nominee's race
to this process be explicitly in the record. We are disturbed that
the assessment of this candidate may be less strenuous by those
who view themselves as antiracist, because he is a black person
who, like many other black people in his age group or who came
before him, have risen to occupational levels that far exceed those
of their parents and even their siblings.
  We are disturbed that those who have adopted in deed, if not in
words, the philosophy of white supremacy are embracing him, be-
cause his blackness serves to mislead many in assessing his record,
a record which demonstrates, in large part, a disdain for the very
remedies he utilized to advance, when applied to persons of color
other than himself.
  Those who are confused, well-meaning of all races, hold onto the
hope not supported in his record, but somehow, if confirmed to the
Supreme Court, he will support the law it is now for people of
color, women and those in the fringes of society. They hope for a
miracle.
  We urge you to determine whether and how you are using this
candidate's race and to decide to refuse to confirm, based on a
record that demonstrates support for lawlessness and behavior that
is below the standard to be demanded of a Supreme Court Justice.
  It is true that the National Conference of Black Lawyers find a
number of Judge Thomas' views to be in direct contradiction with
the positions of this organization. We know you know this, because
we have outlined some of those differences in our written submis-
sion. But his views also reflect a character that is below the stand-
ards this body should demand, a man who, despite the law of the
land, refused to act to protect the rights of groups for whom he had
                                      946

responsibility; a man who ignored codified ethical requirements
and withheld information about the relationship between himself
and the family of the principal shareholders in a lawsuit potential-
ly costing them more than $10 million; a man who sat on the advi-
sory board of the Lincoln Review and attended a reception of the
South African Ambassador, yet indicates to this committee that he
did not know of any position in support of apartheid by the leader-
ship of the review, and he himself did not support apartheid; a
man who retracted position after position that he took prior to his
nomination and urged you to look at only his and other nominees'
comments as a judge, since they would be less effusive; a man who
humiliated his sister and family, but now flaunts the sister, indi-
cating her character is stronger than his.

  This nomination is an insult to not only black people, not only
the tradition of high integrity and character set by Thurgood Mar-
shall, but to the ideals of the Constitution and the Constitutional
Convention, that those who sit on the Highest Court will be those
with whom we can look with pride and respect, although we may
not always agree with them.

  We cannot look with pride and respect at Clarence Thomas, but
only with fear and trepidation, at how will continue to trample the
rights of people of color, the disadvantaged and women, not in con-
formity to the law, but in disdain for it and their collective rights.
We urge you to refuse to confirm.

  Thank you.

                                    948

         Chairperson Biden and Members of the Judiciary Committee, the

National Conference of Black Lawyers appreciates the opportunity

to testify before you on the nomination of Clarence Thomas as

Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. We urge you to refuse to
confirm Judge Thomas1 nomination.

        The National Conference of Black Lawyers (NCBL), founded in

1968, is a national organization composed of Black judges, law

professors, lawyers, law students and legal workers. The

organization was formed to advocate for economic, social and

political justice for people of color generally, and Black people

specifically. It provides legal assistance to communities of color

and develops educational forums to increase awareness of the

numerous issues that affect communities of color. It seeks to rid

the American legal system of racism and introduce law students to

alternative legal careers which advance social change.

         The NCBL believes that it is extremely important to confirm

a person of African descent to serve on this country's highest
court.1 However, of greater importance to NCBL and its members is

the confirmation of a candidate whose record demonstrates a clear

respect for the law combined with a compassion to securing

political, economic and social justice for the millions of people

         1 In nominating Judge Thomas, President Bush attempted to
deceive the American public by stating that, "[t]he fact that he
is black and a minority had nothing to do with this." Indeed,
Judge Thomas has been nominated to fill the seat left vacant by the
retirement of Justice Thurgood Marshall, the 96th Supreme Court
Justice and the only person of African descent to serve on the
Supreme Court in its 202-year history. This nomination also comes
on the heels of President Bush's veto of a Civil Rights Bill, while
at the same time he says he supports civil rights. The fact that
Judge Thomas is of African descent, thus, can hardly be a
coincidence.
                                    949

in this country excluded from the "American dream." Judge Thomas'
record demonstrates none of these aspirations. Clarence Thomas
scoffs at the legal values essential to maintaining the hard-won
rights to social, economic and political justice for people of
color, women, the disabled, the elderly, children and other
historically disadvantaged groups. There are any number of lawyers
and judges of African descent who have demonstrated respect for
these values. Judge Thomas' record2 indicates that he is not one
of those persons and for this reason he should not be confirmed.
Indeed, his record consistently reveals disrespect for the law and
for the rights of individuals and groups guaranteed by law. For
this reason, NCBL is testifying today in opposition to Judge
Thomas' confirmation as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

         Mr. Chairman, President Bush's nomination of Judge Thomas to
fill the seat vacated by Justice Marshall is an insult not only to
people of color and women but to the legacy of Justice Marshall.
His lackluster career supports our conclusion that the nomination
of Judge Thomas is meant to confuse and manipulate those who firmly
believe there should be a person of African descent on this Court
while solidifying a conservative majority. For over 50 years
Justice Marshall has been a champion of the constitutional, civil

                Our opposition to Judge Thomas' confirmation as an
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court rests on Judge Thomas'
record as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department
of Education, his eight-year tenure as Chair of the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC), his decisions as an
appellate judge of the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia and Judge Thomas' writings and speeches.

and human rights of people of color, women, the elderly and

differently-abled people in this country. Although Justice

Marshall's nomination to the Supreme Court was opposed in 1967 by

some members of this body because of his race, he was, unlike Judge
Thomas, eminently qualified for service on the Supreme Court.3 But

for the efforts of Justice Marshall, the NAACP and the NAACP LDF,

many, if not most of the Black lawyers in this country, including

Clarence Thomas, would not have graduated from law school - not

because we were unqualified, but because of the barriers, many of
which were governmentally imposed, that barred our admission.4

         As Professor Derrick Bell of Harvard University stated in

discussing Judge Thomas' qualifications to serve on the Supreme

Court, "[e]ven had Bush limited his selection pool to Black judges

on the federal courts of appeals, there are at least a half dozen

other Black judges whose accomplishments, both on the bench and

            Prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court, Justice
Marshall was a private attorney in Baltimore, Maryland; chief
counsel to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP); head of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund; an Appellate
Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit; and, Solicitor General of the United States.

            During his over 22-year tenure with the NAACP and NAACP
Legal Defense Fund, Justice Marshall argued 34 cases before the
Supreme Court and won 29. Among Justice Marshall's string of
victories, in addition to Brown v. Board of Education, was Sweat
v. Painter, decided four years prior to Brown. holding the
educational opportunities offered Black and Caucasian law students
by the State of Texas violated the 14th Amendment and directing
Texas to admit Herman Sweat into the University of Texas.

before becoming federal judges, put those of Thomas to shame."5
        Mr. Thomas, prior to his appointment to the Court of Appeals

in 1990, had very little litigation experience, functioning more
in administrative and legislative capacities. Indeed, he owes
virtually all of his employment experiences to his relationship to
Senator John Danforth. Upon graduation from law school in 1974, Mr.
Thomas served as an Assistant Attorney General for the State of
Missouri for less than three years. From January 1977 to August
1979, Mr. Thomas was an attorney in the law Department of the
Monsanto Company in Missouri. Thereafter, from August 1979 to May
1981, Mr. Thomas was a Legislative Assistant to Senator Danforth
of Missouri.

         In 1981, Mr. Thomas was appointed by then-President Reagan to
become Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the Department of
Education, a position he initially declined because, in his own
words "my career was not in civil rights and I had no intention of
moving into this area." In 1982, Mr. Thomas was appointed Chair of
the EEOC, a position he held until his confirmation to the Court
of Appeals in 1990. But even if one ignores his lack of litigation
experience, his administrative record and his speeches and writings
underscore his departure from the rule of law.

            JUDGE THOMAS' RECORD AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
        The Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education
(OCR) is responsible for insuring that educational institutions do
not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, handicap and age. The
OCR is responsible for enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
and Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1973.
        As Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights at the Department of
Education, Mr. Thomas, notwithstanding his professed admiration
and support of Black colleges, adopted positions that made it far
easier for the states to avoid their responsibility of ensuring
equality among all state financed educational institutions. When
Judge Thomas took office as Assistant Secretary, the Department had
been under court order since the early 1970s to implement
desegregation and to enhance Black colleges to make up for their
historical neglect by many southern governments.6 The court order
made clear that institutions which receive federal funds must do
more than just adopt non-discriminatory policies but also must take
affirmative steps, including elimination of duplicate programs as
well as enhancement of Black colleges.7

         During Thomas' first months at the agency, he began to
undermine enforcement of this court order by accepting state plans

which gave the states free reign to control desegregation efforts.
In accepting these higher education plans, the OCR waived
established guidelines that had the force of law. The positions
taken by the OCR under Thomas' leadership led to increased budget
reductions, admission constraints and other barriers that had a
negative effect on Black institutions of higher learning.

         In effect, Mr. Thomas, while Assistant Secretary for Civil
Rights, deliberately disobeyed a court order. He substituted his
own personal views for the court order, even though, as he admitted
in federal court, the beneficiaries under the civil rights laws
would have been helped by compliance with the court order.

                         JUDGE THOMAS' RECORD AS CHAIR OF THE
                     EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES COMMISSION
         Mr. Chairman, Judge Thomas' record as chair of the Equal
Employment Opportunities Commission alone warrants the rejection
of his nomination. As you are aware, the EEOC is responsible for
the enforcement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which
prohibits discrimination in employment based on race, color,
religion, sex or national origin; the Equal Pay Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, and Section 501 of the
Rehabilitation Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of
handicap by federal agencies. The EEOC is also responsible for
coordinating all equal employment programs in the federal work
place.
         During Mr. Thomas' eight-year tenure as Chair of the EEOC,
"[t]he EEOC effectively lost the role as lead agency conferred to
it by the historic Civil Rights Reorganization Act of 1978, not

                                                                 6
                                    954

because of any change in the law but by abdication to the Justice
Department."8 Specifically, during Mr. Thomas' administration,
the backlog of cases rose from 31,500 in 1983 to 46,000 in 1989;
while the number of class action suits filed by the EEOC actually
decreased from 218 in fiscal year 1980 to 129 in 1989. The number
of Equal Pay Act cases filed by the EEOC also declined under his
leadership. In 1980, 50 Equal Pay Act cases were filed. After
Thomas assumed leadership, there were nine cases in 1984; in FY
1985, ten; in FY 1986, twelve; in FY 1988, five, and in FY 1989,
seven cases.

         Although Judge Thomas attempted to justify the reduction in
class action cases by claiming that the agency was placing greater
emphasis on individual complainants, this was far from the truth.
In fact, the EEOC under Thomas' leadership saw a sharp decline in
the rate of remedies for individual claimants: settlement rates
plunged from 32.1 percent in 1980 to 13.9 percent in fiscal year
1989. A 1988 review by the General Accounting Office of the
investigations of charges that had been closed with "no cause"
determinations by six EEOC district offices and five states found
that 41 to 82 percent of the charges closed by the EEOC offices
were not fully investigated, and 40 to 87 percent of those closed
by the state agencies had not been fully investigated.9 Moreover,

Review. 601, 703 (1988).

according to Professor Herbert Hill, who formore than a quarter
of a century was the National Labor Director of the NAACP, during
Judge Thomas' tenure at the EEOC, "over 90 percent of all
litigation filed under Title VII" was initiated and conducted by
the private bar.10

         Further, in 1984 and again in 1985, without either a basis in
the prevailing case law or consultation with the various federal
agencies and interested parties, Judge Thomas unilaterally proposed
significant changes in the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection
Procedures. The Guidelines, adopted in 1978, were jointly drafted
and issued by the Department of Justice, the Department of Labor,
the Civil Service Commission (later renamed the Office of Personnel
Management) and the EEOC, with the solicited input of civil rights
groups. The purpose of the Guidelines is to provide employersand
others with a statement of the prevailing law on all selection
practices used to make employment decisions, including application
forms, educational requirements and standardized tests.11

         At the time, the Guidelines were based on Grigas v. Duke Power

the employer to the plaintiff, the rule established by Griaas -

that statistical evidence may be used to demonstrate disparate

because in his view they encouraged "too much reliance on

statistical disparities evidence of employment discrimination."14

York Times. December 3, 1984, at Al. In a March, 1985 speech to
Cascade Employers Association Thomas stated:

        We have permitted sociological and demographic realities to
        be manipulated to the point of surreality convenient legal
        theories such as adverse impact...we have locked amorphous,
         complex, and sometimes unexplainable social phenomena into
         legal theories that sound good to the public, please lawyers,
         fit legal precedents, but make no sense. If I have my way,
        we will have the legal theories conform to reality as opposed
         to reality being made to conform to legal theories.
Speech to Cascade Employers Association, p. 18 (March 13, 1985).

         In another speech in August, 1985, Thomas, attacking what he
believed was the rationale of the Guidelines and Griggs. said:

        The premise underlying [the Guidelines] is that but for
        unlawful discrimination by an employer, there would not be
        variations in the rates of hire or promotion of people of
        different races, sexes, or national origins...[The Guidelines]
        also see[m] to assume inherent inferiority of blacks,
        Hispanics, other minorities, and women by suggesting that they
         should not be held to the same standards as other people, even
         if those standards are race-and sex-neutral. Operating from
        these premises, [the Guidelines] ma[e] determinations of
        discrimination on the basis of a mechanical statistical rule
        that has no relationship to the plain meaning of the term

Thomas went so far as to criticize the merits of his own agency's
then-pending lawsuit against Sears, although it was consistent with
the theory of the Guidelines, stating that it "relies almost
exclusively on statistics." Through these machinations, Thomas
attempted to make proof of discrimination insurmountably difficult,
with total disregard for current law.

        Judge Thomas' unilateral attempt to revise the Uniform
Guidelines was not the only instance in which his actions while at
the EEOC demonstrated a lack of respect for the law and the rights
of victims of discrimination. Since 1979, the EEOC had on its
books regulations concerning affirmative action, adopted after
notice and comment pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act,
providing it with the authority to grant immunity under Title VII.
These regulations authorized employers to take affirmative action,
including goals and timetables to improve employment opportunities
for people of color and women. The "overview" of these regulations
published at the time of their adoption states:

         It is the Commission's interpretation that the appropriate
         voluntary affirmative action, or affirmative action pursuant
         to an administrative or judicial requirement, does not
         constitute unlawful discrimination in violation of the Act.
         Judge Thomas, who has variously attacked affirmative action
programs as creating "a narcotic of dependency" and "social

engineering," disapproved of the Affirmative Action Guidelines and,

thus, sought to evade them. In the fall of 1985, the EEOC Acting

General Counsel, with Judge Thomas' support, ordered EEOC regional

attorneys not to include goals and timetables in settlement

proposals or other actions in which the EEOC had intervened. In

addition, the Acting General Counsel ordered the EEOC legal staff

not to seek enforcement of goals and timetables in existing consent

decrees. Here again Judge Thomas' action demonstrated both

disrespect for the law and indifference to the rights of victims

of discrimination.

        Although Judge Thomas attempted to justify his rejection of

the use of goals and timetables on the basis of Firefighters v.
Stotts,16 his actions were legally and procedurally indefensible,

as Professor Alfred Blumrosen pointed out in opposing Thomas'

nomination to the Court of Appeals:

         If Chairman Thomas' view was that the use of goals and
        timetables was illegal after Stotts the proper course of
        administrative action was to suspend those sections of the
        Affirmative Action Guidelines which authorized their use. The
        Administrative Procedure Act permits an agency to act promptly
         in issuing or revising a rule when it finds for "good cause"
        that "notice and public procedures are impracticable,
        unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest." This would
        have allowed public notice of the EEOC's position, would have
        been based on a formal legal opinion which could then have
        been considered by the concerned community. But Chairman
        Thomas had a preference for private decisionmaking, rather
        than public participation.17

        Finally, in one of the most controversial and outrageous
incidents of his eight-year tenure at the EEOC, the EEOC allowed
more than 13,000 Age Discrimination in Employment (ADEA) claims to
lapse by failing to act within the prescribed time limits, thereby
compromising the discrimination claims of thousands of older
workers, who comprise more than one-third of the national work
force. Ultimately, Congress had to pass special legislation to
reinstate the rights of those older workers whose claims the EEOC
had failed to act on.

        As thirteen members of the House of Representatives with
oversight responsibilities for the EEOC expressed to President Bush
in a letter concerning Mr. Thomas' nomination to the Court of
Appeals: "during Mr. Thomas' administration, the Commission . . .
adopted policies involving pension accrual, supervised waivers,
apprenticeship exclusions and early incentive plans inimical to
ADEA's purpose - to encourage the employment of qualified older
workers." In a series of cases involving precisely the kinds of
early retirement plans the ADEA was designed to prohibit, the EEOC
sided with the employer. In Lusardi v. Xerox Corp. for example, the
EEOC declined to assist over 100 older workers who were faced with
an early retirement program and could not join a class action suit
because of a class cutoff date. The EEOC refused to assist the
workers even though the EEOC staff had found substantial reason to
believe that there was a company policy of targeting older, higher
paid employees for termination. In Paolillo v. Dresser Industries.

Inc..18 the EEOC, after the plaintiffs prevailed on appeal, filed
an amicus brief in support of the employer's request for a
modification of the decision. Specifically, the Commission argued
that the plaintiffs should have been forced to meet a higher
standard for showing coercion and that the plaintiffs should have
to carry the burden of proof on the question of voluntariness.

        NCBL is particularly outraged by Judge Thomas' treatment of
the discrimination complaints of elderly workers because, as
members of this Committee well know, people of African descent are
disproportionately represented among the ranks of the unemployed
and underemployed and consequently often have to work longer than
white workers.

                    JUDGE THOMAS' RECORD AS AN APPELLATE JUDGE
                        OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
                                FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

         Last year, when President Bush nominated Mr. Thomas for the
Court of Appeals, his nomination was opposed by various civil
rights and civil liberties organizations and individuals because
of his record at the EEOC and his otherwise slender legal
experience. In the less than two years since his appointment to
the Court of Appeals Judge Thomas has authored 20 opinions, most
of them in the area of criminal law and procedure and, in all but
one, he ruled against the defendant.

        People of color and the poor are disproportionately
represented as defendants in the criminal court. Judge Thomas'
lack of sensitivity to them as a group, evidenced by his record in

         18 821 F. 2d 81 (2nd Cir. 1987) .
                                                        13
                                 961

the Court of Appeals, combined with his record at the EEOC and OCR,
lead the NCBL to the opinion that his confirmation to the Supreme
Court would serve only to continue to eviscerate the hard-won
criminal procedural rights that once protected defendants from
governmental misconduct.

        Judge Thomas appears to be particularly insensitive to the
prejudice that may result from the joinder of offenses or of
defendants and the admission of prior convictions and acts. In
one case, for example, Judge Thomas affirmed the conviction of a
defendant who had requested and been denied a severance of his
trial, even though the attorney of one of his co-defendant's had
called him to testify, knowing he would refuse to do so,
undermining his constitutional rights against self-incrimination.19
In another case, United States v. Rogers.20 Judge Thomas authored
the opinion for the Court upholding a defendant's conviction over
his arguments that the district court had improperly admitted
evidence of his prior conviction and past ownership of a beeper.
The elevation to Supreme Court of Judge Thomas will certainly add
an additional vote to the increasingly conservative trend in the
Court in the area of criminal procedure, which this past term
overturned five of its own recent cases.

As a member of the Court of Appeals, Judge Thomas has also

demonstrated undue deference to federal agencies that suggests, in

particular, a disregard for the rights of workers and environmental

protection issues. In one case Judge Thomas rejected a union

challenge to a Labor Department decision permitting a mine owner

in Alabama, in violation of federal health and safety regulations,

to use a high-voltage electrical cable within 150 feet of a working

mineface over arguments by the union that use of such cables

increased miners' exposure to dust and methane, created ventilation

problems and made escape from the mines more difficult.21
         In another case, Citizens Against Burlington v. Busbv.zz a

group of Ohio citizens who live near the Toledo airport and who use

a park and campground near the airport challenged the Federal

Aviation Administration's (FAA) decision to allow expansion of the

airport. The Ohio citizens urged that expansion of alternative

airports where less environmental damage might occur be considered

by the FAA in its environmental impact statement. The law requires

consideration of "reasonable alternatives" in environmental impact

statements. Writing for the majority, Judge Thomas ruled against

the citizens and accepted the FAA's reasoning that the only

alternative needed to be considered was the goal of improving the

Toledo economy.  Judge Thomas' lack of sensitivity to the rights

of criminal defendants and apparent deference to federal agencies,

however, are not the only reasons for our concern over his record
at the Court of Appeals. We are also troubled by Judge Thomas1
lack sensitivity to the obligation of all judges, federal and
state, to maintain the integrity of the judicial process by
steadfast vigilance to the highest standard of ethical conduct.
In September 1990, in an apparent violation of the standards for
judicial conduct, Judge Thomas participated in and authored the
opinion for the Court in Alpo Petfoods Inc. v. Ralston Purina
Company.23 reducing a $10.4 million damage claim against Ralston
Purina Company, a corporation owned in large part by the family of
Judge Thomas1 personal friend and political mentor, Senator John
Danforth. Judge Thomas neither disclosed his relationship to
Senator Danforth or disqualified himself as required by federal
law.24

                          JUDGE THOMAS' WRITINGS AMD SPEECHES
         We are also troubled by Judge Thomas1 legal and judicial
philosophies expressed in his writings and speeches. In his
writings and speeches, Judge Thomas has demonstrated a disturbing
disdain for the members of the legislative branch and criticized
a number of important Supreme Court decisions. Judge Thomas has
written: "As Lt. Col. Oliver North made it perfectly clear last

              913 F.2d 958 (D.C. Cir. 1990).
              See 28 U.S.C. 455a; 28 U.S.C. 455e.

summer, it is Congress that is out of control." In a discussion
of the increasing role of the courts, Judge Thomas stated: "Not
that there is a great deal of principle in Congress itself. What
can one expect of a Congress that would pass the ethnic set-aside
the court upheld in Fullilove v. Klutznick." the 1980 ruling
establishing congressional power to enact minority set-aside
programs.26

         In addition to Fullilove. Judge Thomas has attacked the
Court's decisions in United Steel Workers v. Weber.27 Local 28 of
the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association v. EEOC.28 and
Johnson v. Transportation Agency. Santa Clara County 29 as
"egregious" examples of "creative interpretations of equal
protection and legislative intent."30 In the same article, Judge
Thomas, in a frightening display of ignorance of the importance of
the Fifth Amendment due process and equal protection guarantees to

District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and

elsewhere, stated "[a]ny equal protection component of the Fifth
Amendment due process is irrelevant."31

        Additionally, Judge Thomas has repeatedly expressed support

for the long discredited doctrine of "natural law." According to

Professor Lawrence Tribe, Thomas is the first Supreme Court nominee

in 50 years to "maintain that natural law should be readily
consulted in constitutional interpretation."32 As one Supreme Court

justice wrote in dissenting from the Court's natural rights

analysis in a 1798 probate case: "The ideas of natural justice are

regulated by no fixed standard: the ablest and the purest men have
differed upon the subject. . . . "33 The last time the Supreme Court

applied the natural law doctrine some 80 years ago, the Court held

that the Constitution protects such economic rights as the

"liberty" of employers to conduct business free of health and
safety regulations and minimum wage laws.34

         31 && e.g. Boiling v. Sharpe.347 U.S. 497 (1954) (holding

          If Judge Thomas is appointed to the Supreme Court, his views
with respect to natural law may have a drastic consequence. In a
1987 speech to the Heritage Foundation, for example, Judge Thomas
praised as "a splendid example of applying natural law" an article
that argued notonly for the overruling of Roe v. Wade.35 but for
the recognition of an "inalienable right to life of the child-
about-to-be-born (a person)." Judge Thomas has also criticized the
majority and concurring opinions in Griswold v. State of
Connecticut.M a decision that gave married couples the right to
purchase birth control.

        NCBL and its members are deeply concerned by the Supreme
Court's possible reversal of Roe v. Wade because women of color and
poor women were overwhelmingly overrepresented among the women who
died, were left sterile or suffered other serious medical
complications as a result of illegal abortions prior to the Court's
decision inRoe. In 1972, prior toRoe, women of color represented
64% ofthe deaths associated with illegal abortion,37 and they would
be similarly endangered upon Roe's reversal.

          Overturning Roe will also leave women even more vulnerable
to the recent trend in criminal prosecution for prenatal conduct.
This strategy punishes women rather than providing them with
necessary health care. It has been wielded disproportionately

against women of color.58 Despite equal rates of drug and alcohol

use across race and class, women of color amd low-income women have

been found to be ten times more likely to be reported for prenatal
conduct.39 Low income women and women of color are

disproportionately subject to such prosecution because their only

access to health care is through public facilities where drug

testing of pregnant women is also routine.

        Finally, NCBL is deeply troubled by both Thomas's apparent

support for the current South African government and his lending

of the prestige of his office to efforts supporting the racist

regime in South Africa. For the past ten years Mr. Thomas has

served has a member of the Editorial Advisory Board of the Lincoln

Review, the quarterly publication of the Lincoln Institute for

Research and Education, founded by J. A. Parker, who is a paid

agent of the racist government of South Africa and who has been
described as Thomas' political mentor.40 Mr. Parker and one of the

         Our serious concerns about this nominee are not assuaged by
Judge Thomas* attempts, in the last few days, to downplay his
extreme views, his loyalty to which he has manifested through years
of action, writing and speeches. His sudden inconsistency and
professed sensitivity neither negate the deeds of the past nor
inspire confidence in his ability or sincerity in the future to
uphold and apply the law and to act to ensure that the rights of
the disadvantaged in this country are protected.

                       STATEMENT OF WILLIAM HOU

  Mr. Hou. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the committee.
  The National Asian Pacific-American Bar Association, NAPABA,
with several thousand members, is the national organization of
Asian Pacific-American Attorneys. NAPABA represents the profes-
sional concerns of its membership, and promotes the interests of
the fastest growing minority group in this country, the Asian Pacif-
ic-American community.
  NAPABA encourages the nomination of minority candidates to
the Supreme Court and believes that, once confirmed, such Jus-
tices, with a perspective that may otherwise be absent, can play a
vital role in the deliberations of the court.
  However, while Judge Thomas' background is appealing, it is
not, in and of itself, a sufficient basis to support his nomination.
Indeed, NAPABA, after careful review and deliberation of Judge
Thomas' record, opposes his nomination to the Supreme Court for
the reasons set forth in the written statement which we have sub-
mitted to the committee.
  The CHAIRMAN. Which will be placed in the record, as well. All
of your statements will be placed in the record in full--all of your
written statements, if that is what you desire.
  Mr. Hou. Yes, it is. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  My testimony today will focus on two aspects of Judge Thomas'
views that are especially disturbing from an Asian Pacific-Ameri-
can perspective.
  The first is the potentially troubling ramifications of Judge
Thomas' flirtation with natural law principles as a basis for judi-
cial decisions. In particular, Judge Thomas readily cites Justice
Harlan's dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson as "one of our best examples
of natural rights or higher law jurisprudence."
  In his dissent, which is often credited for the concept of a color-
blind constitution, Justice Harlan, nonetheless, referred, with tacit
approval, to racist Chinese Exclusion Acts, writing--

  There is a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging
to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few
exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race.

  Moreover, 2 years later, in United States v. WongKim Ark, Jus-
tice Harlan opposed the majority's decision to permit a man of Chi-
nese descent who was born in this country to re-enter the United
States upon his return from a visit to China. The dissent, joined by
Justice Harlan, described the Chinese as, "of a distinct race and re-
ligion, apparently incapable of assimilating with our own people,
who might endanger good order, and be injurious to the public in-
terests."

   Fortunately, Justice Harlan's position excluding Chinese from
this great country did not prevail.

   Not only am I, as an American of Chinese ancestry, honored to
testify at these proceedings but, on a more personal note, I am
                                      970
grateful, as my parents, both of whom were born in China, did not
meet until after coming to America.

  NAPABA does not mean to suggest that Judge Thomas condones
Justice Harlan's views regarding the Chinese. Indeed, Judge
Thomas has, himself, characterized Justice Harlan's comments as
inappropriate. Nonetheless, such remarks vividly illustrate that
the singling out of an ethnic group for unequal and unjust treat-
ment is not necessarily inconsistent with the natural law analysis
praised by Judge Thomas, raising serious questions about his nomi-
nation.

  NAPABA's second concern is Judge Thomas' portrayal of Asian
Pacific-Americans as a minority group whose accomplishments jus-
tify opposition to affirmative action. Specifically, Judge Thomas
has asserted that because Asian Pacific-Americans have "substan-
tially greater family incomes than whites," they have "transcended
the ravages caused even by harsh legal and social discrimination."

  He has also stated that Asian Pacific-Americans should not be
the beneficiaries of affirmative action, because they are "overrepre-
sented." NAPABA categorically rejects Judge Thomas' assertions
which are inaccurate and misleading generalizations of the Asian
Pacific-American experience.

  For instance, among the Filipino, Asian, Indian, and Vietnamese
communities, average family incomes are only a fraction of the av-
erage for Caucasian families. Moreover, a crucial contributing
factor to the incomes enjoyed by Chinese-, Japanese-, and Korean-
American families, is simply the fact that more family members
work than in other households.

  Further, Asian Pacific-Americans are not overrepresented. In a
recent study which reaffirmed the existence of the glass ceiling
phenomenon, whereby qualified minority candidates are not pro-
moted to senior management positions, the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights concluded that United States born Asian Pacific-Amer-
ican men are "less likely to be in managerial positions than whites
with comparable skills and characteristics."

  In embracing stereotypes and cliches, that is the "model-minori-
ty" myth, Judge Thomas displays insensitivity to the very real dif-
ficulties confronting Asian Pacific-Americans. Moreover, it is be-
lieved that Asian Pacific-Americans are not appropriate candidates
for remedies such as affirmative action raises significant concerns,
should Judge Thomas be called upon to adjudicate a discrimination
claim brought by members of our community.

  For the foregoing reasons, the National Asian Pacific-American
Bar Association opposes Judge Thomas' nomination to the Su-
preme Court of the United States.

  Thank you.

The compelling nature of his life story, however, is not in and of itself a sufficient basis
to support his nomination.

                Evaluating Judge Thomas' suitability for lifelong tenure on the Supreme
Court poses certain difficulties. Because Judge Thomas was only recently appointed
to the U.S. Court of Appeals, his judicial record, the traditional primary source for
evaluating a Supreme Court nominee, does not provide adequate information to
evaluate his nomination. However, Judge Thomas has in other contexts spoken and
written on topics such as affirmative action, employment discrimination, race, and
judicial philosophy.

                Based upon Judge Thomas' record, NAPABAhas concluded that he should
not be confirmed. First, the examples of "natural law" which Judge Thomas has
advocated as appropriate for construing the Constitution have disturbing implications.
Second, his inaccurate characterization of the Asian Pacific American community in his
attempts to justify opposition to affirmative action are a cause of concern. Finally, his
views on employment discrimination are contrary to previously well-settled law.

                In addition to the aforementioned areas of particular interest from an
Asian Pacific American perspective, there are a number of other factors, such as Judge
Thomas' record while he served at the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of
Education and as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which
were also considered by NAPABA. Our concerns about that record have been aptly
presented at these proceedings by other witnesses opposing Judge Thomas' nomination
and therefore will not be repeated herein.

ANALYSIS

        A. Judge Thomas' advocacy of "natural law" has troubling
                ramifications.

                Judge Thomas has, in numerous articles and speeches, advocated the
application of "natural law" concepts in construing the Constitution. His flirtation with
natural law principles as a basis for judicial decisions has troubling ramifications, as
can be readily seen from examining several Supreme Court cases mentioning or
involving Asian Pacific Americans.

                For instance. Judge Thomas has repeatedly praised as "one of our best
examples of natural rights or higher law jurisprudence" Justice Harlan's dissent in
Plessy v. Ferguson. 163 U.S. 53TtI896JTa Supreme Court case which espoused the
"separate but equal" doctrine and upheld a Louisiana law requiring railroad companies
to segregate their passenger cars based on race. Although Justice Harlan rejected the
"separate but equal" doctrine in his dissent which is often cited for the concept of a
"color-blind" Constitution, he nonetheless referred, with tacit approval, to the racist
                                       973

NAPABA Statement
Page 3

Chinese Exclusion Acts: "There is a race so different from our own that we do not
permit those belonging to it to become citizens of the United States. Persons belonging
to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely excluded from our country. I allude to the
Chinese race." 163 U.S. at 561.

               Moreover, two years after Plessv. the Supreme Court held in United States
v. Wong Kim Ark. 169 U.S. 649 (1898), that pursuant to the plain language of the
Fourteenth Amendment, any person born in the United States, under its jurisdiction,
is a citizen. Thus, a man of Ch'~ese descent who was born in this country was allowed
to re-enter the United States following a visit to China. Significantly, Justice Harlan
joined the dissent in arguing for his exclusion. In its analysis, the dissent quoted
favorably from another case, Fong Yue Ting v. United States. 149 U.S. 698 (1893),
describing the Chinese as "of a distinct race and religion . . . apparently incapable of
assimilating with our people . . . (who)... might endanger good order, and be injurious
to the public interests. . .." 169 U.S. at 731. The Wong Kim Ark dissent then
proclaimed: "It is not to be admitted that the children of persons so situated become
citizens by the accident of birth." Id. at 731-732.

                While NAPABA does not mean to suggest that Judge Thomas condones
Justice Harlan's views regarding the Chinese, it is clear that Judge Thomas is fully
aware of Justice Harlan's remarks in the Plessy dissent. Indeed, Judge Thomas, in an
article defending Justice Harlan's analysis, has himself admitted that Justice Harlan's
views on the Chinese are "opprobrious." Thomas, Toward a "Plain Reading" of the
Constitution - the Declaration of Independence in Constitutional Interpretation, 30
Howard L.J. No.4 at 993 (1987). Nonetheless. Harlan's dissent in the Plessy and Wong
Kim Ark cases vividly illustrate that the singling out of an ethnic group for unequal and
unjust treatment is not necessarily inconsistent with the natural law analysis praised
by Judge Thomas. That such overt racism is so readily evident - in a context selected
by Judge Thomas himself - reflects poorly on the desirability of the theory and raises
serious questions about the suitability of a Supreme Court candidate who has often
commented favorably on the application of such natural law principles to judicial
decisions.

        B. Judge Thomas inaccurately portrays the Asian Pacific
                American experience in his attempt to justify opposition
                to affirmative action.

        Judge Thomas has portrayed Asian Pacific Americans as a minority group whose
accomplishmentsjustify opposition toaffirmative action as a remedy for discrimination.
"Thomas Lowell and the Heritage of Lincoln: Ethnicity and Individual Freedom," 8
Lincoln Review 7 (1988). Specifically, Judge Thomas asserts that because Asian Pacific
Americans have "substantially greater family incomes than whites", they have
"transcended the ravages caused even by harsh legal and social discrimination". Id. at
15. He goes on to state that Asian Pacific Americans are "overrepresented" in areas
                                    974

NAPABA Statement
Page 4

such as employment opportunities and hence, are not deserving beneficiaries of
affirmative action as a remedy for discrimination. Id. at 16. NAPABA categorically
rejects Judge Thomas' conclusions.

               Judge Thomas' assertions are inaccurate and misleading generalizations
of the Asian Pacific American experience. For example, with respect to family income,
Judge Thomas fails to recognize the struggles of various ethnic groups which comprise
the Asian Pacific American community. Had Judge Thomas investigated further, he
would have found that among the Filipino American, Asian Indian American and
Vietnamese American communities, average family incomes are only a fraction of the
incomes of comparable Caucasian families. U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, The
Economic Status of Americans of Asian Descent. 1988 at 8. Moreover, a crucial
contributing factor to the incomes enjoyed by Chinese American, Japanese American
and Korean American families is simply the fact that more family members work than
in the average household. Id., at 9. Other Asian Pacific American households are larger
than average so that when family incomes are adjusted on a per capita basis, the
relative economic status of such Asian Pacific American families falls substantially. Id.
Unfortunately, Judge Thomas is evidently content to accept the stereotypes and myths
that continue to plague the Asian Pacific American community.

               Further, NAPABA disagrees with Judge Thomas' belief that Asian Pacific
Americans are overrepresented. In a 1988 study which reaffirmed the existence of the
"glass-ceiling" phenomenon whereby qualified minority candidates are not promoted
to senior management positions, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights noted that U.S.-
born Asian Pacific American men are "lesslikely to be in managerial positions than are
whites with comparable skills and characteristics". Id., at 13. In embracing stereotypes
and cliches (that is, the "model-minority" myth), Judge Thomas fails to recognize the
very real difficulties and barriers confronting Asian Pacific Americans. Moreover, his
belief that Asian Pacific Americans are not appropriate candidates for remedies such
as affirmative action raises significant concerns should Judge Thomas be called upon
to adjudicate a discrimination claim brought by Asian Pacific Americans.

       C. Judge Thomas' view* on employment discrimination
                are in opposition to well-settled law.

               Judge Thomas has made numerous statements and has taken actions
while at the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education and as Chairman of
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that bring into serious question both
his commitment to effective remedies to discrimination as well as his adherence to well
established legal principles. In particular. Judge Thomas has repeatedly stated that
statistical evidence is much overused in employment discrimination cases. Yet,
statistical evidence is often extremely important in both proving and remedying
employment discrimination.
                                    975

NAPABA Statement
Page 5

         One type of claim which relies extensively on statistics is known as an "adverse
impact" case. Restricting the use of statistics as a method of proof would essentially
eliminate the ability to prove such cases, to the significant detriment of Asian Pacific
Americans. For example, Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio. 490 U.S. 642 (1989),
involved alleged discrimination against Filipino American cannery workers that was
manifested by the segregation of those workers into inferior jobs and living conditions.
As a result of the severe limitations place on the use of statistics to demonstrate the
segregation, it was not possible for those Filipino American workers to obtain relief.

               Second, even in "disparate treatment" cases, statistics often are used to
buttress a discrimination claim. For example, if an Asian Pacific American believes
that he or she was not promoted to a managerial position because of discrimination (i.e..
the "glass ceiling"), an important element of proving the existence of discrimination
would likely include evidence that the employer has consistently passed over other
qualified Asian Pacific Americans (UL. statistical evidence).

                In addition to making it significantly harder for those who have been
discriminated against to prove their cases, Judge Thomas' views on goals and
timetables would severely limit a victim's remedies. Because Judge Thomas, in his
writings and speeches, has indicated his opposition to the use of goals and timetables
against even proven and persistent discriminators, his views are contrary to recent
Supreme Court decisions which have endorsed the use of goals and timetables when
the defendant has discriminated against the protected group in the past. See, e.g..
United States v. Paradise. 480 U.S. 149 (1987); Firefighters v. Cleveland. 478 U.S. 501
(1986); Local 28 Sheet Metal Workers Internat'l v. EEOC. 478 U.S. 421 (1986).
Criticizing these well-settled decisions, Judge Thomas, in his capacity as EEOC
Chairman, opposed "race conscious" relief distributing opportunities on the basis of race
or gender.

CONCLUSION

                NAPABA's opposition is the result of a careful review of Judge Thomas'
record as a public official, his writing and his speeches.

               Judge Thomas' documented advocacy of the application of "natural law"
principles to judicial decisions has disturbing ramifications and raises serious doubts
about his suitability to serve as a member of the highest court in this country.

                NAPABA is also concerned by Judge Thomas' attempts to use the Asian
Pacific American community as a basis to justify opposition to affirmative action. Not
only are such attempts inaccurate and contrary to established facts, but Judge Thomas'
apparent readiness to embrace racial stereotypes and cliches is disturbing and raises
significant concerns should Judge Thomas be called upon to adjudicate a
discrimination claim brought by Asian Pacific Americans.

NAPABA Statement
Page 6

               Finally, the evidence is clear that Judge Thomas' opposition to using
statistical evidence to prove discrimination, and his narrow view of appropriate
remedies once discrimination is established, would impair severely an employment
discrimination victim's ability to prove a discrimination case and to be made whole.

               For the foregoing reasons, the National Asian Pacific American Bar
Association opposes the nomination of the Honorable Clarence Thomas to the Supreme
Court of the United States and urges that he not be confirmed by the United States
Senate.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, and thank you for being under the

                   STATEMENT OF LESLIE SEYMORE
  Ms. SEYMORE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee.
  The testimony being presented today is in opposition to the nomi-
nation of Clarence Thomas to the position of Associate Justice of
the U.S. Supreme Court.
  In this time in the history of our country's judicial process, all
citizens must be very concerned about the nomination of Judge
Thomas. The following testimony is presented on behalf of the Na-
tional Black Police Association, an advocacy organization which
represents over 140 chapters of African-American police officers,
nationally.
  In our recent annual conference, of which two-thirds of our
member chapters were present, the issue of President Bush's nomi-
nation of Clarence Thomas as an Associate Justice was discussed.
After a careful presentation of the facts and materials surrounding
Judge Thomas' record and career as a public official, the National
Black Police Association voted to oppose his nomination.
  Our purpose here today is to reiterate and reaffirm our opposi-
tion to the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme
Court for the following reasons.
  Clarence Thomas is opposed to affirmative action and other rem-
edies for racial discrimination. He has repeatedly stated that any
race-conscious remedy is no good. However, the courts have repeat-
edly provided such relief to minorities and women in order to ad-
dress racial disparities in areas such as employment, education and
housing. Surely, as African-Americans in our Nation's police de-
partments, the use of affirmative action and other remedies for
racial discrimination has provided us with the opportunity to make
our communities and neighborhoods safe from crime and violence.
  Since our beginning in 1972, the number of African-American of-
ficers has grown from less than 20,000 to over 48,000 today. In spite
of Clarence Thomas' leadership as Chairman of the EEOC, there
has been a 100 percent increase in the number of African-Ameri-
can police officers in the past 20 years.
  After Judge Thomas' appointment as head of the EEOC, and the
implementation of changes in its procedures, we have fewer Afri-
can-Americans and women employed in police departments today
than 10 years ago. Without affirmative action and other remedies,
America would be a very different place. Access to opportunity is a
key constitutional right, which cannot be compromised.
  Bruce Wright, in his book "Black Robes, White Justice," had the
following to say about minority progress.

  Many blacks in the criminal justice system and in unrelated professions are bit-
terly amused by the white cry of "preferential treatment," "quotas," "affirmative
action," and "reverse discrimination." These terms wage intellectual and ideological
warfare against minority progress. Groups have surfaced demanding "white power,"
as though the locus of power has ever been with the blacks. The American Revolu-
tion stands as a precedent for how much white victims of oppression accept before
they rebel. It is thus that the oppressed, when liberated, become the oppressors.
                                      978
  During his brief period of service on the U.S. Court of Appeals of
the District of Columbia, Judge Thomas has repeatedly ruled
against the accused in the face of alleged police or prosecutorial ex-
cesses. A court with Clarence Thomas serving as an Associate Jus-
tice could permit more American citizens to be abused and incar-
cerated.
  To illustrate this point, in March 1991, the U.S. Supreme Court
voted five to four to allow confessions obtained in violation of a de-
fendant's consitutional rights. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's
opinion states there may be other evidence of guilt that the use of
an involuntary confession could be considered harmless error. The
issue of "harmless error" analysis has been urged by the Bush ad-
ministration.
  Following on the heels of that decision was another ruling con-
cerning the detaining of suspects. The Court ruled that suspects ar-
rested without a warrant generally may be jailed for as long as 48
hours before a judge determines the validity of the arrest. By a five
to four margin, the court ruled that "prompt" generally means 48
hours.
  These two rulings have far-reaching implications. Some might
argue these rulings are indeed needed to address the increasing
crime rate, delays in the court system, and overcrowded jails.
Nonetheless, can we afford to relinquish our basic constitutional
rights in the process?
  Based on the testimony we have heard from Judge Thomas
during these hearings, there is little to indicate any resistance he
may have toward continuing the increased power of police and
other police agencies--an increase in power which ultimately may
lead to a police state in our own country.
  The precedent set by the Court's recent rulings is frightening. As
African-American police officers, we totally reject the notion that
his behavior is necessary to increase the quality of life and the ab-
sence of crime in our community.
  Lastly, we disagree with those individuals who argue Clarence
Thomas is an important role model for young African-Americans.
In the past week we have been inundated with recollections of
Judge Thomas' humble beginnings. I do not wish to refute nor
negate the significance of his background or personal experiences,
however, this committee should not allow itself to become entan-
gled in the bitter-sweet musings of his hardships, for the hardships
of Clarence Thomas are no greater nor harder than those of the
average hardships of numerous African-American males his age or
older.
  President Bush's nomination of Clarence Thomas has created an
illusion of a progressive, fair-minded administration. Yet, the irony
is that this nomination is an attempt to a satisfy a quota--a
remedy which Clarence Thomas opposes. It is fair to say that the
majority of African-Americans are proud to see one of their own
achieve success. However, tokenism cannot be a factor in selecting
the next Supreme Court Justice. The hard questions of Judge
Thomas' philosophy and future direction as an Associate Justice
has not been adequately addressed by this committee.
                                      979
  In conclusion, let me end with the following quote by Edwin
Markham: "One of the tragedies of life is that once a deed is done,
the consequences are beyond our control."
  Thank you.

testimony being presented today is in opposition to the nomination
of Clarence Thomas to the position of Associate Justice of the
United States Supreme Court. At this time in the history of our
country's judicial process, all citizens must be very concerned

        The following testimony is presented on behalf of the National

(2/3) of our member chapters were present, the issue of President

        Our purpose here today is to reiterate and reaffirm our
opposition to the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. supreme
Court for the following reasons:

        AFFIRMATIVE ACTIOM
        Clarence Thomas is opposed to affirmative action and other
remedies for racial discrimination. He has repeatedly stated that
"any race-conscious remedy" is no good. However, the courts have

repeatedly provided such relief to minorities and women in order to
address racial disparities in areas such as employment, education
and housing.

         Surely, as African Americans in our nation's police
department, the use of affirmative action and other remedies for
racial discrimination has provided us with the opportunity to make
our communities and neighborhoods safe from crime and violence.
Since our beginning in 1972, the number of African American
officers has grown from less than 20,000 to over 48,000 today. In
spite of Clarence Thomas' leadership as Chairman of the EEOC,
there has been a one-hundred (100%) percent increase in the number
of African American police officers in the past twenty years.

        After Judge Thomas' appointment as head of the EEOC and the
implementation of changes in its procedures, we have fewer African
Americans and women employed in police departments today than ten
(10) years ago. Without affirmative action and other remedies,
America would be a very different place. Access to opportunity is

oppression accept before they rebel. It is thus that the oppressed
when liberated become the oppressors."

        CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND INDIVIDUAL PROTECTION
         During his brief period of service on the U.S. Court of
Appeals of the District of Columbia, Judge Thomas has repeatedly
ruled against the accused in the face of alleged police or
prosecutorial excesses. A court with Clarence Thomas serving as an
Associate Justice could permit more American citizens to be abused
and incarcerated.

         To illustrate this point, in March 1991, the U.S. Supreme
Court voted 5 to 4 to allow confessions obtained in violation of a
defendant's constitutional rights. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist's opinion states there may be other evidence of guilt
that the use of an involuntary confession could be considered
"harmless error". The issue of "harmless error" analysis had been

urged by the Bush Administration. Following on the heels of that
decision was another ruling concerning the detaining of suspects.

         The Court ruled that suspects arrested, without a warrant,
generally may be jailed for as long as 48 hours, before a judge
determines the validity of the arrest. By a 5 to 4 margin, the
court ruled that "prompt" generally means within 48 hours.

        These two rulings have far reaching implications. Some might
argue these rulings are indeed needed to address the increasing
crime rate, delays in the court system, and overcrowded jails.
Nonetheless, can we afford to relinquish our basic constitutional
rights in the process? Based on the testimony we have heard from
Judge Thomas during these hearings, there is little to indicate any
resistance he may have towards continuing the increased power of
police and other police agencies. An increase in power which
ultimately may lead to a "police state" in our own country.

        The precedent set by the Court's recent rulings is
frightening. As African American police officers, we totally
reject the notion that this behavior is necessary to increase the
quality of life and the absence of crime in our community.

        Lastly, we disagree with those individuals who argue that

Clarence Thomas is an important role model for young African
Americans. In the past week, we have been inundated with
recollections of Judge Thomas' "humble beginnings'*. I do not wish
to refute nor negate the significance of his background nor
personal experiences. However, this Committee should not allow
itself to become entangled in the "bitter-sweet musings" of his
hardships; for the hardships of Clarence Thomas are no greater nor
harder than those of the average hardships of numerous African
American males his age or older.

         President Bush's nomination of Clarence Thomas has created an
illusion of a progressive, fair-minded administration. Yet, the
irony is that this nomination is an attempt to satisfy a "quota" --
a remedy which Clarence Thomas opposes. It is fair to say that the
majority of African Americans are proud to see "one of their own"
achieve success. However, tokenism cannot be a factor in selecting
the next Supreme Court Justice. The hard questions of Judge
Thomas' philosophy and future direction as an Associate Justice has
not been adequately addressed by this Committee.

         In conclusion, let me end with the following quote by Edwin
Markhamj, "one of the tragedies of life is that once a deed is done,
the consequences are beyond our control".

   Senator SIMON [presiding]. Mr. Schulder.

                    STATEMENT OF DANIEL SCHULDER

  Mr. SCHULDER. Thank you, Senator, and in behalf of the National
Council of Senior Citizens, and our 5 million members, and 5,000
local clubs and State councils, I thank this committee for this op-
portunity to comment on the nomination of Judge Clarence
Thomas to the Supreme Court.

  As an advocacy organization, we support public and private ac-
tivities and policies which advance the rights and needs of older
persons, their families, and their communities. Over the past three
decades we have placed ourselves at the side of workers, women,
minorities, persons with disabilities, young people, and senior citi-
zens, in their struggle for economic and social justice, and for full
and effective civil rights.

  Since its enactment in 1967, our organization has supported the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act's expansion of rights and
protections for working people, and its public policy objective to en-
courage older persons to continue to work and earn, and to contrib-
ute to the economies of their families and their communities.

  We believe that Judge Thomas' record as Chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission marks him as a man whose
official actions served to diminish the rights of older workers under
the ADEA--the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. We be-
lieve that instead of creating a climate in which employers knew
that discriminatory actions against older workers would be met
with swift and sure sanctions and penalties, he sent signals that
told employers that it was permissible to discriminate against older
workers in pension, apprenticeship, early retirement and in exit in-
centive programs.

  Under his administration as Chairman of EEOC for 8 years,
thousands of older workers lost their rights to sue for relief against
discriminatory practices, by allowing charges to lapse, or to be
summarily closed without full, or any, investigation in many cases.

  Over a period of years, his EEOC policies resulted in bipartisan
congressional criticism, leading to numerous congressional inter-
ventions to protect the rights of workers, and to ensure that the
clear language and intent of ADEA was enforced.

  Mr. Chairman, we believe that allegations of Judge Thomas' mis-
conduct in administering ADEA are well documented by commit-
tees and organs of this Congress, including the Senate and House
Committees on Aging, the House Government Operations Commit-
tee, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, the
General Accounting Office, and the frequent actions of the full
Congress in changing and reversing policies and practices of the
Thomas-led EEOC.

  His record as Chairman provides the best material description of
his philosophy of law, his responsiveness to the intent of the Con-
gress, his concern for the rights of average persons facing economic
hardships, and his adherence to consistent principles of justice and
equity.

  I should point out that his job--his position--as Chairman of
EEOC was his longest public or private job.
                                         987

  Finally, Mr. Chairman, we trust that this committee can ac-
knowledge that the corrosive influence of age discrimination ranks
with racism, sexism and religious and ethnic bigotry in its effects
on individuals and on the larger society and economy. Both racism
and ageism assault the core human dignity of their victims.

  That is why we have striven to fight the persistence of age
stereotyping that remains a pervasive and virulent aspect of this
Nation s labor market and that is why we find Judge Thomas' fail-
ures to administer the ADEA fairly so profoundly distressing.

  During Judge Thomas' tenure as chair, the EEOC caused thou-
sands of older workers to lose their rights and relief under ADEA
by its failure to investigate in a timely fashion charges of job dis-
crimination.

  We are not aware of any similar level of nonfeasance involving
title VII or the Equal Pay Act. Older workers, as a class, in our
view, were at the bottom of the Thomas EEOC priority system.

  This committee and other committees of this Congress have al-
ready explored this issue at great length. The General Accounting
Office in 1988 also offered to this Congress a review of, and a study
of the lapsed charges.

  I think these documents show that senior members of EEO staff
strove to inform Judge Thomas of this problem and he refused to
listen, he refused to change the procedures. And this led, of course,
to the issuance of a subpoena by the Senate Committee on Aging in
1988 and only then did Judge Thomas begin to come clean with the
real story of the 15,000 persons whose charges lapsed under his
chairmanship.

  There are other issues where we feel that Judge Thomas failed to
protect the rights of older persons. He supported rules that allowed
employers to stop paying into the pension accounts of workers who
exercised their ADEA right to work beyond the age of 65. Such
workers lost millions of dollars in pension benefits until the Con-
gress, itself, overruled the EEOC on this matter in 1986.

  He failed to prohibit the practices of many employers who de-
manded that older workers waive their ADEA rights in exchange
for early retirement benefits in often coercive circumstances. The
Congress was forced to repeatedly overrule the EEOC position and
finally prohibited this practice in 1990. And he fails to include ap-
prenticeship programs under the purview of ADEA despite the
clear language of the act.

  In other cases, such as Lusardi v. Xerox, Cipriano v. Board of
Education, and Paolillo v. Dresser Industries we find Judge Thomas
consistently overruling his own staff in EEOC and taking positions
either not to issue complaints, and in fact, to move on the side of
employers in court cases.

  In summary, Mr. Chairman, responsible persons cannot properly
take an oath to enforce certain laws, and once in office work con-
sistently to undermine those very laws. We believe that Judge
Thomas' tenure at EEOC demonstrates a consistent and dangerous
bias against the interests of older persons in the work force
through unwarranted interpretation of law and precedent.

  He repeatedly defied the clear instructions of the Congress and
required an unprecedented degree of bipartisan congressional over-
sight and corrective intervention. We further believe that Judge
                                      988
Thomas consistently interpreted the ADEA from the vantage point
of employers contesting the claims of workers seeking fair treat-
ment rather than from the point of neutrality.

  Mr. Chairman, the Supreme Court must remain, in the long-
term, the Nation's symbol of fairness and justice. Judge Thomas'
placement on that Court will surely not buttress that symbolic po-
sition in the hearts and hopes of the American people.

  Thank you.

       In behalf of the National Council of Senior Citizens and our
five million members and five thousand local clubs and State
Councils, I thank this Committee for this opportunity to state our
views regarding the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the
position of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

       As an advocacy organization, we support public and private
activities and policies which advance the rights and needs of
older persons, their families and their communities. Over the
past three decades we have placed ourselves at the side of
workers, women, minorities, persons with disabilities, young
people and senior citizens in their struggles for economic and
social justice and for full and effective civil rights.

       Many of our members continue to work and to remain active in
trade unions and other work-related organizations. All of our
members support the right of citizens to continue to work beyond
normal retirement age for as long as they desire or for as long as
they must to meet economic needs. We have therefore been
enthusiastic supporters of programs designed to assist such older
workers and to protect their rights in the workplace.

       Since its enactment in 1967, NCSC has supported the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act's expansion of rights and
protections for working people and its public policy objective to
encourage older Americans to continue to work and earn. We agreed
                                991

                                -2-

in 1967 with the findings of the Secretary of Labor's report to
the Congress urging passage of the ADEA which found that:

       1) Many employers adopted specific age limits in those states

that did not have age discrimination prohibitions even though
many other employers were able to operate successfully in the
absence of these limits;

2) In the aggregate, the age limits had a marked effect on

the employment of older workers;

3) Although age discrimination rarely was based on the sort

of animus motivating other forms of discrimination (e.g.,

racial, religious, union), age discrimination was based on
stereotypes unsupported by objective fact and was often

defended on grounds different from its actual causes;

4)  The available empirical evidence demonstrated that

arbitrary age limits were in fact generally unfounded and
that, overall, the performance of older workers was at least
as good as that of younger workers;

5) Arbitrary age discrimination was profoundly harmful in at
least two ways: It deprived the national economy of the

productive labor of millions of individuals and imposed on the

U.S. Treasury substantially increased costs in unemployment
insurance and Social Security benefits and, it inflicted
economic and psychological injury to those workers who were

deprived of employment because of age discrimination.

In turn, the Acts' preamble makes it clear that the statute is

to be used to encourage the employment of older workers and to
provide the machinery to insure that such workers are treated
equally and fairly in the terms, conditions, benefits and

privileges of such employment.
                                      992

                                                                 _ o _
       We believe that Judge Thomas' record as Chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission marks him as a man whose
official actions served to diminish the rights of older workers
under the ADEA. We believed that instead of creating a climate in
which employers know that discriminatory actions against older
workers would be met with swift and sure sanctions and penalties,
he sent signals which told employers that it was permissible to
discriminate against older workers in pension plans,
apprenticeship programs, early retirement programs and in exit
incentive programs. Under his administration as Chair of EEOC for
eight years, thousands of older workers lost their rights to sue
for relief against discriminatory practices by allowing charges to
lapse without any or full investigation.
       Over a period of years, Judge Thomas' policies resulted in
bipartisan Congressional criticism and conflict leading to
numerous Congressional interventions to protect the rights of
workers and to insure that the clear language and intent of ADEA
was enforced.
       We believe that a fair reading of Judge Thomas' full record as
EEOC Chair does not define him as a person fully committed to the
principles of equal justice and independent enforcement of the
laws.
       Further, we believe that allegations of Judge Thomas'
misconduct in administering ADEA are well documented by Committees
of the Congress including the Senate Special Committee on Aging,
the House Select Committee on Aging, the House Government
Operations Committee, the Senate Committee on Labor and Human
Resources, the General Accounting Office and the actions of
                                     993

                                                         -4-
the full Congress in changing and reversing policies and actions
of the Thomas-led EEOC.

       We believe that the Committee should thoroughly review these
hearings and reports prior to final judgment on Judge Thomas'
qualifications for the Supreme Court. To not do so would be a
serious abdication of the Judiciary Committee's solemn
responsibility to fully explore his qualifications and record. We
should note that his position as Chair of the EEOC was his longest
public or private job. His record as Chair provides the best
material description of his philosophy of law, his responsiveness
to the intent of the Congress, his concern for the rights of
average persons facing economic hardship and his adherence to
consistent principles of justice and equity. We believe that a
review of the EEOC record alone will be sufficient to present
evidence of his lack of qualifications for the Court.

       Finally, Mr. Chairman, we believe that it is critical that
this Committee acknowledge that the corrosive influences of age
discrimination rank with racism, sexism and religious and ethnic
bigotry in its effects on individuals and on the larger society
and economy. Both racism and ageism assault the core human
dignity of victims. If, in this current recession, you can't find
work because you are Black or because you are age 55, the results
are the same. You are diminished and spiritually disabled. You
are found wanting and vulnerable because of factors beyond your
control or desire. That is why NCSC has striven to fight the
persistence of age stereotyping that remains a pervasive and
virulent aspect of this nation's labor market. That is why we
find Judge Thomas' failures to administer the ADEA fairly so

                                                         -5-
profoundly distressing and deserving of this public call for
rejection of his nomination.
Lapsing of ADEA Complaints

       During Judge Thomas' tenure as Chair, the EEOC caused
thousands of older workers to lose their rights and relief under
ADEA by its failure to investigate, in a timely fashion, charges
of job discrimination. We are not aware of any similar level of
nonfeasance involving Title VII or the EPA. Older workers, as a
class, were at the bottom of the Thomas-EEOC priority system.

       This issue was extensively explored by this Committee at the
February, 1990 hearing on Judge Thomas' nomination to the Court of
Appeals. The reports of the Senate Special Committee on Aging,
under Senator John Melcher in the 100th Congress, provides
documentation on the matter of EEOC treatment of ADEA charges
including refusals to investigate and the closing of thousands of
additional charges not fully investigated. The study by the GAO
(GAO/HRD-89-11, October, 1988) provides conclusive evidence of
attempts of senior EEOC staff to move Judge Thomas to act on the
crisis of unprocessed ADEA charges. He not only refused to reform
the EEOC machinery to provide full justice for ADEA complainants,
but he also clearly attempted to mislead -the Congress regarding
the extent of the lapsed charges and the premature closing of
charges. As the record shows, it took a bipartisan vote of the
Senate Aging Committee authorizing a subpoena to force Judge
Thomas to begin to tell the truth about the extent of the scandal
affecting upwards of 15,000 persons. Even at his Court of Appeals
hearing before this Committee (see attachments--letters of AARP &
NCOA to Judiciary Committee), Judge Thomas continued to dissemble
and to try to shift blame to state agencies and others.
995

       This public record demonstrates that Judge Thomas was unable
or unwilling to assure equitable and complete treatment of older
workers' complaints by the EEOC during his tenure. It is not

arguably a case of faulty computers or records systems.

The Senate Aging Committee and GAO reports nail the

responsibility to Judge Thomas' EEOC desk.  That failure

translates to a deliberate decision to distort the Congressional

intent that older workers were to be provided the full protection
of the law. There is no other warranted conclusion.
Pension Benefit Accruals

In 1979, when the Department of Labor was administering the

enforcement of ADEA, a DOL interpretive bulletin was issued

allowing employers with pension plans to stop pension benefit
accruals to the accounts of persons working beyond the "normal"

retirement age. Thus, the pension benefits of persons working

beyond the normal retirement age were effectively frozen--a strong
incentive to leave work.

       In 1984, EEOC appropriately voted to rescind the policy. In
1985, the EEOC Commissioners approved implementing regulations.

However, in 1986, after consultation with the White House, the
EEOC reversed itself and let the pension freeze stand. A
subsequent court action against EEOC forced a rescinding of the

DOL rule, but an order to EEOC to issue rules governing continued

pension accrual was reversed on appeal.

The Congress resolved the matter under PL 99-509 (OBRA-1986)

requiring employers to continue accrual of benefits under certain
conditions. Senator Charles Grassley was author of the Amendment.

After months of EEOC and IRS conflict, the final rule governing

accrual was issued effective early 1989.
                                      996

                                                         -7-
       However, the continual shifting of EEOC positions and the
conflicts with IRS effectively delayed implementation of the new
statute. The net result caused uncertainties regarding the
pension rights of many workers.
       There have been estimates that the workers affected by EEOC's
refusal to rescind the clearly illegal DOC interpretative bulletin
are losing $450 million annually. During this period (1979-1988)
the EEOC prevented older workers from bringing private suits to
give them full pension credits. Employers who claimed to be
acting on the basis of government regulation could not be held
liable under the existing EEOC rules.
       It was only the intense pressures generated by aging groups
and the bipartisan insistence of Members of the Congress that
finally resolved the matter belatedly in favor of tens of
thousands of older workers whose loses were substantial
nevertheless.
Unsupervised Waivers of ADEA Rights
       The ADEA utilizes the enforcement standards (by incorporation)
of the Fair Labor Standards Act under which an employer seeking a
worker's waiver of rights or settlement of claims under the ADEA
must first secure permission of EEOC or a court. With such
protection, older workers can preserve rights to sue under ADEA in
situations where employers use undue pressures toward early
retirement or additional termination benefits. The forcing out of
older workers in the face of company down-sizing is probably the
most pervasive form of employment age discrimination after refusal
to hire because of age.
       In 1985, Thomas proposed sweeping new regulations which would
have permitted unsupervised ADEA waivers and which would have
                                      997

                                                         -8-
shielded employers from ADEA suits even if it could be shown later
that layoffs or early-out arrangements were subterfuges for
replacement by younger workers.

       This proposal was made in the face of clear ADEA language
prohibiting such waivers and with wide-scale acknowledgement of
the potential abuse of such waivers. EEOC issued its rule in 1987
after extensive negative comment by the Congress and aging groups.

       It is clear that the Congress realized the extent of this
Thomas error when it unanimously suspended the rule for fiscal
years 1988, 1989 and 1990. Finally, through the Older Workers'
Benefit Protection Act (Pub. L. 101-433) the Congress repealed the
EEOC rule. Among the Members actively supporting the repeal was
Senator Dan Quayle (R-Iowa).

       Unfortunately, during this entire period while the full
Congress took concerted actions to suspend the rule, EEOC, under
Judge Thomas' direction, refused to consider suits involving
unsupervised waivers. Such workers thus lost their rights to
reinstatement or other compensation.
Other Issues

       In 1987, Thomas and the Commission abstained from one of the
most important age discrimination cases since passage of the Age
Act. In Lusardi v. Xerox Corporation, the company laid off 1,300
employees by offering them benefits upon early retirement. The
layoff affected a significant portion of the company's older
workers, who filed a private class action in federal court.
However, many others were not part of the private lawsuit and
sought assistance from the EEOC.

       EEOC investigators found substantial evidence that Xerox had
engaged in a corporate policy to target its older, higher-paid
                                      998

                                                         -9-
workers for termination and to hire younger, lower-paid workers to
replace them. According to the older workers, they had accepted
the early retirement plan because they were told that otherwise
they would be terminated without benefits through a
reduction-in-force.

       Thomas met with the Commission in closed session to determine
whether to file suit against the company. During the meeting,
Thomas essentially approved of the company's practice, observing,
"This is a standard practice in industry. I don't know why Xerox
is the only one we are after." He brushed aside arguments that
the threat of a reduction-in-force constituted coercion, saying,
"I think it constitutes reality." In addition, Thomas ignored the
fact that the early retirement benefits were less than the amount
which would have been received if the worker had retired at age 65.

       In another case, Thomas not only declined to defend the older
worker but also took the employer's side. In Cipriano v. Board of
Education, the school board offered early retirement incentives
to employees aged 55 to 60, but not to those over age 60. The
EEOC general counsel drafted a brief contending that the Board had
violated the Age Act and that the early retirement plan was
structured to discourage older workers from remaining employed
past age 60.

       Thomas and another Commissioner believed that the plan was
lawful and that forcing the employer to offer equal benefits to
older workers would impose too heavy a cost on the employer. The
Commission ordered another attorney to rewrite the brief, taking
the employer's side.

       Older workers representing themselves in Paolillo v. Dresser
Industries, Inc.. 821 F.2d 81 (2d Cir. 1987), succeeded in
                                      999

                                                         -10-
convincing the court that their employer had coerced them into
accepting early retirement. However, the EEOC subsequently filed
a brief siding with the corporate employer, requesting a
modification of the court's opinion that would essentially weaken
the Age Act.

       Beyond these landmark cases displaying Thomas' anti-older
worker biases, the Committee should note the EEOC record regarding
the application of disparate impact procedures to ADEA cases.
While the ADEA, at Section 1625.7(d), clearly authorizes the use
of disparate impact factors in considering complaints, Judge
Thomas consistently refused, as EEOC Chairman, to apply disparate
impact analysis to such claims. This application of personal
theory to EEOC/ADEA procedures considerably weakened EEOC's
abilities to pursue class action strategies in behalf of older
workers. This position was held despite nearly unanimous
decisions of Federal appellate courts applying disparate impact
analysis to ADEA charges.

       Additionally, despite the lack of any exclusionary language in
ADEA, Thomas refused to apply ADEA to apprenticeship training
programs. Although the Commission in 1984 voted to rescind an
earlier DOL rule excluding such programs from ADEA, EEOC declined
to ever issue rules to assure ADEA coverage. In fact, in 1987,
EEOC reversed itself and voted again to exclude apprenticeships
from ADEA coverage.
Summary

       Responsible persons cannot properly take an oath to enforce
certain laws and, once in office, work consistently to undermine
them. We believe that Judge Thomas' tenure at EEOC demonstrates a
consistent and dangerous bias against the interests of older

persons in the workforce through unwarranted interpretation of law
and precedent. We believe that he failed to administer ADEA in an
effective manner and that this resulted in the loss of the rights
of thousands of persons whose ADEA claims lapsed. We believe that
Judge Thomas repeatedly defied the clear will and instructions of
the Congress and required an unprecedented degree of bipartisan
Congressional oversight and corrective intervention. We further
believe that Judge Thomas consistently interpreted the ADEA from
the vantage point of employers contesting the claims of workers
for fair treatment.

       Because of this record, we question his respect for the rule
of law and for his honesty in dealing with the Congress in regard
to fundamental rights of citizens. The Supreme Court must remain,
in the long term, the ultimate symbol of fairness and justice.
Judge Thomas' placement on the Court will not buttress that
symbolic position in the hearts and hopes of the American people.

                    Dear Chairman Bideni

                           He are appalled over misleading statements made by
                    EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas at his confirmation hearing
                    regarding his agency's failure to enforce the federal Age
                    Discrimination in Employment Act for thousands of older
                    Americans.

                           The Committee confronted Chairman Thomas with evidence
                    that close to 2,000 new age discrimination victims have
                    lost their right to file suit in court because of the
                    failure to process their claims within the two-year
                    statute of limitations. We emphasize that these are new
                    lapses, which have been discovered since the passage of
                    the Age Discrimination Claims Assistance Act in April of
                    1988. That Act extended protection to thousands of
                    complaintants whose ADEA charges were mishandled and
                    neglected by EEOC prior to 1988 and under Mr. Thomas'
                    administration.

                           The bulk of these complaints were filed with state and
                    local fair employment practices agencies which have
                    contracts with the EEOC to investigate complaints filed
                    under federal anti-discrimination laws. Chairman Thomas
                    and the Commissioners approve every such contract.

                           Several times during the hearing, Mr. Thomas attempted
                    to shift blame for both past and current lapsed ADEA
                    charges away from him. He stated that an ADEA charge
                    filed with a FEPA is actually filed under state law, which
                    is false. According to the agency's own guidelines, an
                    ADEA charge may be filed with a state-sponsored agency and

                    A nonprofit agency working to improve the lives of Older Americans
                                     1002

                                                        -2-

may be accompanied by related claims under state law, but it
remains a federal claim and invokes the protection of the federal
law.

       Mr. Thomas also implied that the EEOC's responsibility for an
ADEA charge filed with a FEPA begins only when the FEPA returns
the charge for contract credit within 18 months of the date of
violation. That is also erroneous. As its rules make clear, the
EEOC is required to docket, monitor and review every federal
charge handled by the FEPAs. Upon the initial filing, the
charges are entered into EEOC's national database, and the FEPA
investigations are supposedly monitored by the EEOC's field
offices.

             It is simply amazing that Mr. Thomas proffers these
excuses for failure to enforce the law. There is no question that
the EEOC retains ultimate responsibility for FEPA-processed ADEA
charges. Contrary to what Mr.Thomas may have the Committee
believe, the EEOC cannot contract away the ADEA rights of older
Americans. The FEPAs act directly as agents of the EEOC in
processing federal charges.

       We have witnessed Mr. Thomas's capacity for evasion before
Congressional committees on other occasions, and we believe that
he is being less than candid with the Judiciary Committee about
the extent of his agency's responsibility for the newly lapsed
ADEA charges. During the same hearings, he misrepresented the
facts to Senator Heflin regarding the number of charges lapsing
in prior years. He stated that only 900 had lapsed, when his own
agency reported to the Senate Aging Committee that possibly
13,000 charges had lapsed. (The actual number is unknown because
of the agency's prior policy of destroying files six months after
closure.)

       We believe that it would be a serious mistake to place on the
federal bench an official who has repeatedly shown a disregard of
the law and a willingness to mislead the Committee on important
points of fact. On behalf of older workers and those who wish to
preserve and advance their rights under law, we urge you not to
confirm this nominee.

                                                       Sincerely,

Committee on the Judiciary

Washington, O.C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond and Members of the
Committee:

The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) requests
that this letter be made part of the record of the
confirmation hearings on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to
the U.S. Court of Appeals. The purpose of this letter is to
correct inaccurate statements made by Mr. Thomas at his
confirmation hearing on February 6, 1990, and to express
AARP's serious concern about his commitment to enforcing the
law without regard to his personal wishes.

Mr. Thomas's testimony reveals a fundamental lack of
understanding of both the laws he has been charged with
enforcing for the past eight years and the regulations and
procedures of the agency he has chaired. Taken as a whole,
Mr. Thomas's testimony exhibits the same disregard for the
rights of older workers that we have seen during his tenure
at the EEOC.

The areas of Mr. Thomas's testimony that evidence these
problems include:

              His incorrect assumption that the loss of federal
              civil rights due to agency inaction can be excused by
              the existence of a similar state law.

              His refusal to accept responsibility for, and his
              misstatements regarding, the EEOC's continued failure
              to process on a timely basis charges under the Age
               Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). As a
               result, thousands of older workers have lost their
               rights under the law.

               His misstatements of the case law to erroneously
               justify EEOC's rules on unsupervised ADEA waivers.

              His misstatements regarding the EEOC's obligation to
              rescind admittedly illegal regulations that permitted
              employers to deny older workers full and fair pension
              benefits.

The inaccuracies in Mr. Thomas's testimony are discussed in
more detail below.

1. Mr. Thomas's Testimony on Lapsed Federal ADEA Charges
     Processed bv PBPAa.

AARP was shocked to learn at the February 6, 1990,
confirmation hearing that the EEOC has continued to forfeit
the rights of thousands of older workers by failing to
process charges brought under the ADEA within the required
two year statute of limitations.

Even more disturbing is Mr. Thomas's assumption that the
lapsing of federal ADEA claims is not a problem for victims
of age discrimination because they retain similar state law
claims. This is a remarkable -- and incorrect -- view of
federal law for someone who has been charged with enforcing
fundamental federal rights and who has been nominated to
become a federal appeals court judge.

When the problem of lapsed charges was initially discovered
in 1987 by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Mr. Thomas
personally committed himself to resolving a situation that he
called "totally inexcusable." Apparently, he has made little
effort to do so. Even more disturbing, Mr. Thomas now seeks
to avoid responsibility for the EEOC's continued malfeasance
by divorcing himself and the EEOC from the actions of the
state and local agencies that processed these charges on
behalf of the Commission.

In his testimony, Mr. Thomas acknowledged that for the period
from April 6, 1988 to July 27, 1989, more than 1500 charges
of age discrimination were not processed by the agency within
the ADEA's two year statute of limitations. It is unclear
whether the charging parties received notice of this problem.
The older workers who filed these charges have lost their
right to pursue their claims in federal court under federal
                                   1005

  law.

  When asked to explain this situation, Mr. Thomas asserted
  that the overwhelming majority of the lapsed charges were
  handled by fair employment practice agencies (FEPAs), which
  are state and local agencies under contract with EEOC. He
  asserted that the lapsing of charges by FEPAs is not
  significant because the state and local agencies only handle
  claims filed under state lav, not federal law, and the state
  claims are not subject to the two year statute of
  limitations. Mr. Thomas insisted repeatedly that these were
   "state claims," not federal claims. He stated that the EEOC
   is not involved or responsible for ADEA charges filed with
  FEPAs until and unless the FEPA investigates and reports the
  charge to the EEOC within 18 months of the discriminatory
  act.

  Mr. Thomas is incorrect on every point. As he must -- or
  should ~ know:

                A state law claim in no way substitutes for federal
                 rights, and in no way diminishes the EEOC's
                 obligation to vigorously protect older workers under
                 the ADEA.

                 The EEOC contracts with the FEPAs to receive and
                 investigate federal ADEA charges as the EEOC's agent.
                 These charges remain subject to the ADEA's two year
                 statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit;

                 The EEOC is informed of every federal charge filed
                 with a FEPA at the time the charge is filed;

                 The EEOC remains responsible for ensuring that the
                 federal charges are investigated in a timely and
                 thorough manner, and for monitoring the work of the
                 FEPAs;

   As discussed below, federal law, the EEOC's regulations, the
   terms of its worksharing agreements with the FEPAs, and EEOC

        1 Because these charges lapsed after April 6, 1988, they are
not covered by the Age Discrimination Claims Assistance Act, passed
by Congress to restore, for 18 months, the rights of certain older
workers who had lost their claims due to the EEOC's previous
failure to meet the two year statute of limitations.

documents establish these basic principles. Mr. Thomas's
testimony was not only misleading, but revealed an
astonishing lack of understanding of, and concern for, the
protection of older workers' rights under the law.

     A. A state law clain in no way substitutes for federal
              rights, and in no way diminishes the BEOC's
              obligation to vigorously protect older workers under
              the ADEA.

Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of Mr. Thomas's testimony
is his assumption that state claims are an adequate
substitute for the loss of federal rights. He belittled the
problem of thousands of lapsed federal ADEA charges by noting
that a complaining party retains a state law claim if the
federal charge is lost.

The existence of a state law claim in no way excuses the
EEOC's failure to protect older workers' rights under the
ADEA. Congress enacted the ADEA in order to provide older
workers with a federal cause of action in federal court. A
state law claim -- no matter how beneficial to the charging
party -- is no substitute for the federal right.

It is also untrue that state laws provide comparable rights
and relief to the federal law. In fact, state laws often
provide more limited relief to older workers for age
discrimination than the ADEA. For example, the ADEA permits
a private right of action 60 days after a charge is filed,
jury trials, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees to a
prevailing plaintiff. In contrast, some state laws provide:

              New York; If an older worker pursues an age
              discrimination charge with the New York FEPA, the
              older worker loses his or her private right of action
              to pursue the state claim in state court. The worker
               is limited solely to the state administrative
               process, which may take as many as seven years to
               complete and which is only subject to a deferential
               standard of judicial review. There is no right to a
               jury trial, no right to attorney's fees and no right
               to liquidated damages.

               Maryland: Older workers have QS. private right of
               action to bring a claim of age discrimination in
               court, but are limited to the state administrative
               process, which is subject to deferential judicial

              review. Neither attorney's fees nor liquidated
              damages are awarded.

An older worker's rights under the AOEA should not and must
not depend upon whether the charge was filed with the EEOC
directly or with a FEPA designated as the EEOC's agent.
Nonetheless, that is precisely what appears to have happened
during Mr. Thomas's tenure as EEOC Chairman.

     B. FEPAs handle federal claims mm EEOC's agent.

In his testimony, Mr. Thomas repeatedly asserted that, "The
cases filed with the state agencies are filed under state
law." Each time he was asked whether federal charges are
 filed with FEPAs, he responded by restating, "They are filing
them under state statute." As Mr. Thomas must or should
know, this is incorrect.

The EEOC certifies state and local agencies to become FEPAs
after reviewing analogous state laws on age (as well as race,
 sex, national origin and religious) discrimination, and
 investigation, conciliation and prosecution procedures. The
 EEOC and the FEPAs then enter into annual "worksharing"
 agreements, which designate state and local agencies as the
 EEOC's aaent for the receipt and investigation of federal
 charges. (In most instances the complaining party has also
 filed a state law charge based on the same facts, which the
 FEPA will investigate in any event.) The sole purpose of the
 EEOC-FEPA relationship is to allow state and local agencies
 to receive and investigate federal clflJBg-

 Title 29 C.F.R. part 1626 of the EEOC's regulations on the
 ADEA defines the parameters of this relationship. Section
 1626.10(a) explicitly provides that the EEOC may "engage the
 services of [FEPAs] in processing charges assuring the
 safeguards of the federal rights of aggrieved persons."
  (emphasis supplied).

 The worksharing agreements reiterate this point. For
 example, the current agreement between the EEOC and the
 Maryland Commission on Human Relations makes clear that the
 EEOC has jurisdiction over ADEA charges, and that the "EEOC
 by this Agreement designates and establishes the FEPA as a.
 limited agent of EEOC for the purpose of receiving charges on
 behalf of EEOC . . . "

 The handling of federal claims by FEPAs in no way modifies or
                                  1008

  The Honorable Joseph Biden

  Committee on the Judiciary
  page 6

  tolls the ADEA two year statute of limitations, irrespective
  of a state lav's more generous statute of limitations.
  Regardless of which agency initially receives and
   investigates the federal charge, an ADEA claim must be filed
   in court within two years of the discriminatory act or the
   federal cause of action is forever lost.

        c. The Bloc is notified of every ADB& charge filed with
                 a 7BB* at the time the charge is filed.

   In his testimony, Mr. Thomas implied that the EEOC may not
  know about the charges handled by FEPAs and, therefore,
  cannot be held responsible for the lapsing of those claims.
  He stated that charges not reported to the EEOC within 18
  months are outside the scope of the worksharing agreement
   and, therefore, are not the obligation or responsibility of
  the EEOC. (N[l]f a state agency receives a charge and that
   charge is not to us by 18 months from the date of violation,
   that charge is not under contract with EEOC. We have to have
   that charge in time to process under our statute.1*)

   Mr. Thomas is again incorrect. The EEOC is notified of all
   ADEA charges at the time they are filed with the FEPA. The
   EEOC cannot claim ignorance about these charges, nor use this
   as an excuse for failing to exercise its responsibility to
   insure that the charges are processed in a timely manner.

   The worksharing agreement permits an older worker to file his
   or her federal age discrimination charge with either the EEOC
   or a FEPA. If the latter course is followed, the FEPA
   notifies the EEQC by sending a copy of the charge to the
   relevant EEOC district office. In fact, the worksharing
   agreements expressly require the FEPA to advise the EEOC of
   the charge within ten days of its receipt. Furthermore, the
   FEPA may also enter the federal charge into the national

        2 The FEPAs sole function with respect to the federal charges
is to receive the charge and conduct an administrative
investigation. When it reaches a determination of cause or no
cause, it reports its finding to the EEOC. The FEPA's finding is
then subject to EEOC review, during which it receives "substantial
weight." To pursue litigation, the EEOC uses the same procedures
as when the charge was initially investigated by one of its
district offices. For example, the Office of General Counsel must
review the charge and determine whether or not to recommend
litigation.

  computer data base -- providing a second means of
  notification to the EEOC.

  The EEOC, therefore, has the requisite knowledge for
  monitoring the FEPAs1 processing of federal claims and for
  ensuring that the two year statute of limitations does not
  lapse. The 18-month period for processing by the FEPA is
  simply the baseline by which the FEPA's work is judged for
  purposes of payment. It does not obviate the EEOC's
  responsibility to enforce the ADEA -- and to insure that its
  agent, the FEPA, enforces the ADEA. Indeed, a FEPA that
   repeatedly exceeds the 18-month baseline can be reviewed for
  nonfeasance and possible decertification.

        D. The BBOC is responsible for ensuring that federal
                 charges handled by TEPAs are processed in a timely

  Contrary to Mr. Thomas's testimony,4 the EEOC retains
   jurisdiction over all federal charges filed with a FEPA. The
   EEOC retains the responsibility and obligation to ensure that
   all federal claims handled by FEPAs are processed within the
   two year statute of limitations.

   The EEOC's regulations at 29 CFR parts 1626.10(a),(c) make
   clear that the worksharing agreements not only do not relieve
   the Commission of its responsibilities with regard to ADEA
   charges filed with a FEPA, but in fact obligate the
   Commission to monitor the FEPAs and "promptly process charges
   which the state agency does not pursue." Obviously, these
   regulations contradict Mr. Thomas's repeated statements that
   EEOC's responsibilities extend only to charges reported by
   FEPAs to the EEOC within 18 months.

   The worksharing agreements also make clear the EEOC's
   continued responsibility with regard to the federal claims.

               FEPAs are paid by the EEOC for investigating federal
charges only if the FEPA reports ifs findings within 18 months.
This deadline is an acknowledgement, by the EEOC, that the federal
charges must be handled in a timely fashion.

        4 In his testimony, Mr. Thomas repeated said, "We do not
supervise state and local FEPAs. . . . [I]f a state agency receives
a charge and that charge is not to us by 18 months . . . that
charge is not under contract with EEOC."

  See e.g.. Paragraph le: "It is understood that this Agreement
  does not in any way reduce the jurisdiction conferred upon
  either party to this Agreement, or limit the rights and
  obligations of the respective parties." (Emphasis supplied).
  Even more explicit is the section entitled "Timely Processing
  of AOEA Charges." This section establishes the E E O C s right
  to review anv ADEA charge handled bv the FEPA. and to take
  over the investigation of that charge when over one year has
  passed from the date of the alleged violation.'

  EEOC internal documents also reveal that, contrary to Mr.
  Thomas's repeated assertions that the EEOC does not
   "supervise" or "regulate" the FEPAs processing of federal
   claims, the Commission holds itself responsible for
  monitoring the FEPAs and ultimately for the federal charges
   they handle. For example, a "Field Trip Report," resulting
   from a review by EEOC headquarters of the Miami District
   Office, states that the EEOC district office must be able to
   monitor federal charges handled by FEPAs "to ensure that
   charging party rights are not eroded by the running of the
   statute of limitations."6 Similarly, a March 14, 1988
   memorandum from E E O C s Director of Field Management Programs
   (West) to the Director of the Office of Program Operations,
   expresses concern over the EEOC Chicago district office's
   monitoring of ADEA charges handled by the Illinois Civil
   Rights Commission (a FEPA).

   It is deeply troubling to us that after eight years as
   Chairman, and only two years since he pledged to solve the
   problem of unprocessed ADEA cases, Mr. Thomas is unaware of
   the most fundamental aspects of the E E O C s relationship with
   its agents, the FEPAs, and unwilling to accept responsibility
   for the repeated failure of the FEPAs -- and hence the EEOC -
   - to adequately protect the rights of older workers under the
   ADEA. His (incorrect) insistence that the EEOC does not

              In addition, paragraph 8 of the worksharing agreements
establishes that if the FEPA determines it does not have the
resources to pursue a federal charge, it must notify the
Commission.

  "supervise" or "regulate" the FEPAs may in fact highlight the
  cause of this continuing problem: the EEOC under Mr. Thomas
  has made no effort to insure that the FEPAs are fulfilling
  the terms of their worksharing agreements by processing ADEA
  charges in a timely and thorough manner.

  2. Mr. Thomas's Testimony Regarding Pnaupervised Waivers.

       At the February 6, 1990 confirmation hearing, Mr. Thomas
  was asked to explain the legal basis for the EEOC's rule
  permitting unsupervised AOEA waivers, given Supreme Court
  case law that invalidates such waivers. Rather than answer
  this question, Mr. Thomas repeatedly stated that EEOC's
  General Counsel had recommended adopting the regulations.
  When pressed, Mr. Thomas cited a series of lower court
  decisions permitting unsupervised waivers in limited
   c ircumstance._s.

   The appellate court cases cited by Mr. Thomas provide little
   if any support for the rules issued by the EEOC and
   subsequently suspended by Congress. First, none of these
   cases had been decided when the EEOC first proposed its
   regulations in October 1985. Indeed, the only decision on
   point prohibited unsupervised waivers.9 Second, only two of
   the cases had been decided before the rules were issued in
   final form in July 1987 and, in both these cases, the courts
   relied at least in part upon the Commission's proposed rules

              In Lorillard v. Pons. 434 U.S. 575 (1978), the Supreme
Court expressly held that the ADEA incorporates the enforcement
provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the case law
interpreting those provisions. The Supreme Court has held that
section 16(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is
incorporated into the ADEA, invalidates unsupervised waivers. See
Brooklyn Bridge v. O'Neill. 324 U.S. 697 (1945). The rules
published by the EEOC -- and subsequently suspended by Congress
-- contradict these cases.

  and/or an EEOC brief in reaching their decisions.10

  Third, the two courts carefully and specifically limited
  their decisions to waivers obtained in settlement of a bona
   fide factual dispute. The EEOC's rules are not similarly
  limited, but would permit waivers in all circumstances.

  When asked to explain this discrepancy, Mr. Thomas twice
  misstated the case law by asserting "no court has limited
  unsupervised waivers to bona fide factual disputes that I
  know of.1* Mr. Thomas is wrong. In fact, in Runvan v.
  National Cash Register. 737 F.2d 1039 (6th Cir 1986, fin band
   -- the case upon which the EEOC placed primary reliance when
   issuing its final rule -- the Sixth Circuit explicitly stated
   that its holding was limited to waivers of bona fide factual
   disputes. In Borman v. AT&T C/npmnications. Inc.. 875 F.2d
   399, 404 (2d Cir. 1989), the court also held that the case
   involved a bona fide factual dispute. The other appellate
   decisions cited by Mr. Thomas are similarly limited by their
   facts, their holdings, or are simply inapplicable to the
   issue.

        10 See Runyan v. National Cash Register. 787 F.2d 1039, 1045
(6th Cir. 1986, fin b a n d ; EEOC v. Cosmair. Inc.. 821 F.2d 1085,
1091 (5th Cir. 1987).

        11 BUUiflU/ 787 F.2d at 1044; Cosmair. 821 F.2d at 1091
(specifically adopting the reasoning of Runyan).

        12 The Runvan court noted, "The dispute is not over legal
issues such as the ADEA's coverage or its applicability. Rather,
the parties contest factual issues concerning the motivation and
intent behind National Cash Register's decision to discharge
Runyan. Accordingly, we hold that an unsupervised release of a
claim in a bona fide factual dispute of this type under these
circumstances is not invalid." 787 F.2d at 1044.

Cir. 1989); Clrillo v. ARCO Chemical Co.. 862 F.2d 448, 450 (3d
Cir. 1988). In addition, other appellate decisions permitting
unsupervised waivers also are limited, by their facts, to a bona
fide factual dispute. See e.g. Cosmair. sjifiZ&i Coventry v. U.S.
Steel Corp.. 856 F.2d 514, 516-17 (3rd Cir. 1988).

Inc.. 877 F.2d 221 (3d Cir. 1989), does not involve an unsupervised

  Mr. Thomas's refusal to be guided by Supreme Court case law
  and his misstatenents of the facts and decisions in the lower
  court cases cast serious doubt upon his ability or commitment
  to enforcement of the law regardless of his own personal
  preferences and interpretations. As many of the Senators
  indicated in the questions to Mr. Thomas, it is imperative
  that a federal judge be willing to accept and enforce the law
  as passed by Congress, and interpreted by the Supreme Court,
  notwithstanding personal disagreement with the law or its
  interpretation.

  3 Mr. Thomas*s Testimony Regarfli.no Pension Benefit Accrual.

  Mr. Thomas's testimony at his confirmation hearing paints an
   inaccurate picture of the EEOC's actions and authority with
  respect to the issue of nondiscriminatory pension benefit
  accruals and contributions for older workers. Specifically,
  Mr. Thomas mischaracterized the law and the EEOC's conduct
  with regard to its refusal to rescind an admittedly illegal
   Interpretive Bulletin (IB) that permitted employers to
   freeze the pension accounts of persons who worked past age
   65.

  Mr. Thomas testified that in order to rescind the IB, the
   EEOC had to comply with the formal procedures of rulemaking,
   including inter-agency coordination, a regulatory impact
   analysis and OMB approval. According to Mr. Thomas, these
   rulemaking requirements and the actions of other agencies
   prevented the EEOC from either rescinding the IB or issuing
   new regulations requiring post-65 pension benefit accrual.
   ("In essence, what happened to the pension accrual rulemaking
   was it was bogged down in the coordination process . . . we
   had to engage in rulemaking . . . " Rescission "is a major
   rulemaking . . . we could not simply withdraw the IB.")

   This is incorrect and, in our view, misleading. As noted by
   both Senator Metzenbaum and Mr. Thomas at the hearing, the
   EEOC's Acting Legal Counsel at the time advised Mr. Thomas
   that the EEOC could rescind the IB without running afoul of
   rulemaking requirements. Moreover, even if formal rulemaking
   were required, there were interim steps available to the

waiver of ADEA rights.

   Commission to alleviate the considerable harm caused to, and
   cost imposed upon, older workers by allowing the admittedly
   illegal IB to remain in effect.

        A. BEOC's Acting Legal Counsel advised Chairman Thomas
                 that rescission of the IB did aajfe require formal
                 rulemaking.

   The Office of Legal Counsel is responsible for all rulemaking
   within the EEOC. As documented in a contemporaneous
   memorandum, the Acting Legal Counsel advised Mr. Thomas that
   the Commission did not need to engage in formal rulemaking
   procedures to rescind the IB. Under Executive Order 12291,
   only if the proposed agency action is estimated to have an
   annual effect on the economy of $100 millon or more is it
   designated a major rule requiring a regulatory impact
   analysis and submission to OMB. The Acting Legal Counsel
   determined that resciaaion of the IB would not have the
   required economic impact and thus the formal requirements of
   Executive Order 12291 did not apply.19

        14 In June 1984, the EEOC voted to rescind the IB, finding
that it violated the ADEA. In March 1985, the EEOC reaffirmed its
decision. However, at no time did the EEOC actually take the
required steps to rescind the admittedly illegal IB or publish
replacement regulations for notice and comment. It did not rescind
the IB until subject to court order.

The EEOC's refusal to rescind the IB also prevented older workers
from asserting their rights in court. Under the ADEA, an employer
who relies upon a written agency action may have a "good faith"
defense to a charge of discrimination if he demonstrates reliance
upon the IB -- even if the challenged conduct is discriminatory and
the agency action is subsequently found invalid.

         15 The Acting Legal Counsel's position is supported by the
fact that rescission of the IB would not require employers to take
any action, nor would it release employers from any obligation.

Although studies showed that older workers suffered a loss of
approximately $450 million in annual pension benefits due to the
illegal practice of freezing pension accounts at age 65, regardless
of whether the worker continued to work the cost to employers of

  page 13

  In his testimony, Mr. Thomas stated that he believed his
  Acting Legal Counsel to be wrong. He stated that he obtained
  a "second opinion" which reached the opposite conclusion.
  Mr. Thomas failed, however, to identify who gave the second
  opinion and when -- or why -- it was solicited.16

  Mr. Thomas's willingness to follow or not follow the advice
   of counsel seems arbitrary, at best. For example, Mr.
  Thomas's rejection of his Legal Counsel's advice in this
   regard must be contrasted with his repeated reliance upon the
   advice of the (Acting) General Counsel and the Legal Counsel
  with regard to regulations on unsupervised ADEA waivers (see
   discussion above). At the confirmation hearing, when asked
   for the legal basis for the EEOC's regulations on
   unsupervised waivers, Mr. Thomas emphasized again and again
   that EEOC's General Counsel initiated the controversial
   regulations and that the regulations had the support of the
   Legal Counsel. There appears to be no reason for his
   reliance upon counsel's advice in one instance and his
   rejection of it in the other.

        B. The EBOC could have taken Motion short of rulemalcing
                 to protect the rights of older workers to fair and
                 nondiscriainatory pension benefits.

   Mr. Thomas also failed to acknowledge that even if full
   rulemaking procedures were required for the rescission of the
   illegal IB, the EEOC had the authority to provide interim
   relief to older workers. The EEOC had the authority to issue
   an opinion letter stating that it would no longer recognize
   the IB as a good faith defense available to an employer
   charged with discrimination in pension benefits. The EEOC,
   however, not only failed to do this, but also repeatedly

continuing pension contributions and accruals beyond normal
retirement acre was minimal at most. Comm. Pub. No. 97-323', An
Analysis of the costs of Pension Accrual After Age 65 (A.
Rappaport, W. Mercer), U.S. House of Representatives, Select
Committee on Aging, 97th Cong., 2d Sess (May 1982).

         16 Indeed, Mr. Thomas stated that "we have gotten a second
opinion after the document request," which would be January-
February 1990. This, of course, means that the "second opinion"
could not have formed the basis for his decision four and five
years ago.

  dismissed charges filed by older workers who were denied
  post-65 pension benefit accrual even after the Comfliggjpn
  deternjn.nl th**i "-*** practice M M illegal.

  The EEOC has previously issued opinion letters interpreting
  the requirements of the ADEA, thereby establishing agency
  policy prior to or outside the "informal11 rulemaking process.
  For example, in December 1983, it approved for publication an
  opinion letter explaining an employer's obligation to rehire
  retired employees under the ADEA.

       c. The Inter-agency Coordinatiom process was completed
                by tin time the H O C voted to rescind the old
                regulations and issue the new ones in March I9ts.

  The EEOC had been examining the IB and the issue of pension
  benefit accrual since it first as w e d jurisdiction over the
  ADEA in 1979. In 1983, it issued an Advanced Notice of
  Proposed Rulemaking and in June 1984 it voted to rescind the
  IB and instructed staff to prepare new rules. In March 1985,
  the EEOC voted again to issue the new rules. The issue had
  been discussed repeatedly with other agencies and departments
  during this entire period. The inter-agency coordination
  process was certainly complete when the Commission was sued,
   in June 1986, to rescind the IB and issue the new
  regulations.

  Mr. Thomas has once again attempted to evade responsibility
   for his failure to protect older workers' rights under the
  ADEA by imposing blame upon another party. In this instance,

   as in the case of the lapsed charges, the blame must rest
   squarely with the Commission and Mr. Thomas.

   In any hearing, there will always be some unintentional
   aisstatements of fact or law. Here, however, the
   misstatements throughout Mr. Thomas's testimony cannot.be
   excused as uninformed. The issues discussed above, and in

Employees under Age Discrimination in Employment Act, (approved

our previous letter to Chairman Biden and Senator Thurmond
(of January 26, 1990), have consistently and publicly been
before the Congress and the EEOC and involve basic operating
procedures of the Commission.

During Mr. Thomas's tenure as Chairman, Congress has
repeatedly been forced to step in to overrule or
substantially modify the EEOC's actions and conduct with
regard to its enforcement of the ADEA. What is most
disturbing to AARP, and we hope would be of greatest concern
to the members of the Judiciary Committee, is that Mr.
Thomas's testimony and record reveal not only a failure to
enforce the law as passed by Congress, but, at best, a lack
of concern for the working Americans protected by the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act. The record of the hearing,
and Mr. Thomas's record as EEOC Chairman bring into question
whether he will act differently as a federal judge.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Ms. Axford.

                      STATEMENT OF NAIDA AXFORD

   Ms. AXFORD. Thank you.
   Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thank you for this
privilege. I would like to address three points--the obstacles that
individual employees have to getting their jobs done, earning a
living, and pursuing happiness.
   The concern that the American public must have about this com-
mittee's inability to receive straight answers from this candidate
and the necessity for an open forum for discussion of issues, issues
that will be in the employment area, critical issues to the life and
liberty of American workers.
   Our membership of the National Employment Lawyers Associa-
tion--we call ourselves NELA--is made up of lawyers who repre-
sent the people who are hurt when employment laws are violated.
The people that we talk to call us, come to see us, seek out legal
advice, and legal counsel because they are confused, disoriented,
anxious, nervous, depressed, they are losing weight, they have diffi-
culty sleeping, they are unable to concentrate, they have lost their
jobs, they have lost their will and they need help.

   We have to send them to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in order to have certain laws enforced and I believe
that our lawyers are in a prime position to tell you what happens
to those people when they go to an agency that does not administer
the law, as you, the Congress has created it.

  The laws protecting our clients include the title VII, the Age Dis-
crimination and Employment Act, pension laws, OSHA, wage and
hour regulations and a variety of issues that are probably going to
be addressed by the future Court. There are fundamental employ-
ment rights that we consider basic--a safe work place, the right to
organize, the retention of fundamental rights so that our clients,
your constituents do not have to exchange their liberties and their
freedoms for a day's wage.

   We would like to have our clients have a Supreme Court that
will enforce employment contracts and role expectations in a work
place. The civil rights that have been discussed by members coming
before this panel may be in jeopardy. And employees are now, with
the kind of technology that we face, looking at potential unreason-
able encroachments on privacy.

   To me, as an employment lawyer representing individual em-
ployees, I can liken this situation to those of any American worker.
As you can see, Justice Thomas is in an interview process for a job,
and just like our employees and anyone who goes for a job, there
has been an employment application filled out and filed with the
Senate. That employment application lists all of his jobs, all of his
information about where he lives, et cetera, just like any American
worker.

   But unlike any American worker, the employment evaluations
that come before a job interview are, in this case, recorded in the
annals of many of the congressional reports. And as was noted by
one of the people who testified this morning, Judge Thomas ap-
                                         1019

peared before committees 56 times, reporting about controversial,
highly critical efforts about his experience before the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission role of leadership.

  I urge you to take a look at his job performance. The President
has recommended a candidate to you. He has filed his application
and now you are in the interview process. You have talked with
him and you are looking at the people who make recommendations
to you, those of us who can come. I urge you to ask yourself, in this
interview process, who is in charge here?

  If an applicant came to any other employer and said that they
would not answer questions, it would be extremely disturbing to
the potential employer. I think the American public is very dis-
turbed. Your constituents deserve some more answers.

  We all have common enemies. Those of you who support this
candidate, those of us who do not support this candidate--those en-
emies are fatigue, pressing matters, rush, urgency, competing pri-
orities, family and personal needs. And there are even greater en-
emies--lack of faith in the legal process, suspicion of Government,
and one another, and fear of being harmed.

  But we are family and this is a Government of balance and sepa-
ration of powers. We are governed by a system which recognizes,
tolerates and encourages diversity of ideology. Uniformity of
thought is the antipathy of our independent minds.

  Please let us know, there are many issues likely to be addressed
by this Court--privacy rights, dress codes, sexual harassment, dis-
abilities, limitations of damage awards--many, many issues in the
employment setting.

  But it is not about agreeing with this judge's views. We have a
right to know, your constituents have a right to know. The process
already exists. I implore you to slow down, take stock, take your
time, it is a big decision. This man will have this job for 40 years or
more perhaps. Only the hand of God can remove him from his posi-
tion.

   I urge you, ask him more questions, bring him back, make him
tell us, make him tell your constituents. Sirs, this has been a
deeply moving experience to see the civil rights community bitterly
divided on this issue. You need to bring him back, make him
answer the questions. And we hope and pray, many of us on this
panel, that he will change our minds.

  Thank you.

        The next appoint** to the Supreme Court will play
a pivotal role In determining whether a half century
of law establishing the rights of employees to be
protected against arbitrary and discriminatory
employment practices will be rescinded. As Justice
Thurgood Marshall warned in his final dissenting
opinion, the Court's current majority has launched a
'far-reaching assault upon this court's precedents"
and the majority has 'sent a clear signal that
essentially all decisions implementing the personal
liberties protected by the Bill of Rights and the
Fourteenth Amendment are open to re-examination.*1 It
is therefor* critical that the person nominated to

assume the seat vacated by Justice Marshall be
committed to a judicial philosophy which values the
established rights of employees to be free from
discriminatory treatment.

       The National Employment Lawyers Association
("NELA") believes that Judge clarence Thomas is
clearly not the best person for the position. NELA is
a non-profit professional organization comprised of
over 1,000 lawyers in 48 states and the District of
Columbia who represent employees in work related
natters. As a group, NELA attorneys have represented
hundreds of thousands of individuals seeking equal job
opportunities. Zt is one of the few organizations
dedicated to protecting the rights of all employees
who rely on the courts for protection to be free from
discrimination and wrongful discharge. We are,
therefore, deeply concerned about Judge Thomas1 lack
of commitment to the constitutional and statutory
rights of employees previously established by the
United States Supreme Court.

       In the coming years, the Supreme Court will be
called upon to rule on a myriad of employee rights
issues. Over the last two years, the Supreme Court
substantially cut back on protection afforded the
American working population agalnet employment

                        discrimination.1 However, many issues are left open.
                        For example, there will be major cases raising the
                        question of whether employees can be coerced into
                        waiving their federally protected civil rights in
                        order to obtain a job. At its last session the court
                        held that victims of age discrimination can
                        prospectively waive their rights to statutory
                       protection under the Age Discrimination Act (ADEA).
                       There have already been attempts to expand that to
                       permit waivers of rights established by Congress under
                       Title VII and under S 1981 and $ 1983 of the Civil
                       Rights Act, and ultimately the Supreme Court will be
                       called upon to act. Another issue of significance
                       will be the reach of the Supreme Court's decision in
                       Patterson. There is now a split in the circuit courts
                       as to whether Patterson reaches termination cases.
                       The Court, in the future, will be called upon to rule
                       on that issue. At this critical point in the history
                       of the Court it is, in our view, crucial that the
                       person appointed have a fair and open mind to the
                       issues that will be presented.

       Judge Thomas1 prior record, particularly his

eight year tenure as Chair of the United States Equal

Employment Opportunity Commission  ("EEOC"),

demonstrates clearly his hostility toward the

protective legislation previously passed and

interpreted by the Supreme Court. As chief enforcer

of the federal civil rights statutes, he undermined

the effective implementation of those laws, because of

his personal disagreement with Supreme Court

interpretation of his statutory mandate. The

following is a brief summary of Judge Thomas' record

which MELA believes demonstrates a judicial philosophy

unsuited to elevation to the highest court of the

       There have been only 105 Supreme Court Justices

since the establishment of the court. Elevation to

that prestigious and powerful position is reserved for

those persons who have a demonstrated record of

significant national public service, legal scholarship

or judicial experience. Judge Thomas' brief public
career lacks these essential qualifications.1 Judge

        'indeed at the time of his nomination to the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, the ABA merely found Judge
Thomas "qualified" and denied him the higher ranking of "highly
qualified*1 for that lower court position. When faced with his
nomination to the Supreme court, the ABA again rated him only
"qualified" and overall gave him lower ratings than Judge Bork. A
nominee who is not found most qualified for the position of Court

                   Thonas has extrenely limited judicial experience,
                   having served only about l? months on the Court of
                   Appeals for the District of Columbia. During that
                   time, he has written only 17 opinions, all of which
                   were opinions in non-controversial cases in which the
                   decision of the court was unanimous.

                          His only other significant legal experience was
                   as Chair of the United States Equal Employment
                   Opportunity Commission from 1982 through 1990. As
                   will be discussed more fully below, the Agency under
                   his administration refused to enforce the civil rights
                   laws under its jurisdiction as those laws were
                   Interpreted by the Supreme Court. Judge Thomas simply
                   does not have the broad range of experience that would
                   qualify him for the highest judicial appointment. Nor
                   has he demonstrated respect for Constitutional
                   principles and established legal precedents to qualify
                   him for this esteemed position.

                          The EEOC is the agency established to enforce
                   federal lavs forbidding employment discrimination
                   based on race, sex, national origin, age, and
                   religion.' During his administration, Mr. Thomas
                  demonstrated an unwillingness to enforce those laws
of Appeals Judge can certainly not be viewed as the most qualified
candidate for the United States Supreme Court.

                       vigorously. Among his more egregious failings was
                       allowing 13,000 age discrimination olaims to lapse and
                       at the same time trying to hide those fet6 from the
                       United States Congress.

                                Further, Judge Thomas routinely criticized and
                       complained about the oversight committee of Congress
                       charged with monitoring the work of the EEOC. When
                       first asked by the Senate's Special Committee on the
                       Aging about the number of ADEA4 cases whose statute of
                       limitations had lapsed, Mr. Thomas reported that only
                       78 such cases existed. He complained that the Senate
                       Committee staffers were subpoenaing volumes of records
                       and that this was an expense to the EEOC.5 However,
                       only after constant probing, including the use of
                       subpoenas to obtain EEOC records, was it revealed that
                       over 13,000 such lapsed cases existed.* It took
                       special legislation of Congress to restore the rights
                       of those workers whose claims the EEOC under the
                       stewardship of Clarence Thomas, had allowed to lapse.

                                Forner EEOC Chair Thomas was also responsible for
                       the forfeiture of over $450 million dollar* in lost
                       benefits to older workers because of the EEOC's
                       refusal to enforce the ADEA. Despite his stated
                       commitment to rescind EEOC interpretive guidelines
                       which had improperly held that employers were not
                       required to make pension contributions on behalf of
                       workers over the age of 65, Mr. Thomas issued no
                       rescission order.7 it was only when Congress stepped
                       in, after four long years, that an amendment to the
                       ADEA was passed requiring such pension contributions.
                       In fact/ EEOC did not correct its regulations until it
                       was ordered to do so by the United states Federal
                       Court. As United States District Court Judge Harold
                       Green stated in finding against EEOC, the agency "has
                       at best been slothful, at worse deceptive to the
                       public, in the discharge of its responsibilities."*

                       employees be forced to waive their rights to
                       protection under the federal equal employment
                       statutes. NELA is extremely concerned that employees,

              into waiving their roost valuable statutory and
              constitutional rights in order to work. Judge Thomas,
              as Chair of the EEOC, has indicated his lack of
              willingness to protect workers against such coercion.
              The EEOC, under Judge Thomas' leadership, promulgated
              regulations which allowed employees to obtain waiver*
              of rights under ADEA from employees without the
              supervision of the EEOC. Again Congress had to step
              in and suspend those regulations starting in fiscal
              year 1988. Again in a continuing pattern of arrogance
              and hostility toward Congress, the EEOC refused to
              withdraw or modify the lax waiver guidelines. Judge
              Thomas' willingness to undermine the protection
              afforded by ADEA to all the workers cast grave doubt
              on his commitment to enforce these laws.

                       The EEOC, under Mr. Thomas' stewardship refused
              to follow or actually undermined clear mandates of the
              Supreme Court and thereby denied claimants' remedies
              to which they were entitled. In Griaas v. Duke Power.*
              The Supreme Court established the disparate Impact
              test for proving discrimination. Under this theory a
              member of the protected group could establish a prima
              facie case of discrimination by demonstrating that an
              employment practice disproportionately affected
              members of the protected class. Proof of intent was

                       not required. Mr. Thomas disagreed with that Supreme
                       Court precedent and, therefore, not only failed to
                       pursue litigation where appropriate, but sought to
                       change EEOC regulations which were established
                       pursuant to Griaas.10

                                Moreover, Judge Thomas has been less than candid
                       with the Senate regarding his preconceived position on
                       Criggs. Senator Spector extensively questioned the
                       nominee on Grigcts pointing out that Congress had let
                       grjggs stand for 18 years, thus showing Congress1 view
                       that its intent was being carried out. Judge Thomas
                       said that 18 years was a long time and it was a factor
                       to take into account in determining congressional
                       intent thus implying his agreement with Senator
                       Spector. He failed to explain why, if he believed
                       Griqgs reflected congressional intent, he sought to
                       undermine it through Executive regulations that were
                       contrary to Congress* position.

                                Further, although the courts, including the
                       Supreme Court, had established very clearly under
                       Griqqa and United states v. Teamsters" that

                  particularly the use of goals and timetables In
                  appropriate circumstances, is well documented and not
                  denied.1* As chair of the EEOC, he interjected his
                  personal views on that subject and allowed those views
                  to compromise theactivities of theEEOC. Theuse of
                  goals and timetables to remedy past discrimination was
                  a well established legal remedy upheld by the United
                  States Supreme Court on any number of occasions.14
                  Nonetheless, as a consequence of his personal opinion,
                  Judge Thomas did not exercise the E E O C s oversight

                       Thomas persistently voiced his strong opposition with
                       the Supreme Court's approach insisting that the use of
                       goals and timetables "turns the law against employment
                       discrimination on its head".1'

                                Judge Thomas also thwarted the prosecution of
                       class actions. Discrimination claims, by their very
                       nature, are class claims "as the evil sought to be
                       ended is discrimination on the basis of a class
                       characteristic, jte.. race, sex, religion, or national
                       origin."1* Class actions, are a major weapon in the
                       arsenal of civil rights protection for minorities and
                       women. Indeed, recognizing the class nature of
                       discrimination claims, Congress empowered the EEOC to
                       initiate "pattern and practice" claims of
                       discrimination against employers'1.

                                The benefit of class claims is that they allow
                       the government or private litigants to attack basic
                       practices and policies which directly or effectively
                       preclude women. Blacks, Hispanics and other minorities

company. The class action/pattern and practice case
can economically and more quickly reach issues that no
individual litigant could resolve. For example, in
one of the more major cases upholding a pattern and
practice class action brought by the United States
government, the trucking industry, which completely
excluded Blacks and other minorities from the higher
paying truck driver positions was on mass opened up to
those groups by the successful resolution in United
Stages v. Teamsters. If that had been simply an
individual case then, if that individual could have
even afforded to bring on a lawsuit, he would, at
best, been able to obtain one single position among
thousands for himself. Each individual teamster would
have to come forward and raise his own complaint which
would mean that the industry could continue to be
foreclosed to a sizeable number of Blacks for many
years.

         Another major example of the economy and
effectiveness of the class action/pattern and practice
suit is the recent $66 million dollar settlement in
the case of EEOC v. AT&T, 78 Civ 3951 U.S.D.C. for the
Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. In
that case, the company had discriminated against
pregnant women by requiting them to take unpaid leaves
at the end of their six months of pregnancy while

                       denying them full seniority credit while on pregnancy
                       leave and denying then job guarantees after child
                       birth. There were 13,000 identifiable victims of
                       discrimination who were wade whole by this settlement.
                       There is no possibility that those 13,000 victims
                       would have successfully pursued Individual claims
                       given the expense and tin* consumption of Federal
                       litigation.

                                Although the class action pattern and practice
                       suits have proven to be one of the major tools for
                       successful elimination of discriminatory treatment,
                       Judge Thomas has scorned its use. While EEOC filed a
                       total of 218 class actions in fiscal year 1980, under
                       Judge Thomas' chairmanship, only 129 such actions were
                       filed in 1969." Moreover, in 1985, while chair of
                       the EEOC, Judge Thomas disbanded the EBOC division
                       responsible for bringing national pattern and practice
                       charges."

                                Judge Thomas1 reluctance to use the class action
                       mechanism provided for in the statute or to rely on

                      recognized the value of the class action/pattern and
                       practice mechanism in adopting the law. The Supreme
                       Court recognized these principles. Yet the person
                       primarily responsible for enforcing the law allowed
                       his personal opinions on these issues to thwart
                       congressional intent. By limiting EBOC's class
                       actions, he effectively denied thousands or possibly
                       tens of thousands of victims of discrimination
                       effective relief under the statute.

                                Judge Thomas' stated rationale for his opposition
                       to the use of class action lawsuits and to the use of
                       remedial goals and timetables is that the lav protects
                       rights of individuals, not groups. It was his
                       announced position that acts of discrimination must be
                       individually proven and dealt with.

                                However, under his administration, individual
                       victims were unable to receive any remedial relief as
                       were class members. Indeed, the lack of effective
                       investigative and litigation techniques at the EEOC
                       under Clarence Thomas required special investigation
                       on three separate occasions by the Government
                       Accounting office.10 The GAO severely criticized the

                        that during the five year period, fiscal years 1983-
                        198?, the rate of EEOC cause determinations ranged
                        from a were 2.6 percent to a mere 3.9 percent".
                        Thus, as the GAG found, at no time from 1983 to 1987
                        did th EEOC find merit or cause to more than 4* of
                        its charge filings, such results from an agency with
                       an approximate budget of 180 million dollars are
                       mediocre indeed.

                                The EEOC's litigation statistics are equally
                       dismal. Although the Agency had 50,110 new employment
                       discrimination charges filed in 1986, the total number
                       of cases that the EEOC actually filed in Court in 1966
                       was a mere 526 cases.'2 Thus, in only slightly more
                       than 1% of its charges, did the EEOC engage in any
                       litigation whatsoever on behalf of employment
                       discrimination victims.

                                Statistics for the year 1986 are not an anomaly
                       but merely one example of the astonishingly
                       Ineffective role of the EEOC under Chairman Thomas in
                       the enforcement of its mandate. one need only

                       with the record of the National Labor Relations Board
                       (NLRB). a sister federal labor relations agency which
                       had a similar workload and a similar task to place
                       such failure in context. The NLRB received 41,639
                       cases in FY 1906." In contrast to a reasonable cause
                       finding of less than 4% at the EEOC, the NLRB had a
                       reasonable cause finding of 33.7 percent of charges
                       filed in that same year.

                                Moreover, the settlement rates plunged at the
                       EEOC under clarence Thomas. In fiscal year 1980,
                       prior to Chairman Thomas, 32.1% of the cases were
                       settled whereas in fiscal year 1989 under the helm of
                       Chairman Thomas only 13.9% of the eases were settled.
                       This astonishingly low settlement rate at the EEOC is
                       to be contrasted with the settlement rates at the NLRB
                       for the years 1985 through 1989 which ranged from 91.1
                       percent to 94.4 percent." Clearly, these mediocre
                       EEOC statistics reflect a record of non-performance.
                       They further reflect the experience of NELA's member

Charging Parties. The EEOC, unde.r Chairman Thomas,
simply did not meet its mandate in serving the
Charging Parties who have sought its assistance in
ending employment discrimination.

         Judge Thomas' tenure at the EEOC was thus marked
by hostility to the Agency's mandate, as them defined
by the supreme Court. While he was undoubtedly free
to hold his own opinions about the EEOC's enabling
statute and supreme Court caselav, his acceptance of
a position in which he was charged with the
enforcement of a statute with which he did not agree,
and his refusal to enforce the law as authoritatively
construed, raises troublesome questions about his
commitment to the legal and judicial process.

                                     CONCLUSION
         Over 75% of the workforce is not represented by
unions and has no protection other than that afforded
by statute as interpreted by the courts. Congress has
expanded the protection of those workers to assure
that equal employment opportunities are established
for all Americans, it is the Supreme Court's duty to
safeguard those rights as established by Congress.
Judge Thomas' record as the chief legal enforcer of
the rights established by Congress, as Interpreted by
the court, raises gave doubt about his commitment to
equal employment opportunity. He has withdrawn

support from thost workers aost vulnerable to the
coercion of arbitrary and unfair employers. His
record indicates a readiness to overturn established
protections and that he would Impose his own personal
philosophy in disregard of long established legal
principles. He, therefore, urge that the Senate this
nomination.

                 STATEMENT OF REV. BERNARD TAYLOR

   Reverend TAYLOR. My name is Rev. Bernard Taylor and I am
chairman of the Black Expo of Chicago, an Illinois-based corpora-
tion involved in a host of activities to support the development of
black business enterprises, including an annual exhibit that brings
together black-owned businesses of all types to display their prod-
ucts to black consumers.

  The most recent of these was held this past July in which over
400 businesses exhibited to hundreds of thousands of consumers.

  I am also an ordained minister in the African Methodist Episco-
pal Church, the oldest black church denomination in America, a
church that was organized because of discrimination. I also serve
as assistant pastor, Grant Memorial AME Church in Chicago.

  I am a graduate of Roosevelt University with a BA degree in so-
ciology and the Chicago Theological Seminary with an MA in the-
ology. Senators, I am here in opposition to the nomination of Judge
Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Clarence Thomas' personal history is not unique. Most African-
Americans who have grown up in this country have experienced
poverty, disrespect and hostility by whites who have called our
women, girls; our men, boys; and niggers and worse. African-Amer-
icans have been victimized by vicious expressions of racism. We
can identify with and are still pained by the descriptions of Judge
Thomas on last week.

  The notion of self-help and self-reliance are not concepts that are
foreign to African-Americans. Booker T. Washington, the founder
of Tuskeegee Institute wrote extensively on the need of self-help,
which others have called passive resistance.

  On the contrary, W.E.B. DuBois, professor at Atlanta University
wrote for the need for progression through via the talented tenth
paving the way for the rest of the race. We contend that a blend of
these views must carry the day. While we need self-help we also
need access to the avenues that will prepare our talented tenth and
others to provide guidance to our people.

  It is undisputed that self-help alone will not propel disadvan-
taged people into the mainstream of American society. No person
who presently enjoys the position of power or authority has at-
tained that position without assistance--be it governmental or oth-
erwise. And that type of assistance has been and remains necessary
if persons are to succeed in our society.

  Judge Clarence Thomas, a man who has received some theologi-
cal training, should be able to demonstrate human compassion, yet,
we see him condemning those who would take advantage of well-
earned benefits of Government. African-Americans are, and have
been long-standing and faithful taxpayers and deserve to partici-
pate in every existing governmental benefit.

  Affirmative action is an attempt to bring numbers of unrepre-
sented groups into the mainstream of American life who have tra-
ditionally suffered discrimination and racism as a group.
                                         1039

  Three of our past presidents recognized that African-Americans
were severely discriminated against and signed executive orders to
ease this situation. President Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802 or-
dered defense contractors to practice nondiscrimination in the
awarding of contracts. President Kennedy's Executive Order 10925
provides contract termination as a penalty for noncompliance with
equal employment practices. And President Johnson issued Execu-
tive Order 11246 which established the Office of Federal Contract
Compliance within the Department of Labor.

  These Executive orders were issued because of discrimination in
employment and the awarding of contracts. But Judge Thomas has
stated that he believes that affirmative action creates dependency.
And he has made several references to that kind of affirmative
action, alluding to quotas.

  As Chairman of the EEOC, Thomas should have recognized
quotas have never been part of the statutory affirmative action. Af-
firmative action with its timetables and goals has offered security
for the status quo and potential benefit for others through attri-
tion. The benefits of affirmative action are not hand-outs, but well-
deserved rewards for the labors of ourselves and our forbearers.

  In 1989, the Richmond decision and other Court rulings damaged
affirmative action. When the courts ruled that race-based affirma-
tive action was unconstitutional, the courts seemed to favor indi-
vidual rights over group rights in the area of adjudication of dis-
crimination claims.

  African-American people need someone on the Court who is sen-
sitive to the fact that they have been discriminated against as a
group, and not just individually. By being in opposition to provid-
ing full affirmative action rights to African-Americans and others,
Judge Thomas is contributing to the decline of affirmative action.
He espouses self-help instead of affirmative action.

  When a people are being denied, self-help at best is inadequate to
affirmative action. Judge Thomas claims no agenda. But I would
like to tell him that his agenda should be included in being a
champion for those who have been systematically discriminated
against. We need someone on the Supreme Courts who understands
that African-Americans have been discriminated as a group. We
need a voice on the Court who will be a champion for those who
have been locked out of our society. Someone who is fully aware
that his agenda should be inclusion of all citizens of these United
States.

  We say no to Clarence Thomas.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Reverend.

PERSONAL HISTORY

I. Clarence Thomas' personal history is NOT REMARKABLE
       Most African-Americans who have grown up in this country
       have experienced poverty, whites who have disrespected
       our elders, family members who have been and remain in
       in what is now known as the "underclass", and been per-
       sonally affronted with the most virulent and vicious
       expressions of racism. We can identify with, and are

still pained by the descriptions punctuated by Thomas'
        muffled sobs during the Confirmation Hearings. Most

African-Americans have been or have known parents or
grandparents or other relatives who have been
disrespectfully addressed and treated. e.g (called boy,
girl, nigger, or worse). Thomas' Pin Point Georgia
experience is very familiar to most African-Americans,
one we can readily identify with.

The notions of self-help and self-reliance are not concepts
that are foreign to African-Americans. In fact, Booker T.
                                  1042

Washington, the founder of Tuskegee Institute,, wrote
extensively on the need for passive resistance and
self-help.

On the contrary, W.E.B. DuBois wrote of the need for
progression via the talented tenth paving the way for the
rest of the race.

We contend that a blend of those views must carry the day.
While we need self-help, we also need access to the avenues
that will prepare our "talented tenth" to provide guidance
to our people. It is undisputed that self-help alone will
not propel disadvantaged persons into the mainstream of
American society. No person who presently enjoys a position
of power or authority has attained that position without
assistance, be it governmental or otherwise. That type of
assistance has been and remains necessary if persons are to
succeed in this society.

Judge Clarence Thomas, who has been a beneficiary of
seminary training should be able to demonstrate human
compassion. Yet, we see him denigrating those who would
take advantage of the well-earned largesse of government.

African-Americans are and have been long-standing and
faithful taxpayers, and deserve to participate in every
existing governmental benefit. The benefits of Affirmative
Action are not handouts, but, rather the well-deserved
                        1043

fruits of the labors of ourselves and our predecessors,
borne of scores of years of efforts toward achievement.

Those commentators who marvel at how Thomas overcame such

obstacles should recognize that his experiences are neither

unique nor unusual. Many of us can identify with the

challenging, humilating treatment and  difficult

circumstances faced by persons who are minority and, as a

result, disadvantaged.

INCONSISTENCIES

II. Thomas' inconsistencies abound. Clarence Thomas claims
to have "NO AGENDA" in seeking the role of Justice of the
United States Supreme Court. He further and frequently
asserts the difference in the role of Justice and his
former role as spokesperson for the Administration as a
reason why his earlier statements, speeches and writings
should be disregarded or given a limited amount of credence.
In fact, he frankly disavows many of the statements he
previously made.

Yet, Judge Thomas has not, in his years of public service
conducted himself as one who can think clearly for himself.
His record demonstrates that he will not only carry out the
intentions of, but will actually parrot the views of those
to whom he appears to be beholden. Few can forget Ronald
                                  1044

Reagan's repeated references to totalitanarianism.
Predictably, Thomas' speech to various groups reflected
Reagan's baseless verbiage, offering none of the substance
which would be expected of a legal scholar.

III. Judge Thomas has made several references to "that type
of Affirmative Action", alluding to quotas. He has further
stated that he was never a beneficiary of "that type of
Affirmative Action". As Chairman of EEOC, Thomas should
have recognized that quotas have never been a part of
statutory Affirmative Action..Affirmative Action , with its
attendant goals and timetables, provided both a security
interest for present beneficiaries of the status quo, and an
expectancy interest for potential future beneficiaries of
Affirmative Action. The expectancy interest provided by
goals and timetables simply represents Affirmative Action
(or limited replacement) by attrition. Such a scheme is
gradual and, based on current projections, represents a
recognition of the future composition of the relevant work
force.

Thomas represents that he favors indivdual rights over group
rights in the area of adjudication of discrimination claims.
He says this in 1991 when he is, and most informed members
of the public are aware that the Court, in 1989, severely
curtailed the rights of both groups and individuals in
adjudication of cases related to discrimination.
                                  1045

The Clarence Thomas who has presented himself to the public
for the past ten years should not be appointed to the United
States Supreme Court.
                                         1046

   The CHAIRMAN. Let me begin the questioning with you, Ms. Aiye-
toro, if I may. How do you account for the fact that Judge Thomas
in most of his writings and speeches fails to directly confront and
say forthrightly what you think he believes, which is that he is op-
posed to choice, he--was supportive, or at least insensitive to the
situation in South Africa, and so on? How do you account for that?

   Ms. AIYETORO. I don't, Senator Biden. I am not sure why he
doesn't say more specifically than he does in his speeches his posi-
tion on the issue of choice for women and the issue of South Africa.
I would assume that you would have to ask him about

   The CHAIRMAN. I did.

   Ms. AIYETORO. I know. I guess one answer that I would have,
which is an answer that someone gave you on an earlier panel, is
that most of the times when he was making his speeches, the
speeches that I am familiar with, he was speaking on a particular
topic, and so many of these things were not specifically related to
it.

   I guess the other answer I would give you is that despite whether
or not he has specifically said his position on South Africa or
choice or other issues that I was always raised by the adage that by
your deeds you will be known. And I think we have to look at not
just the words and speeches but his conduct.

  I believe that his conduct and things that he has adopted, in
speeches as well as being on the advisory board of the Lincoln
Review, those kinds of things indicate something about him that I
think that we have to, you know, as lawyers, as human beings, we
draw implications that are rebuttal presumptions, I would assume.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Ms. McPahil, are you at liberty to tell us not how who voted, but
since your organization has such wide respect and it was such a
close vote--it reminds me of that old joke, you know. The board of
directors voted 5 to 4 to send you a get well card. You know, that
kind of thing. I mean it was awfully close.

  Was there any single defining issue that split the vote? I mean
did it break down in any specific way? Were people saying, well, we
will give him a chance, we will give him the benefit of the doubt,
or we disagree with him because he believed one thing on affirma-
tive action and another on something else? Do you understand
what I am trying to get at? What did you all debate?

  Ms. MCPAHIL. Well, we debated primarily his views on affirma-
tive action and his record at the EEOC. The vote, and I am at liber-
ty to tell you--it is public knowledge, we announced it afterwards.
So you have a full picture of it, our Judicial Selection Committee
came in with a 6-to-5 vote against him. Our board voted 23 to 21 to
reject the Judicial Selection Committee, which is essentially a vote
for him. Our delegates on the floor then voted 124 to support him,
128 to oppose him, and 31 to take no position whatsoever.

  The CHAIRMAN. My goodness.
   Ms. MCPAHIL. SO there were four votes that opposed those be-
tween--you know, those who wanted to support him outright and
those who wanted to oppose him outright.
   The CHAIRMAN. MS. Seymore, one of the startling figures--at
least I find it startling--is that there are fewer police officers or
                                        1047

black, women and men alike, today than there were 10 years ago.
More than 20 years ago, but fewer than 10 years ago.

  Can you shed any light on why you think that is the case?
  Ms. SEYMORE. Well, in larger departments, say, for instance,
Washington, DC, 10 years ago the minority participation here was
36 percent. It is now up to 86 percent. But there are hundreds of
departments throughout the country that do not have those num-
bers. Say, for instance, a department who had 800 minorities 10
years ago are down to 400 minorities. Or a department who had 12
females 10 years ago who today have none.
  So because of the disparity in the sizes of police departments,
that is why the numbers show lower today than 10 years ago.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Aiyetoro, we heard testimony--you testified
very eloquently to your view of Judge Thomas', at a minimum, in-
sensitivity, at a maximum, as I understood your testimony, support
of the South African Government. It is somewhere in between I
guess you view it.
  We heard testimony from two members of the board of Holy
Cross University, one a former Federal judge of some reputation
and repute out of the third circuit, and the other the president of
the university, saying that Judge Thomas argued--I forget the ad-
jective they used--but vociferously, or argued strenuously for disin-
vestment.
  I think--let me ask my staff to make sure I am correct on this.
Well before his nomination to the court, either court, I believe--the
court he now sits on or the Supreme Court.
   How do you square that with what was obviously the facts as you
cite them, and they were the facts--how do you square the two
things?
   Ms. AIYETORO. Senator Biden, it is my understanding from the
review of the materials about Judge Thomas that there was a
period in his life in which he was more of an activist for the rights
of people of color, as well as human rights or civil rights in gener-
al. That was a period of time, it is my understanding from the
record, when he was at Holy Cross, and he was instrumental in
forming the Black Student Union.
   I think that what we see in his history is what we see in many of
us, perhaps, or are familiar with someone like Judge Thomas who
when he is in college for whatever reasons they get involved in the
history of the moment. We have to realize that Judge Thomas,
much like I--I am 3 years his senior, but much like I
   The CHAIRMAN. Three years his senior?

   Ms. AIYETORO. Yes, I am.

   The CHAIRMAN. I don't believe it.
   Ms. AIYETORO. We came up in a time in college years where the
civil rights movement was out there. The civil rights movement
was on the front pages, and many of us got involved that never had
been involved before.
   The CHAIRMAN. I may have misled you a little bit. The testimo-
ny, the explicit testimony was not while he was a student, but sev-
eral years ago. I think 3 or 4 years ago, when he was a member of
the board of directors.
   Maybe my friend from Illinois can shed some light on that.

                                        1048

   Senator SIMON. Yes. This was just within, I think it was 2 or 3
years ago. And if I can just complicate the question even more, if
my colleague will let me.

  The CHAIRMAN. Surely.
  Senator SIMON. At Holy Cross he said we should disinvest, but
here in Washington he was opposing sanctions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that was my point.

   Ms. AIYETORO. OK.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Aiyetoro indicated that.
  Senator SIMON. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. She recited the fact that in Washington here and
both with regard to his actions, his comments and his references to
people to whom he looked for guidance represented a view that was
at least benign about apartheid.
  And what I am trying to get at is at the same time he was, and I
have no reason to doubt Judge Gibbons, a man of incredible honor,
nor the president of the university, he was at board meetings,
using their characterization, strenuously arguing that his alma
mater should disinvest from--I am paraphrasing, but I think he
talked about an immoral and abominable practice.
  So I wonder if you factor that in. I am just trying to understand
how you view it. I am having trouble figuring it out. I am wonder-
ing what your view is.
  Ms. AIYETORO. Well, I have trouble figuring it out. I mean the
only thing that I can say to you, Senator Biden, is that this I think,
on the one hand, could either clarify or further complicate your de-
liberation. It seems to me if you have someone that is, as we would
call it, saying two things, speaking out of both sides of his or her
mouth, then I think that we have a serious problem.
  From what we know in terms of the public view, I knew more
about what he did in Washington, and I am concerned that a
person--if indeed he even had the views, that even causes me to
have more concern. Because at least I feel like if I am dealing with
a person who is straight along the line has a position in support of
the apartheid government I may disagree, and I do strongly dis-
agree, just to make it clear, but I would at least say that this
person is consistent.
  To have someone who today is telling us that he is not--he is in
support of the apartheid government, but yesterday is lobbying
against that government, I would have serious pause for concern
about that person.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you. My time is up. I yield to my col-
league from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I just want to take this op-
portunity to welcome you all here. It is nice of you to come and
show your interest in this hearing. You have expressed yourself.
And there have been others who have taken different views and
some who have taken your view, but we are glad to have you here.
  Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent that a letter ad-
dressed to you, dated September 17, 1991, from Thomas Adams
Duckenfleld, a lawyer here in Washington, be placed in the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.
  Senator THURMOND. If it has not been placed. You haven't placed
it in, have you?

  The CHAIRMAN. I have not. I don't think I have.
  Senator THURMOND. I will just read the first paragraph:

   DEAR SENATOR BIDEN. AS a former president of the National Bar Association, I
share with you my wholehearted support for the confirmation of Judge Clarence
Thomas as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

  I won't bother to read the rest of it. I will just put it in the

The Honorable Joseph Biden                September 17,1991
Chairman
Senate Judiciary Committee                RE: Confirmation of Judge Clarence
Office of the United States Senate               Thomas as an Associate Justice of
Room 224                                         the U.S. Supreme Court
Dirsken Office Building
Washington, DC

Dear Senator Biden:

          As a former President of the National Bar Association, I share with you my wholehearted
support for the confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas as an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States.

          Your committee, over the last week, has conducted its confirmation hearings for Judge
Thomas' appointment to the Supreme Court. The world has been poised for the drama that has
been unfolding. The hearings have been a real education in the modern politics of judicial
appointments. For certain they have been an unforgettable lesson on the constitution and
jurisprudence. We are indeed hopeful that if there are no disqualifying factors in existence and that
his legal credentials remain as impeccable as they are, the committee will recommend Judge
Clarence Thomas to the full Senate for confirmation. So far, I have not seen anything that would
disqualify Judge Thomas. This is a view that is shared by many, many Americans. He is well
qualified to assume the awesome responsibility of a Justice on the Supreme Court of the United
States.

          We are not unmindful of many subsisting questions that loom on the horizon raised by
various and sundry individuals and groups as to why the nominee should not be confirmed.
Fortunately, we have heard them all and find them devoid of any substance. We admit that the
individuals and groups themselves are substantive, but the questions posed by them are not. At best
they all articulate subconscious fears of the unknown based on their dislike for the sponsors of our
nominee and/or their intellectual inertia to a new agenda for Civil Rights. As was spoken in the
gospels: "Can there be any good thing ut of Nazareth?... Come and see."

          Unfounded fears abound in the minds and hearts of many highly intelligent people. All
manner of paranoid imaginations are conjured up. None of those fears is justified in feet. Nothing
suggests that Judge Thomas, if allowed to become Justice Thomas, would not take a legal and
scholarly approach to any matter up for decision based on the facts and law as applied to that
particular case in the context of the constitution. He will bring a commitment to fairness, openness
and justice to the deliberations before the U.S. Supreme Court.

          Under the Constitution of the United States, the Advice and Consent of the Senate are a
must before this nominee or any nominee is confirmed to assume the public office to which he or
she has been appointed. We are well aware that the Senate sacredly guards the authority and
                                       1051

scrutinizes nominees with the utmost care. During the course of the hearings, you have, I believe,
sought to carry out your constitutional mandate in a responsible and fair manner.

          The great furor over Judge Qarence Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court of the
United States centers around the fact that the "civil rights" issues are no longer in the forefront of
American politics. This fact or turn of events did not come into being because of Qarence Thomas,
one way or the other. In Harold Cruse's book, "Plural But Equal,"1 page 385, he expresses the
matter thusly:

          "Civil rights justice for all intents and purposes of the United States Constitution
          have been won; there are no more frontiers to conquer; no horizons in view that are
          not mirages that vanish over the hill of the next court decision on the meaning of
          equal protection."

          This fact creates an exasperating situation for the agenda in the traditional Black
Establishment. In the whole of the "Eighties," they have literally been trying to "reinvent the wheel"
so far as Civil Rights justice is concerned. And yet, there are other durable and legitimate options
and approaches for the cause of justice and equality. For them, there is no other course of action
to follow. Frederick Douglas called it "delirium of enthusiasm with the inability to distinguish
between the "see and real." As Douglas further said: T h e pen is often mightier than the sword and
the settled habits of a nation mightier than a statute."

          Senator Biden, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and to your fellow committee
members, the most noble thing you could do to bring "Black Americans" into the mainstream of
American life, is to recommend Judge Qarence Thomas for confirmation to the Supreme Court.
Such is beneficial for all Americans, particularly minorities. Unfortunately, a substantial measure
of astute individuals have demonstrated a confused and misdirected consciousness which remains
detached from the body politic in America. Do for us and them what these individuals are
incapable of doing for themselves, for your decision will wed to generations to come a proper
relationship for those whose ancestry bore the burden of labor in the foundation of this democracy.

                                                                       Very truly yours,

   Senator THURMOND. He held the same position, I believe, Ms.
McPahil, as you hold now; is that correct?

   Ms. MCPAHIL. NO, Senator, it is not correct.
   Senator THURMOND. He was president. You are president now.
  Ms. MCPAHIL. Yes. With all due respect--oh, you mean he had
the same--yes, he held
  The CHAIRMAN. At one time he did.
  Ms. MCPAHIL. He was in the position.
  Senator THURMOND. Yes, of the National Bar Association.
  Ms. MCPAHIL. But let me make clear for the record that only one
person may speak for the National Bar Association and that is its
current president.
  Senator THURMOND. YOU are the president now of the National
Bar Association, aren't you?

   Ms. MCPAHIL. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, he was the president evidently several
years ago.

  Ms. MCPAHIL. Several years ago.
  Senator THURMOND. SO I just want to place that in showing there
is a division in your association as to how you stand on this matter.
  Ms. MCPAHIL. Yes, sir. Mr. Duckenfield is certainly free to ex-
press his opinion as a private citizen, but not as a representative of
the National Bar Association.
  The CHAIRMAN. I don't believe he purports to speak for the Na-
tional Bar.
  Ms. MCPAHIL. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. The hour is late, and I have no questions.
Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  If I could get real fast answers from each of you on this: Ms.
McPahil has told about the National Bar Association and the divi-
sion there, if I may ask each of your--Reverend Taylor, I don't
know if you are speaking for your organization or not.
  Reverend TAYLOR. Yes.
  Senator SIMON. Was this a close vote, an easy vote, marginal in
the authorization for you, Ms. Aiyetoro?
  Ms. AIYETORO. Senator Simon, I have to answer it this way: It
was a very difficult vote, because we had to deliberate and some of
the questions I raised were questions to you all, we had to raise for
ourselves, the importance of him being a black man, but our board
voted unanimously to oppose.
  Senator SIMON. OK. Mr. Hou.
  Mr. Hou. Senator Simon, I think for the NAPABA's position,
what had happened is that each of the local Asian bar associations
that comprise NAPABA engaged in extensive debate and discus-
sion at the local level, from there moved up to a regional level, and
then ultimately up to the national board level, where the final vote
was taken.
  During the process, I think, as an organization, we did a very
thorough review of all of Judge Thomas' decisions, his record at
EEOC, at DOE, and through that process we also talked to various
people who knew Judge Thomas in various capacities, and as a
                                         1053

result of that entire process, we ended up voting to oppose. I think
it was a pretty thorough discussion, but the actual vote I don't be-
lieve was that very close.

  Senator SIMON. OK. If I can ask the rest of you to be a little
more brief, because I am trying to get a couple more questions in
here.

  Ms. Seymore.
  Ms. SEYMORE. The annual conference of the National Black
Police Association, our general assembly instructed the national
board of directors to make a decision on the Clarence Thomas nom-
ination, and it was a close vote.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Schulder.
  Mr. SCHULDER. NO, it was not a close vote. Our organization op-
posed his nomination to the court of appeals and it was easy to
oppose this nomination.
  Senator SIMON. MS. Axford.
  Ms. AXFORD. Ours was not a close vote, either. There were only
several people who were not willing to oppose, and the central
issues had to do with the future issues that were coming up, par-
ticularly waiver of constitutional and statutory rights, and our
major concerns about his opposition to class actions.
  Senator SIMON. Reverend Taylor.
  Reverend TAYLOR. The majority of our organization voted against
Clarence Thomas.
  Senator SIMON. Was it a close vote?
  Reverend TAYLOR. NO, no.
  Senator SIMON. OK. Mr. Hou. We have had how many witnesses,
Mr. Chairman, or will have?
  The CHAIRMAN. We are getting close to 90 when we finish--I am
sorry, through today we will have had about 60 witnesses so far.
  Senator SIMON. Sixty witnesses, and to my knowledge, you are
the only Asian-American who will be testifying; is that correct?
  The CHAIRMAN. I think that is true. I don't know that.
  Senator SIMON. Are there any other Asian-American organiza-
tions that have taken a stand in this, do you know?
  Mr. Hou. I am aware that the Organization of Chinese-Ameri-
cans, which is a national organization, has taken a stand to oppose
the nomination. I am also aware that Chinese for Affirmative
Action, which has a long history as a civil rights organization,
voted to oppose him.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Schulder, on page 9 of your testimony, you
have something here that I don't believe I have read before, and it
gets to the whole question of whether Judge Thomas sides on the
side of privilege or with people who have great need. It talks about
a closed session, where he is speaking. What is your source for this
closed session?
  Mr. SCHULDER. The transcript of closed sessions are made avail-
able to the public, they are public documents and that is the source
of this, and what it does show is that Judge Thomas, indeed, was
speaking from the vantage point of employers, rather than the
workers in the Xerox case.
  Senator SIMON. I thank you.
                                         1054

   In connection with your testimony, I notice you have attached a
very strong statement from the AARP, too, that ought to be en-
tered in the record, if it has not been.

   The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.
   Senator SIMON. I thank you all, particularly Reverend Taylor,
and we thank you all for sitting so long before you get a chance to
testify.
   The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simpson.
   Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Thank you for your understanding of our agenda today and the
time we take, regardless of what members of the panel may think.
We have taken a great deal of time with this issue, because of the
sensitivity of the chairman and the ranking member, and that is
the way we do our business. I think that is quite evident.
   You know, I was interested in the National Bar Association and
the closeness of the vote. Was that a public vote? I mean did people
stand and put their hand up, or was it a closed ballot?
   Ms. MCPAHIL. Well, the session was closed, but it was by ballot.
   Senator SIMPSON. Secret ballot.
   Ms. MCPAHIL. People did stand and speak for and afrmst, so you
knew pretty much who was for him and against him, but it was a
secret ballot and the session was closed to the press.
   Senator SIMPSON. If it was not a secret ballot, I only ask you if
this is the case, how did you vote?
   Ms. MCPAHIL. HOW did I vote?
   Senator SIMPSON. Yes.
   Ms. MCPAHIL. Well, Senator, I considered that I might be asked
that question and it troubled me, because I am here as the presi-
dent of the National Bar Association and, as its president, I must
represent its vote. Were I to respond to that question, then I sup-
pose, if pressed, I might, there would be at least half of the mem-
bers of my organization who would be very disturbed about that, so
I would appreciate not being asked to respond to it, but I would, if
you insist.
   Senator SIMPSON. I understand that fully. We will end that, but
we won't quit here now.
   I wanted to ask Ms. Aiyetoro: You say some pretty tough things,
pretty harsh about Judge Thomas. For example, "President Bush's
nomination of Judge Thomas to fill the seat vacated by Justice
Marshall is an insult, not only to people of color and women, but to
the legacy of Justice Marshall." That is pretty tough stuff, in my
mind. You make it all sound that all people of color and women
find Judge Thomas' nomination an insult. It is difficult for me to
see how you purport to speak for 58 percent of the black Ameri-
cans that, in a September 16, 1991, ABC opinion poll found sup-
porting Judge Thomas and his elevation to the Supreme Court.
   Your testimony also refers to the Griggs v. Duke Power. That
case held that plaintiffs may prevail in a title VII discrimination
suit, if they show that an employer's facially neutral employment
practices were causing significant statistical disparity in their
workplaces. You note the certain EEOC guidelines that attempt to
inform employers about how this case applies to them, and then
you say, "Judge Thomas, as the EEOC Chair, attacked the guide-
lines, because, in his view, they encourage too much reliance on
                                        1055

statistical disparities as evidence of employment discrimination,"
and then you claim, "Thomas attempted to make proof of discrimi-
nation insurmountably difficult, with total disregard for current
law."

  I respectfully say that I think that you have misread current
law. Current law does not allow a disparate impact suit to be based
on statistics alone. It requires that plaintiffs demonstrate how cer-
tain employment practices cause the statistical disparity.

  In fact, even in our colleague's civil rights bill of last year, Sena-
tor Kennedy, about which I have very strong concerns, he stated
the following: "The mere existence of a statistical imbalance in an
employer's work force, on account of race, color, religion, sex or na-
tional origin is not alone sufficient to establish a prima facie case
of disparate impact violation."

  Are you then telling us that Judge Thomas is wrong, that statis-
tics alone are sufficient to establish that type of impact violation?
Is that what you are saying?

  Mr. AIYETORO. No, Senator Simpson, that is not what we are
saying. I would like to respond, if I can, to several of the state-
ments that you made. First of all, we don't purport to speak for all
black Americans. Our statement that the nomination of Judge
Thomas is an insult to the people of color, as well as to the legacy
of Thurgood Marshall, is that our assessment of what has hap-
pened to black Americans and African-Americans in this country is
one that there is a need for someone who at least understands and
supports remedies that will go to actually eradicating racism and
the results of racism in the society.

  It is our view, based on our review of the materials and Judge
Thomas' position on a number of things that Judge Thomas, even
though he has the background of being a black man raised in a sit-
uation of not as many resources as many others, is a person that
has turned his back on the very remedies that our organization
feels are essential, and it is not simply our organization, but any
number of organizations who speak not simply for African-Ameri-
cans, but people of color and women, so that we would not purport
to do so.

  As to the polls that you spoke about, one of the things that we
have found, as we have talked to people about Judge Thomas' nom-
ination, is that many people who were polled are really people who
don't know about his record. I realize that, for many persons, it is
hard to understand that, in fact, when a black man is appointed,
even though, as Senator Biden said earlier, there was as certain
number of people who reserved their position, that for many
people, when they have not heard the full record, will support.

  We have found, when we speak to people and talk to them about
the record, they indeed either question whether we should support
Judge Thomas or, in fact, go the other way. The margins are not
that great.

  The last thing, in terms of the issue of statistics, I am also a liti-
gator and I do civil rights and constitutional law. What we are not
saying is that Judge Thomas said that you can't totally rely on sta-
tistics, but Judge Thomas did not even want to utilize statistics at
all in title VII cases. It is, of course, part of title VII proof, part of
the statute itself is the statistical evidence is very much a part of
                                  1056

the case. That is not 14th amendment law, in many ways, but for
title VII it is.

When we criticize Griggs, at the time Thomas criticized Griggs,
that was the law, so he indeed criticized and did not support the
law as it existed at the time and that is the point we were making
in our testimony.

Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I just had one other question, if
I might ask it.

The CHAIRMAN. GO ahead.
Senator SIMPSON. I would ask Ms. Axford, your organization
criticized Judge Thomas for having only 17 months experience on
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Have you,
or have you, Ms. Aiyetoro, have you read his decisions while on the
circuit court that he serves on?

Ms. AIYETORO. Yes, I have read some of them. I am not sure if I
have read every single one of them. I have read a summary of
every one. I have read some of them page to page.

Senator SIMPSON. Have you read the criminal decisions that he
has given?

Ms. AIYETORO. I have read some of them. I have read summaries
of all of them.

Senator SIMPSON. Are you aware that in the criminal decisions,
and other on the panel have spoken to those, that there is not a
single dissent in those criminal decisions, and Judge Ginsburg,
Judge Pat Wald, and Judge Abner Mikva all unanimously support-
ed Judge Thomas' opinions in that arena? Are you aware of that?

Ms. AIYETORO. That is not my understanding. In some of t h e - --

Senator SIMPSON. It is the truth. It is not just an understanding.
On the criminal cases, that is the way it is, so I think it is impor-
tant

Ms. AXFORD. Senator Simpson, before you

Senator SIMPSON. Yes?
Ms. AXFORD. I have read the decisions and I am curious about
what the relevance of that is to his performance and the^questions
before you today.

Senator SIMPSON. Well, I do not have time to ask those questions.
I believe it was Mr. Schulder who said something^about the crimi-
nal--one of you in your testimony spoke of the/criminal cases and
how they were not appropriate or they were/not sensitive enough,
and so and so. I am saying it must be so, that Judge Ginsburg and
Judge Wald and Judge Mikva are not sensitive, either, because
they supported totally his position. TWt I guess is what I am
saying.                                 /

Ms. AXFORD. I don't know where yoij are getting the character-
ization.
Senator SIMPSON. YOU don't have to worry. Let me ask you a
question. Then you can have rebuttal, if you wish. I will stick
around all night.

You criticize Judge Thomas for a lack of experience, and yet he
has had 17 months of experience on the U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-
peals for the District of Columbia. I believe that is your statement.
Ms. AXFORD. Well, that is not totally correct. Not lack of experi-
ence, but inadequate experience, considering the position for which
he is being considered.
                                        1057

  Senator SIMPSON. OK. And can you tell me how much experience
Earl Warren spent on the bench before being appointed Chief Jus-
tice?

   Ms. AXFORD. No.

  Senator SIMPSON. None. How much time did Justice William O.
Douglas spend on the bench before being appointed to the Supreme
Court?

  Ms. AXFORD. I don't know.
  Senator SIMPSON. None. How much time did the great liberal
Justice Hugo Black spend on the bench before attaining the Su-
preme Court?
  Ms. AXFORD. I don't know.
  Senator SIMPSON. None. How about Felix Frankfurter? None.
Justice Louis Brandeis, none, who first wrote about privacy rights,
that I believe in just as strongly as I think Judge Thomas does.
  I really find it hard to believe that your organization would have
opposed those remarkable people. I really take it then, and I have
the sense, especially hearing your testimony personally, that your
opposition based on this issue of judicial experience is directed only
at conservatives, and when it comes to liberals prior experience
really is quite irrelevant. That is a--if that is true. Is that true?
  Ms. AXFORD. NO. In fact, I think you are making quite a leap of
reasoning in order to make that conclusion. I am also concerned
about you singling out one of the factors that we have mentioned;
that is, what we consider to be not enough experience on the court,
and comparing it with some of the fine jurists, conservative or lib-
eral.
  I appreciate your opportunity for me to be able to give you rebut-
tal on those issues, and I think that when you take a look at the
general experience of all of those jurists, and you take a look at
Judge Thomas' experience as it pertains to employment law, and
my focus is truly in the area of employment law, we are deeply,
deeply troubled by what he has said about employment law, about
the impact on employment law.
  And I would like to stay this evening and debate employment
law, privacy issues, disability matters, seniority systems, limitation
of damage awards, arbitration clauses, job performance issues,
workplace restrictions--many, many issues related and the Su-
preme Court decisions as it relate to it. But, in deference to the
others here, I don't think you and I will be able to do that.
  Senator SIMPSON. Oh, but it would be fun if we could do that.
  Well, I appreciate that. Those are serious issues to you and you
speak with power when you speak of them. And, unfortunately, or
fortunately, depending on your point of view, that is what every-
body does here. So, if everybody just got the answer out of him or
her, whoever would be before us, as to only the things that they
were just terribly gut-hard interested in, we would never get any-
thing done in here. Absolutely nothing, especially on the issue of
abortion. The Miranda rights.
  Go look at Thurgood Marshall and how beautifully he blunted
Senator Eastland, how beautifully he blunted Senator Erwin as
they kept asking, "What are you going to do with Miranda when
you get on the Court?" And he said, "I will not answer that ques-
tion." Nor should this man answer this question.
                                         1058

   Those are areas of controversy, discord. There is no reason for
him to answer it, and he won't answer it. And neither did Judge
Thurgood Marshall answer it in a question that was just exactly as
controversial.

  Ms. AXFORD. Senator, how do you perceive the role of this com-
mittee vis-a-vis the advice-and-consent function? And how far do
you think you can go to ask a candidate to answer a question?

  For instance, I am a litigator also, and when there is a witness
on the stand or, I imagine, in Judge Thomas' courtroom, how far
would someone get if a witness doesn't answer the question?

  Senator SIMPSON. Let me share with you, Ms. Axford, that no
one even asked anybody anything for 100 years in this Senate.
Nothing was asked of these nominees, not one single thing. In fact,
one of them sat outside the door and tapped, like it was a secret
session, and finally he said, "Do you want to see me or not?" and
they said, "No, we don't." One of them was asked eight questions.

  We have done this because I guess the people must like it. We
respond to the people. We are representatives of the people. But
let's understand what this process is.

  Ms. AXFORD. But this process when Rutledge was being consid-
ered there were 5 months of debates in the press, and certainly the
Pony Express may have had to have brought record of those, or the
telegraph or whatever the technology was. But thank the Lord, we
are making progress. There are Americans, millions across the
Nation, who are watching this legal process with the same interest
as they watch as "LA Law." And this is an important function to
the legal system.

  Senator SIMPSON. I would respectfully say that that is the way
we lawyers look at the world, but it is not really the way the
American public looks at the world because our job is one singular
thing: To find out the character, the integrity, the honesty, the
quality of this man. That is what our job is to find out. Not his phi-
losophy.

  In fact, under the American Bar Association rulings of qualified
and well-qualified and all the rest, that is all we are seeking, and
that is our job to seek too. That same thing.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Axford, I think he has answered your ques-
tion. I think he is dead wrong, but he has answered your question.
[Laughter.]

  And so, rather than litigate this thing
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, we find some lapse of judgment in our
chairman.
  Ms. AXFORD. May I respond to one thing that he said, so that
there is not a misunderstanding in my position on the record as
the position of my organization?
  The CHAIRMAN. Surely. You are just going to encourage the man
now.
  Senator SIMPSON. NO, I won't. I won't. I won't. I promise. I have
been very good. I think I have.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have. You have. You have.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you.
  Ms. AXFORD. If you hear me as saying this is a matter of philoso-
phy, I need to clarify. I don't think it is a matter of philosophy. It
is a matter of concern about credibility. It is a matter of inconsist-
                                         1059

ency. And, in the courtroom when there is an inconsistency, and
when there are witnesses that come up behind a chief witness and
there is such inconsistency, and I think he said this, and someone
else thinks he said that, then it is time to find out really what is
thought.

   And the philosophies of the jurists are going to be different, and
I think that people on either side of the issue have to gain by clar-
ity. I am concerned about the potential of executive branch influ-
ence preventing the purity, the truth, and the clarity of this man's
thinking.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. I would point out for the
record that the reason we didn't use to ask questions is they use to
just summarily vote against nominees based on their philosophy. I
am one who thinks philosophy always has been taken into account.
The more the President takes it into account, the more the Senate
historically has taken it into account. When he doesn't, the Senate
doesn't. When he does, the Senate does.

  And I might point out just for the record--I can help the Sena-
tor--Earl Warren, he asked about Earl Warren, was Governor of
the State of California for 10 years. He was a Vice Presidential
nominee in the Republican Party. He was a district attorney, and
he had a distinguished legal career.

  Justice Felix Frankfurter was assistant attorney for New York.
   Senator SIMPSON. Well, Mr. Chairman, I really don't need that
rehabilitation. I was talking about the issue of judicial experience.
I know what those men did. I will take judicial notice of that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right.
   Senator SIMPSON. I don't know what is appropriate about that. I
was responding to the issue of judicial experience, and that is only
what I was responding to.
  The CHAIRMAN. I misunderstood you. Because the men you
named, with the exception of Warren, were the most distinguished
lawyers in America at the time they were nominated. The most
distinguished lawyers in America by everyone's account.
  Senator SIMPSON. Let the record show that I would concur with
that, and let the record also show that none of them had one whit
of legal judicial experience.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, having said all that, let me yield to--no, I
am not going to yield to you
   Senator SIMON. I thought you were going to skip Senator Spec-
ter.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I wasn't going to skip him. You are looking
out for him, and I appreciate that. I was looking to see if Senator
Kohl had come in. He has not. I yield to my friend from Pennsylva-
nia. The hour is getting late, and the Senator from Wyoming and I
probably--we are good friends, and this isn't getting us anywhere.
  Senator SPECTER. MS. Axford, I agree with you that there are
many people, I don't know if there are millions, who are watching
this hearing at this moment. But had any chosen to watch you and
Senator Simpson, it would have been better than "LA Law" for
that last exchange. [Laughter.]
   And, by the time we get to midnight, which is not too far away,
this hearing could even become livelier.
                                         1060

   Let me pursue for just one moment, Ms. Aiyetoro, the question of
the decisions, and I don't want to place too much emphasis on it.
But the case that you cite in your brief, United States v. Rogers, or
that you cite in your statement, was a case with Judge Wald and
Judge Ginsberg, who I think it fair to say are, at the minimum, not
conservative or right-wing judges. And it involved a case where the
prosecution offered some evidence of a prior conviction in a paper
which was not objected to by the defense. And the court went into
some detail explaining that it was a tactical decision, and in that
context it could not be assigned as error.

  And, as I read the case, I saw no problem with his decision. It
was not suggestive of something conservative or right wing or ex-
treme. I wondered if you had had a chance to see United States v.
Lopez, which was not an opinion by Judge Thomas, but one where
he was on the panel and one where I questioned him, because this
was very much on the other side of the fence. This involved a sen-
tencing and the Uniform Code prohibits taking into consideration
socioeconomic factors.

  And the U.S. attorney said that to take into account Mr. Lopez's
background, his family, his home life, his dual--his approach from
both Hispanic and a U.S. point of view, and Judge Thomas joined
the court in allowing that to come in over the objection of the pros-
ecuting attorney, which suggests some expansiveness.

  So that I think that Judge Thomas' record shows some balance
there. And his testimony was, in response to the question on activ-
ist, was the Warren court activist in giving defendants rights, he
supported the Warren court. There is nothing in his writings that I
know of, and I believe I have read all of this writings, that say any-
thing to the contrary.

  What I would ask you on the issue of qualification is how you
would weigh the views you have expressed with the testimony of
Prof. Drew Days who, although not in favor of Judge Thomas, said
that he had the intellectual and educational qualifications, and
Judge John Gibbons, formerly Chief Judge of the third circuit, who
knew him as a member of the Holy Cross board and knew him for
years, and Judge Gibbons, again, is not a conservative judge, he
said he was well qualified, and Dean Calabrese of the Yale Law
School who said he was at least as well-qualified as recent nomi-
nees.

  How would you assess those evaluations compared to your own.
  Ms. AIYETORO. I would first like to point out our concern with the
criminal cases because the points you started off with was question-
ing the position on the criminal cases.
  The concern that we have is not whether or not he agrees or dis-
agrees with the other Justices on his panel. The concern we have is
that of all the criminal cases that he has had the responsibility to
write the decision, in all but one, in our understanding, or re-
search, he has supported the Government's position. The Govern-
ment's position that whittles down some of the rights of the defend-
ant, and that is our concern.
  We, I think, say, or I will say today if we don't, that clearly even
though he has been on the bench 17-18 months he has not ruled on
enough decisions to make a strong definite position on where he is
                                     1061

as a Justice, but it appears that he is leaning--in all but one he
supports the Government, and that is our concern.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, by supporting the Government's position
that doesn't necessarily mean he is wrong. If it is United States v.
Rogers,which you cite, I don't conclude that he was wrong there.

  Beyond supporting the Government's position, are you contend-
ing that he was wrong in doing so?

  Ms. AIYETORO. We think, Senator Specter, that because of the
fact that the criminal arena now, the criminal justice arena now is
disproportionately dealing with people of color that it is important
that procedural due process rights of the defendants get supported
to the nth. degree, to make sure that we are not convicting people
who are not guilty and sending people to prison who are.

  It seems to me, not that I disagree with this specific opinion, but
the point that we were attempting to make is that even though
Judge Thomas may have said, and he has said in several of the
criminal defense opinions that he has authored, that indeed it was
a problem, indeed the Government was wrong. But he finds harm-
less error.

  And it is our opinion that we have to go further. We can't just
say harmless error when you are looking a national prison statistic
that almost 50 percent of the people that are incarcerated in this
country are black and more than 50 percent are people of color.

  And that is not to say that we think that he should go the other
way and never uphold the Government, but that we feel that there
has to be--that the harmless error issue becomes more and more
problematic when you are looking at the kind of criminal justice
system we have now. So that is our position.

  The other point that I believe you asked me was whether or
not--how I would view his intellectual capability, and you named
other persons who had said that he was intellectually qualified.
Our opposition to him is not based on whether or not he has the
intellectual capability to be a judge. Not many people go and grad-
uate from Yale who don't have the intellectual capacity to qualify
to be a judge. We are not taking the position that he is unqualified
because of that.

  We are opposing him because of his record; because of his record
in all of his public office that appears to undermine the right of
people of color, women, and the disenfranchised. We take that posi-
tion.

  We take the position also, as I said in my oral testimony, that his
testimony and his record also indicate someone that is not really
100 percent aboveboard in many ways, and we've given examples of
that. For those reasons, we oppose him. Not because he is not
smart enough. Not because he didn't go to law school. Not because
of anything else, even though we think that he doesn't have the
kind of stellar background that many other justices have.

  Senator SPECTER. One final brief question, if I may, Mr. Chair-
man.

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. Reverend Taylor, you said in your statement
that Judge Thomas has not, in his years of public service, conduct-
ed himself as one who can think clearly for himself. Did you see
                                         1062

his testimony or any part of his testimony during his 4 days before
this committee?

   Reverend TAYLOR. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. And after seeing that, you think he cannot
think clearly for himself?
  Reverend TAYLOR. Well, his past issue has been to mimic the ad-
ministration points of view, and I think he was doing that in the
hearing by evading questions that were put before him.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. I wish all the witnesses would stop
inflating the Senator from Pennsylvania's ego by suggesting that
you have to be smart to have graduated from Yale Law School. The
last panel said something complimentary about him. From now on,
the Chair rules, no more complimentary comments about the Sena-
tor from Pennsylvania.
  Senator SPECTER. Yale has done very well at these hearings.
  The CHAIRMAN. In a sense that it's been present, it has. Now
with that, I thank the panel very, very much.
  Mr. SCHULDER. Mr. Chairman, before we leave, could I enter into
the record the statement of two older persons, Ray Albano and
Georgiana Jungels, who came here--one from Seattle, one from
Buffalo--to give testimony on ADEA treatment of their work and
were unable to testify? They've asked me to ask you to submit it
for the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be submitted for the
record.
  Mr. SCHULDER. Thank you.

                                        Statement of Ray Albano
                          on the Nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas

                                       To the U.S. Supreme Court
                                      Senate Judiciary Committee

                                           September 19, 1991

        My name is Ray Albano. I'm 60 years old, and I live in Seattle, Washington. I
would describe myself as politically conservative. I have never voted for a Democrat for
President, and the only Democrat I ever did vote for was Scoop Jackson. I have served
as leader of the 21st District Republicans in Snohomish County, and as a Lynwood City
Council member.

         Seven years ago, I became the victim of age discrimination. What happened to
me at the EEOC under the direction of Clarence Thomas is why I oppose his nomination
to the U.S. Supreme Court. The EEOC did all it could to .not help me. That agency did
everything possible riot to enforce the very law that it was charged with enforcing, in fact,
the EEOC let the statute of limitations run on my claim, and it is only because of a special
act of Congress and my own persistent efforts that I have gotten anywhere. And I know
that my experience was not unique.

         From 1973 to 1985, I worked as a sales representative for a major corporation.
In 1983, I found out that the company had a plan to force"out its older workers. Their
plan became very real to me when I was denied a promotion. I was the most qualified
candidate for the job, and the person selected was not even 25 years old. I asked to be
                                       1064

considered for another position, but was told that this was not a possibility either. I was
told that both jobs were "young men's jobs."

         I have degenerative arthritis, and in 1984 I had my hip replaced. For about two
weeks, I was in the hospital, and I was on medical leave from October 1984 until January
1985. During this time, my employer expected me to carry a full workload. In fact, the
day after I was released to return to work, my supervisor put me on probation, citing poor
work performance. He also moved several of my key accounts and reduced my
commissions. He told me that I would now have to call on retail stores, and I would have
to help build displays for these stores. This meant carrying and lifting heavy cases --
work that was very painful and difficult for me because of my surgery. I was told that I
had to do it - I had no choice - if I wanted to keep my job. I was so scared and upset
that I would go home at night and cry. I couldn't afford to lose my job, and I tried to do
the best I could, but every day, my supervisor would find something else wrong with my
performance. Finally, I decided that I had no choice but to file an age discrimination
charge.

         I went to the EEOC in February 1985. I told them about the promotions I had
been denied and why I believed it was because of my age. I told them about the
company's plan to fire older workers. I told them about'my surgery and the pressures
placed on me during my medical leave. I told them about tieing placed on probation and
my commissions being reduced the day after I came back to work. I told them that I had
been given a job assignment that I found almost physically impossible to do, and that I
                                       1065

had a doctor's letter confirming this. I told them that I believed that my employer was
harassing me to make me quit my job.

         Despite all this, all the EEOC would do is put a claim of a denied promotion in the
charge. They told me that I would be assigned an investigator and I could tell the
investigator about all the harassment. I tried to discuss it further, but got nowhere. I was
told to sign the complaint as it was drafted, so I did.

         In late February 1985, I tried to discuss the harassment with the EEOC
investigator. In fact, conditions at work had gotten worse. I was told, however, that I
could not amend my claim.

         Finally, all the abuse at work took its toll. I couldn't handle it any more -- either
physically or emotionally - and so I left my job on March 1,1985. A few weeks later, I
called the EEOC to tell them what had happened. I again asked if the charge should be
amended to reflect the harassment. I was told that was not necessary.

         Altogether, I had about 14 conversations with the EEOC. [ had to initiate every
call; they never contacted me. In many of these conversations, I tried to discuss the
harassment and whether I needed to amend my complaint. Each time I was told no. I
never received anything in writing from the EEOC telling mewhat was happening with my
case. Finally, in February 1987, the EEOC told me that they were not going to do
anything about my charge, and that it was too late to file suit.
                                       1066

         I didn't do anything after that, because I thought there was nothing 1could do.
Then, I heard on the news that Congress had extended the statute of limitations for Age
Discrimination claims. So, I found a lawyer, who filed suit for me in federal court. I lost.
One of the reasons was that the statute of limitations had run.

         I appealed my case to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where I finally won. On
August 30,1990, the court ruled that my suit could go forward. Finally, I have a trial date
set for next April. The Ninth Circuit ruled that I had done all that could reasonably be
expected to protect my rights, and that the EEOC had been at fault.

         I flew here from Seattle because I think I have an important story to tell. I know
that what happened to me at the EEOC was not isolated or unique. In fact, one of the
EEOC case workers told me that they were simply following policy from Headquarters.
They had received memos from Washington, D.C. telling them to get rid of their cases
as fast as they could. And I was one of the many victims. As head of the EEOC,
Clarence Thomas tried to gut the very law he was charged with enforcing. His record
makes me question his respect for established law that may be at odds with his personal
beliefs. I am here to oppose his confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.

                         on the Confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas

                                       to the U.S. Supreme Court
                                       Senate Judiciary Commitee

                                           September 19, 1991

     My name is Georgiana Jungels. I have worked for over 30 years as a teacher,
and since 1974 I have been a professor at the State University of New York.

     I am here to describe my experience with the EEOC under the "leadership" of
Clarence Thomas and the personal toll it took on me. I'm a college professor. I've
worked for a long time. I've learned how to combine a career and four children. I've
learned a few things. But a person can't work 7 days a week. A person cannot and
should not have to constantly monitor a public agency to make sure it does its job.
When I filed my complaint with the EEOC, I believed that this agency would do what it
is supposed to do -- help victims of employment discrimination. It did not. From the
very beginning, my case was mishandled.

     In February, 1985, I filed an age and sex discrimination claim against my employer
with the EEOC. My employer had eliminated my position as director of a graduate
studies program. However, four months later, this position was "recreated" and filled
with a male. Later, it was filled with a younger woman. The very first letter I
received from EEOC was addressed to "Miss Jordan." I'don't know who that is, but
clearly that is not me. I notified the Buffalo office of the error, and they sent me a
corrected letter. In that letter, the EEOC stated that the initial investigation would be
                                        1068

done by the New York State Division of Human Rights, and that I would be hearing
from this agency in the near future. Ten months went by and I did not hear a thing.
So I called the regional director of the New York Division of Human Rights. He told
me that what the EEOC had told me was totally incorrect. He told me that, in fact,
EEOC had asked the Division of Human Rights to waive their right for initial
investigation so that the EEOC could do it themselves.

     At that point, I called the director of the EEOC local office in Buffalo. I asked him
three very simple questions. One, what had been done to date; two, what was going
to be done; and three, when would it be done? I was told that my case was "under
investigation," and there was nothing further they could tell me. At the same time, I
got correspondence from them with incorrect charge numbers. I wrote back with the
correct information.

     Every time I called, the EEOC Buffalo office told me that my case was under
investigation. Each time, I asked for a clear plan of action. At the point when there
was only four months remaining before the end of the statute of limitations, I asked
what they were going to do. At this point, I asked both Senator D'Amato's office and
Senator Moynihan's office for some assistance.

     The Senators contacted the EEOC on my behalf, and I think they were as shocked
as I was by the response. Basically, in the entire eighteen months, nothing had been
done. For example, the EEOC had requested some information from my employer,
but then did nothing at all with it. And their only response was to ask for my
forgiveness.
                                       1069

     I continued to contact the EEOC. I continued to ask for information. They told me
that they had misplaced my file. Did I have a copy of the original charge? I Xeroxed
the original charge. I forwarded it to them, and I asked if I could look at my file to
make sure nothing else was misplaced. And I was told that I was not allowed to do
that. To date, I do not know whether or not the thousands of pages I have submitted
to the EEOC Buffalo office are, in fact, in my file, or if they, too, have been misplaced.

     Eleven days before the statute of limitations was to run, I met with the director of
the local regional EEOC office. I was told: "You must go into court yourself. There's
nothing we can do on your behalf. You don't need a letter. You just go do that
yourself, or you will have given up your right to equal protection under the law." I
asked for a response to the same questions I had been asking for 2 1/2 years: "What
have you done; what will you be doing; and when will you be doing it? " And I was
told that it was the policy of the EEOC not to respond to such questions in writing.

     On the very last day before the statute of limitations was to run, I went down the
U.S. District Court in Buffalo, New York. With considerable assistance from the Clerk
of the Court, I tried to fill out the necessary papers to file a complaint. I sent a copy of
what I had filed to the director of the EEOC Buffalo office. Monday morning -- the
very next working day -- he called me. He said, "You have filed the wrong form." I
said, "Pardon me. I filed the form that I was advised to file by the District Court
Clerk." He said, "I think it's the wrong form." I said, "Well, thank you for calling me
and bringing this to my attention. I will call the Clerk."

     And so I spoke with the Clerk -- who, I must add, had spent an hour and a half
                                        1070

reading through a book that was an inch and a half thick in order to advise me
appropriately on how to file my complaint. He told me that the forms I had used were
the only ones they had. He told me not to worry. If the Judge finds an error in the
form, he would advise me and it would be corrected.

     I believe that the EEOC's repeated delays and failure to act on my behalf sent a
very clear message to my employer. That message was: "Do as you please." And
my employer listened. During this time, I was assigned the highest workload of any
faculty member in the entire state university system. While on sick leave for a
physical injury, my employer sent me letter after letter and made phone call after
phone call to me at home, demanding that I respond immediately. I reported all of this
to the EEOC, and they did nothing.

     When I returned to work, the harassment escalated. I was even disciplined for
questioning my employer's treatment of me! I filed a retaliation charge with the
EEOC. Four months later, with apparently no investigation, the EEOC dismissed this
charge.

     What I want to underscore is that instead of acting as my advocate, the EEOC
functioned as an obstacle. Instead of removing the prejudice in my workplace, the
EEOC sanctioned it. While mine is a single story, it has been multiplied thousands of
times. When I heard that President Bush had nominated Judge Thomas to the
Supreme Court, I couldn't believe it. And now I'm here to question why the U.S.
Senate would confirm someone who failed to follow the very law he was charged with
enforcing.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW our last, but clearly not least, panel. We've
combined two panels. After consultation with Senator Thurmond
we've combined the two panels. Our next panel, which is the 10th
panel today and the 12th panel. Each of these witnesses is testify-
ing in support of Judge Thomas' nomination.

  They are Ed Hayes, attorney for Baker & Hostetler here in
Washington DC, who is here on behalf of the Council of 100. And
David Zwiebel--I hope I am pronouncing it correctly--who is gen-
eral counsel and director of government affairs at Agudath Israel.
And John Palmer, president and chief executive officer of EPD En-
terprises; the largest food service management operator in the four
states of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Nebraska. And J.C. Alvarez,
who is vice president of River North Distributing in Chicago, IL.
Ms. Alvarez worked with Judge Thomas while he was on Senator
Danforth's staff and while he was at the Department of Education,
as well as when he headed EEOC.

  Welcome, all. Why don't you begin your testimony in the order
in which you've been called.

  Excuse me, the Senator from Alabama.
  Senator HEFLIN. There are some witnesses that I know from my
State that were unable to come that were on the witness list. I
assume that the statements of any witnesses who were on the wit-
ness list can be admitted into the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, they will be. They'll all be admitted.

         Remarks by United States District Court Senior Judge Jack E.
Tanner Before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee Upon the
Nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas To Be An Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court of the United Sates.

         I was born in Tacoma, Washington, and I have lived there all
of my life. I came from a family where my father was involved with
the immigration of longshoremen and seamen on the Pacific Cost of
this country. My father was a personal friend of Harry Bridges,
the longtime leader of the Waterfront workers. I was a baseball
player, and I thought good enough to play professional baseball
except for the color line.

         I became a member of the longshoremen union in Tacoma just
before I went into the Army in World War II. I, of course, was a
member of an all Black unit with white officers. We were known as
one of those "Jim Crow" units in the armed forces of the United
States. But, it was because of my experience in the army that
caused me to go to law school. I went to law school under the GI
Bill.

        After law school I went into private practice. I represented
anyone and everyone, including Blacks, Mexicans, Indians, and
Orientals. I became a branch president of the NAACP, then an area
President, then I served for seven years on the Board of Directors
of the NAACP. I marched in the South, North, East and West in the
civil rights demonstrations. I knew personally at the time all of
the giants of the civil rights movement. I was a personal friend
                                   1073

of Medgar Evers before he was slain in Mississippi. I represented
Indians in the State of Washington before the Supreme Court of the
United States as to their treaty fishing rights.

         I am a life member of the NAACP. I am a life member of the
National Bar Association, and I am a member of the Judicial Council
of the NBA as well as a Past Chairman of the council. I was one of
the founders of the National Conference of Black Lawyers. I have
received awards and recognition from all of these groups for
outstanding contributions to the struggle for civil and human
rights as well as for scholarship and justice in the federal
courts. I have received recognition and awards from the National
Association of Women Judges,and from the National Association of
Blacks in the criminal justice system. I was honored by the
members of the Federal Bar Association of the Western District of
Washington for my contribution to fair play and justice in the
Federal court.

         I defer to no one as to the understanding and contribution to
the ongoing struggle of men and women of all colors for civil
rights and human dignity.

         I think that I should say here that recently I have been
appearing as a speaker at several grade schools in the State of
Washington. The schools where I attended contained students of all

                                                        2
                                 1074

colors and backgrounds. I was amazed at the reactions to me when
I appeared in my black robe. Their reactions and the responses of
their parents was the most satisfying experience that I have had
while on the Federal bench, and I am now in my fourteenth year of
service.

        My father was and I was, before I became a judge, active in
Democratic politics.

         I am here because of the most intense, unprecedented and harsh
opposition, in the history of this country, to a nominee to the
Supreme Court of the United States. The attacks have now also
shifted to members of the Senate. There is no logic or reason for
the attacks, whether from the right or the left. They are
emotional attacks, based solely upon passion and prejudice,
neither of which has any relevance to the qualifications or fitness
of the nominee. I am most concerned with the concept of fairness
and justice, which are the very foundation of our system of
jurisprudence. These remarks that I am making are my own and do
not purport to represent the view of any other person or
organization.

        I am also concerned because, I, too, appeared before this
Committee under somewhat similar circumstances. I was the first
Black person West of Chicago and North of San Francisco ever
nominated as an Article III Judge. I was nominated by Senator
                                   1075

Warren G. Magnuson, the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee. He formerly was, as several of you will recall,
Chairman of the Commerce Committee, the committee where Civil
Rights Legislation in the 1960's originated.

        My nomination was immediately opposed by certain factions in
the State of Washington. The opposition was led by a local
newspaper. Senator Henry M. Jackson, concerned about the nature of
the attack against my nomination, appeared at a news conference in
Seattle and denounced the attack. Senator Jackson said that the
attack against me was "only because he is Black" . . . "that, if
Tanner was white, there would be no opposition to his nomination.
. ." I think that I should say here that not one member of the
Senate voted against my nomination.

        As you know, Senators Jackson and Magnuson were both lifelong
Democrats and ardent supporters of Civil Rights and human dignity
for all. Both of them would know and understand why the President
appointed Judge Thomas, and they would also understand that the
President would not have nominated him if he was not qualified and
fit to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States. There never has been a President of the United States who
ever appointed a Black person to high judicial office or any other
high office, when the person appointed was not qualified to do the
job. That doesn't happen in America.
                                   1076

         Several organizations have announced opposition to the Thomas
nomination for a variety of specious reasons. He doesn't
understand and appreciate the Black Experience, or his views on
Civil Rights are inconsistent to Hispanics; he holds views
dangerous to the rights important to Hispanics; he would undermine
equal opportunity; he would oppose abortions for women. They say
that he is opposed to quotas and affirmative action although he
owes his own status to that policy; and, he is bent on, and
espouses, a radical philosophy; that he doesn't like Jews, or labor
organizations; that he is indifferent to the concerns of the
elderly people; that he favors Catholicism over other religious
faiths; that he does not fully understand the legal merits of
issues; that he would sabotage the very laws he is supposed to
enforce; and, that constitutional and statutory rights that
Americans have enjoyed for years would be obliterated by a single
stroke of his pen. It is also feared that he will apply "natural
law" to deprive untold numbers of Americans of their life, liberty
and property. The great debate among legal and political
philosophers goes on and on. It means different things to
different people. If you believe in either judicial activism or
judicial restraint, right or left, then take your choice. One's
viewpoint probably depends upon whose ox is getting gored.

        The race to denounce the nominee has reached also a "lynch
mob" atmosphere. The objective and goal of the opponents of the
nominee is obvious, and that is to convince the Senate of the
                                   1077

United States that the nominee is not fit politically and
ideologically to be an Associate Supreme Court Justice. There are,
perhaps, some who are acting in good faith in opposing Thomas'
nomination, but, at least, they are confused. They seem to believe
that America is now at long last color blind, but the facts and
reality are to the contrary.

The opponents of Judge Thomas' nomination are concerned that he
might do this, or he might do that, or his confirmation will lead
to some ideological shift in the Supreme Court, or that he is
somehow outside the mainstream of legal thinking in this country,
just because they do not agree with his sense of values or judicial
philosophy, whatever it is that might be. Judge Thomas has sat, as
a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, for 19 months now, and his judicial philosophy is still
uncertain and unknown. Yet, about 96% of the cases decided by that
court are final decisions. What is certain and known about Judge
Thomas is that he is independent and can't be put into a category.
He is just where he should be. Speculation and hysteria, as to
what the nominee might do, should not disqualify him from the
Supreme Court. After all, no other nominee has ever been
disqualified for such reasons. Judge Thomas understands, very
well, the rule of law.

        Let me take just a moment to explain to the members of the
committee why I maintain that the opposition to the nominee is ill-
                       1078

conceived and ill-advised. Most, if not all, of the opponents to
Clarence Thomas' nomination appear to base their opposition upon
what he might do to destroy or blunt a particular cause or program
that they are interested in at the moment. They have been referred
to at times as "special interests."

                                                                                            /

Where were those opposition leaders when former President

Reagan nominated Chief Justice William Rehnquist? Where was the

opposition when President Reagan nominated Justice Sandra Day

O'Connor, or when Reagan nominated Justice Antonin Scalia? Where

were they when President Bush nominated Justice Tony Kennedy and

Justice David Souter? For the most part, they were silent, or at

best offered only token opposition. But, the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), one of those groups

opposing the current nominee, vigorously endorsed Justice Tony

Kennedy and accepted him with open arms.  Surely these

organizations do not believe that their cause will fare any better

under Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy and Souter.

Most were Appellate Court Judges, and all were nominated by a

Republican President.

        I realize, of course, that there is one obvious difference
between Thomas and the previous nominees to the United States
Supreme Court.
                                   1079

         In my opinion, these groups are saying, and I include all
those groups opposing Thomas' nomination, that we just do not trust
Judge Thomas because he is a Black man. Support for this position
comes from the prevalent view in America, and it is caused by the
ravages and comes from the vestiges of slavery and the infamous
Black codes which followed. The coloreds, (or Negroes, Blacks or
African - Americans if you will ) could not be trusted with
responsibilities and obligations that affected the armed forces,
judicial, political, social and educational institutions of
America. They could not be trusted to fight in the many wars of
this country, although they did, and with courage and valor, and so
it stood to reason that they could not be trusted with the life,
liberty and property of white Americans.

         In 1948 President Truman issued an executive order eliminating
segregation in the armed forces of the United States. That order
was the best thing that happened to the descendants of slaves since
the Emancipation Proclamation. By that order Truman, in effect,
acknowledged that Black members of the armed services could be
entrusted with the security of America against all foreign powerb.
In 1949 President Truman appointed, for the first time in the
history of the United States, the first Article III Black judge.
He appointed William Hastie to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
In 1955 the Supreme Court of the United States handed down the
opinion of Brown v. Board of Education, the greatest decision ever
handed down by the Supreme Court at any time in our history.

                                                        8

Thurgood Marshall was rewarded for his great victory in that case
when President Lyndon Johnson nominated him to the Supreme Court of
the United States. Once again, it had been recognized by the
country that the Black man could be trusted.

         Despite these significant strides toward equality, it was not
until 1969 that a Republican President ever appointed an Article
III Black judge. But, Richard Nixon did not make appointments of
any Black to the Supreme Court, or to any of the United States
Courts of Appeal.

         In 1991, the United States went to war in the Middle East.
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces of
the United States was one Colin Powell, then a four-star general
and a Black man as well. President Bush, as Commander - In -
Chief of the Armed Forces, trusted the integrity, loyalty, training
and experience of General Powell. He was, in fact, entrusting the
security of the United States to a Black man. History will show
that trust was well placed. It is my judgement that history will
repeat itself, and one day show that President Bush, the first
Republican President to ever do so, was right in entrusting to a
Black man, the job of safeguarding the life, liberty and property
of all Americans, by nominating Judge Clarence Thomas to the
Supreme Court of the United States.
                                    1081

        It defies logic and reason to say that since a Republican
President has discovered, in 1991, another qualified Black man,
that he should be rejected because he is Black. I would challenge
and reject the suggestion by anyone, that America and the Supreme
Court of the United States should be denied, for any reason, the
Black Experience in America in 1991, or in any other time as long
as America exists as a free nation. Just because a President
appoints a person who has the same political philosophy that he
has, it does not follow that the person nominated is not qualified
or fit to sit on the Supreme Court.

        Judge Thomas is just as well qualified to become an associate
justice of the Supreme Court as were the 102 white males, 1 Black
male and 1 white woman who have heretofore come before this body
for advice and consent. In fact, because he has had the Black
experience, he is better qualified than all but 2 members of the
Supreme Court.

        Neither the proponents nor the opponents of Judge Thomas'
nomination seem to acknowledge, perhaps, the most important
consideration, at this time in our history, that qualifies a person
to sit on the Supreme Court. That most important qualification
seems to be the nominee's ethnic and religious background. It just
didn't happen that Antonin Scalia was the most qualified person
when he was selected for the Supreme Court. He just happened to be

                                                       10
                                    1082

the most qualified person of Italian descent. It just didn't
happen that Sandra Day O'Connor was the most qualified person when
she was selected. She was, however, the most qualified female at
the time. Tony Kennedy just happened to be of the Roman Catholic
faith, and presumptively opposed to abortions. David Souter is
somewhat of a mystery, but an educated guess would place him
squarely in support of the President's political agenda.

         This Committee can believe the President of the United States
when he says that, "Judge Thomas is the best man for the job."
Just because he happens to be a Black man does not disqualify him
nor should it by any test or criteria. It has only happened twice,
in our history, that a Black man has been nominated. It is highly
doubtful that any of us in this room will see it happen again.

         It is my judgement that there are a great number of Americans
out there, and, yes, there are people throughout the world, who are
watching this great drama unfold. It is also my judgement that the
great majority of those Americans, white, black, brown, yellow and
red, and of all religions and faiths, want to see Judge Clarence
Thomas sitting as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the
United States. They want to see fair play and justice done to this
man. They want to be able to point to this man and say to their
children that they too can aspire to the highest court in the land;
that they too can expect fairness and justice; and that they too
can put their hopes and dreams in America where the rule of the

                                                        11
                                   1083

law, and not of man, reigns supreme.
         In conclusion, let me just say, that despite the vicious,

unwarranted and unprecedented attacks upon the nominee, he still
stands tall. He has exhibited more than just plain character while
under fire. This Black man has exhibited sheer guts and willpower,
above and beyond the call of duty to his country. He has displayed
courage and valor, in the face of the bitter criticism and abuse
heaped upon him. Such valor and courage, in the time of war, is
rewarded in the Armed Services of the United States, by an award of
the Congressional Medal of Honor. What could be a greater test of
character than that displayed by the nominee.

      STATEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE ALVIN HOLMES,
A MEMBER OP THE ALABAMA BOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

         BEFORE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF THE
                        UNITED STATES SENATE
                         SEPTEMBER 19, 1991

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,

I express ay appreciation to each of you for allowing this
statement to enter the records of the Judiciary Committee of
the proceedings of Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the
United States Supreme Court.

First of all, Judge Clarence Thomas talks about his childhood
as if he is the only black person who suffered racist insults.
The fact of the matter is that every black American in the
south withstood indignities of segregation and "Jim Crow."
Each of us can share a story of humiliation during the U.S.
apartheid in the deep south.

It is very unfortunate that Judge Clarence Thomas attempts to
lift his experience above that of others in the black community
and it should be insulting to the committee that Judge Thomas
has used such pandering tactics to ingratiate himself with the
committee.

what is different about Judge Clarence Thomas and the majority
of the black community in the deep south is that thousands upon
thousands of black people marched, demonstrated, went to jail,
were brutally beaten and, unfortunately, there were some who
gave their lives standing up for their dignity until the walls
of segregation and humiliation came tumbling down.

if Judge Thomas was so insulted during his childhood by the
indignities of segregation, then where was he during the sit-
ins, the freedom rides, the confrontation with Bull Conner in
Birmingham, the confrontation in Albany, Georgia, the marching
in Mississippi, the Selna to Montgomery march, the great march
on Washington for jobs, and the inarch in Memphis, Tennessee?
Judge Thomas was not among the multitude, yet he criticizes
black people in masses and civil rights organizations that
chipped, and continue to chip, away at the scourge of
                                   1085

Page 2
September 19, 1991

discrimination so that our constitution can be a living
document for all Americans* Obviously, he was not concerned
about the freedom of blacks because he never participated in
any civil rights movements in the country to my knowledge.
Instead, Judge Thomas criticized black civil rights leaders as
"bitching and moaning all the time."

In regards to affirmative action, the southern states have a
long history of denying black people equal employment
opportunities. If it were not for various laws, rules and
regulations concerning affirmative action to give the blacks an
equal chance, much would be left missing.

In the long history of most states in the nation, if it were
not for different rules and laws dealing with set-aside
programs and affirmative action, blacks would not have the
opportunity to participate in the economic prosperity of this
nation.

Further, Judge Thomas has taken a strong position against
united States Supreme Court decisions dealing with the rights
of poor and disadvantaged people. Judge Thomas states that he
was once poor and now, since becoming successful, he, in my
opinion, has turned his back on the poor and the disadvantaged
of this country. There exists no positive record, to my
knowledge, that Judge Thomas put forth any efforts to help the
poor, the discriminated, the destitute, the old, and the black
people of this nation.

I feel that, once on the Supreme Court, Judge Thomas will lead
the Court on all civil rights matters. That his voice will be
used to permit extreme discrimination to re-emerge. Moreover,
if Judge Thomas is approved for the Supreme Court, in my
opinion, it will send the wrong message to young black
Americans that the way to be successful in life is to criticize
the civil rights movement and civil rights leaders of this
country and cater to the extreme conservative elements of this
country that have always taken the position against the quality
and freedom of black people.

Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for
allowing this testimony to enter into the records of your
proceedings.

Please vote against Judge Thomas' confirmation.

 REPORT ON THE NOMINATION OF
     JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS

TO BECOME ANASSOCIATE JUSTICE
  OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

Adopted unanimously by the NACDL Board of Directors
                     August 17. 1991.
                                    1087

               NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYERS

              Report on the Nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas
                         to Become an Associate Justice of the
                            Supreme Court of the United States

         On July 1, 1991, President George Bush nominated Clarence
Thomas, a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the vacancy on the Supreme
Court of the United States created by the resignation of Associ-
ate Justice Thurgood Marshall. The NACDL opposes the nomination
of Judge Thomas to serve on the Supreme Court.

         1. Why NACDL Cannot Support the Nomination of Judge Clar-
ence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Certainly, NACDL cannot
affirmatively endorse this nomination. While Judge Thomas
appears to have the intellect, temperament and legal ability to
serve on the High Court, he has not clearly demonstrated a
professional commitment to the ideals of individual liberty and
justice for which the Association stands, particularly with
respect to the rights of the criminally accused. Since becoming
a lawyer, Judge Thomas has apparently never represented a private
individual, much less an accused criminal. Nor has he otherwise
shown particular concern for enforcing the rights of the individ-
ual against assertions of state power. It is not nearly enough
that his appointment would help somewhat to restore the loss of
critical diversity of personal background and life experience
among Members of the Court occasioned by the resignation of
Justice Marshall.

         Except for two years as an in-house attorney for the Mon-
santo chemical company, Judge Thomas has always chosen to work
for the state or federal government; his earliest responsibili-
ties with the office of the Missouri Attorney General upon
graduating from Yale Law School in 1974 involved arguing criminal
appeals for the state. (To our knowledge, he has never either
tried a case or presided over a trial as a judge.) As discussed
in the reports of leading civil rights groups, his tenure as
Chair of the EEOC raises serious questions about his devotion to
the law and legal process, especially as regards the system of
checks and balances among the three branches of the federal
government. Judge Clarence Thomas does not merit an affirmative
endorsement from the NACDL.

         2. Why NACDL Opposes the Nomination of Judge Thomas. The
NACDL opposes the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to become
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court for three reasons:
lack of commitment to certain basic but threatened principles of
criminal justice, a dubious sense of judicial ethics, and adher-
ence to an unusual and dangerously ill-defined jurisprudential
philosophy.

            a. Lack of Commitment to Equal Justice and Due Process.
                                     1088

The first reason that NACDL should oppose Judge Thomas's nomina-
tion is that he has not demonstrated a commitment to certain
basic principles of equal justice and due process for which this
Association stands. Not the least of these is the Constitution-
ally-mandated role of the defense attorney in ensuring fairness
in criminal cases. Nor is it certain that he accepts the exclu-
sionary rule as a necessary means of enforcing of Fourth, Fifth
and Sixth Amendment rights, or that he would demand the most
scrupulous fairness in the administration of capital punishment
if the death penalty is not to be abolished (as NACDL would
prefer). (If Judge Thomas opposes the death penalty, as does his
mentor Senator Danforth, or believes in strict limits on its
application, he has never said so publicly.) Finally, we do not
know whether he supports the vital role of the federal courts,
exercising their constitutionally-mandated habeas corpus power,
to review the fundamental fairness of criminal judgments that
have been upheld in state court.

         Judge Thomas has had little or nothing to say publicly about
any of these most critical issues, nor are we aware of any
privately-expressed opinions. His views on other civil rights
and civil liberties questions, while not directly applicable in
the context of defendants' rights, may provide some guidance. In
addition, his support for the exercise of executive power and
disdain for that of Congress and the judiciary, as noted below,
strongly suggest that he would take unsatisfactory positions on
these issues. Because his views are not known with certainty,
however, NACDL urges the Senate to inquire closely during the
confirmation process into Judge Thomas's views on basic princi-
ples of equal justice and due process, as they pertain to the
rights of the accused.

              b. LaTft flf Ethical Sensitivity as a Judge. Attorneys
who have argued criminal appeals before Judge Thomas find him to
be intelligent, courteous, attentive and well-prepared on the
bench. We do not fault him on any of these grounds. Neverthe-
less, his failure to recuse himself when his impartiality could
reasonably be questioned does raise a serious concern about his
ethical judgment and ability to separate personal bias from
official judicial responsibility.

         Most troubling is Judge Thomas's record on the Oliver North
case. Judge Thomas publicly praised Col. North in several 1987
and 1988 speeches and in a 1989 article. One speech lauded North
for having done "a most effective job of exposing congressional
irresponsibility." Remarks at Wake Forest Univ., April 18, 1988,
at 21 (referring to him familiarly as "Ollie North"). Neverthe-
less, despite holding strong personal views in support of this
defendant, Judge Thomas did not disqualify himself from voting on
North's appeal. Specifically, Judge Thomas participated in the
vote to deny rehearing in bane in United States v. North. 920
F.2d 940, 959 (1990), the decision which overturned North's
                                     1089

convictions for endeavoring to obstruct Congress (and other
charges). Since by his own public admission Judge Thomas had an
extrajudicial bias in favor of a party, it is beyond peradventure
that he should not have voted in the Oliver North case. Two
other members of the D.C. Circuit (Judges Mikva and Edwards)
declined for reasons of their own to participate in that vote.

         Also of concern to the committee is Judge Thomas's failure
to recuse himself in A I P O Petfoods. Inc. v. Ralston Purina Co..
913 F.2d 958 (D.C.Cir. 1990). In that case, he wrote the opinion
overturning a large damage award against a company owned by
members of Danforth family, and of which his close friend and
mentor, Senator Danforth, is an heir. Again, it seems apparent
that Judge Thomas's impartiality in that situation could reason-
ably be questioned, requiring him to disqualify himself.

              c. Dangerous "Natural Law" Philosophy. Like Robert Bork
before him, Judge Thomas has an unusual jurisprudential view of
the Constitution, but it is not Bork's "originalist," pro-govern-
ment, anti-libertarian view. Thomas has consistently endorsed a
"natural rights" theory of the Constitution, suggesting that the
Constitution should be interpreted according to an extra-legal
standard of right and wrong that humans can deduce from a study
of "human nature," revealing the "laws of Nature and of Nature's
God." Judge Thomas states that the "revolutionary meaning" of
America is the basing of its government "on a universal truth,
the truth of human equality." 30 Howard L.J. 691, 697 (1987).
NACDL recognizes that this philosophy was indeed shared by those
who signed the Declaration of Independence and by many who framed
the Constitution as well. It was invoked by some of the aboli-
tionists, such as Frederick Douglass, who argued that nothing in
the original Constitution endorsed slavery; indeed, Judge Thomas
has drawn on that tradition in support of his view that Brown v.
Board of Education was decided the right way for the wrong
reasons. (In the same essay, he also relies on the Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr., Attorney General Edwin Meese III, President
Ronald Reagan, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Tom Paine, all within two
paragraphs.)

         Curiously coupled with Thomas's "natural law" argument is an
expressed disdain for the right of privacy, as applied in Gris-
wold v. Connecticut and Roe v. Wade, on the basis that privacy is
not explicitly identified in the text of the Bill of Rights. The
Ninth Amendment declares that such unenumerated rights exist and
are to be protected. Failure to recognize that the right of
privacy extends beyond the confines of the First, Fourth and
Fifth Amendments leads inexorably to overcriminalization and
abuse of state power. NACDL must not forget that the laws
challenged in Griswold and Roe carried criminal penalties.

         If we knew that "human equality" were the only "universal
truth" that Judge Thomas finds behind (or above) the Constitu-
                                     1090

tion, and if we were confident that he is deeply committed to
applying this truth to women's lives as completely as to men's,
we might be less uneasy with this "natural law" philosophy. But
Eighteenth and Nineteenth Century ideas of "human nature" spell
indifference to the problem of poverty, and personal and profes-
sional oppression for women in today's world. The Supreme Court
explicitly invoked "nature herself" and "the law of the Creator"
to hold in 1873 that a woman could be refused the right to
practice law. Moreover, many traditional views of human nature
are fundamentally punitive and unforgiving, and have profound
implications for criminal law which are contrary to NACDL's
understanding of the "liberty" which is protected by the Consti-
tution. Judge Thomas has not clarified whether the view of
"human nature" that he believes to lie behind the Constitution is
an unchanging one, nor which one it is.

         Likewise, whose appreciation of "nature's God" informs Judge
Thomas's "natural law"? We fully support the command of Article
VI of the Constitution that "no religious test shall ever be
required as a qualification to any office or public trust under
the United States," and we codemn any suggestion that a nominee's
religious opinions, as such, could be disqualifying. But this is
because we believe that the Constitution invites a broad diversi-
ty of religious and honreligious opinions in government. When a
judicial nominee states that an understanding of "God's law"
should inform Constitutional decisionmaking, however, it becomes
incumbent on him to reveal what that understanding is. Judge
Thomas's failure to make this clear in any of his dozen speeches
and eight published articles advancing a "natural law" interpre-
tation of the Constitution suggests that he may draw on an
assertion of what is "natural" merely to justify a personal,
political or philosophical agenda.

         Judge Thomas believes that the "task of those involved in
securing the freedom of all Americans is to turn policy toward
reason rather than sentiment, toward justice rather than sensi-
tivity, toward freedom rather than dependence--in other words,
toward the spirit of the Founding.... The first principles of
equality and liberty should inspire our political and constitu-
tional thinking." 30 Howard L.J. at 699, 703. Some of these
words NACDL could wholeheartedly endorse. Yet they do not seem
to mean the same to Judge Thomas as to us: "Such a principled
jurisprudence would pose a major alternative to ... esoteric
hermeneutics rationalizing expansive powers for the government,
especially the judiciary." Id. (emphasis added). Our principal
concern, of course, is with that final twist. Who will check
prosecutors' and politicians' "rationaliz[ation of] expansive
powers for the [executive branch of the] government," to be used
against the criminally accused, if not "the judiciary" in its
interpretation and application of the Constitution, especially
the Bill of Rights? NACDL believes that a powerful and indepen-
dent judiciary, devoted to even-handed enforcement of the "first
                                     1091

principles of equality and liberty," is essential for "securing
the freedom of all Americans." We also believe that "justice" is
not an alternative to "sensitivity"; without sensitivity there
can be no justice.

         Judge Thomas, who has served on the D.C. Circuit less then a
year and a half and was not previously a judge, is the author of
only seven published opinions on appeals of criminal convictions,
all in drug cases. (He has participated in another ten or so
decisions that resulted in published opinions by other judges,
and about 20 unpublished affirmances, in some of which he wrote
unpublished memorandum opinions. He does not appear ever to have
concurred separately or dissented in a criminal case, which may
indicate a relative lack of interest in the subject.) The
opinions on their face are thoroughly researched, lucidly writ-
ten, and temperate in tone. None breaks new ground, either for
the government or for the defense. In these cases, Judge Thomas
explained the affirmance of convictions over claims involving,
for example, asserted' evidentiary insufficiency, severance,
denial of continuance, search and seizure, and definitions of
terms in the Sentencing Guidelines; in other words, the routine
issues seen in federal criminal appeals. As a Supreme Court
Justice, however, he "would face far more difficult issues, and
would have far more freedom from the strictures of established
precedent (if he were inclined to exercise such freedom) than as
a Circuit Judge.

         A handful of Judge Thomass opinions do show a gratifying
independence from prosecutorial argument. In United States v.
Long. 905 F.2d 1572 (1990), he overturned a conviction for
"using" a firearm in connection with a drug offense, where the
unloaded gun was found between the cushions of a sofa. It might
seem easy to say that this evidence was insufficient, but a jury
had convicted, and a judge had upheld that verdict and imposed
the mandatory five year sentence. The truth is that many if not
most appellate judges today would have affirmed, perhaps without
publishing an opinion; the concept of "using" a firearm has been
diluted to meaninglessness in several other circuits. Obviously
alluding to that fact, Judge Thomas wrote, "As an appellate
court, we owe tremendous deference to a jury verdict; we must
consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the govern-
ment. ... We do not, however, fulfill our duty through rote
incantation of these principles followed by summary affirmance."
905 F.2d at 1576. In the same case, Judge Thomas's opinion goes
out of its way to salvage the appellate rights of a defendant
whose lawyer filed the required notice one day late, rejecting
the prosecutor's plea to dismiss the appeal outright.

         In United States v. Rogers. 918 F.2d 207, 212 (1990), while
upholding the admission of "prior bad acts" evidence, Judge
Thomas's opinion rejects the argument that the defense attorney's
acquiescence in a cautionary instruction had waived any objection
                                     1092

to the admission of the questionable evidence. The opinion
explicitly and accurately recognizes the legitimate tactical
decisions a defense attorney must make in the midst of trial when
an objection to prejudicial evidence has been overruled. And in
United States v. Barrv fFarrakhan and Stallinas v. U.S.). 1990
WestLaw 104925 (1990), Judge Thomas participated in issuing an
unsigned order requiring a trial judge to consider the First and
Fifth Amendment rights of controversial, allegedly psychological-
ly "intimidating" supporters of a criminal defendant to attend
his trial.

         These few commendable decisions, however, are greatly
outnumbered by those of Judge Thomas's rulings which brush off
troubling appeals. Especially disturbing are the opinions which
demonstrate a cold indifference to the realities of the criminal
justice system's harsh, discriminatory impact on the poor and
uneducated. In United States v. Jordan. 920 F.2d 1039 (unpub-
slished decision, available on WestLaw), Judge Thomas joined an
unsigned opinion in which a defendant was denied a two-point
reduction under the federal sentencing guidelines, costing him an
additional 2\ years in prison, because his inability to raise the
required bail to secure his release before trial prevented him
from fulfilling an offer to cooperate with the authorities.
Viewing the case as 'if the defendant were claiming some benefit
on account of his poverty, the court invoked against him a
Sentencing Commission rule that "one's_socio-economic status 'is
not relevant in the determination of a sentence."

         Similarly, in United States v. Poston. 902 F.2d 90, 99-100
(1990), Judge Thomas's opinion passes without comment the trans-
parent, self-contradictory lies of the arresting officers about
whether promises of benefit were given to the father of a youth-
ful arrestee and instead parses like the words of a business
contract the father's testimonial recollection of what was said
to him at the stationhouse. The result is an icy justification
of the prosecutor's later refusal to give the defendant the
benefit of a good word at sentencing so as to relieve him from an
otherwise mandatory five year prison sentence for knowingly
giving a ride to a drug dealer. If the Jordan and Poston cases
illustrate what Judge Thomas means by "justice [without] sensi-
tivity," NACDL must demur.

         Conclusion. As discussed, Judge Thomas's record reveals
several points worthy of favorable comment. Nevertheless, NACOL
opposes the nomination of Judge Thomas for three basic reasons:
his lack of demonstrated commitment to equal justice and due
process, his failure to recognize the need for recusal where his
impartiality is open to question, and his adherence to a philoso-
phy of constitutional interpretation and judicial action which is
outside the mainstream of contemporary thought and leads to
unacceptable departures from the duty of the courts to enforce
fundamental rights.
                                     1093

         In addition, we are very concerned that Judge Thomas's views
on the enforcement of civil rights laws, as expressed in both
word and deed during his tenure as chair of the EEOC, bode ill
for his willingness to enforce civil liberties, including those
of the criminally accused. We hold in highest regard the exper-
tise of such sister organizations in the broader civil rights and
civil liberties community as the NAACP, the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights, the National Conference of Black Lawyers, the
Congressional Black Caucus, the Alliance for Justice, the Nation-
al Abortion Rights Action League, the Women's Legal Defense Fund,
the National Organization for Women, AFSCME, and others which
have publicly announced their opposition to this nomination. We
are concerned that his unique legal philosophy and his laissez-
faire attitude toward civil rights point to an approach to
criminal law which is very punitive, rigid and unforgiving, and
ultimately extremely dangerous to individual liberties.

         As this report notes, there are several areas in which Judge
Thomas's views are not yet entirely clear, and where we hope the
Senate Judiciary Committee will press for more definite answers
before considering confirmation. The record already available
however, requires that NACDL oppose the nomination of Judge
Clarence Thomas to become an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States.

                     Testimony of Eleanor Cutri Smeal
                   President, .The Fund for the Feminist Majority
                   Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary
         on the Nomination of Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court

        I am Eleanor Cutri Smeal, President of the Fund for the Feminist
Majority, and I come before this Committee to express strong and
unequivocal opposition to the nomination of Clarence Thomas as an
Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court. My testimony was
prepared with the assistance of Erwin Chemerinsky, distinguished
professor of constitutional law at the University of Southern California.

        The Fund for the Feminist Majority in its very name raises the
conscience of the nation that today in national public opinion polls a
majority of women identify as feminists and a majority of men identify as
supporters of the women's movement. The Fund for the Feminist Majority
specializes in programs to empower women and to achieve equality for
women in all walks of life.

        During part of the period Clarence Thomas served in the
government, first at the Office of Civil Rights and then as Chair of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), I was President of the
National Organization for Women. Over the past decade, Judge Thomas
repeatedly expressed his views in numerous law review articles, speeches,
and essays in newspapers. I carefully have reviewed his words and acts.
And as a leader of the pre-eminent women's rights organization during his
presence in government, I have done more than reviewed his words and
acts. I have witnessed the devastating impact of his philosophy in action on
the efforts to curb discrimination.
                                    1096

         There is nothing in his record, performance, or writings ~ not a
 shred of evidence -- that indicates any willingness to protect civil liberties or
 civil rights for women. Quite the contrary, his record is chilling; for the
 past decade, he has expressed the views of the farthest right fringe of the
 Republican Party.

        Although I believe that Clarence Thomas poses a threat to
constitutional rights in many areas, my testimony will focus on women's
rights. At the outset, it is important to emphasize that the rights of more
than half of the population must not be dismissed as merely the concerns of
a special interest group. I hope that every member of this Committee,
Democrat and Republican, liberal and conservative, agrees that an
individual who is hostile to women's rights under the Constitution has no
place on the United States Supreme Court. A person should not be
confirmed for the Supreme Court unless he or she evidences commitment
to certain basic constitutional values; reproductive privacy and gender
equality must be among them.

        Four years ago, this Committee rightly rejected Robert Bork for a seat
on the Supreme Court because of his views, especially on privacy and
gender discrimination. Clarence Thomas expresses almost identical
opinions and frequently has aligned himself with Bork's judicial
philosophy. In fact, Thomas' performance as Chair of the EEOC makes his
hostility to civil rights even clearer and less abstract.

       My testimony will focus on two areas of vital importance to women:
reproductive privacy and employment discrimination. Clarence Thomas'
views and performance on these issues make him unacceptable for a
position on the Supreme Court which ultimately is responsible for
protecting the civil rights of women and men.
                                  1097

        A person is unsuitable for the Supreme Court unless he or she
expresses a commitment, to basic constitutional freedoms. Reproductive
privacy is one of these guarantees. Indeed, reproductive freedoms are not
simply one right among many. No civil liberty touches more people on a
daily basis or more profoundly affects human lives than access to
contraceptives and safe, legal abortions. Virtually all people ~ at one time
or another -- will use contraceptives. Studies show that forty-six percent of
all women will have an abortion at some point in their lives. Without
constitutional protection of reproductive freedom, women will die and suffer
from unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions.

        Senators, each of you knows that the next person you confirm for the
Supreme Court will be the decisive vote on reproductive freedoms for
decades to come. Thus, a key question - perhaps the crucial question: will
Clarence Thomas follow precedents such as Griswold v. Connecticut.
Eisenstadt v. Baird. and Roe v. Wade which establish the right of each
person to choose whether to exercise fertility control?

        Clarence Thomas' writings leave no doubt as to his views. In fact, no
nominee for the Supreme Court - not even Robert Bork ~ has so
consistently expressed opposition to reproductive freedoms as Clarence
Thomas. In notes for a speech, titled "Notes on Original Intent," Clarence
Thomas wrote: "Restricting birth control devices or information, and
allowing, restricting, or (as Senator Kennedy put it) requiring abortions are
all matters for a legislature to decide; judges should refrain from 'imposing
their values' on public policy." (Undated manuscript, p. 2).

       Thomas specifically discussed Griswold v. Connecticut and Roe v.
Wade in a footnote in a law review article. (Thomas, "The Higher Law
Background of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth
                                  1098

Amendment," 12 Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy 63, 63 n. 2
(1989)). After stating the, holdings in Griswold and Roe. Thomas wrote: "I
elaborate on my misgivings about activist use of the Ninth Amendment in
[a chapter of a book published by the Cato Institute.]" In this chapter,
Thomas defended Robert Bork's view that reproductive privacy is not
worthy of constitutional protection. Thomas called Griswold an "invention"
and argued that it is inappropriate for the Supreme Court to protect rights
that are not expressly enumerated in the Constitution. (Thomas, "Civil
Rights as Principle, Versus Civil Rights as an Interest," in Assessing the
Reagan Years 398-99 (D. Boaz ed. 1988)).

        Thomas' restrictive views about reproductive freedom were also
reflected in the conclusions of a White House Working Group on the
Family, of which Thomas was a member. The report sharply criticizes Roe
v. Wade and several other Court rulings on privacy as "fatally flawed"
decisions that should be "corrected" either by constitutional amendment or
through the appointment of new judges and their confirmation to the
Court." White House Working Group on the Family, The Family
Preserving America's Future 12 (1986). The report also calls for the
overruling of such basic decisions as Eisenstadt v. Baird. which held that
every person has the right to purchase and use contraceptives; Moore v. City
of East Cleveland, which held that a city cannot use a zoning ordinance to
keep a grandmother from living with her grandchildren; and Planned
Parenthood v. Danforth. which held that a state may not condition a
married woman's abortion on permission from her husband.

       There is nothing - not a paragraph, not a sentence, not a word - in
Thomas' writings that indicates a willingness to protect reproductive
freedoms and women's lives. To the contrary, Thomas mav well be the first
                                   1099

Justjjce jn American hifitorv even willing to prohibit states from allowing
abortions. As you know, (Clarence Thomas gave a speech in which he
praised an article written by Lewis Lehman as "a splendid example of
natural law reasoning." Thomas, "Why Black Conservatives Should Look
to Conservative Policies," Speech to the Heritage Foundation, June 18, 1987.

        The central thesis of Lehrman's essay is that fetuses are human
lives entitled to protection, from the moment of conception, by the
Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. (Lehrman, "The
Declaration of Independence and the Right to Life," American Spectator 21
(April 1987)). Lehrman called Roe a "spurious right born exclusively of
judicial supremacy" and "a coup against the Constitution." Lehrman
maintained that human life under the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution starts "at the very beginning of the child-to-be."

        It is imperative to realize that Lehrman's views, endorsed by Thomas
as "splendid," would justify more than overruling Roe v. Wade. Lehrman's
argument is that the Constitution should protect fetuses from the moment
of conception. From this perspective, abortion would be constitutionally
prohibited. States would not even have the authority that existed before 1973
to allow abortion in their jurisdiction.

       Simply stated, it is difficult to imagine a nominee with a more
documented record of hostility to a basic civil liberty than Clarence Thomas'
opposition to reproductive freedom. If a nominee for the Supreme Court
expressed an unwillingness to protect freedom of speech, would not each
and every one of you vote against confirmation? If a nominee expressed an
unwillingness to safeguard free exercise of religion, would not each and
every one of you vote against confirmation? Right now you are considering
a nominee who has expressed an unwillingness to protect privacy. Surely,
                                   1100

 if the word "liberty" in the Constitution means anything it must include
 privacy and the right of each person to choose whether to have a child.

        This is not just about a legal abstraction. It is about women's lives.
The confirmation of Clarence Thomas almost surely would create a
majority on the Court to overrule Roe and condemn thousands of women to
death and suffering. Because he has expressed unqualified hostility to a
basic constitutional freedom, Clarence Thomas should be denied
confirmation to the Supreme Court.

        Independently, Clarence Thomas' views and record on the crucial
issue of employment discrimination make him unsuitable for a seat on the
high Court. Women in this society continue to face serious discriminatory
treatment in the workplace. If a man and a woman hold the same job, the
woman earns, on the average, 68 cents of each dollar paid to a man.
Countless jobs remain closed to women. In many businesses and
industries, discrimination against women remains the norm not the
exception.

        Clarence Thomas was Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the laws
protecting women from discrimination in the workplace. I ask you, when
in Thomas' almost eight years at the agency, did he use his position to
condemn discrimination against women and to fight in any meaningful
way for gender equality in the workplace? As you read through Thomas'
numerous speeches and articles, it is telling that he virtually never even
mentions the civil rights of women.

       The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had a dismal
record under Clarence Thomas' leadership in fighting discrimination. A
study by the Women Employed Institute found that under Thomas'
                                1101

leadership, 54 percent of all cases were found to lack cause, compared with
28.5 percent under the Carter EEOC in fiscal year 1980. The study also
found that less than 14 percent of all new EEOC cases resulted in some type
of settlement under Thomas, compared to settlements in 32 percent of the
cases at the beginning of the Reagan administration. And these statistics
do not even reflect the fact that Thomas' EEOC allowed 13,000 age
discrimination claims, many by women, to lapse.

        Thomas repeatedly has expressed hostility to the use of statistical
evidence to prove employment discrimination. In Griggrs v. Duke Power
Company, in 1971, the Supreme Court held that evidence of disparate
impact against women or racial minorities establishes a prima facie case of
discrimination. Because it is so difficult to prove that an employer acted
with a discriminatory intent, statistical proof is the basic and essential way
of establishing a violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

        But Clarence Thomas has strongly criticized allowing statistical
evidence to prove discrimination. He stated that "we have, unfortunately,
permitted sociological and demographic realities to be manipulated to the
point of surreality by convenient legal theories such as 'adverse impact' and
'prima facie cases.'" Thomas, "The Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission: Reflections on a New Philosophy," 15 Stetson Law Review 31,
35-6 (1985). Thomas, thus, would go even further than the current Supreme
Court in preventing the use of statistical evidence to prove discrimination.
The effect of Thomas' position would be effectively to drastically lessen Title
VII's ban on employment discrimination.

        In fact, as Chair of the EEOC, Thomas proposed to eliminate the use
of statistical evidence to prove discrimination by the federal government.
The Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures were adopted in
                                   1102

 1978 by the EEOC, the Department of Justice, the Labor Department and the
Civil Service Commission. The Uniform Guidelines follow Griggs and
allow statistical proof of employment discrimination. Thomas as Chair of
the EEOC sought to revise these guidelines to eliminate such statistical
evidence. If Thomas' position prevails on the Supreme Court, the fight
against gender discrimination in employment would be immeasurably
damaged.

        Likewise, Thomas repeatedly has opposed the use of hiring
timetables and goals which are an essential to gender equality in the
workplace. The Supreme Court, in cases such as United Steel Workers v.
Weber and Local 28 of the Sheet Metal Workers' International Association
v. EEOC. approved hiring timetables and goals to remedy workplace
inequality. But Thomas has strongly criticized these decisions. Thomas,
"Civil Rights as a Principle Versus Civil Rights as an Interest," at 395-96.
In fact, in Fall 1985, the acting general counsel of the EEOC, under Thomas'
leadership, ordered regional counsel not to enforce goals or timetables in
consent decrees, nor to seek them in the future.

        Countless other examples exist of the failure of Thomas' EEOC to
enforce Title VII and other laws protecting women from discrimination. It
must be emphasized that Thomas was not simply an employee in the
agency; he was the Chair. He was not simply following preset policies; he
was the architect of the Reagan Administration's effort to lessen civil rights
protections. As Chair, he was charged with working to end discrimination
against women. But he did nothing constructive in this regard.

       At the very least, his poor performance at the EEOC should disqualify
him for a "promotion" to the Supreme Court. Moreover, his documented
                                   1103

record of hostility to protecting the dvil rights of women and minorities
make him a grave threat to equal justice if he is confirmed.

        Senators, I ask you to look past all of the rhetoric on both sides and
focus on simple questions. Is there any place in Clarence Thomas' record
where he has ever supported constitutional protection of reproductive
freedoms? Is there anything in Clarence Thomas' record as Chair of EEOC
to indicate that he would be a force for advandng dvil rights and women's
rights on the Supreme Court? Can you point to any evidence -- any speech,
any article, any judirial opinion -- where Clarence Thomas has expressed a
meaningful commitment to reproductive privacy or dvil rights for women?

       The rights of millions of women rest on this nomination. I urge you
to vote against Clarence Thomas' confirmation.

September 17, 1991

Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify here today
in support of President Bush's nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the U. S. Supreme
Court.

I am Thomas J. Charron, elected district attorney of the Cobb Judicial Circuit which includes
Marietta, Georgia. I am also the President of the National District Attorneys Association.

Judge Clarence Thomas has participated in more than 150 cases since joining the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals and is the author of 17 majority opinions; he has authored 2 dissents and 2
concurrences. Seven of the 17 majority opinions related to drug convictions. Judge Thomas'
criminal law opinions reflect scholarship, an appropriate adherence to the rule of law, and
judicial restraint.

But these hearings have not focused on Judge Thomas' criminal law rulings or even his
extrajudicial statements relative to the criminal law. Other issues are paramount. Political
issues, religious issues, ethical issues, and moral issues. In the context of Judge Thomas'
confirmation hearing, "safe streets" is not foremost in the minds of members of this
Committee nor, frankly, foremost in the minds of the public at large. But, I offer a word on
the subject, nevertheless:
                                        1106

As a D.C. Circuit judge, Clarence Thomas has demonstrated a great concern for the safety of
an innocent public. He has closely followed the federal rules of evidence and criminal
procedure as enacted by the Congress of the United States. He has given great deference to
the fact-finding process of the lower court, leaving to the jury its proper role in assessing the
sufficiency of the evidence. He has avoided basing conclusions on personal moral preferences
rather than legal reasoning. He abhors the applicaton of judicial flat to achieve ends that are
political and properly left to legislative bodies. We can ask no more than this. If he has
conducted himself in this fashion as a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals I think we
can assume that he will continue to do so as a member of the Supreme Court.

The Committee has delved quite extensively into Judge Thomas' "natural law" philosophy.
He has stated that his foray into this murky and esoteric area was for the primary purpose of
showing the fundamental injustice of discrimination, an attempt to plumb "the philosopy of
the founders of our country and the drafters of our Constitution." Judge Thomas is an
honorable man and I am satisfied with his repeated assurances that "natural law" should not
be used in constitutional adjudication; that his use of that concept calls for judicial restraint
and does not pennit a judge to insert his own notion of right and wrong into a case or on that
basis strike down legislation passed by Congress. This is important to all of us since Judge
Thomas' pre-emminent task as a Supreme Court justice will be constitutional and statutory
interpretation.

Relative to the interpretation of statutes passed by Congress, we can, I believe, gain some
insight by looking to Judge Thomas' ruling in Otis Elevator v. Sectertary nf T ahnr in which he
                                        1107

looked closely at the legislative history of the act and declared his belief in the principle that
"a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions." Although this is
only one case, the position taken in that case certainly indicates that he would give great
weight to Congressional intent.

We believe that Judge Thomas, as a member of the Supreme Court, will be a staunch
protecter of individual rights guaranteed by our Constitution, faithfully protecting the progress
so hard won by minorities.

Judge Thomas is an unpretentious and intellectually honest man who has chosen a
philosophical path which requires independence, courage, and commitment to advancing the
fundamental and constitutional rights of all Americans. He will make a great
Supreme Court Justice and we urge this Committee and the Senate to confinn his nomination
to the Court with as little delay as possible.

         I am Anne Bryant, executive director of the American
Association of University Women (AAUW). It is a privilege to
testify on behalf of AAUW's 135,000 members: women and men who
are committed to equity and education for women and girls.

        On behalf of our membership, I urge the Judiciary Committee
to reject Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States Supreme
Court. In his testimony before this Committee, Judge Thomas has
suggested that statements he made and views he expressed prior to
1990 are not necessarily positions he would hold as a Supreme
Court Justice. AAUW believes that the Senate has a responsibility
to consider the public record of a Supreme Court nominee in
assessing a nomination. We believe that Judge Thomas' record as
chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and his
tenure as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the Education
Department raise grave concerns about his commitment to equal
opportunity and provide examples of his failure to enforce federal
law.

        AAUW opposes Clarence Thomas' nomination for five reasons.
         First, we believe that in his positions at the EEOC and the
Department of Education, Judge Thomas showed a blatant disregard
for the law of the land. As Chair of the EEOC, he allowed more
than 13,000 age discrimination complaints to lapse by failing to
investigate them within the legal time limit. Congress had to
pass the Age Discrimination Claims Assistance Act to assist those
                                        1110

                                                 -3-

individuals whose complaints of age discrimination had been
ignored by the EEOC.

         Although Judge Thomas served in the Education Department's
Office of Civil Rights for less than a year, a similar pattern of
failure to enforce the law was present there. In 1981, the
Women's Equity Action League filed suit against the Department
charging improper enforcement of Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972. In 1982, a District Court judge ruled that
the Department was both misinterpreting the Title IX regulations
and providing inadequate remedies when a Title IX violation was
determined.

         This pattern of failure to enforce the law casts grave doubts
on Judge Thomas' judicial temperament. We are particularly
disturbed that he has been unwilling to enforce key federal laws
intended to guarantee individual rights in employment and
education.

         Second, AAUW opposes Judge Thomas' nomination because of his
record of vocal opposition to efforts to ensure equal opportunity
in the workplace. While heading the EEOC, he undermined the
effectiveness and credibility of the agency by publicly expressing
his personal opposition to affirmative action programs, even those
ordered as remedies following a finding of discrimination.

        Judge Thomas was also vocal about his opposition to Title VII
class action suits, despite Congress' mandate that his agency
                                    1111

                                                -4-

initiate such cases. His negative comments about a class action
suit filed by the EEOC against Sears led attorneys to explore
calling him as a defense witness. By calling into question the
validity of lawsuits involving claims of disparate impact, Judge
Thomas contravened both the intent of Congress in passing Title
VII and the Supreme Court's ruling in the 1971 Griqqs case.

         In 1985, the EEOC ruled that federal law does not require
equal pay for jobs of comparable value, and the agency stopped
investigating complaints involving pay equity claims. This ruling
contradicted the Supreme Court's 1981 decision in the Gunther
case. Again, Judge Thomas directed EEOC activities based on his
own beliefs, rather than abiding by relevant federal law.

         Third, AAUW is distressed by Judge Thomas' apparent hostility
to the constitutional right to privacy as outlined in Griswold v.
Connecticut. In an article published by the Cato Institute in
Assessing the Reagan Years, Judge Thomas stated that the
unenumerated rights specified in the Ninth Amendment were not
intended to be cited by the Supreme Court in overturning laws.

         By stating his opposition to the constitutional basis of the
fundamental right to privacy, Judge Thomas has given evidence of
his willingness to restrict individual liberties, including the
right to reproductive choice.

         Fourth, Judge Thomas' support of a "natural law" concept is
deeply disturbing to AAUW. In speeches and articles, Thomas has

       56-271 O - 9 3 3
                                       1112

                                                 -5-

maintained that judges should be guided by a "natural law"
philosophy, the belief that the "inalienable rights" cited in the
Declaration of Independence are a higher authority than the U.S.
Constitution.

         Thomas has said he believes in the existence of moral norms
derived from "nature's god," and that those norms can be used to
critiqtie and even invalidate civil law. Thomas' statements about
"natural law" raise serious doubts about his commitment to
maintain separation of church and state.

         Finally, AAUW believes that the Judiciary Committee should
not confirm Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court
because of the critical need for judicial balance on the most
important court in our nation. The recent appointments of Anthony
Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, and David Souter solidified a strong
conservative shift in the Supreme Court. With the resignation of
Justice Thurgood Marshall, the Court swung dangerously out of
balance.

         Confirmation of Clarence Thomas, a probable sixth
conservative vote on the Court, threatens to unleash the sweeping
change we have glimpsed in the Rehnquist Court. Replacing Justice
Marshall with a judicial conservative like Clarence Thomas will
effectively eliminate the Supreme Court as an instrument for
ensuring continued progress and protection of individual rights
for decades to come.

                                                       -6-

        The American Association of University Women believes that
the Senate has a responsibility to ensure an ideologically
balanced Supreme Court and must, therefore, defeat the Thomas
nomination.

        On behalf of AAUW, I thank you for the opportunity to
testify.

                             MOLLY YARD

President, National Organization for Women,
           Before the Judiciary Committee
              of the United States Senate
                           regarding the
           Confirmation of Clarence Thomas
                      September 20, 1991
                            1115

                 My name is Molly Yard. I am the president of
the National Organization for Women. I am pleased to be
here today to testify regarding the nomination of Clar-
ence Thomas to the United States Supreme Court.

                   You may be aware that I am recovering from a
stroke that I suffered several months ago. I am still
working on physical and speech therapy. Despite that, I
was absolutely determined to present this testimony. I
felt that I must make yet one more appeal to you to stand
up for the rights of women and other oppressed groups.

                 NOW is adamantly opposed to the nomination of
Clarence Thomas. Mr. Thomas has demonstrated none of the
qualities necessary for a member of this nation's highest
court. While a Supreme Court Justice must be compassion-
ate, Mr. Thomas has shown scorn for the oppressed. While
a Justice must have respect for the law, Mr. Thomas has
demonstrated a willingness to promote his conservative
personal agenda in defiance of the law of the land.
While a Justice should be forthright, Mr. Thomas has been
evasive. Clarence Thomas has simply not shown himself to
be worthy of a seat on the Supreme Court.

                 Mr. Thomas seems to be doing his best to imi-
tate the Teflon candidacy of David Souter. Perhaps he
feels that a blank slate is an unimpeachable one. Yet
                                 1116

how can the good of this country possibly be served by a
man who has spent weeks backing away from his own record?

                 Perhaps the most blatant example of Mr. Thomas'
attempt to rewrite history is his claim that we should
not take seriously his public praise for Louis Lehman's
antiabortion polemic. Mr. Thomas now would have us be-
lieve that he did not agree with the piece but was only
citing to it to gain the support of his conservative
audience. Frankly, I don't believe that story and nei-
ther should you. But even if I did, Mr. Thomas' defense
-- that he says things that he doesn't believe in order
to win an audience -- does not inspire confidence in the
statements he has made before this committee and certain-
ly does not make me secure that he will be a strong and
zealous guardian of our constitutional rights. Similar-
ly, even if we were to accept Mr. Thomas' astonishing
claim that he has never given much thought to Roe v.
Wade, this lack of interest in one of the crucial civil
rights issues of the last 20 years would show Mr. Thomas
to be so disengaged from modern legal and social debate
as to disqualify him from sitting on the Supreme Court.

                 In fact, Clarence Thomas is not the enigma he
would like to be. Both his words and his actions show
him to be cold and callous. Mr. Thomas compiled a record
                                 1117

of neglect at the EEOC, particularly with regard to wom-
en's rights. This man insulted women who have suffered
discrimination in employment by calling their legitimate
complaints "cliches." He said that women avoid profes-
sions like the practice of medicine because it interferes
with our roles as wives and mothers. This type of medi-
eval claptrap would doom any politician running for elec-
toral office. How, then, can it be considered acceptable
for a Supreme Court nominee?

                 It is always easy to cut through people's pre-
tensions by looking at how they treat their families.
Many saints have been unmasked as sinners in the privacy
of their homes. Clarence Thomas used his own sister,
Emma Mae Martin, as an example to denigrate people on
welfare. Yet Mr. Thomas' sister overcame a life of pov-
erty to graduate high school and enter the workforce.
After she was deserted by her husband, she supported her
young children by working at two minimum wage jobs. She
was indeed on welfare during a period when she was forced
to leave her jobs to take care of her (and Mr. Thomas')
aunt, who had had a stroke. She now works as a cook on a
shift that starts at 3 o'clock in the morning. As is too
often the case, it appears that in Mr. Thomas' family the
male child was given the opportunity to get a college
                              1118

education and a professional career, while the girl ac-
cepted the responsibility of caring for the family. To
me, Emma Mae Martin sounds like a brave, strong woman,
committed to her family and fighting to do the best she
can. Yet Clarence Thomas sees her as dishonorable.

                 Mr. Thomas' cruel remarks would be bad enough
when said of a total stranger. That he would use his own
sister as the butt of such an insult is shocking. Mr.
Thomas has been nominated for a position that requires,
above all, sensitivity and concern about all those who
come before the courts seeking justice. Rather than
demonstrating those qualities, he has instead shown him-
self to be cynical and cold.

                 This nomination is particularly poignant for me
because of the man that Clarence Thomas has been nominat-
ed to replace. Had Thurgood Marshall never spent one day
on the bench, his brilliant career as an activist civil
rights lawyer would have guaranteed him a place in histo-
ry and in the hearts of all people who believe in equali-
ty and justice. Yet Thurgood Marshall went on to champi-
on the rights of the oppressed from the Supreme Court,
tirelessly fighting to uphold the very principles that
Clarence Thomas sees as outmoded or unnecessary. While
nothing can extinguish the light that Thurgood Marshall
                                 1119

lit, it would be sad to replace him with a man who is
committed to dousing the torch that Justice Marshall
carried so proudly.

                 It has become increasingly difficult to come
here on each succeeding Supreme Court nomination and beg
for women's lives, only to have our pleas ignored. We
urged you, in the strongest terms, to understand that the
confirmation of Justices Kennedy and Scalia would lead
inevitably to the erosion of women's right to safe, legal
abortion. Those predictions proved true two years ago as
the court severely undercut Roe v. Wade in the Webster
case, and went on a year later in the Akron and Hodgson
decisions to take away the rights of young women to con-
trol their bodies. We warned that David Souter, silent
though he was on many significant issues, would be yet
another conservative, anti-abortion vote. As we feared,
Justice Souter was an instrumental part of the majority
last term, when the Court took the incredible step of
holding that women had no right to be informed by their
physicians and other medical personnel of even the fact
that abortion exists.

                 Senators, many of you and your colleagues in
the House have spent time in recent sessions trying to
restore the civil rights that the Court has undercut,
                            1120

fighting to reverse the gag rule that the Court has up-
held, and working to guarantee the right to abortion that
the Court has imperiled. Yet had you held fast against
the unsuitable nominees put before you by the Reagan-Bush
administration, these efforts would not have been neces-
sary. Your constitutional role is not to be a rubber
stamp for the President. Instead, you must look into
your hearts and judge what is best for this country be-
fore you advise and consent on nominations.- It is not
just your prerogative but your duty to protect the funda-
mental constitutional rights of all of the people. How
can you in good conscience consent to an increasingly
unbalanced court that represents one judicial philosophy,
a philosophy that ignores the needs of the majority of
this country?

                 The conservative tide has swept over the Su-
preme Court. With each Reagan-Bush nominee that the
Senate confirms, you entrench still more firmly a Supreme
Court that is at best indifferent and at worst hostile to
the rights of women, people of color, lesbians and gays,
the handicapped, the elderly, the poor -- all those who
most need protection from the nation's highest court.
You still have some ability to stem that tide, to give
the dispossessed and disenfranchised a faint glimmer of
                                 1121

hope that someone cares about them, that the entire gov-
ernment of the United States is not a cynical enterprise
run by the privileged for the privileged. I urge you,
once again, to stand up for equality, for justice, and
for compassion. Vote against the confirmation of Clar-
ence Thomas.

 STATEMENTS OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF ED HAYES, COUNCIL
   OF 100; AND DAVID ZWIEBEL, AGUDATH ISRAEL OF AMERICA

   Mr. HAYES. Good evening, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Good evening.
   Mr. HAYES. Members of the committee.
   My name is Edward Hayes, Jr. I am an attorney in private prac-
tice at Baker & Hostetler in Washington, DC, and I appear before
this evening on behalf of the Council of 100, a national organiza-
tion of black Republicans.
   The primary goal of the council is to stimulate and foster partici-
pation by black Americans in the U.S. political process. The council
has appeared before the Congress on prior occasions to support can-
didates and to share its views on important pending legislation.
   We are delighted to appear today to support the candidacy of
Judge Clarence Thomas as a Justice on the Supreme Court. Indeed,
when Justice Marshall announced his resignation from the Court,
the council wrote to President Bush recommending the consider-
ation of Judge Thomas. We made this recommendation because we
know Judge Thomas as an individual, and because we have ad-
mired his selfless contributions to our country as a government of-
ficial in several significant capacities.
  Having learned even more about him through the strenuous con-
firmation process, we continue to believe that he should be con-
firmed for the Supreme Court.
  Because my time before you is brief and the hour is late, I would
like to focus on only a few key reasons for our support of Judge
Thomas.
  The first reason in the wealth of experience that Judge Thomas
has already achieved. Having worked for Senator Danforth, having
served in senior positions in the administration, and serving now
as a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals, he has had exposure to
all branches of government. In addition, having worked as an attor-
ney for Monsanto Corp., he could be the only Justice to have
worked in the corporation counsel office of a major company.
  This opportunity to observe the operation of both government
and business, and to address public concerns, gives Judge Thomas a
perspective that few Supreme Court jurists, past or present, could
match.
  Clearly, the Supreme Court is not like any other institution, and
therefore more scrutiny is required, Yet, it must be remembered
that you do not have a blank slate before you. The positions for
which the Senate has already appointed him have provided Judge
Thomas the broad experience that qualifies him today. The Senate
has, on other occasions, passed on his character after examination.
The strength of his character is no less today. And in the end,
when we judge nominees, the nature of one's character should be
the bottom-line criterion.
  A second reason for the council's support is that Judge Thomas
has the honed ability and the independence of mind, desirable of a
jurist. As has been demonstrated in this hearing, Judge Thomas'
independence of mind has not come without a great deal of person-
                                         1123

al cost to him and to his family. By daring to challenge convention-
al thinking, he has been ostracized by certain of his peers, and per-
sonally attacked by spokespersons in the black community.

  Those who think that his questioning approach to examining
policies that have become sacred cows is a matter of convenience,
in order to endear himself to the Republican Party, would do well
to consider the testimony offered on September 16, by Sister Mary
Reidy, who taught Judge Thomas when he was in the eighth grade.
According to Sister Mary, even at a young age, Clarence Thomas
did not uncritically accept orthodoxy.

  It should be clear to all by now, that Clarence Thomas is first
and foremost an independent thinker. This is what we should re-
quired of our jurists. They must all be bright, sensitive, fair, and
grounded in the Constitution as the law of the land, but they must
also be able to analyze, independently, the law before them, and to
apply it with an open mind, without being beholden to a particular
philosophy, ideology, or patron.

  Finally, we applaud the nomination of Clarence Thomas because
it has brought to the fore the diversity of views that are so often
overlooked within the black community. Certainly, Judge Thomas
has been controversial, and rightly so. Anyone who dares to march
to a different drummer will be controversial and arouse passion.
However, it must not be ignored that despite the visibility of cer-
tain persons within the black community that oppose Judge
Thomas, there is also a great deal of quiet support for him, as indi-
cated by recent polls.

  In conclusion, the Council of 100 believes that if the finest steel
is tempered in the hottest fires, then Clarence Thomas is a man of
fine steel indeed. He has an open legal mind, he is fair and caring,
and he has a commitment to public service. Moreover, he has the
moral character, the breadth of experience, and a due regard for
cautious construction of constitutional issues needed for a Justice.

  Thank you for permitting me, on behalf of the Council of 100, to
address the committee in support of the nomination of Clarence
Thomas.

                                                                                   September 19, 1991

Testimony of Edward Hayes, Jr., Esquire, on behalf of the Council
of 100, an Organization of Black Republicans, before the Senate
Judiciary Committee upon the Nomination of Clarence Thomas to the
Supreme Court.

         Good Morning, Mr. Chairman, and members of the Senate
Judiciary Committee. My name is Edward Hayes, Jr. I am an
attorney in private practice at Baker & Hostetler in Washington,
D.C., and I appear before you this morning on behalf of the Council
of 100, a national organization of black Republicans. The primary
goal of the Council is to stimulate the participation by black
Americans in the U.S. political process through candidacies for
elected positions, through involvement at the local level, and
through airing views on key issues.

        The Council has appeared before the Congress on prior
occasions to support candidates and to share its views on important
pending legislation. We are delighted to appear today to support
the candidacy of Judge Clarence Thomas as a Justice on the Supreme
Court. Indeed, when Justice Marshall first announced his
resignation from the Court, the Council wrote to President Bush
recommending the consideration of Judge Thomas. We made this
recommendation because we know Judge Thomas as an individual and
because we have admired his selfless contributions to our country
as a government official in several significant capacities. Having
learned even more about him through the strenuous confirmation
                                    1125

process, we continue to believe that he should be confirmed for the
Supreme Court.

        Because my time before you is brief, I would like to focus on
only a few key reasons for our support of Judge Thomas.

        The first reason is the wealth of experience that Judge Thomas
has already achieved. Having worked for Senator Danforth, having
served in senior positions in the Administration, and serving now
as a member of the U.S.. Court of Appeals, he has had exposure to
all branches of government. In addition, having worked as an
attorney for Monsanto Corporation, he could be the only justice to
have worked in the corporation counsel office of a major company.
This opportunity to observe the operation of both government and
business, and to address public concerns at different levels, gives
Judge Thomas a perspective that few Supreme Court Jurists past or
present could match.

         Indeed, this Senate has already confirmed Judge Thomas on four
separate occasions: as Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the
Department of Education in 1981, twice as Chairman of the EEOC in
1982 and 1986, and most recently as U.S. Court of Appeals Judge for
the District of Columbia in 1990.

         Clearly the Supreme Court is not like any other institution
and therefore more scrutiny is required. Yet it must be remembered
that you do not have a blank slate before you. The positions for
which the Senate has already appointed him have provided Judge
Thomas the broad experience that qualifies him today. The Senate
has on other occasions passed on his character after examination.
The strength of his character is no less today, and in the end,
when we judge nominees, the nature of one's character should be the
bottom line criterium.

        A second reason for the Council's support is that Judge Thomas
has the honed ability and the independence of mind desirable of a
jurist. As has been demonstrated in this hearing, Judge Thomas'
independence of mind has not come without a great deal of personal
cost to him and to his family. By daring to challenge conventional
thinking, he has been ostracized by certain of his peers and
personally attacked by spokespersons in the black community. Those
who think that his questioning approach to examining policies that
have become "sacred cows" is a matter of convenience, in order to
endear himself to the Republican Party, would do well to consider
the testimony offered on September 16th by Sister Mary Virgilius
Reidy who taught Judge Thomas when he was in the eighth grade.
According to Sister Mary, even at a young age Clarence Thomas did
not uncritically accept orthodoxy. It should be clear to all by
now that Clarence Thomas is first and foremost an independent
thinker. This is what we should require of our jurists. They must

all be bright, sensitive, fair, and grounded in the Constitution
as the law of the land. But they must also be able to analyze
independently the law before them and to apply it with an open mind
without being beholden to a particular philosophy, ideology, or
patron.

         Finally, we applaud the nomination of Clarence Thomas because
it has brought to the fore the diversity of views that are so often

a different drummer will be controversial and arouse passion.
However, it must not be ignored that despite the visibility of
certain spokespersons within the black community that oppose Judge
Thomas, there is also a great deal of quiet support for him.
Indeed, recent polls by both ABC and Jet magazine indicate that
60% of black Americans support the nomination of Judge Thomas. In
this regard, the leaders may have fallen behind the people.

         In conclusion, the Council of 100 believes that if the finest
steel is tempered in the hottest fires, then Clarence Thomas is a
man of fine steel indeed. He has an open legal mind, he is fair
and caring, and he has a commitment to public service. Moreover,
he has the moral character, the breadth of experience, and a due
regard for cautious construction of constitutional issues needed

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Hayes--particularly for your

  Mr. Zwiebel.

                     STATEMENT OF DAVID ZWIEBEL

  Mr. ZWIEBEL. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the panel, I am
David Zwiebel, and I am the general counsel and director of gov-
ernment affairs for Agudath Israel of America. Agudath Israel is
the national's largest grassroots Orthodox Jewish movement, and I
am here to convey our organization's support for the nomination of
Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.
  We support Judge Thomas for a number of reasons. We believe
that his record and his background demonstrate integrity, intelli-
gence, and independence. But, in light of the lateness of the hour, I
think I would like to focus in on one very specific issue--an issue
that has not gathered all that much attention during these hear-
ings.
  It is an issue of extraordinary importance to our own constituen-
cy and, we believe, of extraordinary importance to freedom-loving
Americans throughout this country.
  The issue, specifically, is the accommodation of the religious
rights of minority religionists in the work force--a specific issue
that Judge Thomas compiled a very distinguished record on during
his years as Chairman of the EEOC.
  In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a case called Estate of
Thornton v. Caldor, in which a Connecticut statute, which was de-
fended by, at that time, the attorney general of the State of Con-
necticut, a man by the name of Joseph Lieberman, was held uncon-
stitutional in the U.S. Supreme Court.
  The statute required employers to accommodate the sabbath ob-
servance requirements of their employees. Said the U.S. Supreme
Court, this violated the establishment clause of the first amend-
ment--there shall be no law establishing religion.
  Because this particular accommodation requirement was abso-
lute--it allowed for no exceptions whatsoever--the U.S. Supreme
Court said that constituted an endorsement of religion in violation
of the first amendment.
  Well, after the Supreme Court issued that ruling, our phones and
phones of many Jewish organizations around this country started
ringing off the hook. Employees were calling us, telling us that
their employers were telling them that they could no longer leave
early on Friday afternoons, when sundown was early, in order to
observe their sabbath, or that they could no longer take off for cer-
tain religious holidays.
  And we said that that was an incorrect interpretation of this
ruling. The Connecticut statute was sui generis, it stood on its own,
it was different than other statutes. But, nonetheless, there was
this very serious problem, based on a misperception of the U.S. Su-
preme Court ruling.
  Among other things, at that time, we contacted the EEOC. And,
at that time, Chairman Thomas took a very, very specific and great
interest in this issue, and shortly thereafter issued a policy memo-
                                      1130
randum clarifying that what the Supreme Court held in the Caldor
case applied specifically and only to the statute in Connecticut, be-
cause the statute brooked for no exceptions whatsoever. It was ab-
solute.

  Title VII, on the other hand, which mandates reasonable accom-
modation, and allows an employer to make a case of undue hard-
ship, said Judge Thomas--at that time, Chairman Thomas--was in
full force and effect. And that requirement of reasonable accommo-
dation was the law of the land.

  Armed with that memorandum, we were able to stop the prob-
lem that many of the employees were facing at that time.

  An almost identical scenario played out 1 year later, when the
U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling in a case called Goldman v.
Weinberger. Goldman was Capt. Simcha Goldman in the U.S. Air
Force, an Orthodox Jew, who would always wear a yarmulke, or
head covering, as a matter of religious faith. There was an Air
Force regulation which said no head coverings may be worn while
indoors.

  Captain Goldman said, well the first amendment free exercise
clause protects my right to wear this head covering. Said the U.S.
Supreme Court, by a vote of 5 to 4, no it does not. The military is a
very special setting, and the requirements of discipline and uni-
formity in the military would override Captain Goldman's first
amendment free exercise rights.

  Well, again the phones started ringing off the hook, and employ-
ees who wore yarmulkes on the job were calling us and telling us
that their rights were being threatened because the employers
were telling them the Supreme Court had held that yarmulkes
were no longer permitted, or at least they could insist that there be
no longer any wearing of yarmulkes on the job.

  Again, Chairman Thomas was contacted, and issued a policy
memorandum stating clearly that Goldman v. Weinberger, the Su-
preme Court decision, related specifically to the context of the mili-
tary, and had no application to the context of private employment,
where title VII's protections applied with full force and effect.

  What do these policy memos and actions of Chairman Thomas,
now Judge Thomas--hopefully, soon to be Justice Thomas--what
do they tell us about the man? I think two things, one very specific
and one more general.

  The specific point is that, with respect to the question of respect-
ing religious freedom and the rights of religious minorities, I think
that we can assume that Judge Thomas is sensitive to those con-
cerns, and will, in fact, be a champion of religious freedom.

  This is no small issue, particularly in light of the Supreme
Court's holding a year ago, in a case called Employment Division v.
Smith--Senator Biden, I know you have introduced a bill in the
Senate that would overturn the effect of that decision. But, a 5-to-4
ruling of the Supreme Court which held that the first amendment's
free protection rights simply do not cover statutes that have only
an incidental impact on the practice of religion, which curtailed
the free exercise of religion enormously.

  And this is a very, very serious issue as we enter the 1990's and
beyond, and having a voice like Judge Thomas' on the Supreme
                                 1131

Court, we are hopeful, will, in fact, restore to some extent, the
rightful place of the first amendment's free exercise protections.
The CHAIRMAN. I asked him that question, and he refused to tell
me whether he agreed with O'Connor or Scalia, when everybody
else we have asked that question to had no trouble answering the
question.
I just thought you might want to know that.
Mr. ZWIEBEL. I understand that, and I am aware of that, but,
again, what I would suggest is that this particular aspect of his
record suggests to us, despite his consistent performance at these
hearings of not answering all of those questions quite as openly as
we had hoped he might--it suggests to us at least that the man is
sensitive to religious liberty issues and the rights of religious mi-
norities.
And when you look for clues in a record of that sort, when he
has not issued any judicial rulings on the subject, where he has not
answered the specific question put to him during the hearings, and
you look for clues in the record, I think this is very telling.
And the second, more general, point that I draw from this par-
ticular episode, or series of episodes, is that he is not an ivory
tower jurist. He is not somebody who does not understand the
impact--the broad impact--that Supreme Court rulings can have
on Americans all across the country, in the everyday lives of Amer-
icans, even in contexts in which the Court has never issued the
ruling, such as in the Goldman case, and indeed, also "with respect
to the Caldorcase.                                ^ x
And I think that that is a quality that is of extraordinary impor-
tance in a jurist, and particularly a jurist who is sitting on the
highest court of the land.
Let me just conclude by stating that our review of the record per-
suades us at Agudath Israel of America that Judge Thomas is
highly qualified to sit on the highest court of this land, and we be-
lieve he deserves confirmation.
Thank you.

           having overcome his own circumstances of abject poverty through an unwavering
           commitment to hard work and peraonal excellence.

the best means of improving the plight of impoverished minorities in this
country. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Judge Thomas' vievs on such
controversial issues as quotas, race-normlng and equal opportunity -- for the
record, Agudath Israel happens to agree with those views -- it is impossible
not to admire his courageous willingness to speak the truth as he sees it.
That attribute of independence, perhaps more than any other, persuades Agudath
Israel that Judge Thomas will ser- with distinction on the Supreme Court.

        Yet another noteworthy attribute Agudath Israel believes Judge Thomas
possesses is a clear yet compassionate understanding of how Supreme Court
rulings, issued from the proverbial ivory towers of the Justices' chambers,
affect real people in their daily lives across the length and breadth of this
great nation. To illustrate this point, I would like to share with you a
striking aspect of Judge Thomas' record as EEOC chairman, one which to the
best of my knowledge has not received attention during these hearings. I
refer specifically to an issue in which Agudath Israel and its constituents
have a great stake: the legal obligation to accommodate the rights of
religious minorities in the workplace.

        In March 1986, by a vote of 5-4, the Supreme Court ruled that the First
Amendment'8 guarantee of the free exercise of religion did not protect Air
Force Captain S. Simcha Goldman's right to wear a yarmulke (an unobtrusive
head covering worn by observant Jews) in the face of an Air Force regulation
that proscribed the wearing of headgear indoors. Goldman v. Weinberger, 475
U.S. 503 (1986). In the weeks thereafter, and no doubt as a direct outgrowth
                    1134

Testimony
September 19, 1991
Page Three

of the publicity generated by the Court's ruling, Agudath Israel and several
other Jewish groups received a number of phone calls from observant Jewish
employees who were being told by their private sector employers that they
could no longer wear their yarmulkes on the job. Among various other steps
taken at that time, we contacted the EEOC to inform the agency of this
troubling development. Judge Thomas -- then Chairman Thomas -- took a
personal interest in the matter and issued an EEOC policy memorandum stating
clearly that the holding in the Goldman case was limited to the specific
context of the military; and that the religious accommodation provisions
governing private employment, embodied in Title VII and its accompanying
regulations, remained in full force and effect. Armed with this memo, we were
quickly able to help resolve the problems that had arisen.

        In issuing a policy statement to dispel some of the confusion surrounding
the Supreme Court's 1986 Goldman decision, Judge Thomas followed the course he
had taken a year earlier when similar confusion surrounded the Court's
decision in Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 (1985). In that case,
the high court ruled unconstitutional a Connecticut statute requiring employ-
ers, absolutely and without qualification, to allow their employees time off
for Sabbath observance. In the aftermath of the Court's ruling, Judge
[Chairman] Thomas issued an EEOC memorandum making clear that the discredited
Connecticut statute was not to be confused with less absolute statutes
requiring reasonable accommodation of an employee's Sabbath observances; and
that the Sabbath observance provisions of Title VII continued to retain their
vitality.

         Thus, as chairman of the EEOC, Judge Thomas twice recognized that the
rights of religious minorities in the workforce were being threatened as a
result of inaccurate public perceptions surrounding rulings of the Supreme
Court, and twice took the initiative to dispel the misperceptions and protect
religious freedom. This, we submit, demonstrates not only Judge Thomas'
commitment to the principle of religious liberty -- itself no small cause for
celebration, especially in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling last
year in Employment Division v. Smith, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (1990), which severely
curtailed First Amendment protection for the free exercise of religion -- but
also his sensitivity to the potential power of a Supreme Court ruling and its
ability profoundly to affect the everyday lives of Americans in contexts far-
removed from the one in which the ruling is issued. That sensitivity is an
essential attribute of good judging, especially at the Supreme Court level,
and will stand Judge Thomas in good stead if he is confirmed and assumes his
seat on the high court.

          In sum, Agudath Israel of America's review of Judge Thomas' record and
resume leads us to conclude that he possesses the basic qualities of an
outstanding jurist, perhaps even in abundance. He deserves this Committee's
positive recommendation and eventual confirmation by the full Senate.

         Thank you very much.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
   Now, this is a heck of a thing to do to Mr. Palmer and Ms. Alva-
rez, but there is a vote on and we have about 5 minutes left in
which to vote.
   There are going to be three votes in a row, which means that the
earliest that we will be able to get back here would be about 20
minutes--25 minutes, before we can come back.
   Which means that you are in a tough situation, and beyond our
control, quite frankly. And I would--I am not encouraging you to
do this, but I give you the option to do this, in light of the hour.
  You can wait, and I will come back at 10 o'clock, or earlier, de-
pending on when the last vote is. I will come straight back and
reopen the hearing, or you can submit your testimony in writing.
  I am not encouraging you to do the latter, but I want to accom-
modate your interests. I am here for the duration, and I am anx-
ious to hear from you, but it is up to you, because I know you did
not anticipate, I suspect, that you would be on at 10 at night--not
9:30, let alone 10.
  Would you have a preference of what you would like to do, Mr.
Palmer?
  Mr. PALMER. Yes, I do, Mr. Chairman. I have traveled some 1,500
miles.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is no problem for me to travel back three
blocks to come back. I don't have any problem.
  Mr. PALMER. I look forward to the opportunity to testify.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. We will recess until 10 p.m.
  Mr. PALMER. Thank you.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order. I was given a
suggestion by Ms. Alvarez which seems simple and it's brilliant.
That is, what we will do is excuse the two witnesses who have al-
ready testified. Any questions this committee has we'll submit to
them in writing, and we will invite Mr. Palmer and Ms. Alvarez to
be here at 9 a.m. to hear their testimony, and we'll begin at that
time.
  Also, without objection, we will enter into the record several
written statements that have been submitted regarding Judge
Thomas' nomination, and they will be included in the record.
  We are recessed until 9 a.m. tomorrow morning.

vene at 9 a.m., Friday, September 20, 1991.]
