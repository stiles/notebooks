                         FRIDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1991

                                                                       U.S. SENATE,

  OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR., A
           U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Let me inform the Capitol Hill Police that, if there is not abso-
lute order and decorum in here, we will recess the hearing and
those who engage in any outburst at all will be asked to leave the
committee room.
  Good morning, Judge.
  Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee is meeting to hear evi-
dence on sexual harassment charges that have been made against
Judge Clarence Thomas, who has been nominated to be an Associ-
ate Justice of the Supreme Court.
  I want to speak very briefly about the circumstances that have
caused us to convene these hearings. We are here today to hold
open hearings on Prof. Anita Hill's allegations concerning Judge
Thomas. This committee's handling of her charges has been criti-
cized. Professor Hill made 2 requests to this committee: First, she
asked us to investigate her charges against Judge Thomas, and,
second, she asked that these charges remain confidential, that they
not be made public and not shared with anyone beyond this com-
mittee. I believe that we have honored both of her requests.
  Some have asked how we could have the U.S. Senate vote on
Judge Thomas' nomination and leave Senators in the dark about
Professor Hill's charges. To this, I answer, how could we have
forced Professor Hill against her will into the blinding light where
you see her today.
  But I am deeply sorry that our actions in this respect have been
seen by many across this country as a sign that this committee

                                                     (l)
does not take the charge of sexual harassment seriously. We em-
phatically do.

  I hope we all learn from the events of the past week. As one
person who has spent the past 2 years attempting to combat vio-
lence of all kinds against women through legislative efforts, I can
assure you that I take the charge of sexual harassment seriously.

  The committee's ability to investigate and hold hearings on Pro-
fessor Hill's charges has now been dramatically changed by the
events which forced Professor Hill, against her wishes, to publicly
discuss these charges. The landscape has changed. We are, thus,
here today free from the restrictions which had previously limited
our work.

  Sexual harassment is a serious matter and, in my view, any
person guilty of this offense is unsuited to serve, not only the Na-
tion's highest court, but any position of responsibility, of high re-
sponsibility in or out of government. Sexual harassment of working
women is an issue of national concern.

  With that said, let me make clear that this is not, I emphasize,
this is not a hearing about the extent and nature of sexual harass-
ment in America. That question is for a different sort of meeting of
this or any other committee.

  This is a hearing convened for a specific purpose, to air specific
allegations against one specific individual, allegations which may
be true or may not be true.

  Whichever may be the case, this hearing has not been convened
to investigate the widespread problem, and it is indisputably wide-
spread, the widespread problem of sexual harassment in this coun-
try.

  Those watching these proceedings will see witnesses being sworn
and testifying pursuant to a subpoena. But I want to emphasize
that this is not a trial, this is not a courtroom. At the end of our
proceedings, there will be no formal verdict of guilt or innocence,
nor any finding of civil liability.

  Because this is not a trial, the proceedings will not be conducted
the way in which a sexual harassment trial would be handled in a
court of law. For example, on the advice of the nonpartisan Senate
legal counsel, the rules of evidence that apply in courtrooms will
not apply here today. Thus, evidence and questions that would not
be permitted in the court of law must, under Senate rules, be al-
lowed here.

  This is a factfinding hearing, and our purpose is to help our col-
leagues in the U.S. Senate determine whether Judge Thomas
should be confirmed to the Supreme Court. We are not here, or at
least I am not here to be an advocate for one side or the other with
respect to the specific allegations which we will review, and it is
my hope and belief that my colleagues here today share that view.

  Achieving fairness in the atmosphere in which these hearings
are being held may be the most difficult task I have ever undertak-
en in my close to 19 years in the U.S. Senate.

  Each of us in this committee has already stated how he will vote
on Judge Thomas' nomination. The committee, as the Senate rules
require, has already voted in this committee on whether or not
Judge Thomas should be on the Court. Each of us has already said
whether we think Judge Thomas should or should not be a Su-
preme Court Justice, for reasons related to or unrelated to charges
we will listen to today.

  In this setting, it will be easy and perhaps understandable for
the witnesses to fear unfair treatment, but it is my job, as chair-
man, to ensure as best as I possibly can fair treatment, and that is
what I intend to do, so let me make three ground rules clear for all
of my colleagues:

  First, while legal counsel sitting behind me has advised that the
rules of evidence do not apply here, counsel has also advised the
Chair that the Chair does have the power to rule out of order ques-
tions that are not relevant to our proceedings. Certain subjects are
simply irrelevant to the issue of harassment, namely, the private
conduct of out-of-the-workplace relationships, and the intimate
lives and practices of Judge Thomas, Professor Hill, and any other
witness that comes before us.

  Thus, as chairman, I will not allow questions on matters totally
irrelevant to our investigation of the professional relationship of
Judge Thomas and any woman who has been employed by him.

  The committee is not here to put Judge Thomas or Professor Hill
on trial. I hope my colleagues will bear in mind that the best way
to do our job is to ask questions that are nonjudgmental and open
ended, in an attempt to avoid questions that badger and harass any
witness.

  Second, while I have less discretion than a judge in a trial to bar
inappropriate or embarrassing questions, all of the witnesses
should know that they have a right, under Senate Rule 26.5, to ask
that the committee go into closed session, if a question requires an
answer that is "a clear invasion of their right to privacy."

  The committee will take very seriously the request of any wit-
ness to answer particularly embarrassing questions, as they view
them in private.

  Third, the order of questioning: Because this is an extraordinary
hearing, Democrats and Republicans have each taken the step of
designating a limited number of Senators to question for the com-
mittee. On the Democratic side, our questioners will be Senators
Heflin, Leahy, and myself. As I understand it, on the Republican
side, the questioners will be the ranking member, Senator Hatch
and Senator Specter. That is said to make sure that we do not mis-
lead anyone as to how we will proceed.

  In closing, I want to reiterate my view that the primary responsi-
bility of this committee is fairness. That means making sure that
we do not victimize any witness who appears here and that we
treat every witness with respect. And without making any judg-
ment about the specific witnesses we will hear from today, fairness
means understanding what a victim of sexual harassment goes
through, why victims often do not report such crimes, why they
often believe that they should not or cannot leave their jobs.

  Perhaps 14 men sitting here today cannot understand these
things fully. I know there are many people watching today who
suspect we never will understand, but fairness means doing our
best to understand, no matter what we do or do not believe about
the specific charges. We are going to listen as closely as we can at
these hearings.
  Fairness also means that Judge Thomas must be given a full and
fair opportunity to confront these charges against him, to respond
fully, to tell us his side of the story and to be given the benefit of
the doubt.

  In the end, this hearing may resolve much or it may resolve
little, but there are two things that cannot remain in doubt after
this hearing is over: First, that the members of this committee are
fair and have been fair to all witnesses; and, second, that we take
sexual harassment as a very serious concern in this hearing and
overall.

  So, let us perform our duties with a full understanding of what I
have said and of our responsibilities to the Senate, to the Nation
and to the truth.

  I yield now to my colleague from South Carolina.

     OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STROM THURMOND, A U.S.

          SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, we have taken the unusual
step of reconvening this committee in order to consider further tes-
timony regarding the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to be
a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

  We are here this morning to attempt to discern the truth in
some rather extraordinary allegations made against this nominee,
and because Judge THomas has requested an opportunity to refute
these allegations and restore his good name.

  Mr. Chairman, before we begin, I want to emphasize that the
charge of sexual harassment is a grave one and one that each Sen-
ator on this committee takes with the utmost seriousness. This is
an issue of great sensitivity and there is no doubt in my mind that
this is difficult for everyone involved.

  Both Judge Thomas and Professor Hill find themselves in the un-
enviable position of having to discuss very personal matters in a
very public forum. I want to assure them at the outset that they
will be dealt with fairly. This will be an exceedingly uncomfortable
process for us all, but a great deal hangs in the balance and our
duty is clear, we must finds the truth.

  I would like to commend Chairman Biden, who worked with me
to ensure that this hearing would be conducted fairly. After con-
sulting with each Member on my side, I have decided that Senator
Hatch will conduct the questioning of Judge Thomas. I have also
decided, after consultation, that Senator Specter will undertake the
questioning of Professor Hill and the other witnesses. I reserve the
privilege of propounding questions myself.

  I want to make it clear that every Republican member of this
committee has been deeply involved in this process from the day
Judge Thomas was nominated by President Bush. However, in the
interest of time and fairness to all the witnesses, I believe the pro-
cedures that have been outlined will work best for everyone in-
volved.

  Over 100 days ago, when President Bush nominated Judge
Thomas, this committee undertook a thorough and far-reaching in-
vestigation of his background. That investigation turned up noth-
ing questionable about the Judge, but, rather, showed him to be an
individual of great character and accomplishment.

  During the original confirmation hearings, this committee heard
testimony from over 100 witnesses, both for and against the nomi-
nation. Not one of these witnesses, even those most bitterly op-
posed to this nomination, had one disparaging comment to make
about Clarence Thomas' moral character. On the contrary, witness
after witness spoke of the impeccable character, abiding honesty
and consummate professionalism which Judge Thomas has shown
throughout his career.

  In conclusion, I want to comment briefly about the allegations
that have been raised by Professor Hill. The alleged harassment
she describes took place some 10 years ago. During that time, she
continued to initiate contact with Judge Thomas in an apparently
friendly manner. In addition, Professor Hill chose to publicize her
allegations the day before the full Senate would have voted to con-
firm Judge Thomas.

  While I fully intend to maintain an open mind during today's
testimony, I must say that the timing of these statements raises a
tremendous number of questions which must be dealt with, and I
can assure all the witnesses that we shall be unstinting in our ef-
forts to ascertain the truth.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.

  Now, before I swear Judge Thomas, I ask that the police officer
to go to the front of that door while Judge Thomas is speaking, and
prevent anyone from going in or out. He is entitled to absolute
quiet in this room, no matter who wishes to enter.

  Judge would you stand to be sworn? Judge, do you swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you,
God?

  Judge THOMAS. I do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, do you have an opening statement?
Please proceed.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. CLARENCE THOMAS, OF GEORGIA, TO BE
          ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

  Judge THOMAS. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, members of
the committee: as excruciatingly difficult as the last 2 weeks have
been, I welcome the opportunity to clear my name today. No one
other than my wife and Senator Danforth, to whom I read this
statement at 6:30 a.m., has seen or heard the statement, no han-
dlers, no advisers.

  The first I learned of the allegations by Prof. Anita Hill was on
September 25, 1991, when the FBI came to my home to investigate
her allegations. When informed by the FBI agent of the nature of
the allegations and the person making them, I was shocked, sur-
prised, hurt, and enormously saddened.

  I have not been the same since that day. For almost a decade my
responsibilities included enforcing the rights of victims of sexual
harassment. As a boss, as a friend, and as a human being I was
proud that I have never had such an allegation leveled against me,
even as I sought to promote women, and minorities into nontradi-
tional jobs.

  In addition, several of my friends, who are women, have confided
in me about the horror of harassment on the job, or elsewhere. I
thought I really understood the anguish, the fears, the doubts, the
seriousness of the matter. But since September 25, I have suffered
immensely as these very serious charges were leveled against me.

  I have been wracking my brains, and eating my insides out
trying to think of what I could have said or done to Anita Hill to
lead her to allege that I was interested in her in more than a pro-
fessional way, and that I talked with her about pornographic or x-
rated films.

  Contrary to some press reports, I categorically denied all of the
allegations and denied that I ever attempted to date Anita Hill,
when first interviewed by the FBI. I strongly reaffirm that denial.
Let me describe my relationship with Anita Hill.

  In 1981, after I went to the Department of Education as an As-
sistant Secretary in the Office of Civil Rights, one of my closest
friends, from both college and law school, Gil Hardy, brought Anita
Hill to my attention. As I remember, he indicated that she was dis-
satisfied with her law firm and wanted to work in Government.
Based primarily, if not solely, on Gil's recommendation, I hired
Anita Hill.

  During my tenure at the Department of Education, Anita Hill
was an attorney-adviser who worked directly with me. She worked
on special projects, as well as day-to-day matters. As I recall, she
was one of two professionals working directly with me at the time.
As a result, we worked closely on numerous matters.

  I recall being pleased with her work product and the profession-
al, but cordial relationship which we enjoyed at work. I also recall
engaging in discussions about politics and current events.

  Upon my nomination to become Chairman of the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission, Anita Hill, to the best of my recol-
lection, assisted me in the nomination and confirmation process.
After my confirmation, she and Diane Holt, then my secretary,
joined me at EEOC. I do not recall that there was any question or
doubts that she would become a special assistant to me at EEOC,
although as a career employee she retained the option of remain-
ing at the Department of Education.

  At EEOC our relationship was more distant. And our contacts
less frequent, as a result of the increased size of my personal staff
and the dramatic increase and diversity of my day-to-day responsi-
bilities.

  Upon reflection, I recall that she seemed to have had some diffi-
culty adjusting to this change in her role. In any case, our relation-
ship remained both cordial and professional. At no time did I
become aware, either directly or indirectly that she felt I had said,
or done anything to change the cordial nature of our relationship.

  I detected nothing from her or from my staff, or from Gil Hardy,
our mutual friend, with whom I maintained regular contact. I am
certain that had any statement or conduct on my part been
brought to my attention, I would remember it clearly because of
the nature and seriousness of such conduct, as well as my adamant
opposition to sex discrimination sexual harassment.
  But there were no such statements.
  In the spring of 1983, Mr. Charles Cothey contacted me to speak
at the law school at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, OK. Anita
Hill, who is from Oklahoma, accompanied me on that trip. It was
not unusual that individuals on my staff would travel with me oc-
casionally. Anita Hill accompanied me on that trip primarily be-
cause this was an opportunity to combine business and a visit to
her home.
  As I recall, during our visit at Oral Roberts University, Mr.
Cothey mentioned to me the possibility of approaching Anita Hill
to join the faculty at Oral Roberts University Law School. I encour-
aged him to do so. I noted to him, as I recall, that Anita Hill would
do well in teaching. I recommended her highly and she eventually
was offered a teaching position.
  Although I did not see Anita Hill often after she left EEOC, I did
see her on one or two subsequent visits to Tulsa, OK. And on one
visit I believe she drove me to the airport. I also occasionally re-
ceived telephone calls from her. She would speak directly with me
or with my secretary, Diane Holt. Since Anita Hill and Diane Holt
had been with me at the Department of Education they were fairly
close personally and I believe they occasionally socialized together.

  I would also hear about her through Linda Jackson, then Linda
Lambert, whom both Anita Hill and I met at the Department of
Education. And I would hear of her from my friend Gil.

  Throughout the time that Anita Hill worked with me I treated
her as I treated my other special assistants. I tried to treat them
all cordially, professionally, and respectfully. And I tried to support
them in their endeavors, and be interested in and supportive of
their success.

  I had no reason or basis to believe my relationship with Anita
Hill was anything but this way until the FBI visited me a little
more than 2 weeks ago. I find it particularly troubling that she
never raised any hint that she was uncomfortable with me. She did
not raise or mention it when considering moving with me to EEOC
from the Department of Education. And she never raised it with
me when she left EEOC and was moving on in her life.

  And to my fullest knowledge, she did not speak to any other
women working with or around me, who would feel comfortable
enough to raise it with me, especially Diane Holt, to whom she
seemed closest on my personal staff. Nor did she raise it with
mutual friends, such as Linda Jackson, and Gil Hardy.

  This is a person I have helped at every turn in the road, since we
met. She seemed to appreciate the continued cordial relationship
we had since day one. She sought my advice and counsel, as did
virtually all of the members of my personal staff.

  During my tenure in the executive branch as a manager, as a
policymaker, and as a person, I have adamantly condemned sex
harassment. There is no member of this committee or this Senate
who feels stronger about sex harassment than I do. As a manager,
I made every effort to take swift and decisive action when sex har-
assment raised or reared its ugly head.

  The fact that I feel so very strongly about sex harassment and
spoke loudly about it at EEOC has made these allegations doubly
                                       8

hard on me. I cannot imagine anything that I said or did to Anita
Hill that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment.

  But with that said, if there is anything that I have said that has
been misconstrued by Anita Hill or anyone else, to be sexually har-
assment, then I can say that I am so very sorry and I wish I had
known. If I did know I would have stopped immediately and I
would not, as I have done over the past 2 weeks, had to tear away
at myself trying to think of what I could possibly have done. But I
have not said or done the things that Anita Hill has alleged. God
has gotten me through the days since September 25 and He is my
judge.

  Mr. Chairman, something has happened to me in the dark days
that have followed since the FBI agents informed me about these
allegations. And the days have grown darker, as this very serious,
very explosive, and very sensitive allegation or these sensitive alle-
gations were selectively leaked, in a distorted way to the media
over the past weekend.

  As if the confidential allegations, themselves, were not enough,
this apparently calculated public disclosure has caused me, my
family, and my friends enormous pain and great harm.

  I have never, in all my life, felt such hurt, such pain, such agony.
My family and I have been done a grave and irreparable injustice.
During the past 2 weeks, I lost the belief that if I did my best all
would work out. I called upon the strength that helped me get here
from Pin Point, and it was all sapped out of me. It was sapped out
of me because Anita Hill was a person I considered a friend, whom
I admired and thought I had treated fairly and with the utmost re-
spect. Perhaps I could have better weathered this if it were from
someone else, but here was someone I truly felt I had done my best
with.

  Though I am, by no means, a perfect person, no means, I have
not done what she has alleged, and I still do not know what I could
possibly have done to cause her to make these allegations.

  When I stood next to the President in Kennebunkport, being
nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States, that was a
high honor. But as I sit here, before you, 103 days later, that honor
has been crushed. From the very beginning charges were leveled
against me from the shadows--charges of drug abuse, antisemi-
tism, wife-beating, drug use by family members, that I was a quota
appointment, confirmation conversion and much, much more, and
now, this.

  I have complied with the rules. I responded to a document re-
quest that produced over 30,000 pages of documents. And I have
testified for 5 full days, under oath. I have endured this ordeal for
103 days. Reporters sneaking into my garage to examine books I
read. Reporters and interest groups swarming over divorce papers,
looking for dirt. Unnamed people starting preposterous and damag-
ing rumors. Calls all over the country specifically requesting dirt.
This is not American. This is Kafka-esque. It has got to stop. It
must stop for the benefit of future nominees, and our country.
Enough is enough.

  I am not going to allow myself to be further humiliated in order
to be confirmed. I am here specifically to respond to allegations of
sex harassment in the work place. I am not here to be further hu-
miliated by this committee, or anyone else, or to put my private
life on display for a prurient interest or other reasons. I will not
allow this committee or anyone else to probe into my private life.
This is not what America is all about.

  To ask me to do that would be to ask me to go beyond fundamen-
tal fairness. Yesterday, I called my mother. She was confined to
her bed, unable to work and unable to stop crying. Enough is
enough.

  Mr. Chairman, in my 43 years on this Earth, I have been able,
with the help of others and with the help of God, to defy poverty,
avoid prison, overcome segregation, bigotry, racism, and obtain one
of the finest educations available in this country. But I have not
been able to overcome this process. This is worse than any obstacle
or anything that I have ever faced. Throughout my life I have been
energized by the expectation and the hope that in this country I
would be treated fairly in all endeavors. When there was segrega-
tion I hoped there would be fairness one day or some day. When
there was bigotry and prejudice I hoped that there would be toler-
ance and understanding some day.

  Mr. Chairman, I am proud of my life, proud of what I have done,
and what I have accomplished, proud of my family, and this proc-
ess, this process is trying to destroy it all. No job is worth what I
have been through, no job. No horror in my life has been so debili-
tating. Confirm me if you want, don't confirm me if you are so led,
but let this process end. Let me and my family regain our lives. I
never asked to be nominated. It was an honor. Little did I know
the price, but it is too high.

  I enjoy and appreciate my current position, and I am comfortable
with the prospect of returning to my work as a judge on the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and to my friends there.

  Each of these positions is public service, and I have given at the
office. I want my life and my family's life back and I want them
returned expeditiously.

  I have experienced the exhilaration of new heights from the
moment I was called to Kennebunkport by the President to have
lunch and he nominated me. That was the high point. At that time
I was told eye-to-eye that, Clarence, you made it this far on merit,
the rest is going to be politics and it surely has been. There have
been other highs. The outpouring of support from my friends of
long-standing, a bonding like I have never experienced with my old
boss, Senator Danforth, the wonderful support of those who have
worked with me.

  There have been prayers said for my family, and me, by people I
know and people I will never meet, prayers that were heard and
that sustained not only me, but also my wife and my entire family.
Instead of understanding and appreciating the great honor be-
stowed upon me, I find myself, here today defending my name, my
integrity, because somehow select portions of confidential docu-
ments, dealing with this matter were leaked to the public.

  Mr. Chairman, I am a victim of this process and my name has
been harmed, my integrity has been harmed, my character has
been harmed, my family has been harmed, my friends have been
harmed. There is nothing this committee, this body or this country
can do to give me my good name back, nothing.

  I will not provide the rope for my own lynching or for further
humiliation. I am not going to engage in discussions, nor will I
submit to roving questions of what goes on in the most intimate
parts of my private live or the sanctity of my bedroom. These are
the most intimate parts of my privacy, and they will remain just
that, private.

                                 STATEMENT OF CLARENCE THOMAS

                         BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
                                           October 11, 1991

         AS EXCRUCIATINGLY DIFFICULT AS THE LAST TWO WEEKS HAVE BEEN,
I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAR MY NAME TODAY. CDrOIUS THIS"
COMMITTEE* NO ONE OTHER THAN MY WIFE HAS SEEN AND HEARD THIS
STATEMENT...NO HANDLERS, NO ADVISORS.

         THE FIRST I LEARNED OF THE ALLEGATIONS BY PROFESSOR ANITA HILL
WAS ON SEPTEMBER 25, 1991 WHEN THE FBI CAME TO MY HOME TO
INVESTIGATE HER ALLEGATIONS. WHEN INFORMED BY THE FBI AGENT OF THE
NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND THE PERSON MAKING THEM, I WAS
SHOCKED, SURPRISED, HURT AND ENORMOUSLY SADDENED. I HAVE NOT BEEN
THE SAME SINCE THAT DAY.

          FOR ALMOST A DECADE, MY RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDED ENFORCING
 THE RIGHTS OF VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AS A BOSS, AS A FRIEND
                                     12

                                                   2

AND AS A HUMAN BEING, I WAS PROUD THAT I HAD NEVER HAD SUCH AN
ALLEGATION LEVELLED AGAINST ME AS I SOUGHT TO PROMOTE WOMEN AND
MINORITIES INTO NON-TRADITIONAL JOBS.

         IN ADDITION, SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE WOMEN HAVE CONFIDED
IN ME ABOUT THE HORROR OF HARASSMENT ON THE JOB OR ELSEWHERE. I
THOUGHT I REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE ANGUISH, THE FEARS, THE DOUBTS, THE
SERIOUSNESS OF THIS MATTER.

         BUT SINCE SEPTEMBER 25TH, I HAVE SUFFERED IMMENSELY AS THESE
VERY SERIOUS CHARGES WERE LEVELLED AGAINST ME. I HAVE BEEN RACKING
MY BRAINS AND EATING MY INSIDES OUT TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT I COULD
HAVE SAID OR DONE TO ANITA HILL TO LEAD HER TO ALLEGE THAT I WAS
 INTERESTED IN HER IN MORE THAN A PROFESSIONAL WAY AND THAT I TALKED
 WITH HER ABOUT PORNOGRAPHIC FILMS. CONTRARY TO SOME PRESS REPORTS,
 I CATEGORICALLY DENIED ALJi OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND DENIED THAT I
 EVER ATTEMPTED TO DATE ANITA HILL. I STRONGLY REAFFIRM THAT
                                     13

DENIAL.

LET ME DESCRIBE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH ANITA HILL.

                  IN 1981, AFTER I WENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS
         AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY IN THE OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS, ONE OF
         MY CLOSEST FRIENDS, GIL HARDY, BROUGHT ANITA HILL TO MY
         ATTENTION. AS I REMEMBER, HE INDICATED THAT SHE WAS
         DISSATISFIED WITH HER LAW FIRM AND WANTED TO WORK IN
         GOVERNMENT. BASED PRIMARILY ON GIL'S RECOMMENDATION, I HIRED
         ANITA HILL.

                   DURING MY TENURE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, ANITA
          HILL WAS AN ATTORNEY ADVISOR WHO WORKED DIRECTLY WITH ME. SHE
          WORKED ON SPECIAL PROJECTS AS WELL AS DAY TO DAY MATTERS. AS
          I RECALL, SHE WAS ONE OF TWO PROFESSIONALS WORKING DIRECTLY
          WITH ME. AS A RESULT WE WORKED CLOSELY ON NUMEROUS MATTERS.
                               14

                                                4
I RECALL BEING PLEASED WITH HER WORK PRODUCT AND THE
PROFESSIONAL BUT CORDIAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH WE ENJOYED AT
WORK. I ALSO RECALL ENGAGING IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT POLITICS
AND CURRENT EVENTS.

         UPON MY NOMINATION TO BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE EQUAL
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION, ANITA HILL, TO THE BEST OF
MY . RECOLLECTION, ASSISTED ME IN THE NOMINATION AND
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. AFTER MY CONFIRMATION, SHE AND DIANE
HOLT, THEN MY SECRETARY, JOINED ME AT EEOC. I DO N££ RECALL
THAT THERE WAS ANY QUESTION OR DOUBT THAT SHE WOULD BECOME A
SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO ME AT EEOC, ALTHOUGH, AS A CAREER
EMPLOYEE, SHE RETAINED THE OPTION OF REMAINING AT THE
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

         AT EEOC, OUR RELATIONSHIP WAS MORE DISTANT AND OUR
 CONTACTS LESS FREQUENT AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASED SIZE OF
                     15

                                                5
MY PERSONAL STAFF AND THE DRAMATIC INCREASE AND DIVERSITY OF

MY DAY TO DAY RESPONSIBILITIES. UPON REFLECTION, I RECALL

THAT SHE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY ADJUSTING TO THIS

CHANGE IN HER ROLE/      IN ANY CASE, OUR RELATIONSHIP

REMAINED BOTH CORDIAL AND PROFESSIONAL. AT NO TIME DID I

BECOME AWARE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THAT SHE FELT I HAD

SAID OR DONE ANYTHING TO CHANGE THE CORDIAL NATURE OF OUR

RELATIONSHIP. I DETECTED NOTHING FROM HER, OR FROM MY STAFF,

OR FROM GIL HARDY, OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, WITH WHOM I MAINTAINED

REGULAR CONTACT.

         I AM CERTAIN THAT HAD ANY STATEMENT OR CONDUCT ON MY PART
BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION, I WOULD REMEMBER IT CLEARLY
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE AND SERIOUSNESS OF SUCH CONDUCT AS WELL
AS MY ADAMANT OPPOSITION TO SEX DISCRIMINATION AND SEXUAL
HARASSMENT. BUT THERE WERE NO SUCH STATEMENTS.
                               16

                                          6

         IN THE SPRING OF 1983, MR. CHARLES KOTHE CONTACTED ME TO
SPEAK AT THE LAW SCHOOL AT ORAL ROBERTS UNIVERSITY IN TULSA
OKLAHOMA. ANITA HILL, WHO IS FROM OKLAHOMA, ACCOMPANIED ME.
IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL THAT INDIVIDUALS ON MY STAFF WOULD TRAVEL
WITH ME OCCASIONALLY. ANITA HILL ACCOMPANIED ME ON THAT TRIP
PRIMARILY BECAUSE THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMBINE BUSINESS
AND A VISIT HOME. AS I RECALL, DURING OUR VISIT AT ORAL
ROBERTS UNIVERSITY, MR. KOTHE MENTIONED TO ME THE POSSIBILITY
OF APPROACHING ANITA HILL TO JOIN THE FACULTY AT ORAL ROBERTS
UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL. I ENCOURAGED HIM TO DO SO AND NOTED
TO HIM, AS I RECALL, THAT ANITA HILL WOULD DO WELL IN
TEACHING. I RECOMMENDED HER HIGHLY AND SHE EVENTUALLY WAS
OFFERED A TEACHING POSITION.

         ALTHOUGH I DID NOT SEE ANITA HILL OFTEN AFTER SHE LEFT
EEOC, I DID SEE HER ON ONE OR TWO SUBSEQUENT VISITS TO TULSA,
 OKLAHOMA. AND ON ONE VISIT, I BELIEVE SHE DROVE ME TO THE
                               17

                                                7
AIRPORT. I ALSO OCCASIONALLY RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALLS FROM
HER. SHE WOULD SPEAK DIRECTLY WITH ME OR WITH MY SECRETARY,
DIANE HOLT. SINCE ANITA HILL AND DIANE HOLT HAD BEEN WITH ME
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, THEY WERE FAIRLY CLOSE
PERSONALLY AND I BELIEVE THEY OCCASIONALLY SOCIALIZED
TOGETHER. I WOULD ALSO HEAR ABOUT HER THROUGH LINDA JACKSON,
WHOM BOTH ANITA HILL AND I MET AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION,
AND FROM MY FRIEND, GIL HARDY.

         THROUGHOUT THE TIME THAT ANITA HILL WORKED WITH ME, I
TREATED HER AS I TREATED MY OTHER SPECIAL ASSISTANTS. I TRIED
 TO TREAT THEM ALL CORDIALLY, PROFESSIONALLY, AND RESPECTFULLY.
AND, I TRIED TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR ENDEAVORS AND BE
 INTERESTED IN AND SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR SUCCESS. I HAD NO
 REASON OR BASIS TO BELIEVE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH ANITA HILL
 WAS ANYTHING BUT THIS WAY UNTIL THE FBI VISITED ME A LITTLE
 MORE THAN TWO WEEKS AGO.
                               18

         I FIND IT PARTICULARLY TROUBLING THAT SHE NEVER RAISED
ANY HINT THAT SHE HAS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH ME. SHE DID NOT
RAISE OR MENTION IT WHEN CONSIDERING MOVING WITH ME TO EEOC
FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND, SHE NEVER RAISED IT
WITH ME WHEN SHE LEFT EEOC AND WAS MOVING ON IN HER LIFE. AND
TO MY FULLEST KNOWLEDGE, SHE DID NOT SPEAK TO ANY OTHER WOMEN
WORKING WITH OR AROUND ME, WHO WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH
TO RAISE IT WITH ME -- ESPECIALLY DIANE HOLT TO WHOM SHE
SEEMED CLOSEST ON MY PERSONAL STAFF. NOR DID SHE RAISE IT
WITH MUTUAL FRIENDS SUCH AS LINDA JACKSON AND GIL HARDY.

         THIS IS A PERSON I HAVE HELPED AT EVERY TURN IN THE ROAD
SINCE WE MET. SHE SEEMED TO APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED CORDIAL
RELATIONSHIP WE HAD SINCE DAY ONE. SHE SOUGHT MY ADVICE AND
COUNSEL, AS DID VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF MY PERSONAL
 STAFF.

        DURING MY TENURE IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, AS A MANAGER, AS A
POLICY MAKER AND AS A PERSON, I HAVE ADAMANTLY CONDEMNED SEX
HARASSMENT. THERE IS NO MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE OR THE SENATE WHO
FEELS STRONGER ABOUT SEX HARASSMENT THAN I DO. AS A MANAGER, I
MADE EVERY EFFORT TO TAKE SWIFT AND DECISIVE ACTION
WHEN SEX HARASSMENT REARED ITS UGLY HEAD. THE FACT THAT I FEEL SO
VERY STRONGLY ABOUT SEX HARASSMENT AND SPOKE SO LOUDLY ABOUT IT AT
EEOC, HAS MADE THESE ALLEGATIONS DOUBLY HARD ON ME.

         I CANNOT IMAGINE ANYTHING THAT I SAID OR DID TO ANITA HILL
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MISTAKEN FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BUT WITH THAT
SAID, IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT I HAVE SAID THAT HAS BEEN
MISCONSTRUED, BY ANITA HILL OR ANYONE ELSE, TO BE SEXUAL
HARASSMENT, THEN I CAN SAY THAT I AM SO VERY SORRY AND I WISH I HAD
KNOWN. IF I DID KNOW, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY AND I WOULD
 NOT, AS I HAVE DONE OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS, HAD TO TEAR AWAY AT

                                                        10
MYSELF TRYING TO THINK OF WHAT I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE DONE. BUT,
I HAVE H2ISAID OR DONE THE THINGS THAT ANITA HILL HAS ALLEGED.

         GOD HAS GOTTEN ME THROUGH THE DAYS SINCE SEPTEMBER 25TH. AND
HE IS MY JUDGE.

         MR. CHAIRMAN, SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO ME IN THE DARK DAYS
THAT HAVE FOLLOWED SINCE THE FBI AGENTS INFORMED ME ABOUT THESE
ALLEGATIONS. AND THE DAYS HAVE GROWN DARKER AS THIS VERY SERIOUS,
VERY EXPLOSIVE, AND VERY SENSITIVE ALLEGATION* W*0 SELECTIVELY
LEAKED TO THE MEDIA OVER THE PAST WEEKEND. AS IF THE CONFIDENTIAL
ALLEGATION? WERE NOT ENOUGH, THIS APPARENTLY CALCULATED PUBLIC

           A .

DISCLOSURE HAS CAUSED ME, MY FAMILY, AND MY FRIENDS ENORMOUS PAIN
*AND GREAT HARM.

          I HAVE NEVER IN ALL MY LIFE FELT SUCH HURT, SUCH PAIN, SUCH
 AGONY. MY FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN DONE A GRAVE AND IRREPARABLE
                                     21
                                     n

INJUSTICE.

         DURING THE PAST TWO WEEKS I LOST THE BELIEF THAT IF I DID MY
BEST, ALL WOULD WORK OUT. I CALLED UPON THE STRENGTH THAT HELPED
ME GET OUT OF PINPOINT ... AND IT WAS ALL SAPPED OUT OF HE. IT WAS
SAPPED OUT OF HE BECAUSE ANITA HILL WAS A PERSON I CONSIDERED A
FRIEND, WHOM I ADMIRED AND THOUGHT I HAD TREATED FAIRLY AND WITH
THE UTMOST RESPECT. PERHAPS I COULD HAVE BETTER WEATHERED THIS IF
IT WAS FROM SOMEONE ELSE, BUT HERE WAS SOMEONE I TRULY FELT I HAD
DONE MY BEST WITH. THOUGH I AM BY NO MEANS A PERFECT PERSON, I
HAVE NOT DONE WHAT SHE HAS ALLEGED. AND, I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT
I COULD POSSIBLY HAVE DONE TO CAUSE HER TO MAKE THESE ALLEGATIONS.

         WHEN I STOOD NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT IN KENNEBUNKPORT, BEING
NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS A HIGH
HONOR. BUT AS I SIT HERE BEFORE YOU 103 DAYS LATER, THAT HONOR HAS
 BEEN CRUSHED. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, CHARGES WERE LEVELLED

                                                        12
AGAINST HE FROM THE SHADOWS. CHARGES OF DRUG ABUSE, ANTI-SEMITISM,
WIFE BEATING, DRUG USE BY FAMILY MEMBERS, THAT I MAS A QUOTA
APPOINTMENT, CONFIRMATION CONVERSION, AND MUCH MORE ... AND NOW
THIS.

         I HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE RULES. I RESPONDED TO A DOCUMENT
REQUEST THAT PRODUCED OVER 30,000 PAGES OF DOCUMENTS. AND I HAVE
TESTIFIED FOR FIVE FULL DAYS. I HAVE ENDURED THIS ORDEAL FOR 103
DAYS -- REPORTERS SNEAKING INTO MY GARAGE TO EXAMINE BOOKS I READ,
REPORTERS AND INTEREST GROUPS SWARMING gUTWKHi DIVORCE PAPERS
LOOKING FOR DIRT, UNNAMED PEOPLE STARTING PREPOSTEROUS RUMORS,
CALLS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY SPECIFICALLY REQUESTING DIRT. THIS IS
NOT AMERICAN. THIS IS KAFKAESQUE. IT HAS GOT TO STOP. IT MUST
 STOP FOR THE BENEFIT OF FUTURE NOMINEES AND OUR COUNTRY. ENOUGH
 IS ENOUGH.

        I AM NOT GOING TO ALLOW MYSELF TO BE FURTHER HUMILIATED IN
ORDER TO BE CONFIRMED. I AM HERE SPECIFICALLY TO RESPOND TO
ALLEGATIONS OF SEX HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. I AM NOT HERE TO
BE FURTHER HUMILIATED BY THIS COMMITTEE OR ANYONE ELSE OR TO PUT
MY PRIVATE LIFE ON DISPLAY FOR PRURIENT INTEREST OR OTHER REASONS.
I WILL NOT ALLOW THIS COMMITTEE OR ANYONE ELSE TO PROBE INTO MY
PRIVATE LIFE. THAT IS NOT WHAT AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT. TO ASK ME
TO DO THAT WOULD BE TO ASK ME TO GO BEYOND FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS.

         YESTERDAY, I CALLED MY MOTHER. SHE WAS CONFINED TO HER BED,
UNABLE TO WORK AND UNABLE TO STOP CRYING. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

         MR. CHAIRMAN, IN MY 43 YEARS ON THIS EARTH, I HAVE BEEN ABLE
WITH THE HELP OF OTHERS TO DEFY POVERTY, AVOID PRISON, OVERCOME
 SEGREGATION, BIGOTRY, RACISM AND OBTAIN ONE OF THE FINEST
 EDUCATIONS AVAILABLE IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
 OVERCOME THIS PROCESS. THIS IS WORSE THAN ANY OBSTACLE OR ANYTHING
                                     24

                                                        14
THAT I HAVE EVER FACED.

         THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, I HAVE BEEN ENERGIZED BY THE EXPECTATION
AND THE HOPE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY I WOULD BE TREATED FAIRLY IN ALL
MY ENDEAVORS. WHEN THERE HAS SEGREGATION, I HOPED THERE WOULD BE
FAIRNESS ONE DAY. WHEN THERE WAS BIGOTRY AND PREJUDICE, I HOPED
THAT THERE WOULD BE TOLERANCE AND UNDERSTANDING.

         MR. CHAIRMAN, I AM PROUD OF MY LIFE -- PROUD OF WHAT I HAVE
DONE -- PROUD OF MY FAMILY -- AND THIS PROCESS IS TRYING TO DESTROY
IT ALL.

         NO JOB IS WORTH WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH. NO HORROR IN MY
LIFE HAS BEEN SO DEBILITATING. CONFIRM ME IF YOU WANT. DON'T
 CONFIRM ME IF YOU ARE SO LED. BUT LET THIS PROCESS END. LET ME
 AND MY FAMILY REGAIN OUR LIVES. I NEVER ASKED TO BE NOMINATED.
 IT WAS AN HONOR. LITTLE DID I KNOW THE PRICE. I ENJOY AND

APPRECIATE MY CURRENT POSITION AND I AM COMFORTABLE WITH THE
PROSPECT OF RETURNING TO MY WORK AS A JUDGE AND TO MY FRIENDS ON
THE COURT OF APPEALS. EACH OF THESE POSITIONS IS PUBLIC SERVICE,
AND I HAVE "GIVEN AT THE OFFICE". I WANT MY LIFE AND MY FAMILY'S
LIFE BACK AND I WANT THEM RETURNED EXPEDITIOUSLY.

         I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE EXHILARATION OF NEW HEIGHTS, FROM THE
MOMENT I WAS CALLED TO KENNEBUNKPORT BY THE PRESIDENT TO HAVE
LUNCH, AND HE NOMINATED ME. THAT WAS THE HIGH POINT. I WAS TOLD
 EYE TO EYE THAT; "CLARENCE, YOU MADE IT THIS FAR ON MERIT, THE REST
 IS GOING TO BE POLITICS."

          THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER HIGHS...THE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT FROM
 FRIENDS OF LONGSTANDING, A BONDING LIKE I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED
 WITH MY OLD BOSS, JACK DANFORTH. THE WONDERFUL SUPPORT OF THOSE
 WHO HAVE WORKED WITH ME. THERE HAVE BEEN PRAYERS SAID FOR MY
 FAMILY AND ME BY PEOPLE I KNOW AND PEOPLE I WILL NEVER MEET --

PRAYERS THAT WERE HEARD AND THAT SUSTAINED NOT ONLY ME, BUT ALSO
MY WIFE AND MY ENTIRE FAMILY.

         INSTEAD OF UNDERSTANDING AND APPRECIATING THE GREAT HONOR
BESTOWED ON ME, I FIND MYSELF HERE TODAY DEFENDING MY NAME, MY
INTEGRITY BECAUSE SOMEHOW SELECT PORTIONS OF CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS
DEALING WITH THIS MATTER WERE MADE PUBLIC.

         MR. CHAIRMAN, I AM A VICTIM OF THIS PROCESS. MY NAME HAS BEEN
HARMED. MY INTEGRITY HAS BEEN HARMED. MY CHARACTER HAS BEEN HARMED.
MY FAMILY HAS BEEN HARMED. MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN HARMED.

         I WILL NOT PROVIDE THE ROPE FOR MY OWN LYNCHING OR FOR FURTHER
HUMILIATION. I AM NOT GOING TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS, NOR WILL I
SUBMIT TO ROVING QUESTIONS OF WHAT GOES ON IN THE MOST INTIMATE
PARTS OF MX PRIVATE LIFE OR THE SANCTITY OF MY BEDROOM. THESE ARE
 THE MOST INTIMATE PARTS OF MY PRIVACY AND THEY WILL REMAIN JUST
 THAT: PRIVATE.
                                                27

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Judge. You will not be asked to.
  Before I begin my questioning of Judge Thomas, I would remind
the committee and the nominee that, with respect to one set of al-
legations, those pertaining to Prof. Anita Hill, we are somewhat
limited at this stage as to permissible questions. Professor Hill, as
recently as late last night, continues to ask us to maintain the con-
fidentiality of her statement to the committee.
  So, Judge Thomas, at this stage of the hearing, without having
heard Professor Hill's testimony and without using her statement,
our questioning to you may not be complete. We may have to dis-
cuss some aspects of the allegations with you at the end of these
hearings.
  I would also note for the record that the choice of the order of
these hearings was left to you. I asked whether or not you wished
to go first or second, and you chose, as is your right, to speak first
and then, if you so chose, to speak last.
  Therefore, with respect to Professor Hill, I intend to focus on the
general nature of your relationship with her, her responsibilities in
your office and the environment in which she worked.
  Judge you have spoken to some of these issues in your opening
statement, but let me ask you
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman.

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say something for
the record here. This is not the appointment of a justice of the
peace. This is the nomination process of a man to become a Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States, and he has been badly
maligned.

  I might add that I have a lot of sympathy for Professor Hill, too,
and I am not going to sit here and tolerate her attorneys telling
you or me or anybody else that, now that she has made these state-
ments in writing, with what is, if the Judge is telling the truth--
and I believe he is--scurrilous allegations, that that statement
cannot be used, especially in this proceeding. It is a matter of fair-
ness.

  I might add that I have been informed that the reporter who
broke this story has her statement and read it to her before she
would even talk to her. Now, it would be the greatest travesty I
have ever seen in any court of law, let alone an open forum in the
nomination process of a man for Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court,
to allow her attorneys or her or anybody on this committee or any-
body else, for that matter, to tell us what can or cannot be used
now that this man's reputation has been very badly hurt.

  The CHAIRMAN. Would the Senator yield?
  Senator HATCH. I am not finished.
  I intend to use that statement, because it is fair to use it. I do not
want to hurt
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, let me
  Senator HATCH. Let me finish.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO; I will not.
  Senator HATCH. Yes; you will. Yes; you will.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me just make one--you are entitled to use
the statement under the rule. No one, the Chair cannot stop you
from using the statement.
                                                28

  Senator HATCH. Well, Mr. Chairman, how can it be admissible to
everybody? Everybody in this country is going to see it.

  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, how can she request confiden-
tiality at this point, when she said she

  The CHAIRMAN. I can answer that question. Professor Hill says
that she wants to tell her story. She did not release the statement,
she says, and she wants her story told by her. Because we have
given the opportunity to the Judge to speak first, if he so chose,
and he has, she wants to be able to present her thus far unreleased
statement in her own words. She will not have spoken publicly
when she comes and addresses the committee.

  Now, why don't we get on with this process?
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, let me say a word.
  Senator HATCH. I am not finished.
  Senator THURMOND. Wait just 1 minute.
  Senator HATCH. OK.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, she has been on television
telling her story. She has made it public, so, therefore, I think the
right to use that statement ought to be admitted.
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, I did not release the floor. I did
to the chairman, because the chairman--I want to finish my com-
ments.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Massachusetts and then we
will go back
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Everybody is going to get a chance to say
what
  Senator HATCH. All right, if you will come back to me, I would
appreciate it.
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that you out-
lined a reasonable way of proceeding. I think it is entirely proper
that Judge Thomas be able to make what statement that he so de-
sires. And I thought it was a very moving statement, Judge.
  It might be appropriate, if that is the desire, that at least we
work out in terms of the committee and the committee's under-
standing the way that we are going to proceed on this. As I under-
stand, the professor had indicated a willingness to testify first or go
second, and now we are in the situation where Judge Thomas has
spoken, and it seems to me that we ought to be able to work out at
least the way that we are going to proceed that is going to be re-
spectful both of Judge Thomas and the witness, without getting
into a lot of back and forth up here, which is not really the purpose
of the hearing.
  What I might suggest, at least, is that we have a very brief
recess, so that we can at least find out the way that we can proceed
that is consistent with Judge Thomas, consistent with the others,
and satisfactory to the committee.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Utah.
  Senator HATCH. I object to a recess. The fact of the matter is, last
Thursday, a substantial majority of the Senate frankly asked us to
                                      29

get to the bottom of this. The public deserves to know now, one
way or the other, and the public is going to know, if I have any-
thing to say about it.

  Our colleagues demanded it. They did not ask us to just find out
so much as the witness will allow us to ask, and I have no inten-
tion of pillorying or maligning Professor Hill. I feel sorry for both
of these people. Both of them are going to come out of this with
less of a reputation. It is pathetic and it would not have hap-
pened

  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman.
  Senator HATCH. Let me finish, if I could.
  If somebody on this committee or their staff had had the honesty
and the integrity before the vote to raise this issue and ask for an
executive session and say this has to be brought--nobody did, and
then somebody on this committee or their staff, and I am outraged
by it, leaked that report, an FBI report that we all know should
never be disclosed to the public, because of the materials that gen-
erally are in them. They take it down as it is given. It has raw
stuff in it, but it has been leaked. The media knows everything in
it. I think the American people are entitled to know, if they want
to.
  What I am trying to say is that, to be frank, Mr. Chairman,
there are inconsistencies in the statement of Anita Hill to the FBI,
compared to her other statements. I do not particularly intend to
go into that. She is entitled to explain these discrepancies, but
Judge Thomas is entitled to point out these inconsistencies for
their bearing on the credibility of the accuser in this instance, nice
person though she may be, a good law professor though she may
be, a fellow Yale law graduate though she may be, and the state-
ments of
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman.
  Senator HATCH. If I could just finish. I promise to be shorter. The
statements of the subsequent witnesses are also at variance with
Professor Hill's statements with what she told the FBI. If she hap-
pens to testify differently today, we have to find out which of those
statements are true, and if I
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, we are not at liberty to publicly discuss
what is in the FBI report. Her statement is what
  Senator HATCH. The heck we're not. This report has been leaked
to the press, they know about it. Part of it has been read to the
accuser in this case. I think it is time to be fair to the nominee. He
has come this far. He is the one who is being accused. They have
the burden of showing that he is not telling the truth here, and he
has a right to face the accuser and everything that accuser says,
and if he does not, then I am going to resign from this committee
today. I am telling you, I don't want to be on it.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing is in recess for 5 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  The committee has met and resolved the impasse the following
way: Professor Hill indicated on the telephone that she was pre-
pared to have her statement released.
                                                30

  In further discussion with the committee and others involved, it
has been determined that we will excuse temporarily Judge
Thomas and we will call momentarily as the witness Anita Hill.
Anita Hill will be sworn and will make her own statement in her
own words. At that time, we will begin the questioning of Professor
Hill, after which we will bring back Judge Thomas for questioning.

  Now, the committee will stand in recess until--and I imagine it
is only momentarily, until Professor Hill arrives. We will stand in
recess until she is able to take her seat, which should be a matter
of a minute or so.

  I am told that security is clearing the hall. She is in the hall, so
that she can come down.

  [Pause.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I will tell you what the procedure will be, while
your family and others are being seated. In a moment, I will ask
you to stand to be sworn. When that is finished, we will invite you
to make any statement that you wish to make, and then I will
begin by asking you some questions. Senator Specter will ask you
some questions, and then Senator Leahy will ask you some ques-
tions, and then I assume it will be Senator Specter again, but I am
not certain of that.
  Again, welcome. We are happy that you are here, and stand and
be sworn, if you will: Professor, are you prepared to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

   Ms. HILL. I do.

        TESTIMONY OF ANITA F. HILL, PROFESSOR OF LAW,
               UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA, NORMAN, OK

  The CHAIRMAN. Professor Hill, please make whatever statement
you would wish to make to the committee.

  Ms. HILL. Mr. Chairman
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me. I instruct the officers not to let
anyone in or out of that door while Professor Hill is making her
statement.
  Ms. HILL. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, members of the
committee, my name is Anita F. Hill, and I am a professor of law
at the University of Oklahoma.
  I was born on a farm in Okmulgee County, OK, in 1956. I am the
youngest of 13 children. I had my early education in Okmulgee
County. My father, Albert Hill, is a farmer in that area. My moth-
er's name is Erma Hill. She is also a farmer and a housewife.
  My childhood was one of a lot of hard work and not much
money, but it was one of solid family affection as represented by
my parents. I was reared in a religious atmosphere in the Baptist
faith, and I have been a member of the Antioch Baptist Church, in
Tulsa, OK, since 1983. It is a very warm part of my life at the
present time.

  For my undergraduate work, I went to Oklahoma State Universi-
ty, and graduated from there in 1977. I am attaching to the state-
ment a copy of my resume for further details of my education.

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be included in the record.
  Ms. HILL. Thank you.
  I graduated from the university with academic honors and pro-
ceeded to the Yale Law School, where I received my J.D. degree in
1980.
  Upon graduation from law school, I became a practicing lawyer
with the Washington, DC, firm of Wald, Harkrader & Ross. In
1981, I was introduced to now Judge Thomas by a mutual friend.
Judge Thomas told me that he was anticipating a political appoint-
ment and asked if I would be interested in working with him. He
was, in fact, appointed as Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil
Rights. After he had taken that post, he asked if I would become
his assistant, and I accepted that position.
  In my early period there, I had two major projects. First was an
article I wrote for Judge Thomas' signature on the education of mi-
nority students. The second was the organization of a seminar on
high-risk students, which was abandoned, because Judge Thomas
transferred to the EEOC, where he became the Chairman of that
office.
  During this period at the Department of Education, my working
relationship with Judge Thomas was positive. I had a good deal of
responsibility and independence. I thought he respected my work
and that he trusted my judgment.
  After approximately 3 months of working there, he asked me to
go out socially with him. What happened next and telling the
world about it are the two most difficult things, experiences of my
life. It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration and a
number of sleepless nights that I am able to talk of these unpleas-
ant matters to anyone but my close friends.
                                              37

  I declined the invitation to go out socially with him, and ex-
plained to him that I thought it would jeopardize what at the time
I considered to be a very good working relationship. I had a normal
social life with other men outside of the office. I believed then, as
now, that having a social relationship with a person who was su-
pervising my work would be ill advised. I was very uncomfortable
with the idea and told him so.

  I thought that by saying "no" and explaining my reasons, my
employer would abandon his social suggestions. However, to my
regret, in the following few weeks he continued to ask me out on
several occasions. He pressed me to justify my reasons for saying
"no" to him. These incidents took place in his office or mine. They
were in the form of private conversations which would not have
been overheard by anyone else.

  My working relationship became even more strained when Judge
Thomas began to use work situations to discuss sex. On these occa-
sions, he would call me into his office for reports on education
issues and projects or he might suggest that because of the time
pressures of his schedule, we go to lunch to a government cafeteria.
After a brief discussion of work, he would turn the conversation to
a discussion of sexual matters. His conversations were very vivid.

  He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films in-
volving such matters as women having sex with animals, and films
showing group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic
materials depicting individuals with large penises, or large breasts
involved in various sex acts.

  On several occasions Thomas told me graphically of his own
sexual prowess. Because I was extremely uncomfortable talking
about sex with him at all, and particularly in such a graphic way, I
told him that I did not want to talk about these subjects. I would
also try to change the subject to education matters or to nonsexual
personal matters, such as his background or his beliefs. My efforts
to change the subject were rarely successful.

  Throughout the period of these conversations, he also from time
to time asked me for social engagements. My reactions to these
conversations was to avoid them by limiting opportunities for us to
engage in extended conversations. This was difficult because at the
time, I was his only assistant at the Office of Education or Office
for Civil Rights.

  During the latter part of my time at the Department of Educa-
tion, the social pressures and any conversation of his offensive be-
havior ended. I began both to believe and hope that our working
relationship could be a proper, cordial, and professional one.

  When Judge Thomas was made chair of the EEOC, I needed to
face the question of whether to go with him. I was asked to do so
and I did. The work, itself, was interesting, and at that time, it ap-
peared that the sexual overtures, which had so troubled me, had
ended.

  I also faced the realistic fact that I had no alternative job. While
I might have gone back to private practice, perhaps in my old firm,
or at another, I was dedicated to civil rights work and my first
choice was to be in that field. Moreover, at that time the Depart-
ment of Education, itself, was a dubious venture. President Reagan
was seeking to abolish the entire department.
                                      38

  For my first months at the EEOC, where I continued to be an
assistant to Judge Thomas, there were no sexual conversations or
overtures. However, during the fall and winter of 1982, these began
again. The comments were random, and ranged from pressing me
about why I didn't go out with him, to remarks about my personal
appearance. I remember him saying that "some day I would have
to tell him the real reason that I wouldn't go out with him."

  He began to show displeasure in his tone and voice and his de-
meanor in his continued pressure for an explanation. He comment-
ed on what I was wearing in terms of whether it made me more or
less sexually attractive. The incidents occurred in his inner office
at the EEOC.

  One of the oddest episodes I remember was an occasion in which
Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office, he got up from the table,
at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke,
looked at the can and asked, "Who has put pubic hair on my
Coke?"

  On other occasions he referred to the size of his own penis as
being larger than normal and he also spoke on some occasions of
the pleasures he had given to women with oral sex. At this point,
late 1982,1 began to feel severe stress on the job. I began to be con-
cerned that Clarence Thomas might take out his anger with me by
degrading me or not giving me important assignments. I also
thought that he might find an excuse for dismissing me.

  In January 1983, I began looking for another job. I was handi-
capped because I feared that if he found out he might make it diffi-
cult for me to find other employment, and I might be dismissed
from the job I had.

  Another factor that made my search more difficult was that this
was during a period of a hiring freeze in the Government. In Feb-
ruary 1983,1 was hospitalized for 5 days on an emergency basis for
acute stomach pain which I attributed to stress on the job. Once
out of the hospital. I became more committed to find other employ-
ment and sought further to minimize my contact with Thomas.

  This became easier when Allyson Duncan became office director
because most of my work was then funneled through her and I had
contact with Clarence Thomas mostly in staff meetings.

  In the spring of 1983, an opportunity to teach at Oral Roberts
University opened up. I participated in a seminar, taught an after-
noon session in a seminar at Oral Roberts University. The dean of
the university saw me teaching and inquired as to whether I would
be interested in pursuing a career in teaching, beginning at Oral
Roberts University. I agreed to take the job, in large part, because
of my desire to escape the pressures I felt at the EEOC due to
Judge Thomas.

  When I informed him that I was leaving in July, I recall that his
response was that now, I would no longer have an excuse for not
going out with him. I told him that I still preferred not to do so. At
some time after that meeting, he asked if he could take me to
dinner at the end of the term. When I declined, he assured me that
the dinner was a professional courtesy only and not a social invita-
tion. I reluctantly agreed to accept that invitation but only if it was
at the very end of a working day.
                                      39

  On, as I recall, the last day of my employment at the EEOC in
the summer of 1983, I did have dinner with Clarence Thomas. We
went directly from work to a restaurant near the office. We talked
about the work that I had done both at Education and at the
EEOC. He told me that he was pleased with all of it except for an
article and speech that I had done for him while we were at the
Office for Civil Rights. Finally he made a comment that I will viv-
idly remember. He said, that if I ever told anyone of his behavior
that it would ruin his career. This was not an apology, nor was it
an explanation. That was his last remark about the possibility of
our going out, or reference to his behavior.

  In July 1983, I left the Washington, DC, area and have had mini-
mal contacts with Judge Clarence Thomas since. I am, of course,
aware from the press that some questions have been raised about
conversations I had with Judge Clarence Thomas after I left the
EEOC.

  From 1983 until today I have seen Judge Thomas only twice. On
one occasion I needed to get a reference from him and on another,
he made a public appearance at Tulsa. On one occasion he called
me at home and we had an inconsequential conversation. On one
occasion he called me without reaching me and I returned the call
without reaching him and nothing came of it. I have, at least on
three occasions been asked to act as a conduit to him for others.

  I knew his secretary, Diane Holt. We had worked together both
at EEOC and Education. There were occasions on which I spoke to
her and on some of these occasions, undoubtedly, I passed on some
casual comment to then, Chairman Thomas. There were a series of
calls in the first 3 months of 1985, occasioned by a group in Tulsa
which wished to have a civil rights conference. They wanted Judge
Thomas to be the speaker and enlisted my assistance for this pur-
pose.

  I did call in January and February to no effect and finally sug-
gested to the person directly involved, Susan Cahall, that she put
the matter into her own hands and call directly. She did so in
March 1985.

  In connection with that March invitation, Ms. Cahall wanted
conference materials for the seminar, and some research was
needed. I was asked to try and get the information and did attempt
to do so. There was another call about another possible conference
in July 1985.

  In August 1987, I was in Washington, DC, and I did call Diane
Holt. In the course of this conversation she asked me how long I
was going to be in town and I told her. It is recorded in the mes-
sages as August 15, it was, in fact, August 20. She told me about
Judge Thomas' marriage and I did say, congratulations.

  It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration that I am
able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone, except my clos-
est friends as I have said before. These last few days have been
very trying and very hard for me, and it hasn't just been the last
few days this week. It has actually been over a month now that I
have been under the strain of this issue. Telling the world is the
most difficult experience of my life, but it is very close to have to
live through the experience that occasioned this meeting. I may
have used poor judgment early on in my relationship with this
                                              40

issue. I was aware, however, that telling at any point in my career
could adversely affect my future career. And I did not want, early
on, to build all the bridges to the EEOC.

  As I said, I may have used poor judgment. Perhaps I should have
taken angry or even militant steps, both when I was in the agency
or after I had left it, but I must confess to the world that the
course that I took seemed the better, as well as the easier ap-
proach.

  I declined any comment to newspapers, but later when Senate
staff asked me about these matters, I felt that I had a duty to
report. I have no personal vendetta against Clarence Thomas. I
seek only to provide the committee with information which it may
regard as relevant.

  It would have been more comfortable to remain silent. It took no
initiative to inform anyone. I took no initiative to inform anyone.
But when I was asked by a representative of this committee to
report my experience I felt that I had to tell the truth. I could not
keep silent.

                                  Senate Judiciary Committee

                                           October 11, 1991

                          Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, Members of the
Committee, my name is Anita F. Hill, and I am a Professor of Law
at the University of Oklahoma. I was born on a farm in Okmulge,
Oklahoma in 1956, the 13th child, and had my early education
there. My father is Albert Hill, a farmer of that area. My
mother's name is Erma Hill, she is also a farmer and housewife.
My childhood was the childhood of both work and poverty; but it
was one of solid family affection as represented by my parents
who are with me as I appear here today. I was reared in a
religious atmosphere in the Baptist faith and I have been a
member of the Antioch Baptist Church in Tulsa since-1983. It
remains a warm part of my life at the present time.

                 For my undergraduate work I went to Oklahoma State
University and graduated in 1977. I am attaching to this
statement my resume with further details of my education. I
graduated from the university with academic honors and proceeded
to the Yale Law School where I received my J.D. degree in 1980.

                 Upon graduation from law school I became a practicing
lawyer with the Washington, D.C. firm of Wald, Harkrader & Ross.
In 1981, I was introduced to now Judge Thomas by a mutual friend.
Judge Thomas told me that he anticipated a political appointment
shortly and asked if I might be interested in working in that
                                      42

office. He was in fact appointed as Assistant Secretary of
Education, in which capacity he was the Director of the Office
for Civil Rights. After he was in that post, he asked if I would
become his assistant and I did then accept that position. In my
early period, there I had two major projects. The first was an
article I wrote for Judge Thomas' signature on Education of
Minority Students. The second was the organization of a seminar
on high risk students, which was abandoned because Judge Thomas
transferred to the EEOC before that project was completed.

                  During this period at the Department of Education, my
working relationship with Judge Thomas was positive. I had a
good deal of responsibility as well as independence. I thought
that he respected my work and that he trusted my judgment. After
approximately three months of working together, he asked me to go
out with him socially. I declined and explained to him that I
thought that it would only jeopardize what, at the time, I
considered to be a very good working relationship. I had a
normal social life with other men outside of the office and, I
believed then, as now, that having a social relationship with a
person who was supervising my work would be ill-advised. I was
very uncomfortable with the idea and told him so.

                  I thought that by saying "no" and explaining my
reasons, my employer would abandon his social suggestions.
However, to my regret, in the following few weeks he continued to
ask me out on several occasions. He pressed me to justify my
reasons for saying "no" to him. These incidents took place in
                                     43

his office or mine. They were in the form of private
conversations which would not have been overheard by anyone else.

                 My working relationship became even more strained when
Judge Thomas began to use work situations to discuss sex. On
these occasions he would call me into his office for reports on
education issues and projects or he might suggest that because of
time pressures we go to lunch at a government cafeteria. After a
brief discussion of work, he would turn the conversation to
discussion of sexual matters. His conversations were very vivid.
He spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films
involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films
showing group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic
materials depicting individuals with large penises or large
breasts involved in various sex acts. On several occasions
Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess.

                 Because I was extremely uncomfortable talking about sex
with him at all and particularly in such a graphic way, I told
him that I did not want to talk about those subjects. I would
also try to change the subject to education matters or to
nonsexual personal matters such as his background or beliefs. My
efforts to change the subject were rarely successful.

                 Throughout the period of these conversations, he also
from time-to-time asked me for social engagements. My reactions
to these conversations was to avoid having them by eliminating
opportunities for us to engage in extended conversations. This
was difficult because I was his only assistant at the Office for
                                      44

Civil Rights. During the latter part of my time at the
Department of Education, the social pressures and any
conversations of this offensive kind ended. I began both to
believe and hope that our working relationship could be on a
proper, cordial and professional base.

                  When Judge Thomas was made Chairman of the EEOC, I
needed to face the question of whether to go with him. I was
asked to do so. I did. The work itself was interesting and at
that time it appeared that the sexual overtures which had so
troubled me had ended. I also faced the realistic fact that I
had no alternative job. While I might have gone back to private
practice, perhaps in my old firm or at another, I was dedicated
to civil rights work and my first choice was to be in that field.
Moreover, the Department of Education itself was a dubious
venture; President Reagan was seeking to abolish the entire
Department at that time.

                 For my first months at the EEOC, where I continued as
an assistant to Judge Thomas, there were no sexual conversations
or overtures. However, during the Fall and Winter of 1982, these
began again. The comments were random and ranged from pressing
me about why I didn't go out with him to remarks about my
personal appearance. I remember his saying that someday I would
have to give him the real reason that I wouldn't go out with him.
He began to show real displeasure in his tone of voice, his
demeanor and his continued pressure for an explanation. He
commented on what I was wearing in terms of whether it made me
                                     45

more or less sexually attractive. The incidents occurred in his
inner office at the EEOC.

                 One of the oddest episodes I remember was an occasion
in which Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office. He got up
from the table at which weu/ere working, went over to his desk to
get the Coke, looked at the can, and said, "Who has put pubic
hair on my Coke?" On other occasions he referred to the size of
his own penis as being larger than normal and he also spoke on
some occasions of the pleasures he had given to women with oral
sex.

                 At this point, late 1982, I began to feel severe stress
on the job. I began to be concerned that Clarence Thomas might
take it out on me by downgrading me or not giving me important
assignments. I also thought that he might find an excuse for
dismissing me.

                  In January of 1983, I began looking for another job. I
was handicapped because I feared that if he found out, he might
make it difficult for me to find other employment and I might be
dismissed from the job I had. Another factor that made my search
more difficult was that this was a period of a government hiring
freeze. In February, 1983, I was hospitalized for five days on
an emergency basis for an acute stomach pain which I attributed
to stress on the job. Once out of the hospital, I became more
committed to find other employment and sought further to minimize
my contact with Thomas. This became easier when Allyson Duncan
became office director because most of my work was handled with
                                     46

her and I had contact with Clarence Thomas mostly in staff
meetings.

                  In the Spring of 1983, an opportunity to teach law at
Oral Roberts University opened up. I agreed to take the job in
large part because of my desire to escape the pressures I felt at
the EEOC due to Thomas. When I informed him that I was leaving
in July, I recall that his response was that now I "would no
longer have an excuse for not going out with" him. I told him
that I still preferred not to do so.

                  At some time after that meeting, he asked if he could
take me to dinnr.r at the end of my term. When I declined, he
assured me that the dinner was a professional courtesy only and
not a social invitation. I reluctantly agreed to accept that
invitation but only if it was at the very end of a workday. On,
as I recall, the last day of my employment at the EEOC in the
summer of 1983, I did have dinner with Clarence Thomas. We went
directly from work to a restaurant near the office. We talked
about the work I had done both at Education and at EEOC. He told
me that he was pleased with all of it except for an article and
speech that I done for him when we were at the Office for Civil
Rights. Finally, he made a comment which I vividly remember. He
said that if I ever told anyone about his behavior toward me it
could ruin his career. This was not an apology nor was there any
explanation. That was his last remark about the possibility of
our going out or reference to his behavior.
                                     47

                  In July 1983, I left the Washington, D.C. area and have
had minimal contacts with Judge Clarence Thomas since.

                  I am of course aware from the press that some question
has been raised about conversations I had with Judge Clarence
Thomas after I left the EEOC. From 1983 until today I have seen
Judge Clarence Thomas only twice. On one occasion I needed to
get a reference from him and on another he made a public
appearance in Tulsa. On one occasion he called me at home and we
had an inconsequential conversation. On one other occasion he
called me without reaching me and I returned the call without
reaching him and nothing came of it. I have, on at least three
occasions been asked to act as a conduit for others.

                  I knew his secretary, Diane Holt, well when I was with
the EEOC. There were occasions on which I spoke to her and on
some of those occasions undoubtedly I passed on some casual
comment to Thomas.

                 There was a series of calls in the first three months
of 1985 occasioned by a group in Tulsa which wished to have a
civil rights conference; they wanted Thomas to be the speaker,
and enlisted my assistance for this purpose. I did call in
January and February to no effect and finally suggested to the
person directly involved, Susan Cahall, that she put the matter
back into her own hands and call directly. She did do that in
March of 1985. In connection with that March invitation to Tulsa
by Ms. Cahall, which was for a seminar conference some research
was needed; I was asked to try to get the research work and did
                                     48

attempt to do so by a call to Thomas. There was another call
about another possible conference in July of 1985.

                  In August of 1987, I was in Washington and I did call
Diane Holt. In the course of this conversation she asked me how
long I was going to be in town and I told her; she recorded it as
a August 15; it was in fact August 20. She told me about Thomas'
marriage and I did say "congratulate him."

                  It is only after a great deal of agonizing
consideration that I am able to talk of these unpleasant matters
to anyone but my closest friends. Telling the world is the most
difficult experience of my life. I was aware that he could effect
my future career and did not wish to burn all my bridges. I may
have used poor judgment; perhaps I should have taken angry or
even militant steps both when I was in the agency or after I left
it, but I must confess to the world that the course I took seemed
to me to be the better as well as the easier approach. I
declined any comment to newspapers, but later, when Senate staff
asked me about these matters, I felt I had a duty to report. I
have no personal vendetta against Clarence Thomas. I seek only
to provide the Committee with information which it may regard as
relevant. It would have been more comfortable to remain silent.
I took no initiative to inform anyone. But when I was asked by a
representative of this committee to report my experience, I felt
that have had no other choice but to tell the truth.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much.
  Professor, before I begin my questioning, I notice there are a
number of people sitting behind you. Are any of them your family
members that you would like to introduce?
  Ms. HILL. Well, actually my family members have not arrived
yet. Yes, they have. They are outside the door, they were not here
for my statement.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will make room for your family to be able to
sit.
  Ms. HILL. It is a very large family, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we will begin but attempt to accommodate
as quietly as we can what may be an unusual arrangement. I
might ask, is everyone who is sitting behind you necessary? Maybe
they could stand and let your family sit. I would assume the reason
that--to make it clear--the reason that your family is not here at
the moment is that you did not anticipate coming. If those do not
need to be seated behind Miss Hill could stand with the rest of our
staffs, we could seat the family.
  We will try to get a few more chairs, if possible, but we should
get this underway. We may, at some point, Professor Hill, attempt
to accommodate either your counsel and/or your family members
with chairs down the side here. They need not all be up front here.
  Fine, we can put them in the back, as well.
  Now, there are two chairs on the end here, folks. We must get
this hearing moving. There are two chairs on the end here. We will
find everyone a seat but we must begin.
  Now, Professor Hill, at the risk of everyone behind you standing
up, would you be kind enough to introduce your primary family
members to us.
  Ms. HILL. I would like to introduce, first of all, my father, Albert
Hill.
  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Hill, welcome.
  Ms. HILL. My mother, Erma Hill.
  The CHAIRMAN. Mrs. Hill.
  Ms. HILL. My mother is going to be celebrating her 80th birthday
on the 16th.
  The CHAIRMAN. Happy birthday, in advance.
  Ms. HILL. My sister, my eldest sister, Elreatha Lee is here; my
sister Jo Ann Fennell, my sister Coleen Gilcrist, my sister Joyce
Baird.
  The CHAIRMAN. I welcome you all. I am sorry?
  Ms. HILL. My brother, Ray Hill.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Professor.
  Ms. HILL. I would also--I am sorry.
  The CHAIRMAN. Please?
  Ms. HILL. I would also like to introduce my counsel at this time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes; that would be appropriate.
  Ms. HILL. Mr. Gardner, Ms. Susan Roth, and Mr. Charles Ogel-
tree.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Now, professor, thank you for your statement and your introduc-
tions and I think it is important that the committee understand a
little more about your background and your work experience
                                                50

before we get into the specific allegations that you have made in
your statement.

  I understand, as you have just demonstrated, you come from a
large family and I have been told that you have indicated that you
are the youngest in the family, is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I am.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I assume, like all families, they have been
a great help and assistance to you. Let me ask you tell me again
your educational background for the record?

  Ms. HILL. I went to primary, elementary and secondary school in
Okmulge County, and Morris High School, Morris Jr. High and
Erim Grade School in reverse order. I went to Oklahoma State
University starting in 1973 and graduated in 1977 from Oklahoma
State University with a degree in psychology, and in 1977 I began
attending Yale Law School. I graduated, received my J.D. degree
from there in 1980.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, what was your first job after graduation
from law school?

  Ms. HILL. I worked at the firm of Wald, Harkrader & Ross.
  The CHAIRMAN. HOW did you acquire the job--that is a Washing-
ton law firm?
  Ms. HILL. That is a Washington, DC, law firm.
  The CHAIRMAN. And how did you acquire that job?
  Ms. HILL. Through the interviewing process. The first interview
took place at Yale Law School. I was interviewed for that job. I
don't remember the names of the interviewers. I was called to
Washington for an interview in the office, of Wald, Harkrader &
Ross, I was interviewed by a number of people and I accepted an
appointment with them.
  Now, I will say that that interview process was proceeded by
work that I had done with them as a summer associate, and so the
interview process the second time around was really, actually I will
say that the interview process took place before the summer associ-
ate and then at the end of that summer associateship I was asked
to work there full time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Who was your immediate supervisor when you
were at that law firm?
  Ms. HILL. Well, a number of individuals. I worked with a number
of different attorneys on different projects.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, it would the budget you we are working on?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, what type of work did you do while you
were at the law firm? Was it specialized, or did you do whatever
was asked by any of the partners?

  Ms. HILL. Well, since I worked there for only 1 year, I was a
fairly new associate, most of my work was basically what was
available and when I had time available to do it. However, I did
some Federal Trade work, I did some environmental law work
there, and I participated in the drafting of a manual on banking
law while I was there.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, did you decide you wanted to leave that
law firm, or was it suggested to you?

  Ms. HILL. It was never
                                      51

  The CHAIRMAN. Did someone approach you and say there's an-
other job you might like, or did you indicate that you would like to
leave the law firm to seek another job?

  Ms. HILL. I was interested in seeking other employment. It was
never suggested to me at the firm that I should leave the law firm
in any way.

  The CHAIRMAN. HOW old were you at this time?
  Ms. HILL. At the time, I was 24 years old.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, were you dissatisfied at the law firm? Why
did you want to leave?
  Ms. HILL. Well, I left the law firm because I wanted to pursue
other practice, in other practice other than basically the commer-
cial practice, civil practice that was being done at the law firm. I
was not dissatisfied with the quality of the work or the challenges
of the work. I thought that I would be more personally fulfilled if I
pursued other fields of the law.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, again, were you approached as to the op-
portunity at the Department of Education, or were you aware that
there was a potential opening and you sought it out?
  Ms. HILL. I spoke only with Clarence Thomas about the possibili-
ty of working at the
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me. How did you get to Clarence Thomas,
that is my question?
  Ms. HILL. I was introduced to him by a mutual friend.
  The CHAIRMAN. Was the mutual friend a member of the law firm
for which you worked?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, and his name is Gilbert Hardy. He was a member
of the firm for which I worked, Wald, Harkrader & Ross.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU had expressed to Mr. Hardy that you would
like to move into government or move out of the practice? Were
you specific in what you wanted to do?
  Ms. HILL. I told him only that I was interested in pursuing some-
thing other than private practice.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, some of the activities of the Office of Civil
Rights at the time were pretty controversial. We heard testimony,
in fact, about the fact the office was under court order to change
its practice for carrying out its duties, and some have suggested
that Mr. Thomas had done an exemplary job in changing things,
and some have suggested otherwise.
  Did the controversy surrounding the office detract from your in-
terest in taking this job, or did you consider it?
  Ms. HILL. I certainly considered it. I considered the fact that
there was talk about abolishing the office. I considered all of those
things, but I saw this as an opportunity to do some work that I
may not get at another time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you think this was as good job?
  Ms. HILL. Pardon me?
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you view this as a good job, or did you view
this as an intermediate step?
  Ms. HILL. I viewed it as a good job, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Can you describe for the committee your duties,
initial duties when you arrived at the Department of Education, in
the civil rights area? What were your duties?
                                      52

  Ms. HILL. My duties were really special projects and special re-
search. A lot of the special projects involved commenting on Office
for Civil Rights policies, it involved doing research on education
issues as they related to socioeconomic factors, and so forth.

  The CHAIRMAN. Was Judge Thomas your direct supervisor? Did
you report to anyone else but Judge Thomas at the time?

  Ms. HILL. I reported only to Judge Thomas.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, the Department of Education, your sole im-
mediate supervisor was Judge Thomas?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. And what was your title?
  Ms. HILL. Attorney adviser.
  The CHAIRMAN. Attorney adviser. Now, did you have reason to
interact with Judge Thomas in that capacity very often during the
day?
  Ms. HILL. We interacted regularly.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you attend meetings with Judge Thomas?
  Ms. HILL. I would attend some meetings, but not all of the meet-
ings that he attended.
  The CHAIRMAN. Perhaps you would be willing to describe to the
committee what a routine work day was at that phase of your
career in working with Judge Thomas.
  Ms. HILL. Well, it could--I am not sure there was any such thing
as a routine work day. Some days I would go in, I might be asked
to respond to letters that Judge Thomas had received, I might be
asked to look at memos that had come from the various offices in
the Office for Civil Rights.
  If there was as meeting which Judge Thomas needed to attend,
that he wanted someone there to take information or to help him
with information, I might be asked to do that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Where was your office physically located relative
to Judge Thomas' office?
  Ms. HILL. His office was set up down the hall from mine. Inside
his set of offices, there was a desk for his secretary and then his
office was behind a closed door. My office was down the hall, it was
separated from his office.
  The CHAIRMAN. Can you describe to us how it was that you came
to move over to the EEOC with Judge Thomas?
  Ms. HILL. Well, my understanding of--I did not have much
notice that Judge Thomas was moving over to the EEOC. My un-
derstanding from him at that time was that I could go with him to
the EEOC, that I did not have--since I was his special assistant,
that I did not have a position at the Office for Education, but that I
was welcome to go to the EEOC with him.
  It was as very tough decision, because this behavior occurred.
However, at the time that I went to the EEOC, there was as
period--or prior to the time we went to the EEOC, there was as
period where the incidents had ceased, and so after some consider-
ation of the job opportunities in the area, as well as the fact that I
was not assured that my job at Education was going to be protect-
ed, I made a decision to move to the EEOC.
  The CHAIRMAN. Were you not assured of that, because you were
a political appointee, or were you not assured of it because--tell me
why you felt you weren't assured of that.
                                                53

  Ms. HILL. Well, there were two reasons, really. One, I was a spe-
cial assistant of a political appointee, and, therefore, I assumed and
I was told that that position may not continue to exist. I didn't
know who was going to be taking over the position. I had not been
interviewed to become the special assistant of the new individual,
so I assumed they would want to hire their own, as Judge Thomas
had done.

  In addition, the Department of Education at that time was sched-
uled to be abolished. There had been a lot of talk about it, and at
that time it was truly considered to be on its way out, and so, for a
second reason, I could not be certain that I would have a position
there.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, when you moved over to EEOC, can you
recall for us, to the best of your ability, how that offer came about?
Did you inquire of Judge Thomas whether or not you could go to
EEOC? Did he suggest it? Do you recall?

  Ms. HILL. I recall that when the appointment at the EEOC
became firm, that I was called into his office, and I believe Diane
Holt was there, too, and

  The CHAIRMAN. Diane Holt, his personal secretary?
  Ms. HILL. Diane Holt was his secretary at Education. We were
there and he made the announcement about the appointment and
assured us that we could go to the EEOC with him.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, when you went to EEOC, what were your
duties there?
  Ms. HILL. Well, my duties were really varied, because it was a
much larger organization, there were so many more functions of
the organization, my primary duties were to be the liaison to the
Office of Congressional Affairs and the Office of Review and Ap-
peals, so that I reviewed a number of the cases that came up on
appeal, to make certain our office had given proper consideration, I
acted as a liaison to the press sometimes for the Chairman's office,
through Congressional Affairs and Public Relations.
  I had some additional responsibilities as special projects came
along.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you have as much occasion to interact per-
sonally with Judge Thomas at EEOC as you had with him at the
Department of Education?
  Ms. HILL. NO, no. We were much busier. We were all much
busier and the work that we did was work that did not necessarily
require as much interaction. A lot of times, at the Education De-
partment, the work required some--there were policy decisions
that were to be made and we were trying to do an evaluation of the
program, so there was more interaction at that time. At EEOC,
there were just projects that had to get out, and so there was less
of an opportunity for interaction.
  The CHAIRMAN. Who was your immediate supervisor at EEOC?
  Ms. HILL. At the EEOC, initially, Clarence Thomas was my im-
mediate supervisor. After a period, Allyson Duncan was appointed
to be the Director of the Staff. Initially, the staff consisted of two
special assistants, myself and Carleton Stewart. The staff eventual-
ly grew to a larger number of assistants, and Allyson Duncan was
brought up from the Legal Counsel's Office to take control of that
situation.
                                                54

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, how long were you at EEOC with Judge
Thomas before Allyson Duncan became the chief of staff?

  Ms. HILL. I don't recall.
  The CHAIRMAN. Once she became the chief of staff, was she the
person who gave you assignments most often and to whom you re-
ported most often?
  Ms. HILL. That's right. Occasionally, at the staff meeting assign-
ments would be given out, but that was held only 1 day a week, so
during the rest of the week when things came up, Allyson was in
charge of giving out assignments.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, did the Judge's chief of staff report directly
to him, or did she have an intermediate supervisor?
  Ms. HILL. NO, she reported directly to him, as I understand.
  The CHAIRMAN. Who prepared your performance evaluation?
  Ms. HILL. I understood that Judge Thomas prepared the perform-
ance evaluations.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did the chief of staff, to the best of your knowl-
edge, have the power to fire you?
  Ms. HILL. Not to my knowledge.
  The CHAIRMAN. Who had that power?
  Ms. HILL. Judge Thomas.
  The CHAIRMAN. Was there anyone else at EEOC that you believe
possessed that power?
  Ms. HILL. NO; not for that office.
  The CHAIRMAN. Was Judge Thomas still then your ultimate boss
and the boss of the entire office?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, was there any routine work day at EEOC
that you could describe for the committee?

  Ms. HILL. Actually, most of the work that we did, unlike at Edu-
cation, most of the work was responding to internal memos, instead
of responding to things that had come from outside. There were
many more of those, because there were many more offices, and so
each of us were responsible for a certain area, would respond to a
memo or write up a memo to be sent to the Chairman for his re-
sponse.

  We also had hearings and there was always a special assistant
who was assigned to sit in the Commission hearings, and so some
days, if we were having hearings, well, one of the special assist-
ants--very often it was me--would sit in the hearing to provide the
Chairman with information.

  During the days of the week that we were not having hearings,
we had to prepare the Chairman for the hearings themselves, so
that we had to go through the files on the hearings and the records
and brief the Chairman on those or write memos that briefed the
Chairman on them.

  The CHAIRMAN. Professor, you have testified that you had regu-
lar contact with Judge Thomas at the Department of Education
and you have just described the extent of your contact with Judge
Thomas at EEOC, and you have described your professional inter-
action with him.

  Now, I must ask you to describe once again, and more fully, the
behavior that you have alleged he engaged in while your boss,
which you say went beyond professional conventions, and which
                                                55

was unwelcome to you. Now, I know these are difficult to discuss,
but you must understand that we have to ask you about them.

  Professor, did some of the attempts at conversation you have de-
scribed in your opening statement occur in your office or in his
office?

  Ms. HILL. Some occurred in his office, some comments were made
in mine. Most often they were in his office.

  The CHAIRMAN. Did all of the behavior that you have described
to us in your written statement to the committee and your oral
statement now and what you have said to the FBI, did all of that
behavior take place at work?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, it did.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I would like you to go back
  Ms. HILL. Let me clarify that. If you are including a luncheon
during the workday to be at work, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am just trying to determine, it was what you
described and what you believe to be part of the workday?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I have to ask you where each of these
events occurred? If you can, to the best of your ability, I would like
you to recount for us where each of the incidents that you have
mentioned in your opening statement occurred, physically where
they occurred.

  Ms. HILL. Well, I remember two occasions these incidents oc-
curred at lunch in the cafeteria

  The CHAIRMAN. DO you remember which of those two incidents
were at lunch, professor?

   Ms. HILL. The

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask this, as an antecedent question: Were
you always alone when the alleged conversations would begin or
the alleged statements by Judge Thomas would begin?

  Ms. HILL. Well, when the incidents occurred in the cafeteria, we
were not alone. There were other people in the cafeteria, but be-
cause the way the tables were, there were few individuals who
were within the immediate area of the conversation.

  The CHAIRMAN. Of those incidents that occurred in places other
than in the cafeteria, which ones occurred in his office?

  Ms. HILL. Well, I recall specifically that the incident about the
Coke can occurred in his office at the EEOC.

  The CHAIRMAN. And what was that incident again?
  Ms. HILL. The incident with regard to the Coke can, that state-
ment?
  The CHAIRMAN. Once again for me, please?
  Ms. HILL. The incident involved his going to his desk, getting up
from a worktable, going to his desk, looking at this can and saying,
"Who put pubic hair on my Coke?"
  The CHAIRMAN. Was anyone else in his office at the time?

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  The CHAIRMAN. Was the door closed?
  Ms. HILL. I don't recall.
  The CHAIRMAN. Are there any other incidents that occurred in
his office?
                                  56

    Ms. HILL. I recall at least one instance in his office at the EEOC
where he discussed some pornographic material and he brought up
the substance or the content of pornographic material.
    The CHAIRMAN. Again, it is difficult, but for the record, what
substance did he bring up in this instance at EEOC in his office?
What was the content of what he said?
    Ms. HILL. This was a reference to an individual who had a very
large penis and he used the name that he had referred to in the
pornographic material
    The CHAIRMAN. DO you recall what it was?
    Ms. HILL. Yes; I do. The name that was referred to was Long
John Silver.
    The CHAIRMAN. Were you working on any matter in that con-
text, or were you just called into the office? Do you remember the
circumstances of your being in the office on that occasion?
    Ms. HILL. Very often, I went in to report on memos that I had
written. I'm sure that's why I was in the office. What happened
generally was that I would write a note to Clarence Thomas and he
would call me in to talk about what I had written to him, and I
believe that's what happened on that occasion.

    The CHAIRMAN. Let S go back to the first time that you alleged
Judge Thomas indicated he had more than a professional interest
in you. Do you recall what the first time was and, with as much
precision as you can, what he said to you?
    Ms.          AS I recall, it  either happened at lunch   uorarite  happened
in  his  HILL.   when he said     to me, very casually, "y°            to go out

         office
with me some time."
    The CHAIRMAN. YOU ought to or you are to?
    Ms. HILL. YOU ought to.
    The CHAIRMAN. Was that the extent of that incident?
    Ms. HILL. That was the extent of that incident. At that incident,
I declined and at that incident I think he may have said something
about, you know, he didn't understand why I didn't want to go out
with him, and the conversation may have ended.
    The CHAIRMAN. Would you describe for the committee how you
felt when he asked you out? What was your reaction?
    Ms. HILL. Well, my reaction at that time was a little surprised,
because I had not indicated to him in any way that I was interest-
ed in dating him. We had developed a good working relationship; it
was cordial and it was very comfortable, so I was surprised that he
was interested in something else.
    The CHAIRMAN. With regard to the other incidents--and my time
is running down, and I will come back to them--but with regard to
the other incidents that you mentioned in your opening statement,
can you tell us how you felt at the time? Were you uncomfortable,
were you embarrassed, did it not concern you? How did you feel
about it?
    Ms. HILL. The pressure to go out with him I felt embarrassed
about because I had given him an explanation, that I thought it
was not good for me, as an employee, working directly for him, to
go out. I thought he did not take seriously my decision to say no,
and that he did not respect my having said no, to him.
    I--the conversations about sex, I was much more embarrassed
and humiliated by. The two combined really made me feel sort of
                                              57

helpless in a job situation because I really wanted to do the work
that I was doing; I enjoyed that work. But I felt that that was
being put in jeopardy by the other things that were going on in the
office. And so, I was really, really very troubled by it and distressed
over it.

  The CHAIRMAN. Can you tell the committee what was the most
embarrassing of all the incidents that you have alleged?

  Ms. HILL. I think the one that was the most embarrassing was
this discussion of pornography involving women with large breasts
and engaged in a variety of sex with different people, or animals.
That was the thing that embarrassed me the most and made me
feel the most humiliated.

  The CHAIRMAN. If you can, in his words--not yours--in his
words, can you tell us what, on that occasion, he said to you? You
have described the essence of the conversation. In order for us to
determine--well, can you tell us, in his words, what he said?

  Ms. HILL. I really cannot quote him verbatim. I can remember
something like, you really ought to see these films that I have seen
or this material that I have seen. This woman has this kind of
breasts or breasts that measure this size, and they got her in there
with all kinds of things, she is doing all kinds of different sex acts.
And, you know, that kind of, those were the kinds of words. Where
he expressed his enjoyment of it, and seemed to try to encourage
me to enjoy that kind of material, as well.

  The CHAIRMAN. Did he indicate why he thought you should see
this material?

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  The CHAIRMAN. Why do you think, what was your reaction, why
do you think he was saying these things to you?

  Ms. HILL. Well, coupled with the pressures about going out with
him, I felt that implicit in this discussion about sex was the offer to
have sex with him, not just to go out with him. There was never
any explicit thing about going out to dinner or going to a particu-
lar concert or movie, it was, "we ought to go out" and given his
other conversations I took that to mean, we ought to have sex or
we ought to look at these pornographic movies together.

  The CHAIRMAN. Professor, at your press conference, one of your
press conferences, you said that the issue that you raised about
Judge Thomas was "an ugly issue". Is that how you viewed these
conversations?

   Ms. HILL. Yes. They were very ugly. They were very dirty. They
were disgusting.

  The CHAIRMAN. Were any one of these conversations--this will
be my last question, my time is up--were any one of these conver-
sations, other than being asked repeatedly to go out, were any one
of them repeated more than once? The same conversation, the ref-
erence to

   Ms. HILL. The reference to his own physical attributes was re-
peated more than once, yes.

   The CHAIRMAN. NOW, again, for the record, did he just say I have
great physical attributes or was he more graphic?

   Ms. HILL. He was much more graphic.
   The CHAIRMAN. Can you tell us what he said?

       56-273 O--93-
                                                58

  Ms. HILL. Well, I can tell you that he compared his penis size, he
measured his penis in terms of length, those kinds of comments.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  My time is up, under our agreement. By the way, I might state
once again that we have agreed to go back and forth in half-hour
conversation on each side; when the principals have finished
asking questions, those members who have not been designated to
ask questions, since all have been keenly involved and interested in
this on both sides, will have an opportunity to ask questions for 5
minutes.
  But let me now yield to my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator
Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Hill, I have been asked to question you by Senator
Thurmond, the ranking Republican, but I do not regard this as an
adversary proceeding.
  Ms. HILL. Thank you.
  Senator SPECTER. My duties run to the people of Pennsylvania,
who have elected me, and in the broader sense, as a U.S. Senator
to constitutional government and the Constitution.
  My purpose, as is the purpose of the hearing, generally, is to find
out what happened.
  Ms. HILL. Certainly.
  Senator SPECTER. We obviously have a matter of enormous im-
portance from a lot of points of view. The integrity of the Court is
very important. It is very important that the Supreme Court not
have any member who is tainted or have a cloud. In our society we
can accept unfavorable decisions from the Court if we think they
are fairly arrived at.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, excuse me for interrupting but some of
our colleagues on this end, cannot hear you. Can you pull that
closer? I know that makes it cumbersome.
  Senator SPECTER. I have tried carefully to avoid that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, it worked.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU can hear me all right, can you not, Profes-
sor Hill?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I can.

  Senator SPECTER. OK. But I was just saying, about the impor-
tance of the Court where there should be a feeling of confidence
and fairness with the decisions, as we parties can take unfavorable
decisions if they think they are being treated fairly. I think this
hearing is very important to the Senate and to this committee, be-
cause by 20-20 hindsight we should have done this before. And ob-
viously it is of critical importance to Judge Thomas, and you,
whose reputations and careers are on the line.

  It is not easy to go back to events which happened almost a
decade ago to find out what happened. It is very, very difficult to
do. I would start, Professor Hill, with one of your more recent
statements, at least according to a man by the name of Carl Stew-
art, who says that he met you in August of this year. He said that
he ran into you at the American Bar Association Convention in At-
lanta, where Professor Hill stated to him in the presence of Stanley
Grayson, "How great Clarence's nomination was, and how much he
deserved it."
                                      59

  He said you went on to discuss Judge Thomas and our tenure at
EEOC for an additional 30 minutes or so. There was no mention of
sexual harassment or anything negative about Judge Thomas. He
stated that during that conversation. There is also a statement
from Stanley Grayson corroborating what Carlton Stewart has
said.

  My question is, did Mr. Stewart accurately state what happened
with you at that meeting?

  Ms. HILL. AS I recall at that meeting, I did see Carlton Stewart
and we did discuss the nomination. Carlton Stewart was very excit-
ed about the nomination. And said, I believe that those are his
words, how great it was that Clarence Thomas had been nominat-
ed. I only said that it was a great opportunity for Clarence Thomas.
I did not say that it was a good thing, this nomination was a good
thing.

  I might add that I have spoken to newspaper reporters and have
gone on record as saying that I have some doubts and some ques-
tions about the nomination. I, however, in that conversation where
I was faced with an individual who was elated about the probabil-
ities of his friend being on the Supreme Court, I did not want to
insult him or argue with him at that time about the issue. I was
very passive in the conversation.

  Senator SPECTER. Excuse me?
  Ms. HILL. I was very passive in the conversation.
  Senator SPECTER. SO that Mr. Stewart and Mr. Grayson are
simply wrong when they say, and this is a quotation from Mr.
Stewart that you said, specifically, "how great his nomination was,
and how much he deserved it." They are just wrong?
  Ms. HILL. The latter part is certainly wrong. I did say that it is a
great opportunity for Clarence Thomas. I did not say that he de-
served it.
  Senator SPECTER. We have a statement from former dean of Oral
Roberts Law School, Roger Tuttle, who quotes you as making laud-
atory comments about Judge Thomas, that he "is a fine man and
an excellent legal scholar." In the course of 3 years when Dean
Tuttle knew you at the law school, that you had always praised
him and had never made any derogatory comments. Is Dean Tuttle
correct?
  Ms. HILL. During the time that I was at Oral Roberts University
I realized that Charles Kothe, who was a founding dean of that
school, had very high regards for Clarence Thomas. I did not risk
talking in disparaging ways about Clarence Thomas at that time.
  I don't recall any specific conversations about Clarence Thomas
in which I said anything about his legal scholarship. I do not really
know of his legal scholarship, certainly at that time.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I can understand it if you did not say
anything, but Dean Tuttle makes the specific statement. His words
are, that you said, "The most laudatory comments."
  Ms. HILL. I have no response to that because I do not know exact-
ly what he is saying.
  Senator SPECTER. There is a question about Phyllis Barry who
was quoted in the New York Times on October 7, "In an interview
Ms. Barry suggested that the allegations," referring to your allega-
                                              60

tions, "were the result of Ms. Hill's disappointment and frustration
that Mr. Thomas did not show any sexual interest in her."

  You were asked about Ms. Barry at the interview on October 9
and were reported to have said, "Well, I don't know Phyllis Barry
and she doesn't know me." And there are quite a few people who
have come forward to say that they saw you and Ms. Barry togeth-
er and that you knew each other very well.

  Ms. HILL. I would disagree with that. Ms. Barry worked at the
EEOC. She did attend some staff meetings at the EEOC. We were
not close friends. We did not socialize together and she has no basis
for making a comment about my social interests, with regard to
Clarence Thomas or anyone else.

  I might add, that at the time that I had an active social life and
that I was involved with other people.

  Senator SPECTER. Did Ms. Anna Jenkins and Ms. J.C. Alvarez,
who both have provided statements attesting to the relationship be-
tween you and Ms. Barry, a friendly one. Where Ms. Barry would
have known you, were both Ms. Jenkins and Ms. Alvarez cowork-
ers in a position to observe your relationship with Ms. Barry?

  Ms. HILL. They were both workers at the EEOC. I can only say
that they were commenting on our relationship in the office. It was
cordial and friendly. We were not unfriendly with each other, but
we were not social acquaintances. We were professional acquaint-
ances.

  Senator SPECTER. SO that when you said, Ms. Barry doesn't know
me and I don't know her, you weren't referring to just that, but
some intensity of knowledge?

  Ms. HILL. Well, this is a specific remark about my sexual inter-
est. And I think one has to know another person very well to make
those kinds of remarks unless they are very openly expressed.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, did Ms. Barry observe you and Judge
Thomas together in the EEOC office?

  Ms. HILL. Yes, at staff meetings where she attended and at the
office, yes.

  Senator SPECTER. Let me pick up on Senator Biden's line of ques-
tioning. You referred to the "oddest episode I remember" then
talked the Coke incident. When you made your statement to the
FBI, why was it that that was omitted if it were so strong in your
mind and such an odd incident?

  Ms. HILL. I spoke to the FBI agent and I told them the nature of
comments, and did not tell them more specifics. I referred to the
specific comments that were in my statement.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, when you talked to the FBI agents, you
did make specific allegations about specific sexual statements made
by Judge Thomas.

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. SO that your statement to the FBI did have spe-
cifics.

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. And my question to you, why, if this was such
an odd episode, was it not included when you talked to the FBI?

  Ms. HILL. I do not know.
  Senator SPECTER. I would like you to take a look, if you would, at
your own statement in the first full paragraph of page 5, on the
                                      61

last line and ask you why that was not included in your statement
to the FBI?

  Ms. HILL. Excuse me, my copy is not--would you refer to that
passage again?

  Senator SPECTER. Yes, of course.
  Referring to page 5 of the statement which you provided to the
committee, there is a strong allegation in the last sentence. My
question to you is, why did you not tell that to the FBI?
  Ms. HILL. When the FBI investigation took place I tried to
answer their questions as directly as I recall. I was very uncomfort-
able talking to the agent about that, these incidents, I am very un-
comfortable now, but I feel that it is necessary. The FBI agent told
me that it was regular procedure to come back and ask for more
specifics if it was necessary. And so, at that time, I did not provide
all of the specifics that I could have.
  Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, I can understand that it is un-
comfortable and I don't want to add to that. If any of it--if there is
something you want to pause about, please do.
  You testified this morning, in response to Senator Biden, that
the most embarrassing question involved--this is not too bad--
women's large breasts. That is a word we use all the time. That
was the most embarrassing aspect of what Judge Thomas had said
to you.
  Ms. HILL. NO. The most embarrassing aspect was his description
of the acts of these individuals, these women, the acts that those
particular people would engage in. It wasn't just the breasts; it was
the continuation of his story about what happened in those films
with the people with this characteristic, physical characteristic.
  Senator SPECTER. With the physical characteristic of
  Ms. HILL. The large breasts.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, in your statement to the FBI you did
refer to the films but there is no reference to the physical charac-
teristic you describe. I don't want to attach too much weight to it,
but I had thought you said that the aspect of large breasts was the
aspect that concerned you, and that was missing from the state-
ment to the FBI.
  Ms. HILL. I have been misunderstood. It wasn't the physical char-
acteristic of having large breasts. It was the description of the acts
that this person with this characteristic would do, the act that they
would engage in, group acts with animals, things of that nature in-
volving women.
  Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, I would like you now to turn to
page 3 of your statement that you submitted to the committee, that
we got just this morning. In the last sentence in the first full para-
graph, you again make in that statement a very serious allegation
as to Judge Thomas, and I would ask you why you didn't tell the
FBI about that when they interviewed you.
  Ms. HILL. I suppose my response would be the same. I did not tell
the FBI all of the information. The FBI agent made clear that if I
were embarrassed about talking about something, that I could de-
cline to discuss things that were too embarrassing, but that I could
provide as much information as I felt comfortable with at that
time.
                                                     62

  Senator SPECTER. Well, now, did you decline to discuss with the
FBI anything on the grounds that it was too embarrassing?

  Ms. HILL. There were no particular questions that were asked.
He asked me to describe the kinds of incidents that had occurred
as graphically as I could without being embarrassed. I did not ex-
plain everything. I agree that all of this was not disclosed in the
FBI investigation.

  Senator SPECTER. Was it easier for you because one of the FBI
agents was a woman, or did you ask at any time that you give the
statements to her alone in the absence of the man FBI agent?

  Ms. HILL. NO, I did not do that. I didn't ask to disclose. I just--I
did not.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I understand from what you are saying
now that you were told that you didn't have to say anything if it
was too embarrassing for you. My question to you is, did you use
that at any point to decline to give any information on the ground
that it was too embarrassing?

  Ms. HILL. I never declined to answer a question because it was
too embarrassing, no. He asked me to describe the incidents, and
rather than decline to make any statement at all, I described them
to my level of comfort.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you described a fair number of things in
the FBI statement, but I come back now to the last sentence on
page 3 in the first full paragraph, because it is a strong allegation.
You have said that you had not omitted that because of its being
embarrassing. You might have said even something embarrassing
to the female agent. My question to you is, why was that omitted?

  Ms. HILL. Senator, at the time of the FBI investigation, I cooper-
ated as fully as I could at that time, and I cannot explain why any-
thing in specific was not stated.

  Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, you testified that you drew an
inference that Judge Thomas might want you to look at porno-
graphic films, but you told the FBI specifically that he never asked
you to watch the films. Is that correct?

  Ms. HILL. He never said, "Let's go to my apartment and watch
films," or "go to my house and watch films." He did say, "You
ought to see this material."

  Senator SPECTER. But when you testified that, as I wrote it down,
"We ought to look at pornographic movies together," that was an
expression of what was in your mind when he

  Ms. HILL. That was the inference that I drew, yes.
  Senator SPECTER. The inference, so he
  Ms. HILL. With his pressing me for social engagements, yes.
  Senator SPECTER. That that was something he might have
wanted you to do, but the fact is, flatly, he never asked you to look
at pornographic movies with him.
  Ms. HILL. With him? No, he did not.
  The CHAIRMAN. Will the Senator yield for one moment for a
point of clarification?
  Senator SPECTER. I would rather not.
  The CHAIRMAN. TO determine whether or not the witness ever
saw the FBI report. Does she know what was stated by the FBI
about her comments?
                                              63

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Mr. Chairman, I am asking her about
what she said to the FBI.

  The CHAIRMAN. I understand. I am just asking that.
  Have you ever seen the FBI report?
  Ms. HILL. NO; I have not.
  The CHAIRMAN. Would you like to take a few moments and look
at it now?
  Ms. HILL. Yes; I would.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Let's make a copy of the FBI report. I think
we have to be careful. Senator Grassley asked me to make sure--
maybe you could continue--it only pertains to her. We are not at
liberty to give to her what the FBI said about other individuals.
  Senator SPECTER. I was asking Professor Hill about the FBI
report.
  Obviously because the portion I am questioning you about relates
to their recording what you said, and I think it is fair, one lawyer
to another, to ask about it.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I would continue, because you are not asking
her directly. I just wanted to know whether or not her responses
were at all based upon her knowledge of what the FBI said she
said. That is all I was asking.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, she has asked to see it, and I think it is a
fair request, and I would be glad to take a moment's delay to
  The CHAIRMAN. This is the FBI report as it references Professor
Hill, only Professor Hill.
  Senator SPECTER. May we stop the clock, Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, we will. We will turn the clock back and
give the Senator additional time. I will not ask how long to turn it
back. I will leave that decision to Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. I will be watching the clock. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
  [Pause.]
  The CHAIRMAN. That was not to hurry you along, Professor. That
was to ask for silence in the room.
  The only point I wish to make is that you know what is in the
report and understand that the report is a summary of your con-
versation, not a transcription of your conversation.
  [Pause.]
  The CHAIRMAN. While we have this momentary break, the Sena-
tor has 10 or more minutes remaining, and at the conclusion of his
questioning we will recess for lunch for an hour and then begin
with Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. At what time?
  The CHAIRMAN. Whatever, an hour from the time we end.
  Senator LEAHY. I see. I'm sorry, I didn't hear that part. Thank
you.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Have you had a chance to peruse it?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Ms. HILL. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW I apologize to my colleague for the interrup-
tion.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                                    64

   Professor Hill, now that you have read the FBI report, you can
see that it contains no reference to any mention of Judge Thomas'
private parts or sexual prowess or size, et cetera. My question to
you would be, on something that is as important as it is in your
written testimony and in your responses to Senator Biden, why
didn't you tell the FBI about that?

   Ms. HILL. Senator, in paragraph 2 on page 2 of the report it says
that he liked to discuss specific sex acts and frequency of sex. And
I am not sure what all that summarizes, but his sexual prowess,
his sexual preferences, could have

   Senator SPECTER. Which line are you referring to, Professor?
  Ms. HILL. The very last line in paragraph 2 of page 2.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, that says--and this is not too bad, I can
read it--"Thomas liked to discuss specific sex acts and frequency of
sex." Now are you saying, in response to my question as to why
you didn't tell the FBI about the size of his private parts and his
sexual prowess and "Long John Silver." That information was com-
prehended within the statement, "Thomas liked to discuss specific
sex acts and frequency of sex"?
  Ms. HILL. I am not saying that that information was included in
that. I don't know that it was. I don't believe that I even men-
tioned the latter information to the FBI agent, and I c^uid only re-
spond again that at the time of the investigation I tried to cooper-
ate as fully as I could, to recall information to answer the ques-
tions that they asked.
  Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, you said that you took it to
mean that Judge Thomas wanted to have sex with you, but in fact
he never did ask you to have sex, correct?
  Ms. HILL. NO, he did not ask me to have sex. He did continually
pressure me to go out with him, continually, and he would not
accept my explanation as being valid.
  Senator SPECTER. SO that when you said you took it to mean,
"We ought to have sex," that that was an inference that you drew?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, yes.

  Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, the USA Today reported on Oc-
tober 9,

  Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers her signed affidavit alleging sexual harass-
ment by Clarence Thomas would be the instrument that "quietly and behind the
scenes" would force him to withdraw his name.

  Was USA Today correct on that, attributing it to a man named
Mr. Keith Henderson, a 10-year friend of Hill and former Senate
Judiciary Committee staffer?

  Ms. HILL. I do not recall. I guess--did I say that? I don't under-
stand who said what in that quotation.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, let me go on. He said,

  Keith Henderson, a 10-year friend of Hill and former Senate Judiciary Committee
staffer, says Hill was advised by Senate staffers that her charge would be kept
secret and her name kept from public scrutiny.

  Apparently referring again to Mr. Henderson's statement, "they
would approach Judge Thomas with the information and he would
withdraw and not turn this into a big story, Henderson says."

  Did anybody ever tell you that, by providing the statement, that
there would be a move to request Judge Thomas to withdraw his
nomination?
                                                65

  Ms. HILL. I don't recall any story about pressing, using this to
press anyone.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, do you recall anything at all about any-
thing related to that?

  Ms. HILL. I think that I was told that my statement would be
shown to Judge Thomas, and I agreed to that.

  Senator SPECTER. But was there any suggestion, however slight,
that the statement with these serious charges would result in a
withdrawal so that it wouldn't have to be necessary for your identi-
ty to be known or for you to come forward under circumstances
like these?

  Ms. HILL. There was--no, not that I recall. I don't recall any-
thing being said about him being pressed to resign.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, this would only have happened in the
course of the past month or so, because all this started just in early
September.

  Ms. HILL. I understand.
  Senator SPECTER. SO that when you say you don't recall, I would
ask you to search your memory on this point, and perhaps we
might begin--and this is an important subject--about the initiation
of this entire matter with respect to the Senate staffers who talked
to you. But that is going to be too long for the few minutes that I
have left, so I would just ask you once again, and you say you don't
recollect, whether there was anything at all said to you by anyone
that, as USA Today reports, that just by having the allegations of
sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas, that it would be the in-
strument that "quietly and behind the scenes" would force him to
withdraw his name. Is there anything related to that in any way
whatsoever?
  Ms. HILL. The only thing that I can think of, and if you will
check, there were a lot of phone conversations. We were discussing
this matter very carefully, and at some point there might have
been a conversation about what might happen.
  Senator SPECTER. Might have been?
  Ms. HILL. There might have been, but that wasn't--I don't re-
member this specific kind of comment about "quietly and behind
the scenes" pressing him to withdraw.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, aside from "quietly and behind the
scenes" pressing him to withdraw, any suggestion that just the
charges themselves, in writing, would result in Judge Thomas with-
drawing, going away?
  Ms. HILL. NO, no. I don't recall that at all, no.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, you started to say that there might have
been some conversation, and it seemed to me
  Ms. HILL. There might have been some conversation about what
could possibly occur.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, tell me about that conversation.
  Ms. HILL. Well, I can't really tell you any more than what I have
said. I discussed what the alternatives were, what might happen
with this affidavit that I submitted. We talked about the possibility
of the Senate committee coming back for more information. We
talked about the possibility of the FBI, asking, going to the FBI
and getting more information; some questions from individual Sen-
                                                66

ators. I just, the statement that you are referring to, I really can't
verify.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, when you talk about the Senate coming
back for more information or the FBI coming back for more infor-
mation or Senators coming back for more information, that has
nothing to do at all with Judge Thomas withdrawing. When you
testified a few moments ago that there might possibly have been a
conversation, in response to my question about a possible with-
drawal, I would press you on that, Professor Hill, in this context:
You have testified with some specificity about what happened 10
years ago. I would ask you to press your recollection as to what
happened within the last month.

  Ms. HILL. And I have done that, Senator, and I don't recall that
comment. I do recall that there might have been some suggestion
that if the FBI did the investigation, that the Senate might get in-
volved, that there may be--that a number of things might occur,
but I really, I have to be honest with you, I cannot verify the state-
ment that you are asking me to verify. There is not really more
that I can tell you on that.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, when you say a number of things might
occur, what sort of things?

  Ms. HILL. May I just add this one thing?
  Senator SPECTER. Sure.
  Ms. HILL. The nature of that kind of conversation that you are
talking about is very different from the nature of the conversation
that I recall. The conversations that I recall were much more vivid.
They were more explicit. The conversations that I have had with
the staff over the last few days in particular have become much
more blurry, but these are vivid events that I recall from even 8
years ago when they happened, and they are going to stand out
much more in my mind than a telephone conversation. They were
one-on-one, personal conversations, as a matter of fact, and that
adds to why they are much more easily recalled. I am sure that
there are some comments that I do not recall the exact nature of
from that period, as well, but these that are here are the ones that
I do recall.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Professor Hill, I can understand why you
say that these comments, alleged comments, would stand out in
your mind, and we have gone over those. I don't want to go over
them again. But when you talk about the withdrawal of a Supreme
Court nominee, you are talking about something that is very, very
vivid, stark, and you are talking about something that occurred
vithin the past 4 or 5 weeks, and my question goes to a very dra-
matic and important event. If a mere allegation would pressure a
nominee to withdraw from the Supreme Court, I would suggest to
you that that is not something that wouldn't stick in a mind for 4
or 5 weeks, if it happened.
  Ms. HILL. Well, Senator, I would suggest to you that for me these
are more than mere allegations, so that if that comment were
made--these are the truth to me, these comments are the truth to
me--and if it were made, then I may not respond to it in the same
way that you do.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I am not questioning your statement
when I use the word "allegation" to refer to 10 years ago. I just
                                                67

don't want to talk about it as a fact because so far that is some-
thing we have to decide, so I am not stressing that aspect of the
question. I do with respect to the time period, but the point that I
would come back to for just 1 more minute would be--well, let me
ask it to you this way.

   Ms. HILL. OK.

  Senator SPECTER. Would you not consider it a matter of real im-
portance if someone said to you, "Professor, you won't have to go
public. Your name won't have to be disclosed. You won't have to do
anything. Just sign the affidavit and this," as the USA Today
report, would be the instrument that "quietly and behind the
scenes" would force him to withdraw his name. Now I am not
asking you whether it happened. I am asking you now only, if it
did happen, whether that would be the kind of a statement to you
which would be important and impressed upon you, that you would
remember in the course of 4 or 5 weeks.

  Ms. HILL. I don't recall a specific statement, and I cannot say
whether that comment would have stuck in my mind. I really
cannot say that.

  Senator SPECTER. The sequence with the staffers is very involved,
so I am going to move to another subject now, but I want to come
back to this. Over the luncheon break, I would ask you to think
about it further, if there is any way you can shed any further light
on that question, because I think it is an important one.

  Ms. HILL. OK. Thank you.
  Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, the next subject I want to take
up with you involves the kind of strong language which you say
Judge Thomas used in a very unique setting, where there you have
the Chairman of the EEOC, the Nation's chief law enforcement of-
ficer on sexual harassment, and here you have a lawyer who is an
expert in this field, later goes on to teach civil rights and has a
dedication to making sure that women are not discriminated
against. If you take the single issue of discrimination against
women, the Chairman of the EEOC has a more important role on
that question even than a Supreme Court Justice--a Supreme
Court Justice is a more important position overall, than if you
focus just on sexual harassment.
  The testimony that you described here today depicts a circum-
stance where the Chairman of the EEOC is blatant, as you describe
it, and my question is: Understanding the fact that you are 25 and
that you are shortly out of law school and the pressures that exist
in this world--and I know about it to a fair extent. I used to be a
district attorney and I know about sexual harassment and discrimi-
nation against women and I think I have some sensitivity on it--
but even considering all of that, given your own expert standing
and the fact that here you have the chief law enforcement officer
of the country on this subject and the whole purpose of the civil
right law is being perverted right in the office of the Chairman
with one of his own female subordinates, what went through your
mind, if anything, on whether you ought to come forward at that
stage? If you had, you would have stopped this man from being
head of the EEOC perhaps for another decade. What went on
through your mind? I know you decided not to make a complaint,
but did you give that any consideration, and, if so, how could you
                                          68

allow this kind of reprehensible conduct to go on right in the head-
quarters, without doing something about it?

  Ms. HILL. Well, it was a very trying and difficult decision for me
not to say anything further. I can only say that when I made the
decision to just withdraw from the situation and not press a claim
or charge against him, that I may have shirked a duty, a responsi-
bility that I had, and to that extent I confess that I am very sorry
that I did not do something or say something, but at the time that
was my best judgment. Maybe it was a poor judgment, but it
wasn't dishonest and it wasn't a completely unreasonable choice
that I made, given the circumstances.

  Senator SPECTER. My red light is on. Thank you very much, Pro-
fessor Hill.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Thank you, Professor Hill.
  We will adjourn until 2:15 p.m. We will reconvene at 2:15 p.m.
  [Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m., the committee was recessed, to recon-
vene at 2:15 p.m., the same day.]

                                      AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order.
  Welcome back, Professor Hill.
  The Chair now yields to the Senator from Vermont, Senator
Leahy, who will question for one-half hour, and then we will go
back to Senator Specter.
  Senator LEAHY. Good afternoon, Professor Hill.
  Ms. HILL. Good afternoon, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. Professor, we have had a number of discussions,
almost shorthand discussions here, about things you are familiar
with and which members of the committee are familiar with, but I
would like to take you through a couple of the spots.
  You have mentioned--and there were discussions and answers
from you regarding the FBI investigation--would you tell us, was it
one FBI agent, two FBI agents? How many spoke to you and
where?
  Ms. HILL. There were two FBI agents who visited me in my
home.
  Senator LEAHY. HOW was that arranged? Just focus on the me-
chanics, please.
  Ms. HILL. Well, it was arranged, as I understand it, through Sen-
ator Biden's office. I received a phone call from one of the staff
members of Senator Biden and she informed me that she had--
excuse me, the date was September 23--she informed me that she
had received a fax from me of my statement and that I should
expect a call from the FBI.
  When the FBI called, they called me at home, left a message on
my machine, I returned their phone call that evening after work
and arranged for them to come over immediately from Oklahoma
City, I believe, to talk with me.
  Senator LEAHY. That evening?
  Ms. HILL. That evening, on Monday, September 23.
  Senator LEAHY. About what time did they arrive?
                                          69

  Ms. HILL. They arrived at about 6:30.
  Senator LEAHY. And who arrived?
  Ms. HILL. Inspector Luddin and--there was one inspector named
Inspector Luddin, and I don't recall the name of the other individ-
ual.
  Senator LEAHY. One male and one female?
  Ms. HILL. And one female.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, was anybody else present for that inter-
view?
  Ms. HILL. NO, no one else was present.
  Senator LEAHY. It was just the three of you?
  Ms. HILL. The three of us; yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Did they tape record the interview?
  Ms. HILL. NO; one inspector did take notes.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, what did they tell you they wanted?
  Ms. HILL. They told me that they had been contacted by the com-
mittee, the Judiciary Committee, and that they wanted informa-
tion regarding the statement that I had made to the committee.
  Senator LEAHY. Did they have that statement with them?
  Ms. HILL. I do not believe that they had the statement with
them. It was clear from the questioning that they had read the
statement, and I believe at one point in the evening Inspector
Luddin did say that he had read the statement.

  Senator LEAHY. When you made that statement, you had it typed
up and you signed it, is that correct?

  Ms. HILL. I typed it and I signed it.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU typed and signed it, and kept a copy for
yourself?
  Ms. HILL. I only telefaxed a copy. I did keep a copy, the original.
  Senator LEAHY. And you still have that?
  Ms. HILL. I still have it.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you given copies of that, other than the
copy you telefaxed, to anybody else?
  Ms. HILL. Well, I shared the statement with my counsel.
  Senator LEAHY. Let's make sure I have this well in mind: You
have the original copy, correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. And you telefaxed a copy which, in itself, made
copies to the committee, is that correct?

  Ms. HILL. Pardon me?
  Senator LEAHY. YOU faxed a copy to the committee, is that cor-
rect?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. YOU gave a copy to your counsel?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. Did you give a copy to anybody else?
  Ms. HILL. Other than counsel? I don't believe that I gave a copy
to anyone else.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU did not give a copy to the FBI agents?
  Ms. HILL. NO; they told me that they had received a copy from
the committee.
  Senator LEAHY. Did you give a copy to any member of the press?

   Ms. HILL. NO; I did not.
                                              70

  Senator LEAHY. And so your counsel, the faxed copy, and your
own copy are the only ones that you have had control of, is that
correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. NOW, did the FBI give any indication to you of
how you should answer--in great detail, little detail? How was the
interview done?

  Ms. HILL. Well, the interview was conducted, the indication that
I had from the agents was that they would like to take as much
information as they could, that they wanted as much as I felt com-
fortable giving. The questions that were asked were fairly general,
in terms of what kinds of comments were made.

  Senator LEAHY. Did they--go ahead. I didn't mean to cut you off.
  Ms. HILL. NO, that's fine.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, in your statement that they told you they
had, in that statement you were fairly specific about the kind of
sexual discussions that you said Judge Thomas had with you, is
that correct, Professor?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I felt that I was fairly specific.
  Senator LEAHY. Did they refer to that specificity when they
talked with you?
  Ms. HILL. I'm sorry?
  Senator LEAHY. Did the FBI agents refer to that specificity when
they talked with you?
  Ms. HILL. They simply said that if I got to any point with regard
to being specific that made me uncomfortable, that I should with-
draw from the conversation or I could perhaps give the information
to the female agent who was there. They did not indicate that my
comments were not specific enough or that they needed more infor-
mation.
  Senator LEAHY. Did they say that they might come back and talk
with you again?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, he almost assured me that he would come back.
  Senator LEAHY. But did they?
  Ms. HILL. In fact, they did not come back. I did receive a phone
call the next day to verify two names of persons that I had given
them, but they did not return for more information.
  Senator LEAHY. And has anybody come back to talk with you
since then?
  Ms. HILL. From the FBI?
  Senator LEAHY. From the FBI.
  Ms. HILL. NO, I have not spoken with the FBI since then.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, you had a chance to read their report
about you this morning, did you not?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I did.

  Senator LEAHY. If you could just bear with me a moment, I want
to read--do you have that before you?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I do.

  Senator LEAHY. Would you turn to the part of the FBI report--
and someone is getting me a copy now, as I do not have one--turn
to the part where you have reference to the last time or the time
you went out to dinner with Judge Thomas. Do you know the one I
am referring to?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.
                                          71

  Senator LEAHY. I believe it is on the second--let's see, now--yes,
on page 4, is a line that, according to the FBI report, "Hill stated
that when she left EEOC, Thomas took her out to eat." Do you find
that paragraph, Professor Hill?

  Ms. HILL. I'm sorry, what page are you referring to?
  Senator LEAHY. On page 3 of your report, you see the paragraph
which begins--I think it is one, two, three, four, five paragraphs
down, "Hill stated that when she left EEOC, Thomas took her out
to eat."

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. Would you read the rest of that sentence, please?
  Ms. HILL. "Took her out to eat and told her that if she ever told
anyone about their conversation, he would ruin her career."
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, is that precisely the way it is in your state-
ment?
  Ms. HILL. That is not precisely the way it is in my statement.
That is not what I told the FBI agents.
  Senator LEAHY. And what did you tell the FBI agents?
  Ms. HILL. I told the FBI agent that he said that it would ruin his
career.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, the FBI agents, did they ask you to give
them any written statement of any sort?
  Ms. HILL. NO, they didn't ask for any written statement.
  Senator LEAHY. Did they ask if you would be willing to come to
Washington to talk with them?
  Ms. HILL. They didn't ask that.
  Senator LEAHY. Did they ask if there was anything else you
might be willing to do?
  Ms. HILL. NO, they didn't mention anything farther, except for
coming back for additional questioning.
  Senator LEAHY. Did they ask you if you would be willing to take
a polygraph?
  Ms. HILL. They asked if I would be willing to take a polygraph.
  Senator LEAHY. And what did you say?
  Ms. HILL. I answered, "yes."
  Senator LEAHY. Let us go to that last meal discussion. It is your
statement that the FBI misunderstood you and, as you have said in
each of your statements, that Judge Thomas said that if this came
out, it would ruin his career, not that he would ruin your career?
  Ms. HILL. Exactly.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you. Where did you go for dinner that
time?
  Ms. HILL. I do not recall the restaurant, the name of the restau-
rant.
  Senator LEAHY. Was it nearby or
  Ms. HILL. It was nearby work.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you remember the type of restaurant?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I don't. It wasn't anything that was memorable to
me, the type of food that we had.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you remember how you got there?
  Ms. HILL. I believe that the driver for Chairman Thomas or then
Chairman Thomas took us, Mr. Randall, and dropped us off at the
restaurant.
  Senator LEAHY. And you went right from the office?
                                              72

  Ms. HILL. Went from the office.
  Senator LEAHY. After dinner, how did you get home?
  Ms. HILL. I took the subway home, if I recall correctly. As I am
recalling--I'm not sure how I got home.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you recall whether then Chairman Thomas
offered you a ride home?
  Ms. HILL. NO, he did not offer me a ride home.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you know whether his car came to pick him
up?
  Ms. HILL. I don't know how he got home, either.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you recall approximately how long a time
this was? Was this a case where you had to stand in line a long
time to get a table or anything like that?
  Ms. HILL. NO, we walked right into the restaurant and sat down.
I imagine that it was about an hour all-told.
  Senator LEAHY. Did you have cocktails?
  Ms. HILL. I did not have a cocktail.
  Senator LEAHY. Anything alcoholic?
  Ms. HILL. I don't recall having anything alcoholic.
  Senator LEAHY. HOW long into the meal did the conversation you
discussed come up? How long were you into the meal before the
conversation you have just described came up?

  Ms. HILL. I believe it was about--it was well into the meal,
maybe mid-way, half-way or beyond.

  Senator LEAHY. And what did you say in response?
  Ms. HILL. My response was that I really just wanted to get away
from the office and leave that kind of activity behind me.
  Senator LEAHY. Did he ask you if you intended to ever make this
public?

  Ms. HILL. He did not ask me that.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU have discussed somewhat earlier here today
why you did not come forward with these allegations before. Had
you come forward with them, at the time of your employment,
either at the Department of Education or at the EEOC, what would
have been the mechanism to come forward with the allegations?

  Ms. HILL. I do not know of my own knowledge. I have been told
or I have heard suggested that the oversight committee would have
been the proper authority to deal with such an issue.

  Senator LEAHY. Oversight within the department or here on the
Hill?

  Ms. HILL. NO, here on the Hill, the congressional oversight com-
mittee that had oversight over the EEOC. But I don't know that, I
just heard that.

   Senator LEAHY. Did you at any time consider going somewhere,
wherever the appropriate place might be, to make this public?

   Ms. HILL. I considered it, but I really at the time did not clearly
think out exactly where I would go.

   Senator LEAHY. Had you come forward, what do you think would
have happened?

   Ms. HILL. Well, I can speculate that it might have been diffi-
cult--I can speculate that, had I come forward immediately after I
left the EEOC, I can speculate that I would have lost my job at
Oral Roberts.
                                                    73

  Senator LEAHY. Professor Hill, this morning, Judge Thomas testi-
fied before this committee--and I don't know if you saw his testi-
mony or not

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I did.

  Senator LEAHY. Let me read from his statement. He said.

  I cannot imagine anything that I said or did to Anita Hill could have been mistak-
en for sexual harassment. With that said, if there is anything that I have said that
has been misconstrued by Anita Hill or anyone else to be sexual harassment, then I
can say that I am so very sorry and I wish I had known. If I did know, I would have
stopped immediately and I would not, as I have done over the past two weeks, had
to tear away at myself trying to think what I could possibly have done, but I have
not said or done the things that Anita Hill has alleged.

  You are aware of that statement by Judge Thomas?
  Ms. HILL. I am aware.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you agree with that? Do you agree with his
statement?
  Ms. HILL. DO I agree with his statement?
  Senator LEAHY. Yes.

   Ms. HILL. NO, I do not.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, let us go through in summary. What are
the things that you felt he should have known were sexual harass-
ment?

  Ms. HILL. Well, starting with the insisting on dates, I believe
that once I had given a response to the question about dating, that
my answer showed him that any further insisting was unwarrant-
ed and not desired by me.

  I believe that the conversations about sex and the constant pres-
suring about dating which I objected to, both of which I objected to,
were a basis--there was enough for him to understand that I was
unappreciative and did not desire the kind of attention in the
workplace. I think that my constantly saying to him that I was
afraid, because he was in a supervisory position, that this would
jeopardize my ability to do my job, that that should have given him
notice.

   Senator LEAHY. Did he ask you--well, you have said that he
asked you for dates many times. By many, what do you mean? Can
you give us even a ball park figure?

   Ms. HILL. Oh, I would say over the course of
   Senator LEAHY. Of both the Department of Education and the
EEOC.
   Ms. HILL. I would say 10 times, maybe, I don't know, 5 to 10
times.
   Senator LEAHY. And you said, no, each time?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

   Senator LEAHY. With the exception of the departure dinner to
which you have just testified here?

   Ms. HILL. That was not a date and I made clear that it was not
considered to be a date.

   Senator LEAHY. And on that occasion, while you rode to the res-
taurant with him, you did not leave the restaurant with him? I
mean you did not go

   Ms. HILL. NO, I did not.

   Senator LEAHY. YOU took the subway home.
                                                    74

  Now, you said you made it clear to him about the discussions of
pornography and all, that you did not like what he was saying, is
that a fair statement of yours?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, it is.

  Senator LEAHY. Were these often or ever, these discussions of
pornography or sexual acts, co-terminus with a request to go out on
a date? I mean did they come up in the same conversation or was
one of them one day and one of them the next?

  Ms. HILL. I cannot say that they came up in the same conversa-
tion.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, let's go back to this. You said that he had
described pornographic movies to you, is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. And explicitly described them?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. When that happened, what would you say or
what would you do?

  Ms. HILL. I would say, specifically with the pornographic movies
or material, I would say that I am really not interested in discuss-
ing this, I am uncomfortable with your talking about this, the kind
of material that is--I would prefer not to discuss this with you.

  Senator LEAHY. YOU would be that clear about it. Would the dis-
cussions end when you said that? I mean for that occasion?

  Ms. HILL. Yes, for that occasion, very often they would. Some-
times I would have to say it more than once. But, yes, they would.

  Senator LEAHY. Did you ever hear him say this to anybody else?
  Ms. HILL. These kinds of
  Senator LEAHY. Yes.
  Ms. HILL. I did not hear it.
  Senator LEAHY. Did anybody ever tell you that he did?
  Ms. HILL. NO, no one ever told me that he did the same with
them.
  Senator LEAHY. Did he say these things to you in your office, at
any time?
  Ms. HILL. There might have been some occasion when he said it
in my office.
  Senator LEAHY. But you do recollect him saying it to you in his
office?

  -Ms; HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. Was that a big office or a small office, for either
of the two jobs he had?

  Ms. HILL. Well, I think they were relatively, both were relatively
large offices. I remember the EEOC setup a little bit more clearly. I
was there longer, but they were both large offices.

  Senator LEAHY. Did you, at some time when he was saying it,
say, "Look, I don't want to hear about this," and just walk out the
door?

  Ms. HILL. There were times when I would just walk away. If I
were in a situation, like I could get up from his office and just
leave, yes.

  Senator LEAHY. Did he ever try to stop you from going out of the
office?

  Ms. HILL. NO, he did not, not physically.
                                                    75

  Senator LEAHY. In any fashion, like saying, "Don't go any fur-
ther?"

  Ms. HILL. Oh, no, he might have said, don't go or, you know, OK.
  Senator LEAHY. What you mentioned happening in a cafeteria--
were people within earshot? Was there anybody within earshot
when it happened in the cafeteria?
  Ms. HILL. NO, not that I could see anyway. There might have
been somebody within ear shot.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, you testified to this today. You have given
a statement that we have referred to. You discussed it with the
FBI. Let's go back more to a time contemporaneous with when this
happened. Did you discuss it with anybody at that time?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I did.

  Senator LEAHY. And with whom did you discuss it at that time?
  Ms. HILL. Well, Sue Hoerchner, I did discuss it with Sue
Hoerchner, she was a friend of mine and someone I confided in.
And I spoke with of this to two other people also.
  Senator LEAHY. Let's talk about Ms. Hoerchner. Was that when
you were at EEOC or the Department of Education?
  Ms. HILL. That was at Education, I believe.
  Senator LEAHY. And what was your relationship to her, was it as
a coworker or
  Ms. HILL. NO, she was not a coworker at Education. We had
never worked together. She was a friend from law school.
  Senator LEAHY. HOW often did you discuss it with her?
  Ms. HILL. Maybe once or twice. Not, we did not discuss it very
often. I can't say exactly how many times.
  Senator LEAHY. What was the nature of your discussion with
her?
  Ms. HILL. Well, I was upset about the behavior. And that's what
I was expressing to her as a friend, that it was upsetting and that I
wanted it to stop and maybe even asked for advice or something to
help me out of the situation.

  Senator LEAHY. And did she offer advice?
  Ms. HILL. I don't recall her offering any advice. I am not sure,
exactly sure, what she said. I think she offered more comfort, be-
cause she knew I was upset.

  Senator LEAHY. And did you discuss it with somebody else?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I have discussed it with other people.
  Senator LEAHY. At that time?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, at that time.
  Senator LEAHY. And who was that, Professor?
  Ms. HILL. I discussed it, in passing, well, no, not in passing. I dis-
cussed it with Ellen Wells, who is another female friend. She and I
were close during the time and we had a conversation, in particu-
lar, we were talking about what I should do, how I should respond
to it, what might make it stop happening.
  At the time, in addition, I was dating someone, John Carr, and
we discussed it because I was, I was upset by it. And I wanted to let
him know why I was upset and again, just trying to see if there
might be some way that he could handle this differently.
  Senator LEAHY. And did he give you a recommendation?
  Ms. HILL. I don't recall whether he did.
                                                76

  Senator LEAHY. YOU said when you talked to Ms.--was there
anybody else that you recall?

  Ms. HILL. At this point, I don't recall.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU said when you talked with Ms. Hoerchner,
you were very concerned and upset, and that is why you did. De-
scribe to us how you felt when this happened.
  Ms. HILL. Well, I was really upset. I felt like my job could be
taken away or at least threatened. That I wasn't going to able to
work. That this person who had some power in the new adminis-
tration would make it difficult for me in terms of other positions. I,
it really, it was threatening from the job, in terms of my job, but it
was also just unpleasant and something that I didn't want to have
to deal with.
  And it wasn't as though it happened every day but I went to
work, during certain periods, knowing that it might happen.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU said in your statement that at one point you
were hospitalized for 5 days. Am I correct in understanding your
statement, you felt it was related to this?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I do believe that it was related to the stress that I
felt because of this.
  Senator LEAHY. Had you ever had a similar hospitalization?
  Ms. HILL. I had never had a similar hospitalization.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, when you think back on this, you described
how you felt at the time, how do you feel about it today?
  Ms. HILL. Well, I am a little farther removed from it in time, but
even today I still feel hurt and maybe today I feel more angry and
disgusted. I don't feel quite as threatened. The situation, I am re-
moved from it. My career is on solid ground and so the threat is
not there. But the anger and hurt is there.
  Senator LEAHY. In your statement you had said that between
1981 and 1983 you spoke to only one person about these incidents--
Susan Hoerchner and you have talked about two others now. Is
there a contradiction there?
  Ms. HILL. Well, in my statement I do say that I only spoke with
one person. That is all that I recalled at the time that I made the
statement. I am finding that, I am recalling more about the situa-
tion. I really am finding that I repressed a lot of the things that
happened during that time, and I am recalling more, in more
detail.
  When I made the statement too, I might add, that I made it
rather hurriedly and even though I had been thinking about the
situation, I had not perhaps given all of the consideration in terms
of who I had told that I should have for such a statement.
  Senator LEAHY. Since this began, for whatever series of reasons,
there has been discussion and debate about how all of this came
about, and this has become a most public matter. You cannot get
much more public than the situation we are in right now.
  And Judge Thomas has been up for confirmation on other occa-
sions. Did you think, on any of those other occasions, about coming
forward and giving, in effect, the same testimony that you are
giving here today?
  Ms. HILL. I may have considered it, but I was not contacted in
those confirmation hearings. And I did not come forward on my
own in that confirmation hearing, the most recent one.
                                                77

  Senator LEAHY. YOU mean this one?
  Ms. HILL. Not this one, but the prior one.
  Senator LEAHY. Had you been contacted in the prior one?
  Ms. HILL. I had not been contacted in the prior one.
  Senator LEAHY. But you were contacted in this one?
  Ms. HILL. I was contacted in this one, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. I realize--and my time is virtually up--this re-
quires speculation and you can or cannot answer as you see fit, but
had you not been contacted would you have come forward on this
occasion?
  Ms. HILL. I cannot say that I would have.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I have a lot more questions, but
my time is up and I will stop there.
  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will give you an opportunity, Senator, to
complete those.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. We now recognize the Senator from Pennsylva-
nia, Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Hill, there is a report in the Kansas City Star of Octo-
ber 8, 1991, that says in an August interview with the Kansas City
Star, Anita Hill offered some favorable comments regarding Clar-
ence Thomas and some criticism. And then further on it says, quot-
ing you, "judicial experience aside, the Clarence Thomas of that
period"--referring to his days in EEOC early--"would have made a
better judge on the Supreme Court because he was more open-
minded."
  Now, how is it that you would have said that Judge Thomas, in
his early days at EEOC would have made a better judge, at least
an adequate judge, considering all of the things you have said that
he told you about, at the Department of Education and also at
EEOC?
  Ms. HILL. That opinion, Senator, was based strictly on his experi-
ence, his ability to reason. It was not based on personal informa-
tion which I did not see fit to share with that reporter. I was trying
to give as objective an opinion as possible and that's what that
statement is based on.
  In addition, very early on, I believe I was commenting on his
time at Education. Very early on at Education I was not experienc-
ing the kinds of things that I later experienced with Judge
Thomas.
  Senator SPECTER. But when you make a statement in August
1991 and say, that "judicial experience aside, the Clarence Thomas
of that period would have made a better judge on the Supreme
Court because he was more open-minded" you are making a com-
parison as to what Judge Thomas felt judicially early on before he
changed his views on affirmative action. So that is the reference to,
at that period.
  But when you say that Judge Thomas would have made a better
Supreme Court Justice, you are saying that, at one stage of his
career, he would have made an adequate Supreme Court Justice.
  Ms. HILL. Well, I am not sure that that's what I am saying at all.
I am sure that what I was trying to give to that reporter was my
                                                78

assessment of him objectively without considering the personal in-
formation that I had. Now, if I had said to him, I don't think he
would have made a good judge because of personal information
that I have, then I think I would have had to explain that or at
least created some innuendo that I was not ready to create.

  In addition, I think as a university professor, quoted as a univer-
sity professor you have some obligation to try to make objective
statements. And that's what I was doing. I was attempting to make
an objective statement about the individual based on his record as
a public figure and I was not relying on my own private under-
standing and knowledge.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, let's take it the way you have just re-ex-
plained it. An objective evaluation, without considering personal
information, as a law school professor to make a comment, on his
record as a public figure. How could you conclude, in any respect,
that he would be appropriate for the Court even if you say that
was without considering the personal information, if you had all of
this personal information?

  Ms. HILL. I did not say that he would be appropriate for the
Court, Senator. I said that he would make a better judge. I did not
say that I would consider him the best person for the Supreme
Court.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, when you say he would have made a
better judge at one point, are you saying that there is not an ex-
plicit recommendation or statement that, as you said earlier, on
the basis of his intellect, aside from the personal information that
you decided not to share, that he would have been a better Su-
preme Court Justice?

  Ms. HILL. I am sorry, would you rephrase that?
  Senator SPECTER. Sure. Isn't the long and short of it, Professor
Hill, that when you spoke to the Kansas City Star reporter, that
you were saying, at one point in his career he would have been OK
for the Supreme Court?

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  [Pause.]
  Senator SPECTER. What were you saying as to Judge Thomas'
qualifications for the Supreme Court when you spoke to the report-
er in August?
  Ms. HILL. We were speaking in terms of his being openminded.
One of the comments that the reporter made was that some have
complained that he has a set ideology and that he won't be able to
review cases on their own. My comment went to whether or not he
did have that set ideology and it was that now he did, whereas a
few years ago, I did not find that to be so.
  I found him to be more openminded. So in that sense, I believe
that he was better suited for a judicial position at that time, than
now. And that's all that I was referring to, that particular com-
ment or my concern about the nominee's qualifications for being
on the Court.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, it is certainly true, Professor Hill, that
your statement has a comparative that Judge Thomas would have
been a better judge of the Supreme Court at an earlier point in his
career, but if you stand on your statement that this interview does
                                          79

not contain a recommendation for Judge Thomas, so be it. Is that
your position?

  Ms. HILL. Yes, it does, that is my position.
  Senator SPECTER. Did you ever maintain any notes or written
memoranda of the comments that Judge Thomas had made to you?

   Ms. HILL. NO, I did not.

  Senator SPECTER. In your statement and in your testimony, here,
today, you have said that you were concerned that "Judge Thomas
might take it out on me by downgrading me, or by not giving me
important assignments. I also thought that he might find an excuse
for dismissing me."

  As an experienced attorney and as someone who was in the field
of handling sexual harassment cases, didn't it cross your mind that
if you needed to defend yourself from what you anticipated he
might do that your evidentiary position would be much stronger if
you had made some notes?

   Ms. HILL. NO, it did not.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, why not?
  Ms. HILL. I don't know why it didn't cross my mind.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, the law of evidence is that notes are very
important. You are nodding yes. Present recollection refreshed,
right?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, indeed.
  Senator SPECTER. Prior recollection recorded, right?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. In a controversy, if Judge Thomas took some
action against you, and you had to defend yourself on the ground
that he was being malicious in retaliation for your turning him
down, wouldn't those notes be very influential if not determinative
in enabling you to establish your legal position?

  Ms. HILL. I think they would be very influential, yes.
  Senator SPECTER. SO, given your experience, if all this happened,
since all this happened, why not make the notes?
  Ms. HILL. Well, it might have been a good choice to make the
notes. I did not do it, though. Maybe I made the wrong choice in
not making the notes. I am not a person--I was not interested in
any litigation. I was not interested. If I had been dismissed, very
likely I would have just gone out and tried to find another job. I
was not interested in filing a claim against him, and perhaps that
is why it did not occur to me to make notes about it.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I am not on the point of your being inter-
ested in making a claim. What I am on the point of is your state-
ment that you were concerned that he might take retaliatory
action against you, and therefore the inference arises that the
notes would have been something which would have been done by
an experienced lawyer.
  Ms. HILL. One of the things that I did do at that time was to doc-
ument my work. I went through very meticulously with every as-
signment that I was given. This was, this really was in response to
the concerns that I had about being fired. I went through, I logged
in every work assignment that I received, the date that it was re-
ceived, the action that was requested, the action that I took on it,
the date that it went out, so I did do that in order to protect
                                              80

myself, but I did not write down any of the comments or conversa-
tions.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, when you comment about documenting
your work to protect yourself because of concern of being fired,
wouldn't the same precise thought about documentation have led
you to document Judge Thomas' statements to you?

  Ms. HILL. Well, I was documenting my work so that I could show
to a new employer that I had in fact done these things. I was not
documenting my work so that I could defend myself or to present a
claim against him.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, why would you need to document with
precision the time the assignment came in and the time you com-
pleted the work for a new employer? Wouldn't that kind of docu-
mentation really relate to the adequacy and speed of your work at
EEOC, contrasted with a finished product which you could show to
a new prospective employer?

  Ms. HILL. I'm sorry. I don't quite understand your question. Are
you saying that the new employer would not be interested in know-
ing whether or not I turned my work around quickly?

  Senator SPECTER. What is the relevancy as to when you got the
assignment and how fast you made it, for a new employer?

  Ms. HILL. Because it goes to whether or not I was slow in turning
around the work product in a very fast-paced job situation.

  Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, as you know, the statute of limi-
tations for filing a case on sexual harassment is 180 days, right?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. A very short statute of limitations because of
the difficulty of someone defending against a charge of sexual har-
assment, right?

  Ms. HILL. Well, it is a short turnover time. I am not quite sure
exactly why it is that short. That is one of the reasons that it is so
short.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you are an expert in the field. Delaware
State College v. Ricks, 101 Supreme Court Reporter, in 1980, John-
son v. Railway Express Agency, 421 U.S. Reports, comment about
the short period of limitations because of the difficulty of defending
against a charge of sexual harassment.

  Ms. HILL. Yes, but I don't believe either of those cases say that
that is the only reason. And let me clarify something: I consider
myself to be an expert in contracts and commercial law, not an
expert in the field of sexual harassment or EEO law. I don't even
teach in that area any more.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you did teach civil rights law?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, at one point.
   Senator SPECTER. YOU taught civil rights law after 1980, right?
   Ms. HILL. Yes, I have.
   Senator SPECTER. Well, all right, it is one of the reasons for
having a short period of limitations, to give someone an opportuni-
ty to defend himself against a charge of sexual harassment because
they are hard to defend.
   Ms. HILL. Certainly.
   Senator SPECTER. The statute of limitations in a contract case is
6 years?
   Ms. HILL. Well, in some States.
                                          81

  Senator SPECTER. Some States, 6 years?
  Ms. HILL. The statute of limitations is not set. It is not a set
thing. It varies from State to State.
  Senator SPECTER. The Federal statute of limitations on crimes is
5 years?
  Ms. HILL. I am not a criminal expert. I don't know.
  Senator SPECTER. DO you know of any statute of limitations
which is as short as 6 months, besides sexual harassment cases?
  Ms. HILL. DO I know of any?
  Senator SPECTER. Yes.
  Ms. HILL. NO, not offhand.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, in the context of the Federal law limiting
a sexual harassment claim to 6 months because of the grave diffi-
culty of someone defending themselves in this context, what is your
view of the fairness of asking Judge Thomas to reply 8, 9, 10 years
after the fact?
  Ms. HILL. I don't believe it is unfair. I think that that is some-
thing that you have to take into account in evaluating his com-
ments.
  Senator SPECTER. I had asked you this morning, Professor Hill,
about a statement which was made by Ms. Barry, and I had asked
you then in the context of your saying that she didn't know you
and you didn't know her. You then expanded that to say that she
didn't know your social life, but you did say that she had an oppor-
tunity to observe you and Judge Thomas at EEOC. I want to come
back to that for just a moment, because the New York Times says
this: "In an interview, Ms. Barry suggested that the allegations
were a result of Ms. Hill's disappointment and frustration that Mr.
Thomas did not show any sexual interest in her."

   Now, aside from saying that Ms. Barry doesn't know about you on
the social side, what about the substance of what Ms. Barry had to
say?

   Ms. HILL. What exactly are you asking me?
   Senator SPECTER. Well, I will repeat the question again.
   Was there any substance in Ms. Barry's flat statement that, "Ms.
Hill was disappointed and frustrated that Mr. Thomas did not
show any sexual interest in her"?
   Ms. HILL. NO, there is not. There is no substance to that. He did
show interest, and I have explained to you how he did show that
interest. Now she was not aware of that. If you are asking me,
could she have made that statement, she could have made the
statement if she wasn't aware of it. But she wasn't aware of every-
thing that happened.

   Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, do you know a man by the name
of John Doggett?

   Ms. HILL. Pardon me?
   Senator SPECTER. A man by the name of John Doggett?
  Ms. HILL. John Doggett?
  Senator SPECTER. John Doggett III.
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I have met him.
  Senator SPECTER. I ask you this, Professor Hill, in the context of
whether you have any motivation as to Judge Thomas. What was
your relationship with Mr. Doggett?
  Ms. HILL. I don't recall. I do not recall. We were friends, but I
don't--it wasn't anything. I just don't know.
                                              82

  Senator SPECTER. Well, before I pursue this question, I will give
you a copy of his statement, give you an opportunity to read it
before I ask you about that, and I will do that at a break.

  Ms. HILL. Thank you.
  Senator SPECTER. HOW close were you to Dean Charles Kothe of
the Oral Roberts Law School?
  Ms. HILL. He was the dean of the law school. I was there for a
year. I believe he was the dean for a year while I was there. We
worked together.
  Senator SPECTER. One of the comments which was made by Dean
Kothe related to your voluntarily driving Judge Thomas to the air-
port on an occasion when he came to speak at Oral Roberts Law
School. My question is that in a context where you had responded
to some people who asked you to make inquiries of Judge Thomas,
in a context of his having said these things to you as you represent,
being violations of the Civil Rights law, constituting sexual harass-
ment, given that background, why would you voluntarily agree to
drive Judge Thomas to the airport?

  Ms. HILL. I really don't recall that I voluntarily agreed to drive
him to the airport. I think that the dean suggested that I drive him
to the airport, and that I said that I would. But at any rate, one of
the things that I have said was that I intended to--I hoped to keep
a cordial professional relationship with that individual, and so I did
him the courtesy of driving him to the airport.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, when you say you wanted to maintain a
cordial professional relationship, why would you do that, given the
comments which you represent Judge Thomas made to you, given
the seriousness of the comments, given the fact that they violated
the Civil Rights Act? Was it simply a matter that you wanted to
derive whatever advantage you could from a cordial professional
relationship?

  Ms. HILL. It was a matter that I did not want to invoke any kind
of retaliation against me professionally. It wasn't that I was trying
to get any benefit out of it.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you say that you consulted with him
about a letter of recommendation. That would have been a benefit,
wouldn't it?

  Ms. HILL. Well, that letter of recommendation was necessary.
The application asked for a recommendation from former employ-
ers.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas testified at some length this
morning about his shock and dismay and anger, and specified a
group of facts which he said in effect undercut your credibility:
when you moved with him from the Department of Education to
EEOC; when you went with him voluntarily, and I take it it was
voluntary, to go to a speech which he made at Oral Roberts Law
School; when you contacted him about the speech at the University
of Oklahoma; when you asked him for his guidance and his advice.

  Would you say, Professor Hill, that all of those contacts and the
continuation of a cordial professional association, relationship,
have no bearing at all on your representation that he made these
disgusting comments to you and was guilty of sexual harassment in
violation of the Civil Rights Act?
  Ms. HILL. I wouldn't say that they have no bearing, but I believe
that I have explained a number of those factors. I talked to you
about why I went to the EEOC. I talked to you about--would you
list those again? I have forgotten what representations you are sug-
gesting.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I know that you have explained or given
an explanation as to why you moved from the Department of Edu-
cation to EEOC, and I know you have an explanation for the Okla-
homa University invitation, but nonetheless you called him. I know
you have an explanation for the Oral Roberts incident.

  But in seeking to evaluate the credibility between you and Judge
Thomas, I am asking, and I think you have already answered it,
that it does have some relevancy as to whether you would main-
tain over a long period of time this cordial association if he had
been so disgusting to you, had victimized you with sexual harass-
ment and had violated the Civil Rights Act.

  Ms. HILL. Well, the things that occurred after I left the EEOC,
occurred during a time--any matter, calling him up from the uni-
versity--occurred during a time when he was no longer a threat to
me of any kind. He could not threaten my job; he already had
tenure there. He could not threaten me as he had, implicitly at
least, at the EEOC; I was no longer working with him at the EEOC.
So I was removed from the harassment at that point. I did not feel
that it was necessary to cut off all ties or to burn all bridges or to
treat him in a hostile manner.

  Moreover, I think that if I had done that, I would have had to
explain in this, this whole situation that I have come for today. I
think what one has to do is try to put oneself in the situation that
I was in, and I think it is not an atypical situation. Perhaps all of
those things, if you look at them without any explanation, might
suggest that there was no harassment, but there is an explanation
for each of those things. And given the judgment that I made at
the time, that I did want to maintain some cordial but distant rela-
tionship, I think that there is no contradiction in what I am saying
and those actions.

  Senator SPECTER. All right. I am prepared to leave it at that.
There is some relevancy to that continuing association questioning
your credibility, but you have an explanation. I will leave it at
that.

  I want to ask you about one statement of Charles Kothe, Dean
Kothe, because he knew you and Judge Thomas very well. I want
to ask you for your comment on it. There is a similar reference in
the Doggett statement which I am not going to ask you about be-
cause you haven't read the Doggett statement and you say you do
not remember him. Out of fairness I want to give you a chance to
read that first, but you do know Dean Kothe and he does know
Judge Thomas.

  And this is his concluding statement: "I find the references to
the alleged sexual harassment not only unbelievable but preposter-
ous. I am convinced that such are the product of fantasy." Would
you care to comment on that?

  Ms. HILL. Well, I would only say that I am not given to fantasy.
This is not something that I would have come forward with, if I
were not absolutely sure about what it is I am saying. I weighed
                                                84

this very carefully, I considered it carefully, and I made a determi-
nation to come forward. I think it is unfortunate that that com-
ment was made by a man who purports to be someone who says he
knows me, and I think it is just inaccurate.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you have added, during the course of
your testimony today, two new witnesses whom you made this com-
plaint to. When you talked to the FBI, there was one witness, and
you are testifying today that you are now "recalling more," that
you had "repressed a lot." And the question which I have for you
is, how reliable is your testimony in October 1991 on events that
occurred 8, 10 years ago, when you are adding new factors, explain-
ing them by saying you have repressed a lot? And in the context of
a sexual harassment charge where the Federal law is very firm on
a 6-month period of limitation, how sure can you expect this com-
mittee to be on the accuracy of your statements?

  Ms. HILL. Well, I think if you start to look at each individual
problem with this statement, then you're not going to be satisfied
that it's true, but I think the statement has to be taken as a whole.
There's nothing in the statement, nothing in my background, noth-
ing in my statement, there is no motivation that would show that I
would make up something like this. I guess one does have to really
understand something about the nature of sexual harassment. It is
very difficult for people to come forward with these things, these
kinds of things. It wasn't as though I rushed forward with this in-
formation.

  I can only tell you what happened, to the best of my recollection
what occurred and ask you to take that into account. Now, you
have to make your own judgments about it from there on, but I do
want you to take into account the whole thing.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I will proceed with the question of moti-
vation on my next round, because the red light is now on.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator.
  There is one-half hour still to use. I am going to yield the bulk of
it to Senator Heflin, but I am going to ask for just a few minutes.
  Would you prefer a break?

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  The CHAIRMAN. Because you have been sitting there a long time.
  Ms. HILL. I will take a break. I need to read the statement from
Mr. Doggett.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we are not going to go to Mr. Doggett now.
Before we get back to Senator Specter, we will break and give you
an opportunity to read that statement, which, I might add, we are
reading for the first time ourselves.

   Ms. HILL. OK.

  The CHAIRMAN. But we are not going to break now, so there will
be order. Order in here. We will break after Senator Heflin and I
ask our questions, and then we will give you time to read the state-
ment, and, as I said, give all us time to read the statement, because
the statement is news to me as well as the rest of the committee,
other than Senator Specter.

  Senator Specter and all of us acknowledge that there is a need to
understand the nature of sexual harassment and the way in which
people respond to that harassment.
                                          85

  One of the things that you have repeatedly said here, and you
have said publicly prior to coming here, is that this was not your
idea, you did not want to come here. You have stated, and it ap-
pears to be so, that you are a reluctant witness, not one who is out
charging down the road. As Senator Specter acknowledged, and as
every expert in the field acknowledges, that is not conduct incon-
sistent with someone who has been harassed.

   Now, let me ask you this, though, because I am sure a lot of
people, including me, are wondering about it. You indicated, and it
is totally understandable, that you repressed a lot. Again, every
expert over the years with whom I have spoken about this sub-
ject--not about you, not about this incident, but about the nature
and the conduct of harassment and the response of the person har-
assed acknowledges that repression is not unusual.

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

   The CHAIRMAN. But I would like to ask you if, notwithstanding
that fact, you can lay out for the committee what, in fact, was the
sequence of events that did bring you forward?

   You and I had a long discussion--relatively long discussion--the
night that the Senate agreed--we meaning the members of the
committee--the Senate agreed to put off the vote on Judge Thomas
until 6 o'clock this coming Tuesday. I called to tell you that you
would be receiving a subpoena so that you would not be alarmed
when someone knocked at your door, and then you and I had a dis-
cussion about the sequence of events that brought you here. You
have made reference to that sequence, directly and indirectly, on
this record and off this record, but publicly.

   Now, this is not something that you initiated, is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. NO; it is not.

  The CHAIRMAN. And you were contacted by a staff person from
the U.S. Senate, is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

   The CHAIRMAN. And you indicated to me you thought that staff
person--and it is perfectly understandable, you would, in my
view--you thought that staff person was a staff person from the
Judiciary Committee, is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. And then you were contacted subsequently by
two other staff persons?

   Ms. HILL. Yes. Let me clarify something. I thought that staff
person was acting on behalf of a member of the committee

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

   Ms. HILL [continuing]. With regard to their duties on the commit-
tee.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see. Which is I understand to be the case, and
legitimately so.

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

   The CHAIRMAN. But as we talked, I had indicated to you that I,
in my responsibilities as chairman, did not make known the allega-
tions to the committee as a whole until after the committee had
begun its meeting. That is not your responsibility, that is mine, but
I want to get at this issue, because it seems to me it does go to ex-
plain your assertions here this morning as to how you got here.
                                      86

  What ultimately made you decide that you must go public, know-
ing that all this would occur?

  Ms. HILL. Well, I was presented with the information by a news-
paper reporter.

  The CHAIRMAN. The information that you had submitted to me
and I distributed to the committee?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU were presented with that information
and

  Ms. HILL. Over the telephone, it was read to me verbatim by a
member of the press.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, the thing that was read to you verbatim
was the statement that you had submitted and asked me to distrib-
ute to the committee, is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. SO, in your view, you are here as a result of some
unexpected events

  Ms. HILL. Definitely.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. And events that turned out not to
be within your control?
  Ms. HILL. Definitely.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you consider yourself part of some organized
effort to determine whether or not Clarence Thomas should or
should not sit on the bench?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I had no intention of being here today, none at all.
I did not think that this would ever--I had not even imagined that
this would occur.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, as I listened to you today answer very
direct questions by Senator Specter, fair and direct questions, you
stated here--correct me if I am wrong--that you did not view what
was happening to you as a situation in which you would need to
have a record to be able to retaliate or sue. Your main objective
was to try to stop what you alleged to be happening, from happen-
ing, is that correct?
  Ms. HILL. That is correct, that was my motive at the time, just to
stop the activity.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS this what you anticipated?
  Ms. HILL. This? No, not at all. I would have never even dreamed,
I just can't imagine.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS it reasonable to say that it was your hope and
expectation that it would not come to this?
  Ms. HILL. It was exactly what I was trying to really very--I
made greater effort to make sure that it did not come to this, and I
was meticulous, I was making every effort to make sure that this
public thing did not happen. I did not talk to the press. I was called
by the press on July 1. I did not talk to the press. This is exactly
what I did not want.
  The CHAIRMAN. And is it fair to say that attitude prevailed up
until the moment the press person called you and read you your
statement?
  Ms. HILL. Well, the attitude of not wanting this to happen?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Ms. HILL. It prevails even today.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we are beyond that point, as you know.
                                          87

  Ms. HILL. Yes, we are beyond that point, but it certainly pre-
vailed up until that point.

  The CHAIRMAN. The reason I ask that is that it is important, it
seems to me, for the committee to know why someone would move
from one point to the next and still hope that she didn't have to
reach an end point, with the end point being a situation like this
one here. Am I misstating in any way your desires as you moved
along in this process or were moved along in this process?

  Ms. HILL. The desire was never to get to this point. The desire--
and I thought that I could do things and if I were cautious enough
and I could control it so that it would not get to this point, but I
was mistaken.

  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you very much.
  I yield to my friend from Alabama, Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Professor Hill, we heard Judge Thomas deny
that he had ever asked you to go out with him socially, dating, and
deny all allegations relative to statements that allegedly he had
made to you that involved sex, sex organs, pornographic films and
materials and this type of thing.
  You have testified that this occurred, and that he asked you to
date and go out socially. You have testified here today concerning
statements that he had made to you about pornographic films and
materials and other things.
  I, and I suppose every member of this committee, have to come
down to the ultimate question of who is telling the truth. My expe-
rience as a lawyer and a judge is that you listen to all the testimo-
ny and then you try to determine the motivation for the one that is
not telling the truth.
  Now, in trying to determine whether you are telling falsehoods
or not, I have got to determine what your motivation might be. Are
you a scorned woman?

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  Senator HEFLIN. Are you a zealoting civil rights believer that
progress will be turned back, if Clarence Thomas goes on the
Court?

  Ms. HILL. NO, I don't--I think that--I have my opinion, but I
don't think that progress will be turned back. I think that civil
rights will prevail, no matter what happens with the Court.

  Senator HEFLIN. DO you have a militant attitude relative to the
area of civil rights?

  Ms. HILL. NO, I don't have a militant attitude.
  Senator HEFLIN. DO you have a martyr complex?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I don't. [Laughter.]
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, do you see that, coming out of this, you
can be a hero in the civil rights movement?
  Ms. HILL. I do not have that kind of complex. I don't like all of
the attention that I am getting, I don't--even if I liked the atten-
tion, I would not lie to get attention.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, the issue of fantasy has arisen. You have
a degree in psychology from the University of Oklahoma State Uni-
versity.

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator HEFLIN. Have you studied in your psychology studies,
when you were in school and what you may have followed up with,
the question of fantasies? Have you ever studied that from a psy-
chology basis?

  Ms. HILL. TO some extent, yes.
  Senator HEFLIN. What are the traits of fantasy that you studied
and as you remember?
  Ms. HILL. AS I remember, it would require some other indication
of loss of touch with reality other than one instance. There is no
indication that I am an individual who is not in touch with reality
on a regular basis and would be subject to fantasy.
  Senator HEFLIN. The reality of where you are today is rather
dramatic. Did you take, as Senator Biden asked you, all steps that
you knew how to take to prevent being in that witness chair today?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I did everything that I knew to do, I did.
  Senator HEFLIN. There may be other motivations. I just listed
some that you usually look to relative to these. Are you interested
in writing a book? [Laughter.]
  Ms. HILL. NO, I'm not interested in writing a book.
  Senator HEFLIN. In the statement that was made which we refer
to as an affidavit, on the--do you have a copy of that?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I do.

  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, just for part of the full record, I
would move that that statement be made a part of the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be made part of the
record.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU describe on the second page, starting at the
first paragraph there, about the working relationship and the vari-
ous conversations, which you say were very vivid and very graphic,
pertaining to pornographic materials and films and other state-
ments of that nature.

  Then you end that paragraph with these words: "However, I
sense that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on,
as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was
what he wanted."

  In other words, you are basically stating that that appeared to be
his goal, rather than trying to obtain an intimate or sexual rela-
tions with you. It may be that you also felt that, though that raises
quite an issue.

  "However, I sense that my discomfort with his discussions only
urged him on as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vul-
nerable was what he wanted." What do you mean by that? How do
you conclude that?

  Ms. HILL. Well, it was almost as though he wanted me at a disad-
vantage, to put me at a disadvantage, so that I would have to con-
cede to whatever his wishes were.

  Senator HEFLIN. DO you think that he got some pleasure out of
seeing you ill at ease and vulnerable?

  Ms. HILL. I think so, yes.
  Senator HEFLIN. Was this feeling more so than a feeling that he
might be seeking some type of dating or social relationship with
you?
  Ms. HILL. I think it was a combination of factors. I think that he
wanted to see me vulnerable and that, if I were vulnerable, then he
could extract from me whatever he wanted, whether it was sexual
or otherwise, that I would be under his control.
                                          89

  Senator HEFLIN. AS a psychology major, what elements of human
nature seem to go into that type of a situation?

  Ms. HILL. Well, I can't say exactly. I can say that I felt that he
was using his power and authority over me, he was exerting a level
of power and attempting to make sure that that power was exert-
ed. I think it was the fact that I had said no to him that caused
him to want to do this.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU cite the instance of the Coke can and his
statement of pubic hair on it. Do you feel that he was attempting
to have some specific message by relating that? How did you inter-
pret that?

  Ms. HILL. I did not have a clue as to how to interpret that. I did
not know; it was just a very strange comment for me. I could not
interpret it. I thought it was inappropriate, but I did not know
what he meant.

  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, was there an occasion when you were at
the EEOC that you wanted a different job or a promotion or a
higher job?

  Ms. HILL. I never sought a promotion with Clarence Thomas
while at the EEOC. I never sought a promotion with anyone while
at the EEOC.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, did this Allyson Duncan, in effect, take
over some position or became a supervisor of you, as opposed to
what it had previously been, and was it a reorganization, or what
were the facts pertaining to that?

  Ms. HILL. When Allyson Duncan took over her position--let me
say this: Prior to when Allyson Duncan moved into the office of the
Chair as an assistant, the assistants had basically been reporting
directly to Thomas, and what I understood happened was that the
work got too much for him to handle, to dole out to the assistants
himself, so he reorganized the structure and appointed Allyson as
the chief of staff for the special assistants in that office.

  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, Senator Specter asked you about the USA
Today report of October 9, 1991, in which it recites that Anita Hill
was told by Senate staffers her signed affidavit alleging sexual har-
assment by Clarence Thomas would be the instrument which quiet-
ly and behind the scenes would force him to withdraw his name.

  Keith Henderson, a 10-year friend of Hill's and a former Senate
Judiciary Committee staffer, says Hill was advised by Senate staff-
ers that her charge would be kept secret and her name kept from
the public scrutiny.

  Have you had a conversation with Keith Henderson during the
period of time from when you were originally contacted by some
staffers from the Senate and the time that this newspaper account
occurred?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I did.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU did. All right. And what was your conversa-
tion with Mr. Henderson? What did you tell him?

  Ms. HILL. Well, my conversation was that I was really concerned
about the situation involving this issue, that I had made the com-
ments to the staff, that I had followed up on those comments with
an affidavit and that I had gone through the investigation, all with
the understanding that this was not going to be a public matter,

       56-273 O--93-
                                      90

and that I was concerned about whether or not the information
would be made available to all the committee.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, during any conversation with Keith Hen-
derson, did you tell him that certain staffers had told you that if
you went ahead and signed the affidavit, that that might be a way
to get him to withdraw?

  Ms. HILL. NO, I did not tell him that.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, did you tell him that that was mentioned
or that it would have been mentioned relative to this?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I didn't tell him that.
  Senator HEFLIN. DO you know whether or not Keith Henderson
talked to certain Judiciary Committee staffers?
  Ms. HILL. I did not--I don't know whether he did talk to Judici-
ary Committee staffers.
  Senator HEFLIN. DO you know whether in any conversation that
he might have talked to Judiciary staffers, they might have said
that is a possibility?
  Ms. HILL. DO I know of any conversation
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, do you know whether or not there was a
conversation between Keith Henderson and some staffer in which
they were discussing the affidavit and saying that there were cer-
tain possibilities, which included the possibility that Clarence
Thomas might withdraw his name?
  Ms. HILL. That might have happened, but I haven't talked with
Keith Henderson about that.
  Senator HEFLIN. When you were at the EEOC, were you there on
November 23,1983? Would you have been there then?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I was not there then. I had left for Oral Roberts
University.
  Senator HEFLIN. When did you leave?
  Ms. HILL. I left in July 1983.
  Senator HEFLIN. Have you read a story in the Washington Post,
today, Friday, October 11, in which there is mentioned a case in-
volving allegations that Earl Harper, Jr., a regional attorney in the
EEOC Baltimore office, had made unwelcome sexual advances to
several women on his staff? When you were there at the EEOC, do
you remember anything about a case being alleged involving Earl
Harper, who was a trial attorney at the Baltimore office of the
EEOC?
  Ms. HILL. I don't recall any case.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right. Since you graduated, your scholastic
work, have you written any Law Review articles?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I have.
  Senator HEFLIN. HOW many Law Review articles have you writ-
ten?
  Ms. HILL. I've written six, seven, including a short Law Review
article--if I may back up, I have written five Law Review articles,
some shorter pieces in journals.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, while you were at the Office of Civil
Rights of the Department of Education, according to the way I read
the statements, most of these instances pertaining to descriptions
of pornographic films and materials was mentioned to you at the
Department of Education, as opposed to the EEOC office?
                                      91

  Ms. HILL. I think the more explicit statements probably did occur
at Education more than later at EEOC.

  Senator HEFLIN. But they did occur some at EEOC?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, how old were you at this particular time
that you were at the Department of Education?

  Ms. HILL. I was 25,1 just turned 25 when I started the job.
  Senator HEFLIN. Did you have any family here in Washington?

   Ms. HILL. NO, I did not.

  Senator HEFLIN. Did you have other than certain friends that
you could turn to in times of difficulty and

  Ms. HILL. I just had some friends. I did have some friends, but no
family.

  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, I believe that is all I have.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  We will recess for 15 minutes--let's have order in here, please--
and at that time we will come back and Senator Specter will ques-
tion, and then we will move to Senators who have 5 minutes of
questions and we hope that will be it. We will, in due course, call
back Judge Thomas.
  We are recessed for 15 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Before we begin this next round of questioning, through what I
know to be inadvertence, the affidavit that was given to Professor
Hill was also for the first time made available to the committee at-
large; the Senator from Pennsylvania did not realize that we did
not have it, either.
  There has been an agreement from the outset of this proceed-
ing--because, as I said, this is not a trial, this is a hearing to seek
the facts--that everyone on the committee would have made avail-
able to them any and all documents that are produced, for what-
ever reason, before there is any introduction of such documents in
the record or before there is any questioning on any documents.
That applies to Professor Hill, that applies to Judge Thomas, and
that applies to all our witnesses.
  Again, I think in this case this was inadvertence. The Senate has
indicated to us they want this very important and difficult matter
resolved and they gave us essentially 48 hours to get ready for this,
so there is going to be a lot that drops between the cup and the lip
here, but one of the things that won't is any document that all
members of the committee have not had in sufficient time to exam-
ine, read, and think about before it is even presented.
  With that, while we are doing a bit of housekeeping here on such
an important matter, let me suggest, again, the committee's inten-
tion in terms of timing: The committee intends to go back to Sena-
tor Specter. He indicates he may have more questions than his
next half-hour, and Senator Leahy has indicated that he has some
more questions. It is my sincere hope, Professor Hill, that we do
not keep you much longer.
  At the conclusion of Senator Leahy's questioning, we will then do
what I indicated at the outset. Each member who has not asked
questions, all of whom have a keen interest in this matter, will
have up to 5 minutes to ask a question or questions.
                                      92

  We will then, God willing, excuse Professor Hill and call Judge
Thomas back this evening, and I hope we will complete Judge
Thomas' testimony tonight before we go tomorrow to other wit-
nesses.

  I thank you for your patience, Professor Hill. Again, as we have
with all witnesses, if at any point during this process, as I indicated
to Judge Thomas and to every witness before us, you desire to ask
for a break, for whatever reason--you need not have any reason--
you just indicate to the Chair and we will recess.

  Now, with that, let me yield to my friend from Pennsylvania,
Senator Specter.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, as you have noted, I have not known you had not
seen the Doggett statement, but, in any event, the interruption
gave both Professor Hill and other members of the committee a
chance to see that statement.
  Professor Hill, a copy or copies of that statement, copies were
made available to you over the break, and I ask you now if you
would have any objection to answering questions about that state-
ment.

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  Senator SPECTER. All right. It may be that Mr. Doggett will
appear as a witness. If he does, it would be appropriate to give you
a chance to comment and, rather than have you come back after
the fact, you can comment now. I had candidly some question in
my mind about asking you about this statement at all, but our
lines of inquiry at this kind of a proceeding are very different from
any other kind of a proceeding. You have now had a chance to read
it and you are willing to comment about it?

  Ms. HILL. Yes, I will.
  Senator SPECTER. I bring up the statement of Mr. Doggett, be-
cause of the statement which was made by Dean Kothe. You have
already commented about where Dean Kothe of the Oral Roberts
Law School made the statement about fantasy. I don't intend to
repeat again, but that comes up in the Doggett statement.
  Now, the Doggett statement is a long statement and I am going
to summarize it by reading a portion of page 2. You, of course, Pro-
fessor Hill, are free to bring up any other part of it you want, if
you would like to go into any of the rest of it.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, you may, Senator.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding
that if I follow this procedure by accepting this affidavit and in-
quiring of the witness in connection with it, that you open up a
little Pandora's box, because we can get all sorts of sworn state-
ments--I see a number of them that were handed to me a little bit
ago, and it seems that there is no end.
  It is my understanding further that there were some limits as to
the number of witnesses that would be called by Judge Thomas,
that were interested in his confirmation; a number by Ms. Hill.
And my question is what are the rules?
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator makes a valid point. We had agreed
to a witness list submitted on behalf of Judge Thomas by the mi-
nority, and a witness list that was submitted on behalf of Professor
                                      93

Hill. We were of the understanding that this was the totality of the
witness list.

  There was an agreement that there would be no witnesses called
other than those witnesses without the entire committee being in-
formed of, and deciding on, whether or not to issue a subpoena to
any witness that had not, heretofore, been mentioned.

  Now, obviously Mr. Doggett's affidavit, it would seem to me, at a
minimum, would require Mr. Doggett to come forward and be
under oath. So, by implication, we have changed the groundrules of
who would be witnesses and under what circumstances.

  I would suggest that it may not be inappropriate to question Pro-
fessor Hill on Mr. Doggett's statement, but not absent the opportu-
nity of the majority to be able to question Mr. Doggett. I have in-
sisted that both the majority counsel and the minority counsel si-
multaneously interview every person on the witness list so that
they have an opportunity to listen to and question that potential
witness.

  In the case of Mr. Doggett that has not occurred. Now, unless my
colleague from South Carolina would object, it seems to me that it
is not appropriate at this moment to question Professor Hill, not-
withstanding her willingness to be questioned, and I am told that
Mr. Doggett is scheduled to be interviewed by majority and minori-
ty staff at 5 o'clock today.

  Senator THURMOND. Yes, this afternoon.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would respectfully suggest to my friend from
Pennsylvania it would be more appropriate to question Professor
Hill on Mr. Doggett's assertions after all parties on the committee
have had an opportunity to speak with Mr. Doggett, so that other
Senators will have an opportunity to intelligently question Profes-
sor Hill on Mr. Doggett's statement, and after the staff has spoken
to--Mr. Doggett.
  So, unless my colleague from South Carolina objects. I would sug-
gest we postpone any questioning on Mr. Doggett. Although it may
be totally appropriate to do so, until the full committee has had a
chance, as per our agreement, to interview Mr. Doggett so we are
all prepared, and are able to ask intelligent follow-up questions.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I do not object, just provided
that we have the opportunity to question Professor Hill after Mr.
Doggett has testified.
  The CHAIRMAN. Professor Hill, this may mean that you have to
come back. And I would leave the choice to you but I would re-
spectfully suggest that it is better for us to have an opportunity, all
of us, to question Mr. Doggett before you are questioned about
whatever Mr. Doggett had to say.
  Would you like time to confer with your counsel?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, just a moment, please.
  I will agree to come back if necessary to respond on Mr. Dog-
gett's statement.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, it may be possible--I am not promising
this--it may be possible that we can do this by interrogatories or
sworn interrogatories, or by affidavit, but I do not make that com-
mitment. The only commitment I am making now--it seems to me
fair--is for the committee to be fully informed prior to your being
questioned on this.

  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes?
  Senator HATCH. I haven't perhaps been privy to some of these
agreements that have been made, but it seems to me there is noth-
ing wrong
  Senator LEAHY. Orrin, we cannot hear you down here.
  Senator HATCH. I am sorry, I apologize. It seems to me there is
nothing wrong with while the witness is here, asking her about
these questions about, you know, this particular statement. She
was willing to answer it. And I think you save time by doing it.
And, frankly, I don't see any problem with that. I think the Sena-
tor could have
  Senator THURMOND. If she is willing to go ahead, we have no ob-
jections.
  Senator HATCH. He can ask any questions he wants, maybe we
will not call Doggett. But at least he should be able to ask her if
this is true, or if this is what happened? And she can answer.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. I will yield in a moment to my friend from Ver-
mont. There is one simple reason why I would not like to go for-
ward now. Quite frankly, it is not totally as a consequence of
whether or not we are being fair to the witness, although I think it
would be unfair to her.
  It is simply that I don't know enough. I want to be able to ques-
tion the witness on this issue when she returns for questioning and
it seems to me that the best way to find out the truth is for every-
body on this committee to have ample opportunity to review what-
ever is going to be introduced in evidence, so that we can all intelli-
gently question on the matter.
  I yield to my friend from Vermont.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I really echo what you said, but I
know that we have tried, in fairness to everybody involved--the ad-
ministration, Judge Thomas, Professor Hill and everybody else--we
have worked out groundrules that you and Senator Thurmond and
the rest of the committee have agreed to. And we have all had to
develop whatever we were going to do within those groundrules.
This would go outside them, and as one who has been designated to
ask questions, I would find it very difficult to do any kind of a fol-
lowup on this without having been able to at least delve into a
statement of somebody who is not going to be a witness, but used
almost as though they had been. And for the sake of a few hours'
delay, whatever it might be, I would rather do it in a way that all
of us--those asking questions based on the statement, those who
may want to do followup questions based on the statement--at
least know what the facts are.
  Senator HATCH. Well, Mr. Chairman, I don't know of these
groundrules. I have not heard of this that you can't ask a witness
questions. Now, admittedly we may decide that we do not call this
                                          95

man as a witness, but it is a verified statement, as I understand it,
and she may agree or not agree with it, but she did read it, she
said that she was willing to testify and I don't see any reason why
he can't ask questions about it. It is relevant to the proceedings.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I do not think we ought to
attempt to require her, but if she is willing to go ahead, then we
can save time, I think.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Hill would you prefer to wait until we or our
staffs have had a chance to interview Mr. Doggett, or would you
prefer to go now?

  Ms. HILL. That's a hard choice, if the committee needs
  The CHAIRMAN. Then the Chair will make the choice, we will
wait.
  Senator SIMPSON. I would like to hear her choice, if I might.

   The CHAIRMAN. OK.

  Senator THURMOND. We'll give her the choice.
  Ms. HILL. I can comment on the statement now. I am not sure
what the statement is supposed to mean.
  The CHAIRMAN. That's the problem.
  Ms. HILL. And it is really baffling me. I am really confused by it,
but it is meaningless to me.
  Senator THURMOND. DO you prefer to go forward now or not?
  Ms. HILL. Excuse me, just a moment.
  Senator THURMOND. I think whatever she prefers.
  The CHAIRMAN. I agree, whatever the witness prefers, we will do.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I might say that it is because the
affidavit is so meaningless to me that I wanted to question it fur-
ther, but whatever works.
  Ms. HILL. If the Chairman recommends that we wait, I am per-
fectly happy to wait.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have no recommendation. [Laughter.]
  Ms. HILL. SO you are going to make me decide, aren't you?
  The CHAIRMAN. If it were left to me I would want to abide by the
established rules, but if the witness prefers to go, she may go.
  Ms. HILL. I would prefer that we abide by the rules that we have
then.
  The CHAIRMAN. Then we will wait.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, let me ask a question. We were
all in the hall during the recess and the media has this affidavit
and they are not going to wait for anything.
  Ms. HILL. That's true, they don't.
  Senator SIMPSON. And so you know that. And I just say that to
you as a lawyer, that it will be circulated. It is now going out, and
there is no response from you. I would think that obviously this
man should come and testify. I would think that he automatically
qualifies as a witness. The other witness, Angela Wright, I was told
about yesterday afternoon. They took a deposition from her yester-
day and I saw it last evening. And she said, although the headline
was, "new and dazzling evidence," she said, "I am not stating a
claim of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas. It is not
something that intimidated or frightened me. At the most it was
annoying and obnoxious."
  So, surely, if we are going to have fairness, and we have had fair-
ness, but this is an extraordinary document and it is not, nor was
                                          96

yours, a notarized statement. It is a sworn statement. It is an affi-
davit. And so I think I am ready to do anything you wish but the
feeding frenzy is on.

  The CHAIRMAN. There is no right answer, I expect, to this ques-
tion. With regard to the person referred to by the Senator from
Wyoming as soon as we became aware that such a person existed
we contacted all staff within 20 minutes, and any discussions that
took place with that person were done jointly.

  But I only say that to put them at rest. I want to end this. I see
your counsel has indicated that it might be a good idea for you to
go forward. And if that is your decision, we will go forward; from
now on, though, as I said, no document will be put in place until
every member has had time, to examine it and we will abide by
your counsel's recommendation to you.

  Mr. GARDNER. Mr. Chairman, I want to explain that she is ready
to answer questions. The issue of whether or not to bend the rules
is not ours, it is yours.

  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, sir, and this is the last statement I am
going to make on this. It is very easy for me to insist on the com-
mittee rules being followed, but you and Ms. Hill's other counsel
may rightly conclude that Senator Simpson is correct, and that this
will mean that this affidavit will be sitting out there ^L 2, 4, 6, 8
hours without a response. Since it is not a court of law, I am not
prepared to make the judgment on whether or not Professor Hill is
prejudiced by the fact that she cannot respond. That is why the
chair is not going to rule that the committee rules must be adhered
to, especially as they are not the committee rules, but ground rules
laid down in what is obviously an extraordinary, unusual, and un-
precedented hearing.

  So, ultimately, we must look to the witness and her counsel to
determine what is in her best interests, not the committee's best
interest. From the beginning, the interests at stake are those of
Professor Hill and those of Clarence Thomas, not those of the com-
mittee.

  Ms. HILL. Will there be an opportunity to respond to the witness
if he is called?

  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. You will have an opportunity to respond
today, this moment if you wish, and to the witness if he is called.

  Ms. HILL. Then I am ready to go forward.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I think my time is up. [Laughter.]
  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to say initially for the record
that I did not make this statement available to the media or
anyone.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that, Senator, I know you better
than that.
  Senator SPECTER. And the election is to proceed.
  The CHAIRMAN. The election of the witness is to proceed knowing
that we may call Mr. Doggett here to testify under oath if we so
deem necessary.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Hill, I had started to question you about this affidavit.
I had desisted in mid-sentence because I wanted you to have an op-
                                          97

portunity to read it. There was a concern on my part about the
document but I think it has sufficient value and since you are will-
ing to respond to it, I am going to discuss it with you briefly.

  This is an affidavit provided by a man who knew both you and
Judge Thomas, and its relevancy, to the extent that it is relevant,
arises on page 2 where Mr. Doggett says the following:

  The last time I saw Professor Anita Hill was at a going away party that her
friends held for her at the Sheraton Carlton Hotel on K Street, just before she left
for Oral Roberts Law School. During this party she said that she wanted me to talk
in private. When we moved to a corner of the room she said, "I am very disappoint-
ed in you. You really shouldn't lead on women and then let them down." When she
made that statement I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about. When I
asked her what she meant she stated that she had assumed that I was interested in
her. She said that it was wrong for me not to have dinner with her or to try to get
to know her better. She said that my actions hurt her feelings and I shouldn't lead
women on like that. Quite frankly I was stunned by her statement and I told her
that her comments were totally uncalled for and completely unfounded. I reiterated
that I had never expressed a romantic interest in her and had done nothing to give
her any indication that I might be romantically interested in her in the future. I
also stated that the fact that I lived three or four blocks away from her but never
came over to her house or invited her to my condominium should have been a clear
sign that I had no personal or romantic interest in her. I came away from her going
away party feeling that she was somewhat unstable and that in my case she had
fantasied about my being interested in her romantically.

  On page 3,

  It was my opinion at the time and it is now my opinion that Ms. Hill's fantasies
about sexual interest in her were an indication of the fact that she was having a
problem being rejected by men she was attracted to. Her statements and actions in
my presence during the time when she alleges that Clarence Thomas harassed her
were totally inconsistent with her current descriptions and are, in my opinion, of
yet another example of her ability to fabricate the idea that someone was interested
in her, when, in fact, no such interest existed.

  My question to you, Professor Hill, is, is Mr. Doggett accurate
when he quotes you as saying, "I am very disappointed in you. You
really shouldn't lead on women and then let them down."

   Ms. HILL. NO, he is not.

  Senator SPECTER. What, if anything, did he say to you?
  Ms. HILL. AS I recall, before we broke I told you that I had very
limited memory of Mr. Doggett. The event that he is talking about
was a party where there were 30 or 40 people. I was talking to a lot
of people, they were people who I had known while I was here in
Washington, and we might have had some conversation, but this
was not the content of that conversation. I have very limited
memory of him. I did not at any time have any fantasy about a
romance with him.
  Senator SPECTER. In the earlier part of his affidavit he says that
he met you in 1982 at a gathering of African-American lawyers on
Capitol Hill, and that he had a number of contacts with you. Are
his statements in that regard accurate, if you recall?
  Ms. HILL. AS I said, my memory of him is limited. I do remember
at some point seeing him jogging near my home, but beyond that I
have a very limited memory of any interaction that I had with him
or how I might have met him, anything like that.
  Senator SPECTER. I am shifting now, Professor Hill, to a key issue
regarding your testimony that you moved with Judge Thomas from
the Department of Education to EEOC because you needed the job.
That is your testimony, correct?
                                      98

  Ms. HILL. Well, I think that is your summary of my testimony.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, is my summary accurate?
  Ms. HILL. Well, I said that I moved to EEOC because I did not
have another job. This position that--I was not sure whether I
would have a position at the Department of Education. I suppose
that could be translated into I needed the job.
  Senator SPECTER. OK. I am informed, Professor Hill, that you
were a schedule A attorney and in that capacity could stay at the
Department of Education. Is that incorrect?
  Ms. HILL. I believe I was a schedule A attorney but, as I ex-
plained it, I was the assistant to the Chair of--oh, excuse me--as-
sistant to the Assistant Secretary of Education. That, I had not
been interviewed by anyone who was to take over that position for
that job. I was not even informed that I could stay on as a schedule
A attorney, as well as, as I stated before, the agency was subject to
being abolished.
  Senator SPECTER. But as a schedule A attorney, you could have
stayed in some job?
  Ms. HILL. I suppose. As far as I know, I could have, but I am not
sure because at the time the agency was scheduled to be abolished.
  I want to add, too, that one of the things that I have made the
point about before was that the activity had ended at that time,
and I enjoyed the work. I wanted to do civil rights work, but I
didn't know what work I would be doing if I could have even
stayed at the agency, at the Department of Education. I moved on
because I assumed that the issue of the behavior of Clarence
Thomas had been laid to rest, that it was over, and that I could
look forward to a similar position at the EEOC.
  Senator SPECTER. I understand that you have given that reason,
that the behavior had ended, so that you have given a basis for not
expressing a concern, but your statements in your earlier testimo-
ny involved your conclusion that you would have lost your job, and
I am now
  Ms. HILL. That was one of the factors.
  Senator SPECTER. Excuse me?
  Ms. HILL. That was one of the factors.
  Senator SPECTER. That was one of the factors, and I am now
asking you about the correctness of that in light of the fact that
you were a schedule A attorney. While you would not have been
Judge Thomas' assistant or perhaps the assistant of the Assistant
Secretary, as a class A attorney you could have in fact kept your
job, had you wanted to stay there.
  Ms. HILL. That really was not my understanding, sir. At the time
I understood that my job was going to be lost. That was my under-
standing.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, did you make an inquiry?
  Ms. HILL. With whom?
  Senator SPECTER. Anyone?
  Ms. HILL. I did not make an inquiry. I went on what I was told in
my conversation with Mr. Thomas.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Thomas was replaced by Harry
Singleton, and Harry Singleton in fact, according to an affidavit
provided, was prepared to retain you as one of his attorney advi-
sors. Now I pursue this in some detail, Professor Hill, because on
                                      99

your prior statements as well as your testimony here. In extensive
newspaper accounts there has been a major question raised about
why you would leave with Judge Thomas, considering your state-
ments about his sexual harassment.

  And I understand that you have given us part of your thinking,
the cessation, so perhaps it wouldn't arise. But there has been a
major basis for your leaving the Department of Education, because
you would have lost your job and at 25, as I recollect the press ac-
counts and your statements, you needed a job. But on inquiry it is
determined, No. 1, that as a class A attorney you could have stayed
at the Department of Education in an attorney's job; and, second,
that Harry Singleton, who took Judge Thomas' position, was ready
to retain you as one of his attorney advisers, had you made an in-
quiry.

  So that leads to the question, just how concerned were you about
losing the job when you made no inquiry about your status to keep
a job as a class A attorney, or any inquiry with the successor As-
sistant Attorney General who was prepared to keep you?

  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, again I want to raise the
question about the method of procedure. What we have now,
within the last 15 minutes we were presented five pieces of paper,
some of which are notarized, some of which aren't, are various
people making certain statements. And now we find that our
friend, Senator Specter--and before that we had been presented
the affidavit of Mr. Doggett--now we find that this lady is being
called upon to respond to these statements, some of which are nota-
rized, some of which aren't.

  But what we are doing is, we are introducing a whole new ele-
ment of testimony in this means by inquiring of her. And frankly,
Mr. Chairman, I feel it violates the rules under which you told us
this committee was operating and which I think we all agreed to. I
think it is a back door way of approaching the question of how
many witnesses each side will bring forth.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, if I may respond

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER, [continuing]. This is a key point as to why Pro-
fessor Hill left one department and went to another. According to
her statements, Judge Thomas had sexually harassed her at the
Department of Education, and she went with him to EEOC in sig-
nificant part, if not in major part, according to her statement, be-
cause she would have lost her job.

  Now, Senator Metzenbaum may find that uncomfortable, but I
frankly object to his interruption. The witness doesn't have any
problem with the question.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I want to say I am not wanting to inter-
rupt my friend in his line of inquiry. I am raising the question with
the Chair with respect to the procedure. We were all told that
there would be only so many witnesses, and unless there was
agreement between the Chair and the ranking member, that is the
number that would be had. But if you have witnesses come in
through affidavits and then inquire about them to Ms. Hill, I think
that it just is not following the procedures.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, this is a question which goes to
the heart of the credibility of what the witness has testified to, as
                                      100

to her reason for a very critical move from the Department of Edu-
cation to EEOC.

  The CHAIRMAN. There is no question that it is as represented.
The question is whether the remainder of the committee had any
opportunity to prepare, or even know whether this was going to
happen. What I am afraid is going to happen now is, by the time
that Judge Thomas gets here, there will be 2, 7, 10, 12, 15 affidavits
that no one will have had an opportunity to look at, and Judge
Thomas will be questioned on things that could be totally scurri-
lous, could be in fact totally off the wall, without any of our staffs
haying had an opportunity to determine whether the person prof-
fering the statement is in fact credible and whether that person
should be called before the committee.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, may I make a statement?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. I think the question is proper because with-
out this affidavit, you don't need the Doggett affidavit. He could
ask her the question that he did ask her, why she left when she
could have stayed, without this affidavit. You don't need this affi-
davit. The question he asked is perfectly proper.

  Senator KENNEDY. But Mr. Chairman, just on this issue, it is
being represented that Singleton had a job available for Professor
Hill. I mean, I think it would be legitimate to find out when did
Mr. Singleton indicate that Professor Hill might have a job. Did he
have a conversation with her prior to the time that she left the
agency? Here a Senator is saying, "Well, don't you know that Mr.
Singleton," who happens to be one of Clarence Thomas' best
friends, "had a job just out there, and why didn't you take it? And
the fact you didn't take it must reflect something,' and I think all
of us know what is trying to be reflected.

  And so I think it is perfectly appropriate for us, when we are
going to talk about asking a witness about when that job was avail-
able, to know when that job--whether Mr. Singleton talked to Pro-
fessor Hill, when he talked to her, when he indicated a job was
going to be available, rather than just go ask the witness right here
on an affidavit, at some time Mr. Singleton concluded, based upon
your standing over there, that you would have been available.

  And I think that is the point the Senator from Ohio is making. I
think it is a legitimate point.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, if I may respond just briefly

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER, [continuing]. The question is whether Professor
Hill asked Mr. Singleton. She is in the process of leaving. She is
concerned about her job, and the question which I asked goes to
the issue of her inquiry as to her ability to stay because she is in a
class A status or, secondarily, to keep the same position as the As-
sistant Secretary's advisor. It goes to the issue of her state of mind,
as to whether she felt she really had to move with Judge Thomas
to keep a job.

  Senator HATCH. Well, Mr. Chairman
  The CHAIRMAN. Wait a minute. Let me say something.
  Senator HATCH. Before you rule I would like to make a state-
ment, though
  The CHAIRMAN. Make it briefly, if you could.
                                         101

  Senator HATCH. I will try.
  It seems to me that these questions are relevant
  Senator METZENBAUM. We can't hear you, Orrin.
  Senator HATCH. I'm sorry.
  It seems to me that these questions are relevant. Last night we
were trying to obtain all the knowledge we could from this so-
called Angela Wright. Well, she gave so much testimony and then
refused to talk after that. Now does that mean that she is going to
be barred from testifying? I don't think anybody on your side is
going to argue that.
  He is entitled to ask her, in advance, what her recollection is of
these things. And all that means is, if she will answer it, either she
agrees with the statement or she doesn't. If she doesn't, she
doesn't. Now if she doesn't and the Singleton statement says some-
thing else, we have an option of calling Singleton or not calling
him. I mean, that doesn't take anybody s rights away from them,
and I think if she wanted to, she would have an option of coming
back if she didn't like what he said. So I think I never heard of this
rule.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank my friend, and
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I do wish to make one point on
this. How fair can it be to either Professor Hill or any other wit-
ness if any of us can sit up here and say, "I have this stack of affi-
davits, and in affidavit No. 5 in the third paragraph somebody says
such-and-such. What do you have to say about that?"
  I mean, at the very least, at the very least they ought to be able
to see these affidavits. At the very least, they ought to have some
idea of who the person is and if they are credible. Otherwise you
could go down through a whole list and say, "Ah, affidavit No. 29,
in the second sentence, they say that you were living in Japan at
the time. Can you prove that you weren't?" I mean, this doesn't
make much sense.
  The CHAIRMAN. I thank my colleagues for their advice. The
Chair rules as follows.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, may I? I have been
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have been very good. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. I promise. It is a very difficult day for me.
  Mr. Chairman, let me just say every one of us at this table is in
anguish because what we are trying to deal with is the credibility
of these two people, principally, and so anything that goes to their
credibility we have to hear. Forget about Doggett. I am glad you
responded. I think that was appropriate, because that thing would
be splattered all over the place, and if you hadn't said anything,
you would pay for it.
  And so now you can't tell me what you are going to do when
Clarence Thomas gets here and you bring up any questions im-
pugning his credibility. Are we going to invoke this rule? I want to
see it to believe it. This is about credibility.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, let me tell you what I am going to do, and
then I will yield to my colleagues.
  It is appropriate to ask Professor Hill anything any Member
wishes to ask her to plumb the depths of her credibility. It would
be appropriate to ask her about Mr. Singleton, but it is inappropri-
                                      102

ate to represent what Mr. Singleton says via an affidavit. There is
a distinction.

  So you can ask anything you want. You can ask her what Santa
Claus said or didn't say, whether she spoke to him or not, but it is
inappropriate to introduce an affidavit from Santa Claus prior to
every member on this committee having an opportunity to check it
out, for the following reason: We may find out that Santa Claus is
not real. Therefore, it may not be very relevant whether Santa
Claus said something or not.

  So, we are all lawyers on this committee, with one or two excep-
tions. There is a fundamental distinction between being able to ask
a direct question, to determine the credibility of a witness, and rep-
resenting what another individual said the witness said or what an
individual said they thought about the motivation of the witness.
There is a distinction.

  So the Chair will rule that you can ask anything you want about
credibility; you cannot represent, via an affidavit or a sworn state-
ment or a statement, as to what the individual in question thinks.
If that is the case, ask the committee to bring that witness forward,
and then we will sit down and renegotiate among ourselves and
with the White House how many witnesses we are going to have.
But as pointed out here, this is another way of getting in 2, 5, 7, 10,
20 witnesses without allowing for an opportunity to cross-examine
them.

  Now that is the Chair's ruling. Did my friend want to say any-
thing?

  Senator SIMON. I would just buttress that by saying there is one
other reason, Mr. Chairman, and that is, if we don't abide by the
rules, we are going to end up in these wrangles constantly every
time a new affidavit is brought up.

  The CHAIRMAN. I assure my friend from Wyoming that I will
impose the same exact rule on anyone questioning Judge Thomas.

  Now, the Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, am I accurate that I only have
29 minutes left?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have whatever time was--let me ask. Let
me ask Senator Simon.
  Senator SPECTER. Twenty-nine minutes on my 30-minute round.
  The CHAIRMAN. Pardon me?
  Senator SPECTER. IS it accurate that I only have 29 minutes left
on my 30-minute round?
  The CHAIRMAN. It is accurate you can have as much time as you
want, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Hill, did you know that, as a class A attorney, you
could have stayed on at the Department of Education?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I did not know at that time.
  Senator SPECTER. Did you make any effort to find out that, as a
class A attorney, you could have stayed on at the Department of
Education?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I relied on what I was told.
  Senator SPECTER. Sorry, I didn't hear you.
  Ms. HILL. I relied on what I was told by Clarence Thomas.
  Senator SPECTER. My question
                                         103

  Ms. HILL. I relied on what I was told by Clarence Thomas. I did
not make further inquiry.

  Senator SPECTER. And what are you saying that Judge Thomas
told you?

  Ms. HILL. His indication from him was that he could not assure
me of a position at Education.

  Senator SPECTER. Was that when you were hired or when he was
leaving?

  Ms. HILL. When he was leaving.
  Senator SPECTER. Did you make any inquiry of his successor, Mr.
Singleton, as to what your status would be?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I did not. I'm not even sure that I knew who his
successor would be at the time.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, was Mr. Singleton on the premises for
about four weeks in advance of Judge Thomas' departure as
the
  Ms. HILL. I don't
  Senator SPECTER. May I finish the question?
  Ms. HILL. I don't--I'm sorry.
  Senator SPECTER. May I finish the question?
  Ms. HILL. I'm sorry.
  Senator SPECTER. Was Mr. Singleton on the premises for about 4
weeks prior to Judge Thomas' departure, for transition?
  Ms. HILL. I don't recall.
  Senator SPECTER. Did you make any effort at all with anybody in
the Department of Education to find out whether you could stay on
in a job there?
  Ms. HILL. AS I said before, I did not make any further inquiries.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, how concerned were you on your decision
to move with Judge Thomas to EEOC, notwithstanding your repre-
sented comments about retaining some job somewhere?
  Ms. HILL. I'm sorry, could you rephrase your question?
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I would be glad to repeat it. If you made
no inquiry to see if you could stay at the Department of Education,
perhaps even as the assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Educa-
tion, how much of a factor was your need for a job to go along with
Judge Thomas, even though he had made these reprehensible
statements?
  Ms. HILL. It was part of what I considered.
  Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, there has been disclosed in the
public milieu the records of certain telephone logs as so much of
the evidence or representations or comments about this matter,
and you were quoted in the Washington Post as saying, "I'm terri-
bly saddened and deeply offended by these allegations. Ms. Hill
called the telephone logs garbage, and said that she had not tele-
phoned Thomas, except to return his calls." Did you, in fact, say
that you had not telephoned Thomas, except to return his calls?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I did not say that.
  Senator SPECTER. The Washington Post is in error on that state-
ment attributed to you?
  Ms. HILL. Well, I can tell you something about that conversation.
  Senator SPECTER. Please do.
  Ms. HILL. When that conversation was made, it was my indica-
tion that the reporter was saying to me that "we have information
                                         104

that you talked to Clarence Thomas 10 or 11 times over this period
of time that was described." That was my understanding of what
she was telling me. I knew that I had not talked to Clarence
Thomas, and I told her that. I said I haven't talked to Clarence
Thomas 10 or 11 times, and she said that there were telephone logs
that indicated that I had.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, it is not a matter of talking to Judge
Thomas, it is as matter of telephoning

  Ms. HILL. I understand that.
  Senator SPECTER. May I finish the question--it is a matter of
telephoning him. Did you tell the reporter for the Washington Post
that you had not telephoned Thomas, except to return his calls?
  Ms. HILL. I said to her that I had not talked to Clarence Thomas
10 or 11 times over that period of time.
  Senator SPECTER. SO, she misunderstood you, to say that you had
not telephoned Thomas 10 or 11 times?
  Ms. HILL. I think there was miscommunication in the entire
interview.
  Senator SPECTER. Did you call the telephone log issue "garbage"?
  Ms. HILL. I believe that the issue is garbage, when you look at
what seems to be implied from the telephone log, then, yes, that is
garbage.
  Senator SPECTER. Have you seen the records of the telephone
logs, Professor Hill?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I have.
  Senator SPECTER. DO you deny the accuracy of these telephone
logs?

   Ms. HILL. NO, I do not.

  Senator SPECTER. Then you now concede that you had called
Judge Thomas 11 times?

  Ms. HILL. I do not deny the accuracy of these logs. I cannot deny
that they are accurate, and I will concede that those phone calls
were made, yes.

  Senator SPECTER. SO, they are not garbage?
  Ms. HILL. Well, Senator, what I said was the issue is garbage.
Those telephone messages do not indicate that--they are being
used to indicate, that is, that somehow I was pursuing something
more than a cordial relationship, a professional relationship. Each
of those calls were made in a professional context. Some of those
calls revolved around one incident. Several of those calls, in fact,
three involved one incident where I was trying to act on behalf of
another group, so the issue that is being created by the telephone
calls, yes, indeed, is garbage.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, the issue which was raised by Senator
Danforth, who disclosed this log in a press conference, was done so
on the point that you had made repeated efforts to contact Judge
Thomas. This bore on the issue as to whether he had sexually har-
assed you, on the approach that if he had victimized you by sexual
harassment, you would not be calling him so many times. So, when
you were quoted by the Washington Post as, number one, calling
them garbage and denying that you had telephoned Thomas, it con-
stituted your statement that you had, in fact, not made those ef-
forts to contact him.
                                         105

  Now, my question to you is, since those calls were in fact made,
as you now say, doesn't that have some relevance as to whether the
committee should accept your statements about Judge Thomas'
sexual harassment in the context of your efforts to call him this
many times over that period of time?

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  Senator SPECTER. OK.
  Answer into the microphone, if you will, so we can hear you.
  Ms. HILL. I'm sorry. My response is no, that those are not rele-
vant to the issue of whether or not there was harassment. My
point is this--and I believe that these are completely consistent
with what you have before you in my statement--my point is that
I have stated to you that I continued, I hoped to continue to main-
tain a professional relationship, for a variety of reasons. One was a
sense that I could not afford to antagonize a person in such a high
position.
  Those calls that were made, I have attempted to explain, none of
them were personal in nature, they involved instances where I
passed along casual messages or instances where I called to either
find out whether or not the Chairman was available for a speech,
acting on behalf of someone else. No, they have very little, if any,
relevance at all to the incidents that happened before those phone
calls were made.
  Senator SPECTER. Very little relevance, but perhaps some?
  Ms. HILL. I believe they have none. We may differ on that.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU say that they were all professional and
you have accounted for a number of them in your statement, but a
number of them have not been accounted for. For example, the log
on January 30, 1984, "Just called to say hello, sorry she didn't see
you last week." May 9, 1984, "Please call." October 8, 1986, "Please
call."
  Taking the one, "Just called to say hello, sorry she didn't see you
last week," first of all, is that accurate?
  Ms. HILL. AS I indicated earlier, I do not deny the accuracy of
these messages.
   Senator SPECTER. YOU had picked out one of the calls in your
statement which appears on page 8, as follows: "In August of 1987,
I was in Washington and I did call Diane Holt. In the course of this
conversation, she asked me how long I was going to be in town, and
I told her."
   Now, the log says, "Anita Hill, 547-4500, 4:00 o'clock, in town
until 8:15," is dated August 4. Now, if the log represents your
making the statement "in town until August 15," from August 4,
some might interpret that as a suggestion that you would be avail-
able to meet, maybe, maybe not, but some might suggest that.
   If, on the other hand, Judge Thomas' secretary asked you how
long you were going to be in town, the initiative would come from
her. It would contain no possible suggestion of your availability to
meet. My question to you is how do you know today that, on
August 4, 1987, she asked you how long you were going to be in
town, as opposed to your saying that you would be in town until
August 15.
   Ms. HILL. That is my recollection of how the telephone conversa-
tion took.
                                         106

  Senator SPECTER. And your representation to this committee is
that you have recollection at this moment that Judge Thomas' sec-
retary asked you how long you were going to be in town, as op-
posed to your volunteering the statement to her? You have an
active recollection of that?

  Ms. HILL. That is my recollection.
  Senator SPECTER. OK.
  Ms. HILL. May I comment on that telephone call?
  Senator SPECTER. Sure.
  Ms. HILL. I was actually in town until the 20th of August, so at
least this may be an accurate representation of what was written
in the log, but that is not an accurate representation of my activi-
ties.

  Senator SPECTER. What relevance does that have?
  Ms. HILL. My point is you asked if these phone messages were
accurate, and I said that I would not deny their accuracy, but I will
deny the accuracy of that as a representation of my activities.
  Senator SPECTER. Let me return, Professor Hill, to the question
as to how you first came to be contacted by the Senate, and I would
appreciate it if you would tell us when the first contact was made,
by whom and the circumstances?

  Ms. HILL. On September 4, a woman named Gail Laster called
me and a message was left at my office.

  Senator SPECTER. On September 4?
  Ms. HILL. On September 4.
  The CHAIRMAN. What was the woman's name?
  Ms. HILL. September 4.
  The CHAIRMAN. Her name?
  Ms. HILL. Gail Laster.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator SPECTER. YOU say the person was who?
  Ms. HILL. Gail Laster, and I don't have the message in front of
me, but the indication was that she was working with a Senate
office and I can't
  Senator SPECTER. And what happened next?
  Ms. HILL. At some point in between--on September 4, I must
have returned her call or she on her own initiative called back on
September 5 and I returned her call on that same day.
  Senator SPECTER. NOW, on September 4, did you call back or on
September 5 did she call you again?
  Ms. HILL. On September 4,1 called back.
  Senator SPECTER. And did you talk to someone?
  Ms. HILL. I left a message.
  Senator SPECTER. What happened next?
  Ms. HILL. On September 5, she called me.
   Senator SPECTER. And what was the content of that conversa-
tion?
   Ms. HILL. I returned her call on September 5, and during that
call she asked me if I knew anything about allegations of sexual
harassment.
   Senator SPECTER. DO you have notes of these matters, Professor
Hill? I see you reading from something there.
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I do, I have notes that I have made.
                                      107

  Senator SPECTER. Did you make those notes contemporaneously
with the event?

   Ms. HILL. NO, I did not.

  Senator SPECTER. When did you make the notes?
  Ms. HILL. I made these notes yesterday.
  Senator SPECTER. OK. What was the conversation that you had
on September 5 with, you say, Gail Laster?
  Ms. HILL. G-a-i-1, Laster, L-a-s-t-e-r.
  Senator SPECTER. And what was the conversation which you had
with Gail Laster?
  Ms. HILL. She asked me some general questions and then she
asked me if I knew anything about allegations of sexual harass-
ment or tolerance of sexual harassment at the Office of the EEOC,
in particular as they related to Clarence Thomas.
  Senator SPECTER. And what was your response?
  Ms. HILL. My response was that I did not have any comment on
either of those.
  Senator SPECTER. And what did she say when you told her that
you had no comment, as opposed to no knowledge of any tolerance
of sexual harassment?
  Ms. HILL. I believe we might have gone on to something more
general about the nomination. I don t believe the conversation
lasted very long after that.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, what was in the conversation?
  Ms. HILL. AS I say, we went on to more general matters regard-
ing the nomination, issues about
  Senator SPECTER. YOU don't recall the specific contents of the
conversation?
  Ms. HILL. Oh, we talked about general issues involving women in
the workplace, what I thought of his views on that, on those issues.
  Senator SPECTER. What happened next?
  Ms. HILL. On September 6, Ricky Seidman called me. I returned
the call on that day and she asked me some specific questions
about some work that I had done at the Department of Education.
We spoke about that work and she asked what role I played in
doing it, and then she again asked me about rumors or did I know
anything or had I heard any rumors while I was at the EEOC in-
volving his tolerance, Judge Thomas' tolerance of sexual harass-
ment
  Senator SPECTER. And what response
  Ms. HILL [continuing]. Or whether I knew anything about his ac-
tually engaging in sexual harassment acts.
  Senator SPECTER. And what was your response?
  Ms. HILL. At that point, I told Ms. Seidman that I would neither
confirm nor deny any knowledge of that.
  Senator SPECTER. Anything further in that conversation?
  Ms. HILL. At that point, I think again we might have moved on.
She
  Senator SPECTER. Might have moved on, or do you not recall the
specifics of the conversation?
  Ms. HILL. I will complete my thought here. At that point, she
said are you saying that you will neither confirm nor deny your
knowledge, or are you saying that you will neither confirm or deny
that the actual harassment existed, and I told her it was the latter.
                                      108

  Senator SPECTER. What happened next?
  Ms. HILL. I told her that I wanted to think about it and that I
would get back to her.
  Senator SPECTER. Think about what?
  Ms. HILL. Think about this issue of sexual harassment.
  Senator SPECTER. Did that conclude the conversation?
  Ms. HILL. That concluded the conversation.
  Senator SPECTER. What happened next?
  Ms. HILL. I think in the interim, on the weekend, over the week-
end of September 7 or 8, I spoke to Ms. Seidman again. I did speak
to her again and I asked her specifically, if I were to discuss this
matter, where should I go? That I wanted to talk with someone
who was knowledgeable about the issue before I proceeded to tell
what I knew. At that point what I was trying to do was to really
determine, get some sense of how the committee would approach
this and give some--take some effort to weigh what I thought was
valuable information, but I wanted to do it from a more objective
viewpoint.
  Senator SPECTER. And what did Ms. Seidman tell you?
  Ms. HILL. At that point she told me that she knew someone who
worked on the Senate Labor Committee, James Brudney, who
would have information, who had worked in the area of sex dis-
crimination, and that he would be able to give me some indication
of the law. She also said that she had his telephone number.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, why would you need someone to give you
an indication of the status of the law, considering your own knowl-
edge of sexual harassment and the fact that you had been a civil
rights professor at Oral Roberts Law School?
  Ms. HILL. I had not practiced in the area. I have never actually
practiced in the area. I have taught in the area, but it has been--I
haven't taught in the area since 1986, and I understand that this is
a very fast-developing area of law. In addition, I wanted a more ob-
jective evaluation of my situation and I wanted to do it with some-
one who I could trust. I knew James Brudney and I wanted to talk
with him so that I might be able to make that evaluation.
  Senator SPECTER. SO MS. Seidman recommended Mr. James
Brudney?
  Ms. HILL. She gave me his name, and I indicated that he was
someone who I knew and who I thought had integrity and who I
could trust with confidential information.
  Senator SPECTER. OK, and then you did talk to Mr. Brudney?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, we talked.
  Senator SPECTER. And when was that?
  Ms. HILL. Well, we talked on the weekend of September 7 and 8.
  Senator SPECTER. And what was the content of that conversa-
tion?
  Ms. HILL. Actually, I'm sorry, that is incorrect. We talked on
September 9.
  The content of the conversation was really, "Tell me something.
What do you know about the development of sexual harassment? If
I disclose to you certain facts, can you make an evaluation of some
kind as to what kind of legal conclusion one might make?"
                                      109

  Senator SPECTER. SO that at that time there was a doubt in your
mind as to whether Judge Thomas was, in fact, guilty of sexual
harassment on the facts as you knew them?

  Ms. HILL. Well, I want to back up and say something here. In my
statement to you I never alleged sexual harassment. I had conduct
that I wanted explained to the committee. My sense was, my own
personal sense was that yes, this was sexual harassment, but I un-
derstood that the committee with their staff could make that eval-
uation on their own. So I didn't have any doubts but I wanted to
talk with someone who might be more objective.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you did call it sexual harassment in your
extensive news conference on October 7, even though you did not
so characterize it to the FBI or in your statement to this commit-
tee.

  Ms. HILL. But that news conference on August 7 had not taken
place at the time--or, excuse me, on October 7

  Senator SPECTER. October 7.
  Ms. HILL [continuing]. On October 7 had not taken place at the
time that this conversation was made.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, the statement to the committee and the
statement to the FBI hadn't taken place, either.
  Ms. HILL. The statement to the FBI had not; you are right.
  Senator SPECTER. SO that you made statements to the FBI during
the week of September 23 and you furnished this committee a
statement on September 23, both of which occurred after your con-
versation with Mr. Brudney, but in neither of those statements did
you conclude that Judge Thomas was guilty of sexual harassment.
  Ms. HILL. I had reached--in either of which statements?
  Senator SPECTER. YOU did not tell the FBI that Judge Thomas
was guilty of sexual harassment, did you?
  Ms. HILL. I don't recall telling them that he was guilty of sexual
harassment, no. I didn't tell them that.
  Senator SPECTER. Or you didn't characterize his conduct as
sexual harassment.
  Ms. HILL. I did or did not?
  Senator SPECTER. YOU did not characterize Judge Thomas' con-
duct as sexual harassment when you gave the statement to the
FBI, correct?
  Ms. HILL. Senator, I guess I am not making myself clear. I was
not raising a legal claim in either of my statements. I was not rais-
ing a legal claim. I was attempting to inform about conduct.
  Senator SPECTER. But you did raise a legal claim in your inter-
view on October 7.
  Ms. HILL. NO, I did not raise a legal claim then.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I will produce the transcript which says
that it was sexual harassment.
  Ms. HILL. Well, I would suggest that saying that it is sexual har-
assment and raising a legal claim are two different things. What I
was trying to do when I provided information to you was not say to
you, "I am claiming that this man sexually harassed me." What I
was saying and what I state now is that this conduct that took
place, you have your own legal staff and many are lawyers your-
selves. You can investigate and determine whether or not it is
                                         110

sexual harassment, and that is one of the things that I want to get
away from.

  Were I filing a claim, if I were filing a complaint in court, this
would be done very differently, but this does not constitute a legal
complaint.

  Senator SPECTER. SO that you are not now drawing a conclusion
that Judge Thomas sexually harassed you?

  Ms. HILL. Yes, I am drawing that conclusion.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, then, I don't understand.
  Ms. HILL. Pardon me?
  Senator SPECTER. Then I don't understand.
  Ms. HILL. Well, let me try to explain again.
  I brought this information forward for the committee to make
their own decision. I did not bring the information forward to try
to establish a legal claim for sexual harassment. I brought it for-
ward so that the committee could determine the veracity of it, the
truth of it, and from there on you could evaluate the information
as to whether or not it constituted sexual harassment or whether
or not it went to his ability to conduct a job as an Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court.
  Senator SPECTER. But, Professor Hill, there is a big difference be-
tween your articulating your version of events, contrasted with
your statement that Judge Thomas sexually harassed you. And in
the transcript of your October 7 interview, you responded to a ques-
tion saying that it was sexual harassment.
  Ms. HILL. In my opinion, based on my reading of the law, yes, it
was. But later on, immediately following that response, I noted to
the press that I did not raise a claim of sexual harassment in this
complaint. It seems to me that the behavior has to be evaluated on
its own with regard to the fitness of this individual to act as an
Associate Justice. It seems to me that even if it does not rise to the
level of sexual harassment, it is behavior that is not befitting an
individual who will be a member of the Court.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Professor Hill, I quite agree with you
that the committee ought to examine the conduct or the behavior
and make a factual determination of what you say happened and
what Judge Thomas said happened. But when you say that you had
not make the statement that he had sexually harassed you, that is
at variance with your statement at the October 7 news conference.
  Ms. HILL. Senator, I would submit that what I said was, I have
not raised a claim of sexual harassment in either of my statements,
and I will say again that in the news conference I was simply stat-
ing that yes, in my opinion, this does constitute sexual harassment.
  Senator SPECTER. OK. Back to Mr. Jim Brudney. You consulted
with him because you wanted some expert advice on what
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, I am not going to interrupt you, but
your time is up. Go ahead, finish this line of questioning, and then
we will move to our friend from Vermont, but I just wanted you to
be aware.
  Senator SPECTER. I am sorry. I hadn't noticed.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is all right. There is no reason why you
should have.
  Senator SPECTER. I had recollected your statement, "Take as
much time as you want."
                                      Ill

  The CHAIRMAN. That is true. Go ahead, finish this line, and then
we will go to our friend from Vermont. I just wanted to alert you
to start to wind down.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, this is not necessarily brief, because I
think it is important to develop the facts as to the contacts, which
end up with the issue as to whether the USA Today report is cor-
rect that, "Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers her signed affida-
vit alleging sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas would be the
instrument that 'quietly and behind the scenes' would force him to
withdraw his name."

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I understand, and I assumed that is where
the Senator was going. Since that will take a little more time, why
don't we break here?

  Senator SPECTER. That is fine with me, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. And let me ask, because there is a lot of pressure
for any witness sitting under the lights this long, would you like to
take a break now?
  Now before everyone starts to get up and go, let me tell you
what we are going to do from here on, if I can. It is our hope and
intention that shortly we will take a break. We will then come
back to Senator Leahy, and from that point will continue--al-
though we agreed we would stop at this point, the purpose of this is
factfinding. We will allow time for any questions from my friend
from Pennsylvania has, or from my friend from Vermont may
have, speaking for me and for Senator Heflin.
  But we are going to try to finish with the witness relatively soon,
and then we will break for dinner. It is the intention of the Chair
to have Judge Thomas return then. In fairness to him, he should
have an opportunity to speak tonight and should not have to wait
to respond to what has been asserted, and so that is how we will
proceed.
  We will recess for 10 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome back. Now again we are waiting to
hear from Judge Thomas, whether he wishes to--I know there are
a few people in the press who are anxious to know what the sched-
ule will be for tonight.
  I have made a commitment, I think it is only fair, that Judge
Thomas can come on whenever he wishes after Professor Hill fin-
ishes. He has not decided whether he wants to testify tonight. If he
wishes to speak tonight, we will go tonight as long as is appropri-
ate or is reasonable, and I can't guess what that would be at this
moment.
  So I apologize to those who are trying to set their schedules but
again, as I said, this is not a trial. This is a fact-finding mission,
and we are going to be as fair as we can to all parties.
  As it appears now, we have, Professor Hill, two more principal
questioners who will question you for roughly a half-hour apiece.
Then we are going to yield, as I indicated at the outset, to any of
our colleagues who wish to ask up to 5 minutes. It is my sincere
hope that all the questions that they wish to have asked will have
been asked.
  So we will be a minimum of another hour and a maximum of
another hour and 40 minutes or thereabouts. We will then break
                                      112

for dinner. If Judge Thomas wishes to come back, we will break for
roughly 45 minutes to 1 hour for dinner. If he does not wish to
come back, we will recess until tomorrow morning. We will have to
decide on the time when I speak to the ranking member, whether
it is 9 or 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

  I can see my friend from Wyoming seeking recognition.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. chairman, I think that all should be aware
that I feel rather positive that Judge Thomas does want to be here
this evening. Whether it can be concluded or not, I don't know,
but
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing.] I guarantee that he will be, then.
  Senator SIMPSON. I know you will be fair. I know you will be.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO thank you for your patience, Professor Hill,
and for everyone else's. Let us now turn to the Senator from Ver-
mont, Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Hill, let me go back to some of the areas we discussed
earlier. I would like to refer first to a comment just made by the
chairman, and then I want to go into a couple of the questions
posed by Senator Specter.
  The chairman said, and quite rightly, that this is not a trial. We
are not having a trial on whether sexual harassment under the
statute was committed or not, and whether or not the statute of
limitations has run. We are trying to find out what the facts are.
  And with that in mind, I turn to the questions Senator Specter
was asking you. He talked about whether you had called your
charges against Judge Thomas "sexual harassment" in your FBI
statements. During your October 7 press conference in Norman,
OK, you were asked, "Professor Hill, you said that you did not de-
scribe this as sexual harassment in your FBI statement." You an-
swered, "I described the incidents. I did not use the term 'sexual
harassment.' "
  Let me go, if I might--and please just bear with me a couple of
minutes on this--let me go to your earlier statement today, your
sworn statement. You talked of Judge Thomas calling you into his
office and then saying, and I quote from your statement on page 3,

  After a brief discussion of work, he would turn the conversation to discussions of
sexual matters. His conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had
seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with ani-
mals and films showing group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic ma-
terials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various
sex acts.

  Now without saying whether you felt that his conduct met a spe-
cific statutory definition of harassment, tell us in your own words,
Professor Hill, after one of those conversations, how did you feel?

  Ms. HILL. I was embarrassed. I found this talk offensive, com-
pletely offensive. It was--I made the point that it was offensive and
it was something that was thrust upon me. It was not something
that I voluntarily entered into and, therefore, it was even more of-
fensive. It was--just the nature of the conversation was very offen-
sive and disgusting, and degrading.

  Senator LEAHY. Without going into a statutory description of
what is or is not sexual harassment, how did you feel after--and I
                                         113

quote from your statement, "on several occasions Thomas told me
graphically of his own sexual prowess."

  How did you feel then?
  Ms. HILL. That was really embarrassing because I thought it
even personalized it more to the individual who I was looking at. I
mean it is one thing to hear about something that someone has
seen, but it is another thing to be face-to-face with an individual
who is describing to you things that they have done and that was
very embarrassing and offensive and I did not like it. I felt, I just,
it was just, I mean it is hard for me to describe. It just made me
feel very bad about the whole situation.
   Senator LEAHY. And on page 5, without repeating it again, you
spoke of discussions he had had with you, about himself and other
women, is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

   Senator LEAHY. Professor Hill, you spoke of us all being lawyers
and we read the statute and the code words of the statute, let me
just ask you one more time, did you consider that, at least as it in-
volved you, harassment?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I did.

   Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
   Now, Professor, we have spoken in other questions of phone logs.
Have you seen the phone logs that Senator Danforth released; I be-
lieve the New York Times and the Washington Post and others
have had articles about them?
   Ms. HILL. Yes, I have seen that.
   Senator LEAHY. NOW, you left EEOC in 1983. Is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

   Senator LEAHY. Judge Thomas left EEOC in 1990. Is that correct?
   Ms. HILL. AS far as I recall.
   Senator LEAHY. Approximately 7 years there?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

   Senator LEAHY. If you count up the phone calls that are shown
on those phone logs--assuming that they are accurate--and that
amounts to, in the 7 years, what, a dozen phone calls?

   Ms. HILL. I think they were described as 10-to-12 or 10-to-ll
phone calls.

   Senator LEAHY. About one and a half per year?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

   Senator LEAHY. SO assuming those phone logs are accurate, you
were not exactly beating down the doors with phone calls there,
were you?

    Ms. HILL. I was not at all.

   Senator LEAHY. NOW, there was a question about Mr. Doggett. Do
you have any strong and clear recollection of Mr. Doggett at all?

    Ms. HILL. NO, not at all.

   Senator LEAHY. If you were asked to, would you be able to de-
scribe him accurately?

   Ms. HILL. I could not with any specificity describe him. I think I
remember him as being tall.

   Senator LEAHY. It happens to a lot of us.
   Who was the legal counsel at EEOC when you started there in
the spring of 1982?
   Ms. HILL. Legal counsel was Constance Dupre?.
                                         114

  Senator LEAHY. I beg your pardon?
  Ms. HILL. The legal counsel was, I believe, Constance Dupree at
the EEOC.
  Senator LEAHY. Did there come a time when there was a change
made in this position? After you went to EEOC?
  Ms. HILL. After I went to the EEOC, I believe she retired from
the Government service altogether, but she left that position.
  Senator LEAHY. Was it a short time after you arrived or a long
time after you arrived? Do you recall?
  Ms. HILL. Oh, I believe it was about mid-way, maybe 4 or 5
months, it may have been shorter than that.
  Senator LEAHY. Who became legal counsel then, do you recall?
  Ms. HILL. I do not recall the individual's name.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, in one of the interviews this morning a wit-
ness stated--and this was an interview for which you have not
seen the transcript but both the Republican and Democratic coun-
sel were there--the witness said that you had expressed your
desire to have the legal counsel's position. Had you done that, had
you expressed such a desire at the time that the vacancy occurred,
the one you just described?

  Ms. HILL. NO. I did not express any desire for that position. I had
no desire for such a position. I was just new to the EEOC.

  Senator LEAHY. SO did you have conversations with an Arm-
strong Williams about getting that job, the job of legal counsel?

   Ms. HILL. NO, I did not.

  Senator LEAHY. And you do not recall applying for the job of
legal counsel?

   Ms. HILL. I did not.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Senator Specter questioned you at some length about following
Judge Thomas from the Department of Education to the EEOC, is
that correct?

  Ms. HILL. Yes, that is correct.
  Senator LEAHY. And am I correct in restating your testimony
that those conversations, which you now describe as--just during
these questions--have described as harassment, those conversations
began at the Department of Education, is that correct?

  Ms. HILL. Yes, that is correct.
  Senator LEAHY. But notwithstanding that, you went to the EEOC
when Judge Thomas went there?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. DO you recall prior to going to the EEOC, how
long before that had been the last conversation of the nature that
you have described here with Judge Thomas? Of those conversa-
tions that you found offensive, how long prior to your transfer had
one of those occurred?

  Ms. HILL. I would say 4 months or so, about 4 months.
  Senator LEAHY. Some time, in fact.
  Ms. HILL. Some time.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, did anybody tell you that you could stay
and have a job at the Department of Education?
  Ms. HILL. Nobody told me that.
                                      115

  Senator LEAHY. Had President Reagan pledged and campaigned
on such a pledge that he would do away with the Department of
Education, if elected?

  Ms. HILL. Yes, he had, and that was the understanding within
the Department itself. The individuals who were working in the
Department understood that to be the case.

  Senator LEAHY. And President Reagan was then President?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, he was.

  Senator LEAHY. And nobody told you that there would be a job in
the Department of Education where you could still work in civil
rights, is that correct?

  Ms. HILL. Nobody told me that.
  Senator LEAHY. But you did want to work in civil rights, accord-
ing to your testimony?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I did.

  Senator LEAHY. NOW, walk me through again, please, what was
the nature of the job that would be available to you at EEOC, how
did you hear about it, what did you do to apply for it and so forth?

  Ms. HILL. I did not apply for it. I heard about it from Judge
Thomas. He indicated to me that I could go with him to the EEOC
and I would have the same type of position that I had at the De-
partment of Education.

  Senator LEAHY. And that was?
  Ms. HILL. That of a special assistant who would be working di-
rectly under him, advising him on a number of projects and issues
that came up.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, Professor Hill, you have told us of the con-
versations. In answering questions today you have elaborated even
on the statement that you gave us early on, is that correct?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I have.
  Senator LEAHY. IS there anything you would change, in either
your statement or your answers that you have given us today
about the kinds of conversations that you had with Judge Thomas
that you say were so offensive?
  Ms. HILL. NO, sir, I would not change anything.
  Senator LEAHY. HOW did you feel at the time that you had those
conversations?
  Ms. HILL. During the time that I had those conversations I was
very depressed. I was embarrassed by the type and the content of
the conversations. I was concerned about whether or not I could
continue in my position.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, that was years ago. As you recount them
today, how do you feel today?
  Ms. HILL. Today I feel more angry about the situation. Having
looked at it with hindsight I think it was very irresponsible for an
individual in the position of the kind of authority as was Mr.
Thomas, at the time, to engage in that kind of a conduct. It was
not only irresponsible, in my opinion, it was in violation of the law.
Now, I am much more divorced from it. I am less embarrassed by
the fact that I went through that, after having gone through what
I have gone through now, I am less embarrassed by it. It is still
embarrassing. It is embarrassing that I did not say anything, but I
am angrier about it and I think that it needs to be addressed by
this committee.
                                      116

  Senator LEAHY. DO you have anything to gain by coming here?
Has anybody promised you anything for coming forth with this
story now?

  Ms. HILL. I have nothing to gain. No one has promised me any-
thing. I have nothing to gain here. This has been disruptive of my
life and I have taken a number of personal risks. I have been
threatened and I have not gained anything except knowing that I
came forward and did what I felt that I had an obligation to do and
that was to tell the truth.

  Senator LEAHY. And my last question: Would your life be sim-
pler, quieter, far more private had you never come forth at all?

  Ms. HILL. Yes. Norman, OK is a much simpler, quieter place
than this room today.

  Senator LEAHY. I have a good friend in Norman, OK and I have
actually visited Norman, OK and I agree with you.

  Mr. Chairman, that is all I have.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. Senator Specter, do you want to proceed?
  Senator SPECTER. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  When my time expired we were up to the contact you had with
Mr. Brudney on September 9. If you could proceed from there to
recount who called you and what those conversations consisted of
as it led to your coming forward to the committee?
  Ms. HILL. Well, we discussed a number of different issues. We
discussed one, what he knew about the law on sexual harassment.
We discussed what he knew about the process for bringing informa-
tion forward to the committee. And in the course of our conversa-
tions Mr. Brudney asked me what were specifics about what it was
that I had experienced.
  In addition, we talked about the process for going forward. What
might happen if I did bring information to the committee. That in-
cluded that an investigation might take place, that I might be ques-
tioned by the committee in closed session. It even included some-
thing to the effect that the information might be presented to the
candidate or to the White House. There was some indication that
the candidate or, excuse me, the nominee might not wish to contin-
ue the process.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Brudney said to you that the nominee,
Judge Thomas, might not wish to continue the process if you came
forward with a statement on the factors which you have testified
about?
  Ms. HILL. Well, I am not sure that that is exactly what he said. I
think what he said was, depending on an investigation, a Senate,
whether the Senate went into closed session and so forth, it might
be that he might not wish to continue the process.
  Senator SPECTER. SO Mr. Brudney did tell you that Judge Thomas
might not wish to continue to go forward with his nomination, if
you came forward?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. Isn't that somewhat different from your testi-
mony this morning?

  Ms. HILL. My testimony this morning involved my response to
this USA newspaper report and the newspaper report suggested
that by making the allegations that that would be enough that the
                                      117

candidate would quietly and somehow withdraw from the process.
So, no, I do not believe that it is at variance. We talked about a
number of different options. But it was never suggested that just
by alleging incidents that that might, that that would cause the
nominee to withdraw.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, what more could you do than make alle-
gations as to what you said occurred?

  Ms. HILL. I could not do any more but this body could.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, but I am now looking at your distinguish-
ing what you have just testified to from what you testified to this
morning. This morning I had asked you about just one sentence
from the USA Today news, "Anita Hill was told by Senate Staffers
that her signed affidavit alleging sexual harassment by Clarence
Thomas would be the instrument that quietly and behind the
scenes would force him to withdraw his name."
  And now you are testifying that Mr. Brudney said that if you
came forward and made representations as to what you said hap-
pened between you and Judge Thomas, that Judge Thomas might
withdraw his nomination?
  Ms. HILL. I guess, Senator, the difference in what you are saying
and what I am saying is that that quote seems to indicate that
there would be no intermediate steps in the process. What we were
talking about was process. What could happen along the way.
What were the possibilities? Would there be a full hearing? Would
there be questioning from the FBI? Would there be questioning by
some individual Members of the Senate?
  We were not talking about or even speculating that simply alleg-
ing this would cause someone to withdraw.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, if your answer now turns on process, all I
can say is that it would have been much shorter had you said, at
the outset, that Mr. Brudney told you that if you came forward,
Judge Thomas might withdraw. That is the essence as to what oc-
curred.
  Ms. HILL. NO, it is not. I think we differ on our interpretation of
what I said.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, what am I missing here?
  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, can we let the witness speak
in her own words, rather than having words put in her mouth?
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, I object to that. I object to that
vociferously. I am asking questions here. If Senator Kennedy has
anything to say let him participate in this hearing.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let everybody calm down. Professor Hill,
give your interpretation to what was asked by Senator Specter.
And then he can ask you further questions.
  Ms. HILL. My interpretation
  Senator THURMOND. Speak into the microphone, so we can hear
you.
  Ms. HILL [continuing], I understood Mr. Specter's question to be
what kinds of conversation did I have regarding this information. I
was attempting, in talking to the staff, to understand how the in-
formation would be used, what I would have to do, what might be
the outcome of such a use. We talked about a number of possibili-
ties, but there was never any indication that, by simply making
                                      118

these allegations, the nominee would withdraw from the process.
No one ever said that and I did not say that anyone ever said that.

  We talked about the form that the statement would come in, we
talked about the process that might be undertaken post-statement,
and we talked about the possibilities of outcomes, and included in
that possibility of outcome was that the committee could decide to
review the point and that the nomination, the vote could continue,
as it did.

  Senator SPECTER. SO that, at some point in the process, Judge
Thomas might withdraw?

  Ms. HILL. Again, I would have to respectfully say that is not
what I said. That was one of the possibilities, but it would not come
from a simple, my simply making an allegation.

  Senator SPECTER. Professor Hill, is that what you meant, when
you said earlier, as best I could write it down, that you would con-
trol it, so it would not get to this point?

  Ms. HILL. Pardon me?
  Senator SPECTER. IS that what you meant, when you responded
earlier to Senator Biden, that the situation would be controlled "so
that it would not get to this point in the hearings"?
  Ms. HILL. Of the public hearing. In entering into these conversa-
tions with the staff members, what I was trying to do was control
this information, yes, so that it would not get to this point.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Now, Professor Hill, with your continued indulgence, I will yield
to my colleagues, alternating, and limit their questions to 5 min-
utes, if I may, and I would begin with my friend from Massachu-
setts, Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will just take a
moment.
  I know this has been an extraordinary long day for you, Profes-
sor Hill, and it obviously has been for Judge Thomas, as well, and I
know for your family. I just want to pay tribute to both your cour-
age in this whole procedure and for your eloquence and for the dig-
nity with which you have conducted yourself, and, as is quite clear,
from observing your comments, for the anguish and pain which
you have had to experience today in sharing with millions of Amer-
icans. This has been a service and we clearly have to make a judg-
ment. It certainly I think has been a very important service.
  Let me just say, as far as I am concerned, I think it has been
enormously important to millions of Americans. I do not think that
this country is ever going to look at sexual harassment the same
tomorrow as it has any time in its past. If we are able to make
some progress on it, I think history books will show that, to a very
important extent, it is because of your action.
  The viciousness of harassment is real, it is experienced by mil-
lions of people as a form of sex discrimination, and I think all of us
are hopeful that we can make progress on it, and I just want you to
know that I believe that you have made an important contribution,
if we do.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Ms. HILL. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
                                      119

  Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, I appointed Senator Specter to question Professor
Hill and those supporting her, so I will now yield my time to him.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, with an additional yielding, Mr. Chair-
man, I would just join in thanking Professor Hill for coming for-
ward. I would join in the comment that this proceeding has been
illuminating to tell America what is the law on sexual harassment.
That is something which had not been known. From what I have
heard in the last few days, there has been a lot of change in con-
duct in the workplace in this country.
  I just would have wished, in retrospect, that we had done this
earlier and that this educational process had not come in this
forum on a Supreme Court nominee at this stage. But you have an-
swered the questions and I join in thanking you for that.
  Ms. HILL. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. MS. Hill, I could not help but think of my
own four daughters, as you sat there, and thought to myself how
much courage and commitment and concern, but even more, the
valor you possess to come before the U.S. Senate and speak out in
areas so sensitive, and I am sure are so difficult for you to talk
about.
  I do not know what impact your testimony will have on the con-
firmation process, but I know that your testimony will have a tre-
mendous impact on this Nation from henceforth. The women of
this country, I am certain, owe you a fantastic debt of gratitude for
bringing this issue of sexual harassment to the fore.
  But as one of those 98 men in the U.S. Senate, I think I speak for
all of us when I say we owe you a debt of gratitude, as well, for
bringing this issue up to the fore, in a more striking, more sympa-
thetic, more concerned manner than ever before. I think you have
made this Nation, men and women alike, more enlightened, more
aware, more sensitive, and the Nation will never be the same,
thanks to you.
  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. There will be order in the chamber. I am serious
when I say that, any outburst at all, no matter how small, will
result in police removing whomever does it from the chamber.
  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I have been pleased to sit here and listen today, and I just want
to say one thing, that I apologize to you on behalf of our committee
that you had to be heard under these circumstances, because had
the committee considered this matter--and I have to say that
Chairman Biden and ranking member Thurmond, when they heard
about this the first time, they immediately ordered this FBI inves-
tigation, which was the very right thing to do, it was the appropri-
ate thing to do and they did what every other chairman and rank-
ing member have done in the past, and the investigation was done
and it was a good investigation.
  Then Chairman Biden notified everybody on his side and many
of us were notified, as well. Any member of the committee, before
we voted, could have put this over for a week for consideration, if
                                         120

they were concerned. Any member could have insisted on at least
an executive session, where neither of you would have had to have
appeared in public, or any member could have insisted on an open
session. The committee could have voted.

  These FBI reports are extremely important and they have raw
data, raw information. They take down what people tell them and
that is why they are not to be leaked to the press or anywhere else,
and that is why these rules are so important. And had an appropri-
ate, fair procedure been followed, you would not have been dragged
through the media and through all of these other things that both
of you have been dragged through, that both of you have suffered
from, as you have.

  I have to say that I hope I never see that happen again to any-
body in any confirmation proceeding, let alone a confirmation for a
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States of America.

  Having said that, I wish you well and I won't make any further
comments at this time.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Hill, I join in realizing the difficulty of today's proceed-
ings. It is very obvious and I appreciate that immensely. Sexual
harassment is not as new as maybe some members seem to think it
is. I just remember, as a young boy, my mother telling me about
sexual harassment on her job and losing her job when she was 22
years old. So I grew up with that in my mind. She mentioned it
several times as I grew in age.

  I had dinner with her the night before last and she got choked
up just telling me again about it 60 years later.

  So, it is a subject that is very sensitive. Obviously, men have a
more difficult time, I believe, of understanding it, but I do believe
there are many men in this Senate, in the House of Representa-
tives and other political offices that indeed are sensitive as much
as a man can be.

  Now, one of the areas that intrigued me today was Senator Hef-
lin's questions of motives. I am not at all indicating any diminution
of your motive, but I am interested in your answers to some of
those.

  Before I ask you that, do you see anything positive coming out of
what you have been through here today and the last week or so of
this ordeal, other than increasing the awareness of sexual harass-
ment in the workplace? Is there any single thing you see more sig-
nificant than that coming out of this?

  Ms. HILL. Yes, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. What do you see as the most significant
public thing coming out of this unfortunate experience that you
have had to go through now?
  Ms. HILL. Other than creating awareness, I see that the informa-
tion is going to be fully explored, the information that I provided
will be fully explored, it will be given a full hearing. In addition, I
think that coming out, my coming forward may encourage other
people to come forward, other people who have had the same expe-
riences who have not been able to talk about them.
                                         121

  Senator DECONCINI. That would be raising the awareness of
sexual harassment in the public.

  Ms. HILL. Raising the awareness, but also giving people courage.
  Senator DECONCINI. And giving people the courage to step for-
ward and do what you did not do 10 years ago or 6 years ago or
even 2 years ago, but you are doing today?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator DECONCINI. IS your motive also an attempt to clear your
name from any degrading publicity that has occurred? Do you feel
put upon? Do you feel exposed?

  Mr. HILL. Coming here today?
  Senator DECONCINI. DO you feel injured and damaged as a result
of this, even though you obviously have committed yourself to pro-
ceed with it?
  Ms. HILL. YOU mean my motive in coming here today or some-
thing that I think will be a positive thing from coming here today?
  Senator DECONCINI. NO, I mean is your motive also to help clari-
fy to the public your own position on sexual harassment, due to the
publicity that has resulted from this being brought up to the fore-
front? Is that one of your motives? Is that one of the reasons you
came forward? In other words, was your reputation one of the rea-
sons you came forward. Do you feel that your reputation was being
degraded or impugned by the fact that this was printed all over the
press and that people were making countercharges and questioning
your motives, and what have you? Is that one of the reasons?
  Ms. HILL. I definitely--coming here today, yes, I did want to ac-
complish that. There were a number of very ugly and nasty things
that have been said, and I did want to come forward and tell my
side.
  Senator DECONCINI. DO you think, now having told your side and
responded to these questions, that your reputation from your
standpoint could ever be fully restored?
  Ms. HILL. Not in the minds of many, never, it will not be.
  Senator DECONCINI. And in your opinion, Professor Hill, is there
any single group or entity that you think caused more damage to
you? I am interested in your perception. It seems to me that those
who leaked this information certainly caused damage. The press, in
my opinion, should be on trial, because they did not have to print
this, but they elected to do so. In this country, as we all know they
can print anything they want, true or false. Then the committee
made a judgment to not address these allegations, and I think that
is certainly on trial.
  Obviously, Judge Thomas is on trial, though this is not a trial.
You are on trial, in the sense of credibility here. Is the committee
more culpable for causing you to have to come forward, is the press
more culpable, or is everyone equally culpable?
   Ms. HILL. I think it is just the reality, Senator, of this situation,
the nature of this complaint and I cannot point my finger at any
one entity and say you are responsible for it.
   Senator DECONCINI. But you said earlier--and correct me if I am
wrong--that you did not want today to be what it is, that you had
hoped that you could just get the information to this committee,
and ultimately you agreed that your name could be used only
among the committee members. You had hoped that that would be

          56-273 0--93-
                                      122

sufficient for the members to make a judgment, and that you
would not have to do what you are doing today. Is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator DECONCINI. Yes. Now, that did not happen or we would
not be here today. Would you repeat why you think we are here?
Why did you have to come forward and make this public presenta-
tion, when you had hoped just to bring this information to the com-
mittee, without having to do what you are doing today?

  Ms. HILL. Well, I think that there are a number of factors. I
think that however the material was leaked, that was one factor. I
believe that the press is a factor, but I think, in addition, that the
information is just going before the public that wants to know and
wants to know about this, and so I think, again, there is a variety
of situations and factors that caused this to occur today.

  Senator DECONCINI. Let me ask you this, if I can, Professor Hill:
If this information had not been leaked, would you have come for-
ward in this public forum?

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  Senator DECONCINI. If the press had not published or read your
statement to you, and left you with the distinct impression that
they were going to publish it, would you still have felt obligated to
come forward in this public way?

  Ms. HILL. I do not believe that I would have come forward.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU would not have come forward.
  Ms. HILL. I do not believe I would have.
  Senator DECONCINI. SO, it is safe to say that because the informa-
tion was first leaked and then made public, that you felt that you
no longer could proceed with what you originally felt was proper,
which was making the information available only to the committee
and not in a public forum. Is that a fair statement?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. I won't be very much longer.
  Another concern I have is, when you were at the Department of
Education and these, in my terms, God-awful things occurred--gro-
tesque, ugly, I don't know how else I can depict them. Obviously
they were extremely offensive, and you did not want them to con-
tinue, so you attempted to inform the person that you didn't want
them to continue. I have a difficult time understanding, and it is
obviously because I am not a woman and have not had that kind of
personal experience, I have a difficult time understanding, but how
could you tolerate that treatment, even though you didn't have an-
other job? I realize that this is part of the whole problem of sexual
harassment in the work place, the fact that women tolerate it.
  Maybe you explained this sufficiently, but if you wouldn't mind
repeating to me what went through your mind: Why, No. 1, you
would stay there after this happened several times; and, No. 2,
even though it ceased for a few months, why you would proceed on
to another job with someone that hadn't just asked you out and
pressed you, but had gotten into the explanations and explorations
of the anatomy with you?
  Ms. HILL. Well, I think it is very difficult to understand, Senator,
and in hindsight it is even difficult for me to understand, but I
have to take the situation as it existed at that time. At that time,
staying seemed the only reasonable choice. At that time, staying
                                      123

was the way that--in a way, a choice that I made because I wanted
to do the work. I in fact believed that I could make that choice to
do the work, and that is what I wanted to do, and I did not want to
let that kind of behavior control my choices.

  So I attempted to end the behavior, and for some time the behav-
ior did stop. I attempted to make that effort. And so the choice to
continue with the same person to another agency involved a belief
that I had stopped the behavior that was offensive.

  Senator DECONCINI. IS it safe to say, then, Ms. Hill--based on the
readings that I have done in this area by professionals who counsel
on it--that you were willing to stuff this inside you and go on with
your life and keep it from exploding?

  Is that a safe assumption? We all have done that under different
circumstances. We stuff certain things in and don't explode or
react. Is that one way of describing what you did?

  Ms. HILL. I did repress a number of my feelings about it, to allow
myself to go on and to continue.

  Senator DECONCINI. IS it safe to say that you did this for a long
period of time?

   Ms. HILL. Yes, I did.

  Senator DECONCINI. And you obviously saw Chairman Thomas
move on to bigger and better positions, including being appointed
to an appellate court judge, and still you did not take any action.
Did you, at that time, again repress your feelings and have to keep
it down? Do you recall going through that any other time?

  Ms. HILL. Well, at some point over the last few years, or at vari-
ous points, I think that I have dealt with many of my repressed
feelings about this. I have just dealt with them on my own.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU didn't hire or solicit any counseling or
any assistance. You just dealt with it on your own?

  Ms. HILL. Dealt with them on my own.
  Senator DECONCINI. And finally we are here today where it is all
over, so to speak. It is all out, not that by any means there won't
be repercussions, but you finally have let it all out.
  Ms. HILL. Well, that is my feeling, but one has to consider that
even before this point I had dealt with the feelings of humiliation,
realizing that none of this was my fault, and had dealt with a sense
that I was helpless to confront this kind of a situation again, so
many of the feelings have been dealt with.
  Senator DECONCINI. And the fact that you admit that in retro-
spect maybe you should have done something, do you conclude that
it is all someone else's fault, and not your own?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator DECONCINI. IS that your frame of mind?
  Ms. HILL. That is my frame of mind.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the additional
time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, there are two additional documents here, and I
am asking and take your advice, from the two FBI agents who
are--if this has been furnished for over two hours under the
                                      124

rules--the affidavits from the two FBI agents indicating the incon-
sistencies as expressed by Professor Hill this morning. Is that not
appropriate?

  The CHAIRMAN. It is appropriate. The inconsistences are not of
all that much consequence. At some point maybe we should read it.
I think it may be helpful for you to read the entire thing in the
record.

  Senator SIMPSON. I only have 5 minutes, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, no. Well, you go ahead and put it in the
record and I will read them, because they are not of much conse-
quence, but--let me put it this way--I think people should know
what they say.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think that they should know that the
witness did not say anything to the FBI about the described size of
his penis, the description of the movie "Long Dong Silver," about
the pubic hair in the Coke story, and describing giving pleasure to
women with oral sex. That is not part of the original FBI report.
And the agents are simply saying that there was no pressure upon
the witness, and they specifically say--the woman FBI Agent par-
ticularly said that she was quite clear that she did not care wheth-
er it was general or specific.
  The interviewing Special Agent, a woman, said that if the subject
was too embarrassing, she did not have to answer, that was Profes-
sor Hill's statement, but the Special Agent said that she, the other
agent, apologized for the sensitivity of the matter but advised Pro-
fessor Hill that she should be as specific as possible and give de-
tails. She was further advised that if the questions were too embar-
rassing, Special Agent Luton would leave the room and she could
discuss the matter with Special Agent Jameson.
  I think that is appropriate only from the standpoint that you de-
scribe in your statement so poignantly that these were disgusting
things, and yet they did not appear in the FBI report. That is
enough. We will enter it into the record.
  [The statement referred to follows:]

                      Special Agent JOHN B. LUTON, Federal Bureau of
   Investigation, Oklahoma city, Oklahoma, watched th* morning session of
   testimony by Professor ANITA FAYB HILL, before the U. S. Senate,
   Judiciary Committee, Washington, D.C., on October XX, 1991. The
   following discrepancies were noted regarding her testimony whan
   coapared to the statement she provided Speoial Agents JOHN B. LUTON
   and JOLBKB SMITH JAMESON, September 23, 1991.

                      Professor HILL stated that she was advised by the
   interviewing Agent that she did not have to answer questions if they
   were too embarrassing as she would possibly be re-interviewed by FBI
   Agents at a later date. In fact, she was told by Speoial Agent LUTON
   to provide the specifics of all incidents. She was also told that it
   might be necessary to re-interview her at a later time regarding this
   matter, but that occurred at the end of the interview.

                      During Professor HILL'S testimony before the senate
   Judiciary Committee, she referred to numerous telephonic contacts with
    representatives of that committee regarding her allegations prior to
   preparing the Signed Statement. On September 23, 1991, she was asked
   by the interviewing Special Agents as to what her motivation was for
    submitting her statement to the Judiciary Committee. She advised the
    interviewing Agents that she made the decision to prepare the
    statement after several telephone conversations with her personal
    friend, SUSAN H O E S C H N E R . The last telephone conversation between her
    and HOBSCHNER was on a Sunday prior to her preparation of her
    statement. She did not mention the telephone conversations that she
   had had with representatives of the Judiciary Committee.

                       Professor HILL in her testimony identified a number of
    specific incidents in which Judge CLARENCE THOMAS made embarrassing
    comments to her about sexual activities. Among these was the
    reftrenoe to Judge T H O M A S ' sexual prowess and sise. She made
    referenoe to a pornographic movie in whioh an individual by the name
    of LONG DOWG SILVER played a role. She cited an instance in which she
    was in his office and he referred to a coke can and made the
    statement, "Who left their pubic hair on my coke," or words to that
    effect. During th* interview on September 23, 1991, Professor HILL
    did not mention any of the above incidents.

                      Special Agent (SA) JOLENE SMITH JAMESON observed tha morning
   session of testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee by Professor
   ANITA HILL as it was broadcast on CNN on October 11, 1991. During
   that broadcast, Professor HILL made comments that were in
   contradiction with statements she had made to S A S JAMESON and JOHN B.
   LUTON. Those contradictory comments are set forth as follows:

                      Professor HILL stated she did not discuss specific incidents
   in detail because the interviewing Special Agent had advised her that,
   if the subject was too embarrassing, she did not have to answer. In
   fact, SA LUTON apologized for the sensitivity of the matter, but
   advised Professor HILL that she should be as specific as possible and
   give details. She was further advised if the questions were too
   embarrassing, SA LUTON would leave the room and she could discuss the
   matter with SA JAMESON.

                      During the interview with the SAs, Professor HILL stated she
   could only recall specifics regarding the pornographic incidents
   involving people in sex acts with each other and with animals. Ms.
   KILL never mentioned Judge THOMAS saying how well endowed he was.
   HILL never mentioned or referred to a person named "Long Dong silver"
   or any incident involving a Coke can, all of which she testified to
   before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

                      Professor HILL stated she had been advised early in the
   interview that SA LUTON would reoontact her at a later time to obtain
   more specific details. In fact, SA 'LUTON advised Professor HILL, only
   at the termination of the interview, that a follow up interview might
   bt necessary if further questions arose.

  The CHAIRMAN. I realize that the way we are doing this is a bit
unusual. My recollection was, that the witness had acknowledged
that they did not appear in the report, and had acknowledged that
she had not said that to the agents, as well.

  Ms. HILL. That is true.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, you have your opportunity

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I just wanted to mention this now because
this is unusual, and she hasn't had a chance to see it. Please con-
tinue.

  Senator SIMPSON. YOU are very fair.
  Let me ask you, I think both of you say that you--both Judge
Thomas and you say you never met each other until 1981. Is that
correct?
  Ms. HILL. That is correct.
  Senator SIMPSON. Weren't you both members of the Black Repub-
lican Congressional Staff Association?

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  Senator SIMPSON. YOU never were?
  Ms. HILL. NO, I never was.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I don't have enough time to go into that
one. I had heard you were, and that you knew him there, and other
people stated that, and perhaps--that is what I was advised by a
person who called me who knew you both, and was there with you
both, but that is enough.
  I am not leaving that out there as some sinister thing. I am just
trying to find out if you knew each other before, because I heard
that because he knew you there and respected you and enjoyed you
there and found you very professional, that it was there he made
the contact to then bring you to the Department of Education.
  Ms. HILL. Which group is this?
  Senator SIMPSON. The Black Republican Congressional Staff As-
sociation.
  Ms. HILL. NO, I am not a member of that. I have never been a
member of that group.
  Senator SIMPSON. In 1970, 1979, or 1980, some time in there
  Ms. HILL. I was in law school in 1979 and 1980.
  Senator SIMPSON. Eighty and eighty-one?
  Ms. HILL. In eighty, I graduated from law school in 1980 and
went to work in private practice here in Washington, DC.
  Senator SIMPSON. OK, that's good. Thank you. That was present-
ed to me.
  Now I heard Howard Metzenbaum say, and you have presented
yourself and your testimony in an extraordinary way. I did think
that Senator Specter pointed out some inconsistencies. But like
Howard, I thought too of my daughter, my rainbow of life, and I
would be outraged if such alleged conduct occurred directed to her.
  And then I have had the terrible pain of also thinking of my
sons, raised by a very enlightened mother, responsive, still kiss
their old man good night and things like that, and rather expan-
sive, stalwart boys, and where that kind of conduct could lead
them--very troubling for me. Because all we have heard for 103
days is about a most remarkable man, and nobody has come for-
ward, and they scoured his every shred of life, and nobody but you
                             128

and another witness, apparently who is alleging no sexual harass-
ment, has come forward.

  And so maybe, maybe, it seems to me you didn't really intend to
kill him, but you might have. And that is pretty heavy, I don't care
if you are a man or a woman, to know that 43 years or 35 years of
your life or 60 years of your life, where no one has corroborated
what is a devastating charge, kind of a singular torpedo below the
water line and he sinks, while 103 days of accumulated things
never penetrated the armor.

  So I guess I would just say it is a very troubling thing to me, it
really is, and leave out who leaked what to who or what media
person let it out. That all will be hashed. But let me tell you, if
what you say this man said to you occurred, why in God's name,
when he left his position of power or status or authority over you,
and you left in 1983, why in God's name would you ever speak to a
man like that the rest of your life?

  Ms. HILL. That is a very good question, and I am sure that I
cannot answer that to your satisfaction. That is one of the things
that I have tried to do today. I have suggested that I was afraid of
retaliation, I was afraid of damage to my professional life, and I
believe that you have to understand that this response--and that is
one of the things that I have come to understand about harass-
ment--that this response, this kind of response, is not atypical, and
I can't explain. It takes an expert in psychology to explain how
that can happen, but it can happen, because it happened to me.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, it just seems so incredible to me that you
would not only have visited with him twice after that period and
after he was no longer able to manipulate you or to destroy you,
that you then not only visited with him but took him to the air-
port, and then 11 times contacted him. That part of it appalls me. I
would think that these things, what you describe, are so repugnant,
so ugly, so obscene, that you would never have talked to him again,
and that is the most contradictory and puzzling thing for me.

The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  First, Professor Hill, let me say to your parents, you have a
daughter you ought to be very, very proud of. I am sure you are
proud of your whole family.

  I want to underscore what has been said by my colleagues. You
have shown great courage and you have handled yourself with dig-
nity, and you have lifted the level of consideration of this whole
question of sexual harassment as no one has done before in the his-
tory of our country. No matter what happens on the nomination, I
think you have performed a real public service.
  On the question of sexual harassment, you and I know and the
members of this committee know that physical contact is not neces-
sary for sexual harassment, but I have had two people tell me over
the phone that there couldn't have been sexual harassment be-
cause there was no physical] contact. If I can use another analogy
that I think people would/Understand, if you were to receive the
kind of language over the telephone that you received in an office,
would you consider that an obscene phone call?

Ms. HILL. Yes.  i
                                         129

  Senator SIMON. And I think everyone understands obscene phone
calls.

  Let me just ask two totally disconnected questions beyond this:
You say in your statement, "In February, 1983 I was hospitalized
for five days on an emergency basis for an acute stomach pain
which I attributed to stress on the job." One of the things we have
to do in this committee, and my colleagues in the Senate have to
do, is to make an evaluation, who is telling the truth? This is some-
thing objective that happened out there. But when you say "which
I attributed to stress on the job," did your physician also suggest
this as a possibility?

  Ms. HILL. My physician suggested that it could be stress-related.
They could not identify the nature of the illness. They couldn't give
a medical diagnosis, so the physician did suggest that it might be
stress related.

  Senator SIMON. And then, finally--and this has been partially
touched upon--but there are those who say the timing of this is all
some kind of a plot. That is the term I hear over and over.

  I recall calling you the day before our committee voted, when we
talked about the possibility of distributing this, your statement, to
Members of the Senate, and I said, "You can't do that and keep it
confidential, and keep your name confidential." I sensed that you
were really agonizing on this whole thing, and I think I sensed cor-
rectly, for obvious reasons.

  But this thing gradually built, from the time you first contacted
or had contact with the members of the Senate staff and Senate
committee. Was there at any point anyone who suggested, "If you
hold this out until the last minute, you could have a great impact
on this process?"

  Ms. HILL. NO one ever suggested that, not at all.
   Senator SIMON. And then finally let me just make a suggestion.
You are always giving assignments to students at the University of
Oklahoma Law School.
   If I could give you and your fellow faculty members at the Uni-
versity of Oklahoma Law School and your law students an assign-
ment, we face a very difficult problem, and it is not just with the
Thomas nomination. How do we deal with a charge that someone
makes, that is a substantial charge, but that person says, "I don't
want my name used publicly," or even "I don't want the charge
made publicly"? We should not simply ignore it. On the other
hand, how are you fair to a nominee?

   This is the struggle that this committee has gone through and
the Senate is going through. I would be interested in you and your
colleagues taking a look at that, sending a letter to members of
this committee. But again I thank you. I think you have performed
a great public service.

   Ms. HILL. Thank you.
   Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Senator Grassley.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Professor Hill, let me at the outset be very
candid and tell you that even though the issues that have been dis-
cussed here this afternoon and this morning are very, very impor-
tant, if I had to ask some of these questions that were asked of you
                                      130

today/1 would not be able to do that. It is just not my nature. But I
have one question and a couple of comments.

  This is in regard to your testifying that you were approached by
Senate staff members about disclosing these allegations. My ques-
tion is whether or not any other individuals or any other organiza-
tions other than those who you publicly stated today or otherwise,
or Senator Specter stated, whether any other individuals or organi-
zations have approached you about disclosing these matters to the
Judiciary Committee any time since Judge Thomas was nominated
by the President on July 1st?

  Ms. HILL. NO. NO other individual, no other organizations or indi-
viduals have approached me to disclose this to anyone. Do you
mean prior to the contact from this or even after that?

  Senator GRASSLEY. Or any time during July, August, or Septem-
ber, other than all those names that have already been discussed
here today?

  Ms. HILL. NO. NO one has urged me to do that or even ap-
proached me about it.

  Senator GRASSLEY. OK.
  Now, a couple of points that I would like to make and I suppose I
am making these more for my colleagues than I am for anybody
else. But one of the hardest parts of this discussion for me is the
fact that if any Senate employee had a complaint of sex harass-
ment that individual would not have the same remedy that you
had available to you, Professor Hill, when you were an employee of
Government, particularly, EEOC, although I know you chose not to
pursue that remedy. Because, like so many laws that we pass, the
U.S. Senate has exempted itself, as an employer, from the coverage
of title VII, including the EEOC rules governing sex harassment.
That is a situation that I hope the Senate will soon change so that
our employees will be treated fairly just like any other employees.
  On another point there has been much said--and, of course, each
of us on this committee have had to deal with this, as the press has
asked us how come we did not consider all of these things prior to
voting this out of committee. This concerns the process of the Judi-
ciary Committee. People are asking how we could have let your
statement slip past us? How could we have had the committee vote
without airing this matter? Those are valid questions.
  And let me say that I am going to work towards assuring that
this never happens again. I realize, of course, that our committee
gets hundreds, maybe even thousands of allegations in a nomina-
tion like this one. And we rely upon our chairman and ranking
member to determine which ones need investigation and which
ones might be coming from cranks and crackpots. They determined
this one needed investigation and they called in the FBI. But some-
where along the process something broke down.
  So I would like to work with the chairman and ranking member
and other colleagues to establish a new ground rule. Whenever the
FBI is dispatched, every committee member should be notified
about the nature of the allegation. And when the FBI has complet-
ed its work, every committee member should be notified and have
access to that report. And a determination by the committee
should be made as to how we need to proceed with any allegations.
                                      131

  A rule like this should ensure, once and for all, that even an
11th hour charge, like yours, has been fully considered.

  I yield the floor.
  You can comment if you want to.
  Ms. HILL. I would like, for a moment, to revisit your first ques-
tion. I am keenly aware that I want to be certain of my answers.
The first question was whether or not anyone had contacted me to
urge me to come forward with this?
  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes.
  Ms. HILL. NO. NO one did that. Ms. Hirschener did contact me
and reminded me of the situation and we discussed the fact that we
had talked about this in earlier years but she did not urge me to
come forward at all.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Thank you, very much. Of course
the state of the law actually is that women, even in these kinds of
situations, don't have adequate remedies. All they have is an in-
junction. They are not permitted to get any damages which is one
of the matters that is being addressed in the Civil Rights Bill.
  The Senator from Wisconsin.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Hill, as you said, this has been a difficult time for you.
You wanted to make the committee aware of your experiences with
Clarence Thomas but you also wanted to preserve your privacy and
that is understandable and we deeply regret that it has not worked
out that way. But while the process may have failed you, Professor
Hill, you certainly have not failed the process.
  For without making, at this time, any judgments about the ulti-
mate truth of your claims we can make a certain judgment about
the value of the public discussions that your claims have created.
All of us have learned a great deal about and become more sensi-
tive to the problem of sexual harassment and inappropriate behav-
ior. The issue is complex and our understanding may never be com-
plete, but your perception of your relationship with Judge Thomas
is clear in your own mind, and your courage in coming forward and
the composure you have demonstrated since this issue became
public all speak to your character.
  I am sure this has been very painful for you, as it has been for
all of us, but I believe the pain will vastly improve the way that
men and women respond to this problem throughout our country.
  Thank you, very much.
  Ms. HILL. Thank you, Senator Kohl.
  Senator THURMOND. Senator Brown is next on my side.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman
  Professor Hill, you were kind enough to take my call earlier this
week and you were very forthcoming and I appreciated that and
the information you provided. I had a few additional questions that
I thought might be helpful that I would bring up.
  My impression was that calls from the staff that had originally
prompted you to begin thinking about making a statement includ-
ed not only questions about sexual harassment but had actually
implied to you that there were rumors circulating about sexual
harassment at the EEOC and even a suggestion that there might
be rumors to sexual harassment related to you.
                                      132

  Now, could you share your view of what those rumors were or
what they had suggested to you in those calls?

  Ms. HILL. Well, when I received the calls I assumed that someone
had known about the incidents as they were occurring who I did
not know, who might have contacted the offices that called me. So
when the statements were made and the questions were asked, I
assumed that it was someone who knew that these things had hap-
pened and that they had come forward to the committee or to the
individuals who were calling and that they were following up on
that.

  Senator BROWN. I guess what had occurred to me when I heard
that description from you was that, at least the inference in my
mind, was that the fact that there were stories or there could be
stories circulating relating to sexual harassment, and perhaps the
sexual harassment toward you, that that was one of the factors
that encouraged you to come forward?

  Ms. HILL. That was definitely one of the factors. I did not want
the committee to rely on rumors. I did not want the rumors to per-
haps circulate through the press without at least considering the
possibilities or exploring the possibilities through the committee
process of coming forward. So, yes, that call, those calls and that
raising the issue with me very much encouraged me to further ex-
plore the process to determine how and if I could come forward.

  Senator BROWN. YOU mentioned that you talked to several staff-
ers and then eventually made a decision to come forward and you
chatted with the committee and had a variety of conversations
there. Were there others that you talked to after you talked to
those two staffers and before you decided to speak to the commit-
tee?

  Ms. HILL. I talked with personal friends. I talked with individ-
uals who knew more about Title VII law than I did.

  Senator BROWN. But I take it none of these conversations includ-
ed people who were actively opposing the nomination?

   Ms. HILL. NO.

  Senator BROWN. On the employment question, I thought I would
go back to it. I must tell you that my own impression is that I
think if you have a job you are reluctant to leave it without some
other offers, but I thought it might be helpful to put a cap on that.
At the point that Judge Thomas was leaving the Department of
Education and had invited you to accompany him or go with him
in terms of a job assignment over to the EEOC. Did you contact
anyone in the private sector for a job? You have already talked
about not exploring alternatives within the Education Department,
but did you contact anyone about a job at that point?

  Ms. HILL. I did not contact anyone in the private sector. I had
left the private sector 9 months earlier and decided that I did not
want to return at that point, to the private sector.

  Senator BROWN. At the point that the harassment, or at least the
harassment was alleged to have taken place at the Department,
Education Department, did you begin to explore job opportunities
at that point? As I understand that was a point sometime before
the decision to leave?

  Ms. HILL. NO. I did not explore. I may have read Government
 ~intouts but I did not actively look for another job.
                      133

Senator BROWN. With regard to the Judge, himself, you clearly,
in working with him as you had, were familiar with a portion of
his philosophy. Do you find you were in agreement with his philos-
ophy on most issues proposed? What can you share with us on
that?
  Ms. HILL. Well, I am not really sure what his philosophy on
many issues is. And so I can't say that I am in agreement or dis-
agreement. I can say that during the times that we were there
were, worked together, there were matters that we agreed on and
some that we did not agree on and we had discussions about those
matters.

But I am not really certain what his philosophies are at this
point.
Senator BROWN. Would that be the case with regard to say, abor-
tion or Roe v. Wade?
  Ms. HILL. That I am not sure of his philosophies?
  Senator BROWN. Sure of his philosophy or do you perceive a sig-
nificant difference between the two of you in that area?

Ms. HILL. Yes.
  Senator BROWN. Can you tell us what that might be? I don't
mean to pressure you here. If you would prefer not to, please don't.
But if there is something that you could share with us in that area,
I think the committee would like to hear it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, from Judge Thomas' position this was
supposed to relate to issues of harassment, and was not intended to
be an investigation of Judge Thomas' views on abortion.
  Senator BROWN. Mr. Chairman, you are perfectly correct. If
there were something that wished to be offered there I thought it
would be helpful.
I see the red light is on so I will conclude.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, two of our primary questioners also want
to take an additional 5 minutes. Senator Leahy and then Senator
Specter.
  Senator LEAHY. I will be very brief. I know that everyone is
tired. Professor Hill, you were asked questions by Senator Simpson
this afternoon regarding the FBI report, which I believe you were
shown, and about the question of whether there may be some in-
consistencies. Everybody has to determine whether they feel there
are or are not, I make no statement to that. Basically, the thrust
was that you were less specific about these incidents--the language
and the description of these two incidents--when you talked to the
two agents than you were in your statement, here today.

  Let me just ask   jtuhsret eanosrwfeoru,r"yvees"r>y  quick questions  and  I  think
probably you could                                     or "no .
The statement that you made here today was made under oath,
is that correct?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. And that statement was more specific than the
conversation that you had with the FBI agents, is that correct?
  Ms. HILL. Yes, I agree.
  Senator LEAHY. And when specific questions were asked by dif-
ferent Senators about that, you went into even more specific de-
tails of the language that you say that Judge Thomas used, is that
correct?
                                      134

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. And if there had been even more questions going
specifically conversation-by-conversation it would be safe to say
that you would have had even more specific language?

  Ms. HILL. I would have attempted to.
  Senator LEAHY. It would be safe to say, also, that you found it
uncomfortable repeating even the language that we elicited from
you in the questions?

   Ms. HILL. Yes.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  I have no further questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Just a word or two. Professor Hill, when you say that by hind-
sight--because I wrote this down, it is difficult for me to under-
stand. In looking at the entire record, it is difficult for me to under-
stand. You have substantially enlarged a testimony which I had ex-
pected based on the FBI report and your statement as to what you
allege Judge Thomas had done. The critical move from the Depart-
ment of Education to the EEOC is not understandable to me, where
you make the statements about his offensive conduct. For an expe-
rienced lawyer not to inquire about standing or even an inexperi-
enced lawyer not to inquire about standing to stay at the Depart-
ment of Education or not to make an inquiry of the people in
charge.
  The toll calls you characterized as garbage which you admitted
to in your interviews with the newspaper although you denied
other aspects. You know concede to be true, you did make those
calls. It is one thing for you to say that you felt constrained to
maintain some sort of an association with Judge Thomas in the
face of this kind of conduct which you have represented, but why
make the calls which you agreed to, the how are you doing, or I am
in town, or tell the secretary you are in town? Why drive the man
to the airport? Why maintain that kind of a cordial association in
the face of this kind of conduct?
  We have an office, equal opportunities, EEOC to enforce the laws
on sexual harassment. And we have here representations that the
nation's chief law enforcement officer sexually harassed his attor-
ney advisor. That attorney advisor is dedicated to enforcement of
the law against sexual harassment and tells us that she moved
from the Department of Education to EEOC because she wanted to
protect the women of America. And conceding that this is an enor-
mous educational experience, the question is why with an experi-
enced lawyer in that position being concerned about women's
rights, do you leave a man, Clarence Thomas, as Chairman of the
EEOC for years when according to your testimony he has been
guilty of sexual harassment, himself?
  Now, I do see explanations at every turn. And I have wondered
about the quality of those explanations, candidly. But there is no
description for this entire proceeding other than a tragedy. I do not
know how Judge Thomas defends himself beyond stepping forward
and saying that he is shocked, surprised, hurt, and saddened. And
the shortest statute of limitations I have ever heard of is 180 days.
                                         135

Until I got involved in this proceeding I did not know there was
such a short statute of limitations. Contract cases are 6 years, tort
cases are 2 years, criminal cases are 5 years, but the Federal law
has put that into effect because it is so difficult to defend and to go
back and to recollect all that has happened. And I appreciate the
stark nature of the statements which have been made.

  But I also see that your own statement that you prepared in
your leisure, put aside the FBI statement, you were with two
people, but no mention about the Coke bottle, no mention about
sexual prowess, no mention about other major issues which are in
your statement. So I conclude, from looking at this very complex
day on our obligation to try to find out what happened between a
man and a woman long ago, and nobody else was there, that I
would agree with you, Professor Hill, it is very difficult for me to
understand.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  The Senator from North Carolina--South Carolina, I beg your
pardon.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, don't forget it. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I realize there are certain things I should never
say to the Senator from South Carolina, and one of them is that he
is from North Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I just have one brief ques-
tion.
  Professor Hill, I understand you told the FBI that you had con-
cerns about the political philosophy of Judge Thomas and that he
may no longer be open-minded. Is that accurate?
  Ms. HILL. I told them that I did not quite understand, but as they
had been represented, yes, that I did have some concerns.
  Senator THURMOND. I have the FBI report here, and I just won-
dered if you remember telling them that.
  Ms. HILL. I remember discussion about political philosophy and I
remember specifically saying that I'm not quite sure that we un-
derstand his political philosophies. But based on what I under-
stand, yes, there is some discomfort.
  Senator THURMOND. That is all, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Now, let me just say, Professor Hill, we have heard in a sense
the half of this story today, all of your story, and we have not
heard all of Judge Thomas' story.
  But I, for one, can assure you that, assuming for the moment
what you have said is true, there is nothing hard to understand.
Having spent as many years as I have dealing with the issue of vic-
timization and victimization of women, I have seen that every
single psychiatrist and psychologist who considers himself or her-
self an expert in the field will point out that the nature of response
is not at all atypical, assuming it to be true--and please do not be
offended by my saying "assuming it to be true." I view myself
again here as a finder of fact and we have yet to hear the whole
story from Judge Thomas.
  This is a tragedy; and people keep mentioning that, and my good
friend from Iowa hopes that this will never happen again in the
sense of the way the committee handled it.
                                      136

  I must be brutally frank with my colleagues and with everyone
else involved: I do apologize to the women of America, if they got
the wrong impression about how seriously I take the issue of
sexual harassment, but I make no apologies for attempting to
follow every one of your wishes, because everyone that I have
spoken to, again, in the years that I have dealt with this subject
indicate that the most unfair thing to do to a woman in your posi-
tion is what was done to you, force you to do something that you
did not intend to do.

  So, I must tell you and I must tell everyone else, I take sexual
harassment seriously, but I take your claim and took your claim
that you have reasserted here today half a dozen times that you
did not want this to go public as seriously as I possibly could. For
those who suggest that there was some way to do it differently and
still honor your commitment, I respond that I know of no such way
to guarantee your anonymity, or to guarantee you would not have
to be in this place on this day.

  I must tell you, every instinct in me in the world wanted to say
to the whole Senate and to the whole world that we should have a
hearing on this. But again, we tend to look at large issues and
forget individuals. You were the individual in the middle of this,
and I will say again to anyone who will listen, as long as I am
Chairman of this committee, if a person comes to me in a similar
circumstance and says repeatedly and in different ways that I have
no authority to tell their story, to leak their story, to demand that
their story be put in a context different than they wish, I will
honor that commitment.

  I appreciate the fact, and to be very, very blunt about it, I can't
tell you how thankful I am, purely from a personal standpoint--
and I should not say this, but I am going to say it anyway--that
you were so straightforward and honest about the way in which
this committee handled your request, and so straightforward and
honest about, notwithstanding occasional confusion, how you did
not decide to do what is being done here, and were it not for the
fact that it was leaked to a press person, you would not be here
today.

  It seems to me, ultimately, in this great giant machine we call
this Nation and this Government, that I don't know how we can
call ourselves civil libertarians. I don't know how we can call our-
selves people interested in the individual, if, in the name of a
larger cause to justify the ends, we make a judgment for an indi-
vidual that that individual chooses and has a right not to make.

  So, I must tell you. I admire you. I admire the way you handled
this matter once you were confronted with it. As I said to you very
bluntly over the telephone, all of us up here choose to be in this
business, we choose to be under these lights, we choose to be under
the scrutiny of those ladies and gentlemen sitting behind you, we
choose to go before the American public and say "judge me," but
we have no right to make you choose to do that.

  Once you chose to do that, because you had no choice, you han-
dled it with such grace and such elan that I can't quite understand
how you were able to pull it off in the sense of walking before all
those press people in the press conference and handling it the way
                                         137

you did. I don't know three candidates in my whole life who could
do that, and they have had 27 handlers telling them how to do it.

  So, I don't want to kid anybody. If you came to me again in the
same circumstance and said, "Senator Biden, keep this tight, do
not make it go public," I would do the same thing again. I thank
you for your honesty in laying out just what you did, because you
could have very easily said, "oh, no, I would have come forward no
matter what, I was getting ready to do that," and, quite frankly,
made me look like an idiot.

  I thank you very, very much. We can all talk about the process,
it is a cumbersome one, but, ultimately, it seems that the purpose
of the process is to protect the rights of individuals.

  I thank you for being willing to be here. I thank you for your
testimony.

  We will now recess
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. I will yield in just as moment.
  Judge Thomas has indicated he wants very much to come back
on this evening, so we will reconvene this hearing at 9:00 o'clock to
hear from Judge Thomas.
  Before we do, I yield to my friend from Alabama, who wants to
submit for the record some--well, I will let him say what he wants
to do.
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, I want to submit certain newspa-
per articles that have appeared for the record.
  These are from the Washington Post, October 11, 1991, and the
headline is "Thomas' View Of Harassment Said to Evolve"; from
the Baltimore Sun, dated October 11, 1991, "Thomas-Hill Dis-
putes"; from the New York Times, on October 10, 1991, "Stark
Conflict Marks Accounts Given by Thomas and Professor"; the
Washington Post, of the same date, "Conflict Emerges Over A
Second Witness"; from the Washington Post, October 11, 1991,
"Charlotte Woman Details Thomas' Conducts"; from the New York

Harassment in 1980's"; and from the U.S. News & World Report,
September 16, 1991, an article entitled "The Crowning Thomas
Affair."

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, they will be made a part of
the record.

Thomas-Hill disputes

     The record on nine factual disputes on the credibility of Clarence
 Thomas and his accuser, Anita F. Hill:

     1. Did Judge Thomas ask Ms. Hill for a date in 1981?
  ' Ms. Hill's version: Judge Thomas asked her out socially and he re-
 fused to accept her explanation that it was inappropriate to go out with the
 boss. (National Public Radio, Oct. 6)

     What Judge Thomas may have told the FBI: Unnamed congressional
 sources have been quoted as saying that Judge Thomas acknowledged
 asking Ms. Hill out for a date, but that he said he dropped the matter when
 she declined. (NPR, Oct. 6, and New York Times, Oct. 10)

    Judge Thomas to Senators: Judge Thomas "deniea that he had ever
asked her for a date." (Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., McNeil-Lehrer, Oct. 7)

    2. Did Judge Thomas discuss pornography with Ms. Hill in 1981?
    Ms. Hill: "He [Judge Thomas] spoke about acts he had seen in porno-
graphic films involving such things as women having sex with animals and
films involving group sex or rape scenes." (NPR, quoting unpublished Hill
affidavit, Oct. 6)
    Thomas defender "He says... that none of the alleged salacious ex-
pressions were made by him to her." (Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo.,
press conference, Oct. 7)
    3. If Ms. Hill was sexually harassed, why did she follow Mr. Thomas
from the Education Department to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission in 1982?
    Ms. Hill: "If I quit, I would have been jobless. I had not built a resume
such that I could have expected to go out and get a job. And you'll recall
that in the early '80s, there was a hiring freeze in the federal government.
(Press conference, Oct. 7)
    Thomas defender There was "no rational reason for her not to believe
that she could have stayed" at the Education Department. When Mr.
Thomas asked her to follow him to EEOC, "she was excited, flattered and
gushing with enthusiasm about continuing to work with Clarence Thom-
as." (Andrew S. Fishel, who worked with both Ms. Hill and Judge Thomas
at both the Education Department and the EEOC, New York Times inter-
view, Oct. 9)
    4. Did Ms. Hill know co-worker Phyllis Berry while they were both at
the EEOC?
    Thomas defender. Ms. Berry, who says she worked with both Ms. Hill
and Judge Thomas as congressional liaison officer for the EEOC, told a
reporter that Ms. Hill's allegations resulted from her disappointment and
frustration that Judge Thomas had shown no sexual interest in her. (New
York Times, Oct. 7)
    Ms. Hill: "Well, I don't know Phyllis Berry and she doesn't know me,
and so I don't have anything else to say to that." (Press conference, Oct.
7)

5. How did Ms. Hill get her first legal teaching job at Oral Roberts

University in Oklahoma after leaving the EEOC In 1983?

Ms. Hill: "I interviewed for that job. And at that time, after the interview

took place, after I had been assured that I would get the job, i went to him
[Judge Thomas] and said, 'Would you write a recommendation?1 And that

came only because the process at Oral Roberts University required some

kind of letter from a former employer." (Press conference, Oct. 7)

Thomas defender Charles Kothe, then dean of the law school, said

Judge Thomas played a more important part in her hiring than she has ac-

knowledged. Mr. Kothe said he first met Ms. Hill when she accompanied

Judge Thomas to Tulsa, Okla., so he could hold a seminar as EEOC chair-

man. (New York Times, Oct. 9)

6. Did Ms. Hill voluntarily stay in touch with Judge Thomas after the

alleged sexual harassment, and if so, why?

Thomas defender Handwritten phone logs kept in Judge Thomas' of-

fice show 11 calls received from Ms. Hill between 1983 and 1990. "Needs

your advice in getting research grants," a secretary noted in an Aug. 29,

1984, entry. Another entry said "wanted to congratulate you on marriage."

(Logs released by Senator Danforth, Oct. 8)

Ms. Hill: "If there are messages to him from me, these are attempts to

return calls I never called him to say hello. I found out about his mar-

riage through a third party. I never called to congratulate him." (Washing-

ton Post interview, Oct. 9)

7. Did Ms. Hill call Judge Thomas in 1990 and ask him to make a

speech at the University of Oklahoma?

Thomas defender: Judge Thomas says Ms. Hill telephoned him in No-

vember 1990, they chattedfor 10 to 15 minutes, and she asked him if he

would be receptive to an invitation to speak at the University of Oklahoma

Law School. (Senator Danforth press conference, Oct. 7)             i

Ms. Hill: "No, I did not invite him. The enrichment committee sent an

official letter to him inviting him. The chairmanjof that committee came to

me and said would you follow up to see, make sure he's got that letter and

that he's going to pay some attention to it. At that time, I stated very clear-

ly to the chairman of the committee that I did not want him to come here.

And I, however, did make a phone call " (Press conference, Oct. 7)

Thomas defender's rebuttal: The Thomas phone logs will disclose

that Ms. Hill made the call "many days before" the invitation letter went

out, not afterward as Ms. Hill said. (Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., Senate

floor speech, Oct. 8)

8. What was Ms. Hill's reaction when Judge Thomas was nominated

to the Supreme Court?

Ms. Hill: "I was very disturbed. I have been very disturbed throughout

this process. This has been a very painful process for me." (Press confer-

ence, Oct. 7)

Thomas defender Carlton Stewart, an Atlanta lawyer who was special

assistant to Judge Thomas at the EEOC, said Ms. Hill expressed delight

at the Thomas nomination in a conversation with him at the American Bar

Association convention. (Quoted in Washington Post, Oct. 8)

9. Did Ms. Hill provide the Senate committee a sworn statement in

1991?

Thomas defender: "She did not furnish an affidavit. An affidavit is

something sworn to and then sealed. She chose to give a statement, a

four-page statement." (Senator Simpson, speech to Senate, Oct. 8)

Ms. Hill: She gave a sworn affidavit to the FBI on Sept. 23. (Written

statement to press, Oct. 7)

  The CHAIRMAN. Yes?
  Ms. HILL. I would just like to take this opportunity to thank the
committee for its time, its questions and the efforts that it has put
into this investigation on my behalf.
  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  We are adjourned until 9 o'clock.

                                             EVENING SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will please come to order.
  Judge it is a tough day and a tough night for you, I know. Let
me ask, do you have anything you would like to say before we
begin?
  I understand that your preference is, which is totally and com-
pletely understandable, that we go 1 hour tonight, 30 minutes on
each side. Am I correct in that?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.

FURTHER TESTIMONY OF HON. CLARENCE THOMAS, OF GEOR-
  GIA, TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you have anything you would like to say?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I would like to start by saying unequivo-

cally, uncategorically that I deny each and every single allegation
against me today that suggested in any way that I had conversa-
tions of a sexual nature or about pornographic material with Anita
Hill, that I ever attempted to date her, that I ever had any person-
al sexual interest in her, or that I in any way ever harassed her.

  Second, and I think a more important point, I think that this
today is a travesty. I think that it is disgusting. I think that this
hearing should never occur in America. This is a case in which this
sleaze, this dirt was searched for by staffers of members of this
committee, was then leaked to the media, and this committee and
this body validated it and displayed it in prime time over our
entire Nation.

  How would any member on this committee or any person in this
room or any person in this country would like sleaze said about
him or her in this fashion or this dirt dredged up and this gossip
and these lies displayed in this manner? How would any person
like it?

  The Supreme Court is not worth it. No job is worth it. I am not
here for that. I am here for my name, my family, my life and my
integrity. I think something is dreadfully wrong with this country,
when any person, any person in this free country would be subject-
ed to this. This is not a closed room.

  There was an FBI investigation. This is not an opportunity to
talk about difficult matters privately or in a closed environment.
This is a circus. It is a national disgrace. And from my standpoint,
as a black American, as far as I am concerned, it is a high-tech
lynching for uppity-blacks who in any way deign to think for them-
                                      158

selves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a mes-
sage that, unless you kow-tow to an old order, this is what will
happen to you, you will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a
committee of the U.S. Senate, rather than hung from a tree.

  The CHAIRMAN. We will have
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. I have named Senator Hatch to cross-exam-
ine the Judge and those who are supporting him.
  Senator HATCH. AS I understand it, it was
  The CHAIRMAN. I think that is correct. I think we would start
with Senator Heflin and then go to Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. I think that is the way I was--I would be happy
to do it, but I think that is the way I was told.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Thomas, in addition to Anita Hill, there
have surfaced some other allegations against you. One was on a tel-
evision show last evening here in Washington, channel 7. I don't
know whether you saw that or not?
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU didn't see it. It was carried somewhat in
the print media today, but it involved a man by the name of Earl
Harper, Jr., who allegedly was a senior trial lawyer with the EEOC
at Baltimore in or around the early 1980's. Do you recall this in-
stance pertaining to Earl Harper, Jr.?
  Judge THOMAS. I remember the name. I can't remember the de-
tails.
  Senator HEFLIN. The allegations against Mr. Harper involved
some 12 or 13 women who claim that Mr. Harper made unwelcome
sexual advances to several women on his staff, including instances
in which Mr. Harper masturbated in the presence of some of the
female employees. The allegations contain other aspects of sexual
activity.
  The information we have is that the General Counsel of the
EEOC, David Slate, made a lengthy internal investigation and
found that this had the effect of creating an intimidating, hostile
and offense working environment, and that on November 23, 1983,
you wrote Mr. Slate a memo urging that Mr. Harper be fired. Mr.
Slate eventually recommended dismissal. Then the story recites
that you did not dismiss him, you allowed him to stay on for 11
months and then he retired.
  Does that bring back to you any recollection of that event con-
cerning Mr. Earl Harper, Jr.?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, I am operating strictly on recollection. If I
remember the case, if it is the one I am thinking of, Mr. Harper's
supervisor recommended either suspension or some form of sanc-
tion or punishment that was less than termination.
  When that proposal--the supervisor initially was not David
Slate--when that proposal reached my desk, I believe my recom-
mendation was that, for the conduct involved, he should be fired.
The problem there was that if the immediate supervisor's decision
is changed--and I believe Mr. Harper was a veteran--there are a
number of procedural protections that he had, including a hearing
                                      159

and, of course, he had a lawyer and there was potential litigation,
et cetera.

  I do not remember all of the details, but it is not as simple as
you set it out. It was as a result of my insistence that the General
Counsel, as I remember, upgraded the sanction to termination.

  Senator HEFLIN. DO you know a Congressman by the name of
Scott Kluge, a Republican Congressman who was defeated by
Robert Kastenmeier of Wisconsin, who now serves in Congress,
who back in the early 1980's, 1983 or something, was a television
reporter for a channel here in Washington and that he at that time
disclosed this as indicating that, after the recommendation of dis-
missal, that you did not move in regards to it for some 11 months
and let him retire? Do you know Congressman Kluge?

  Judge THOMAS. I do not know him. Again, remember, I am oper-
ating on recollection. There was far more to it than the facts as
you set them out. His rights had much to do with the fact that he
was a veteran and that we could not simply dismiss him. If we
could, that was my recommendation, he would have been dis-
missed.

  Senator HEFLIN. There was no political influence brought to bear
on you at that time to prevent his dismissal? Do you recall if any
political

  Judge THOMAS. There was absolutely no political influence. In
fact, it was my policy that no personnel decisions would in any way
be changed or influenced by political pressure, one way or the
other.

  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, it is reported to me that Congressman
Kluge, after your nomination, went to the White House and told
this story and, I hear by hearsay, that the White House ignored his
statement and that Congressman Kluge further came to the Senate
Judiciary Committee and made it known here.

  As far as I know, I attempted to check--I have not been able to
find where it was in the Judiciary Committee, if it was, and I think
the Chairman has attempted to locate it--but the point I am
asking is, in the whole process pertaining to the nomination and
the preparation for it, were you ever notified that Congressman
Kluge went to the White House in regards to this?

  Judge THOMAS. I do not remember that, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. Nobody ever discussed that?
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, that is the way it has been reported to me
and it is very fragmented relative to it, but I have asked that all
the records of the EEOC be subpoenaed by subpoena duces tecum
pertaining to that, in order that we might get to the bottom of it.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, if I could interrupt Senator
Heflin, I really think this is outside the scope, under the rules. I
would have to object to it.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would have to sustain that objection. I do
not
  Senator HATCH. I hesitate to object, but I just think we ought to
keep it on the subject matter.
  The CHAIRMAN. I do not see where it is relevant.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I think it is relevant in the issue pertain-
ing to the period of time relative to the issue, particularly in re-
                                      160

gards to the responsibilities as head of the agency dealing with dis-
crimination in employment.

  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman

   The CHAIRMAN. If I may say

  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman
  The CHAIRMAN. If I may speak, let me say this is not about
whether the Judge administered the agency properly. The only
issue here relates to conduct and the allegations that have been
made, so I would respectfully suggest to my friend from Alabama
that that line of questioning is not in order and I rule it out of
order.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right, sir, I will reserve an exception, as we
used to say.
  Now, I suppose you have heard Professor Hill, Ms. Hill, Anita F.
Hill testify today.
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I haven't.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU didn't listen?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I didn't. I have heard enough lies.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU didn't listen to her testimony?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I didn't.
  Senator HEFLIN. On television?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I didn't. I've heard enough lies. Today is not
a day that, in my opinion, is high among the days in our country.
This is a travesty. You spent the entire day destroying what it has
taken me 43 years to build and providing a forum for that.
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Thomas, you know we have a responsibil-
ity too, and as far as I am involved, I had nothing to do with Anita
Hill coming here and testifying. We are trying to get to the bottom
of this. And, if she is lying, then I think you can help us prove that
she was lying.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I am incapable of proving the negative
that did not occur.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, if it did not occur, I think you are in a
position, with certainly your ability to testify, in effect, to try to
eliminate it from people's minds.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I didn't create it in people's minds. This
matter was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in
a confidential way. It was then leaked last weekend to the media. I
did not do that. And how many members of this committee would
like to have the same scurrilous, uncorroborated allegations made
about him and then leaked to national newspapers and then be
drawn and dragged before a national forum of this nature to dis-
cuss those allegations that should have been resolved in a confiden-
tial way?
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I certainly appreciate your attitude to-
wards leaks. I happen to serve on the Senate Ethics Committee and
it has been a sieve.
  Judge THOMAS. But it didn't leak on me. This leaked on me and
it is drowning my life, my career and my integrity, and you can't
give it back to me, and this Committee can't give it back to me,
and this Senate can't give it back to me. You have robbed me of
something that can never be restored.
  Senator DECONCINI. I know exactly how you feel.
                                      161

  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Thomas, one of the aspects of this is that
she could be living in a fantasy world. I don't know. We are just
trying to get to the bottom of all of these facts.

  But if you didn't listen and didn't see her testify, I think you put
yourself in an unusual position. You are, in effect, defending your-
self, and basically some of us want to be fair to you, fair to her, but
if you didn't listen to what she said today, then that puts it some-
what in a more difficult task to find out what the actual facts are
relative to this matter.

  Judge THOMAS. The facts keep changing, Senator. When the FBI
visited me, the statements to this committee and the questions
were one thing. The FBI's subsequent questions were another
thing. And the statements today, as I received summaries of them,
are another thing.

  I am not--it is not my fault that the facts change. What I have
said to you is categorical that any allegations that I engaged in any
conduct involving sexual activity, pornographic movies, attempted
to date her, any allegations, I deny. It is not true.

  So the facts can change but my denial does not. Ms. Hill was
treated in a way that all my special assistants were treated, cor-
dial, professional, respectful.

  Senator HEFLIN. Judge, if you are on the bench and you ap-
proach a case where you appear to have a closed mind and that
you are only right, doesn't it raise issues of judicial temperament?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator? Senator, there is a difference between
approaching a case objectively and watching yourself being
lynched. There is no comparison whatsoever.

  Senator HATCH. I might add, he has personal knowledge of this
as well, and personal justification for anger.

  Senator HEFLIN. Judge, I don't want to go over this stuff but, of
course, there are many instances in which she has stated, but--
and, in effect, since you didn't see her testify I think it is somewhat
unfair to ask you specifically about it.

  I would reserve my time and go ahead and let Senator Hatch ask
you, and then come back.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hatch?
  Senator HATCH. Judge Thomas, I have sat here and I have lis-
tened all day long, and Anita Hill was very impressive. She is an
impressive law professor. She is a Yale Law graduate. And, when
she met with the FBI, she said that you told her about your sexual
experiences and preferences. And I hate to go into this but I want
to go into it because I have to, and I know that it is something that
you wish you had never heard at any time or place. But I think it
is important that we go into it and let me just do it this way.
  She said to the FBI that you told her about your sexual experi-
ences and preferences, that you asked her what she liked or if she
had ever done the same thing, that you discussed oral sex between
men and women, that you discussed viewing films of people having
sex with each other and with animals, and that you told her that
she should see such films, and that you would like to discuss specif-
ic sex acts and the frequency of sex.
  What about that?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I would not want to, except being re-
quired to here, to dignify those allegations with a response. As I
                                      162

have said before, I categorically deny them. To me, I have been pil-
loried with scurrilous allegations of this nature. I have denied
them earlier and I deny them tonight.

  Senator HATCH. Judge Thomas, today in a new statement, in ad-
dition to what she had told the FBI, which I have to agree with you
is quite a bit, she made a number of other allegations and what I
would like to do is--some of them most specifically were for the
first time today in addition to these, which I think almost anybody
would say are terrible. And I would just like to give you an oppor-
tunity, because this is your chance to address her testimony.

  At any time did you say to Professor Hill that she could ruin
your career if she talked about sexual comments you allegedly
made to her?

  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HATCH. Did you say to her in words or substance that
you could ruin her career?
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HATCH. Should she ever have been afraid of you and any
kind of vindictiveness to ruin her career?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have made it my business to help my
special assistants. I recommended Ms. Hill for her position at Oral
Roberts University. I have always spoken highly of her.
  I had no reason prior to the FBI visiting me a little more than 2
weeks ago to know that she harbored any ill feelings toward me or
any discomfort with me. This is all new to me.
  Senator HATCH. It is new to me too, because I read the FBI
report at least 10 or 15 times. I didn't see any of these allegations I
am about to go into, including that one. But she seemed to sure
have a recollection here today.
  Now, did you ever say to Professor Hill in words or substance,
and this is embarrassing for me to say in public, but it has to be
done, and I am sure it is not pleasing to you.
  Did you ever say in words or substance something like there is a
pubic hair in my Coke?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Did you ever refer to your private parts in con-
versations with Professor Hill?
  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely not, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Did you ever brag to Professor Hill about your
sexual prowess?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Did you ever use the term "Long Dong Silver" in
conversation with Professor Hill?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Did you ever have lunch with Professor Hill at
which you talked about sex or pressured her to go out with you?
  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely not.
  Senator HATCH. Did you ever tell
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. I have had no such discussions, nor
have I ever pressured or asked her to go out with me beyond her
work environment.
  Senator HATCH. Did you ever tell Professor Hill that she should
see pornographic films?
  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely not.
                                      163

  Senator HATCH. Did you ever talk about pornography with Pro-
fessor Hill?

  Judge THOMAS. I did not discuss any pornographic material or
pornographic preferences or pornographic films with Professor
Hill.

  Senator HATCH. SO you never even talked or described porno-
graphic materials with her?

  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely not.
  Senator HATCH. Amongst those or in addition?
  Judge THOMAS. What I have told you is precisely what I told the
FBI on September 25 when they shocked me with the allegations
made by Anita Hill.
  Senator HATCH. Judge Thomas, those are a lot of allegations.
Those are a lot of charges, talking about sexual experiences and
preferences, whether she liked it or had ever done the same thing,
oral sex, viewing films of people having sex with each other and
with animals, that maybe she should see such films, discuss specific
sex acts, talk about pubic hair in Coke, talking about your private
parts, bragging about sexual prowess, talking about particular por-
nographic movies.
  Let me ask you something. You have dealt with these problems
for a long time. At one time I was the chairman of the committee
overseeing the EEOC and, I might add, the Department of Educa-
tion, and I am the ranking member today. I have known you for 11
years and you are an expert in sexual harassment. Because you are
the person who made the arguments to then Solicitor General
Fried that the administration should strongly take a position on
sexual harassment in the Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson case, and
the Supreme Court adopted your position.
  Did I misstate that?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, what you have said is substantially ac-
curate. What I attempted to do in my discussions with the Solicitor
is to have them be aggressive in that litigation, and EEOC was
very instrumental in the success in the Meritor case.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, Judge, keep in mind that the statute of
limitations under title VII for sexual harassment for private em-
ployers is 180 days or 6 months. But the statute of limitations
under title VII for Federal employers and employees is 30 days.
  Are you aware of that?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, Senator, I am generally aware of those limi-
tations.
  Senator HATCH. And are you aware of why those statutes of limi-
tation are so short?
  Judge THOMAS. I would suspect that at some point it would have
to do with the decision by this body that either memories begin to
fade or stories change, perhaps individuals move around, and that
it would be more difficult to litigate them.
  I don't know precisely what all of the rationale is.
  Senator HATCH. Well, it involves the basic issue of fairness, just
exactly how you have described it. If somebody is going to be ac-
cused in a unilateral declaration of sexual harassment, then that
somebody ought to be accused through either a complaint or some
sort of a criticism, so that that somebody can be informed and then
                                      164

respond to those charges, and, if necessary, change that somebody's
conduct.

  Is that a fair statement?
  Judge THOMAS. I think that is a fair statement.
  Senator HATCH. NOW let me ask you something: I described all
kinds of what I consider to be gross, awful sexually harassing
things, which if you take them cumulatively have to gag anybody.
Now you have seen a lot of these sexual harassment cases as you
have served there at the EEOC. What is your opinion with regard
to what should have been done with those charges, and whether or
not you believe that, let's take Professor Hill in this case, should
have done something, since she was a Yale Law graduate who
taught civil rights law at one point, served in these various agen-
cies, and had to understand that there is an issue of fairness here.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, if any of those activities occur, it would
seem to me to clearly suggest or to clearly indicate sexual harass-
ment, and anyone who felt that she was harassed could go to an
EEO officer at any agency and have that dealt with confidentially.
At the Department of Education, if she said it occurred there, or at
EEOC, those are separate tracks. At EEOC, I do not get to review
those, if they involve me, and at Department of Education there is
a separate EEO officer for the whole department. It would have
nothing to do with me. But if I were an individual advising a
person who had been subjected to that treatment, I would advise
her to immediately go to the EEO officer.
  Senator HATCH. An EEO office then would bring the parties to-
gether, or at least would confront the problem head-on, wouldn't
it?
  Judge THOMAS. The EEO officer would provide counseling
  Senator HATCH. Within a short period of time?
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. Within a short period of time, as
well as, I think, if necessary, an actual charge would be
  Senator HATCH. SO the charge would be made, and the charge
would then--the person against whom it was made would have a
chance to answer it right then, right up front, in a way that could
resolve it and stop this type of activity if it ever really occurred?
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. That is right.
  Senator HATCH. And you have just said it never really occurred.
  Judge THOMAS. It never occurred. That is why there was no
charge.
  Senator HATCH. YOU see, one of the problems that has bothered
me from the front of this thing is, these are gross. Cumulative, I
don't know why anybody would put up with them, or why anybody
would respect or work with another person who would do that. And
if you did that, I don't know why anybody would work with you
who suffered these treatments.
  Judge THOMAS. I agree.
  Senator HATCH. Furthermore, I don't know why they would have
gone to a different position with you, even if they did think that
maybe it had stopped and it won't start again, but then claimed
that it started again. And then when they finally got out into the
private sector, wouldn't somehow or other confront these problems
in three successive confirmation proceedings. Does that bother you?
                                         165

  Judge THOMAS. This whole affair bothers me, Senator. I am wit-
nessing the destruction of my integrity.

  Senator HATCH. And it is by a unilateral set of declarations that
are made on successive dates, and differ, by one person who contin-
ued to maintain what she considered to be a "cordial professional
relationship" with you over a 10-year period.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my relationship with Anita Hill prior to
September 25 was cordial and professional, and I might add one
other thing. If you really want an idea of how I treated women,
then ask the majority of the women who worked for me. They are
out here. Give them as much time as you have given one person,
the only person who has been on my staff who has ever made these
sorts of allegations about me.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I think one of our Senators, one of our
better Senators in the U.S. Senate, did do exactly that, and he is a
Democrat, as a matter of fact, one of the fairest people and I think
one of the best new people in the whole Senate.

  This is a statement that was made on the floor of the Senate in
this Record by my distinguished colleague, Senator Lieberman, a
man I have a great deal of respect for. Senator Lieberman's staff
conducted a survey of various women who have worked for you
over the years. He was concerned. He has been a supporter of
yours, and he was one who asked for this delay so that this could
be looked into because he was concerned, too.

  But as a result of the survey, Senator Lieberman made the fol-
lowing statement: He said, "I have contacted associates, women
who worked with Judge Thomas during his time at the Depart-
ment of Education and EEOC, and in the calls that I and my staff
have made there has been universal support for Judge Thomas and
a clear indication by all of the women we spoke to that there was
never, certainly not a case of sexual harassment, and not even a
hint of impropriety." That was put into the Congressional Record
on October 8, 1991.

  And I think Senator Lieberman has performed a very valuable
service because he is in the other party. He is a person who looks
at these matters seriously. He has to be as appalled by this type of
accusation as I am, and frankly he wanted to know, "Just what
kind of a guy is Clarence Thomas?" And those of us who know you,
know that all of these are inconsistent with the real Clarence
Thomas.

  And I don't care who testifies, you have to keep in mind, this is
an attorney, a law graduate from one of the four or five best law
schools in this land, a very intelligent, articulate law professor, and
the only person on earth other than you knowing whether these
things are true--the only other person. I don't blame you for being
mad.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have worked with hundreds of women
in different capacities. I have promoted and mentored dozens. I will
put my record against any member of this committee in promoting
and mentoring women.

  Senator HATCH. I will put your record against anybody in the
whole Congress.

  Judge THOMAS. And I think that if you want to really be fair,
you parade every single one before you and you ask them, in their
                                      166

relationships with me, whether or not any of this nonsense, this
garbage, trash that you siphoned out of the sewers against me,
whether any of it is true. Ask them. They have worked with me.
Ask my chief of staff, my former chief of staff. She worked shoul-
der to shoulder with me.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I think we should do that.
  Now, Judge, what was Professor Hill's role in your office at the
Education Department and at the EEOC?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I indicated this morning, at the De-
partment of Education Ms. Hill was an attorney-adviser. I had a
small staff and she had the opportunity to work on a variety of
issues.
  Senator HATCH. She was your number one person?
  Judge THOMAS. By and large, on substantive issues, she was.
  Senator HATCH. HOW about when you went to the EEOC?
  Judge THOMAS. At EEOC that role changed drastically. As I indi-
cated, my duties expanded immensely. EEOC, as you remember,
had enormous management problems, so I focused on that. I also
needed an experienced EEO staff, and my staff was much more
mature. It was older. It was a more experienced staff.
  As a result, she did not enjoy that close a relationship with me,
nor did she have her choice of the better assignments, and I think
that as a result of that there was some concern on her part that
she was not being treated as well as she had been treated prior to
that.
  Senator HATCH. At any time in your tenure in the Department of
Education, did Professor Hill ever express any concern about or
discomfort with your conduct toward her?
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HATCH. Never?
  Judge THOMAS. NO. The only caveat I would add to that would be
that from time to time people want promotions or better assign-
ments or work hours, something of that nature, but no discomfort
of the nature that is being discussed here today.
  Senator HATCH. NOW I note that Professor Hill alleges improper
conduct on your part during the period of November, 1981 to Feb-
ruary or March of 1982. Now isn't it true that both you and Profes-
sor Hill moved from the Education Department to the EEOC in
April of that same year?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, that is an odd period. The President ex-
pressed his intent to nominate me to become Chairman of EEOC in
February 1982, and during that very same period, to the best of my
recollection, she assisted me in my nomination and confirmation
process. I did in fact leave actual work at the Department of Edu-
cation, I believe in April, and started at EEOC in May 1982, and
she transferred with me.
  Senator HATCH. SO, in other words, Professor Hill followed you to
the EEOC no more than 2 or 3 months, possibly only 1 month after
she claims this alleged conduct occurred.
  Judge THOMAS. Precisely.
  Senator HATCH. Isn't it true, Judge Thomas, that Professor Hill
could have remained in her job at the Education Department when
you went to the EEOC?
                                         167

  Judge THOMAS. TO the best of my recollection, she was a schedule
A attorney. I know she was not cleared through the White House,
so she was not a schedule C. She was not a political appointee. As a
result, she had all the rights of schedule A attorneys, and could
have remained at the Department of Education in a career capac-
ity.

  Senator HATCH. And even if she might not have remained the
number one person to the head of the Civil Rights Division, which
you were, she would have been transferred to another equivalent
attorney's position.

  Judge THOMAS. If she had requested it.
  Senator HATCH. Did you tell her anything to the contrary?
  Judge THOMAS. Not to my knowledge. In fact, I don't think it
ever came up.
  Senator HATCH. She didn't even ask you?
  Judge THOMAS. I don't think it ever came up. I think it was un-
derstood that she would move to EEOC with me if she so desired.
  Senator HATCH. If I could just button it down, in other words,
Judge Thomas, if instead of following you to the EEOC, Professor
Hill had remained at the Department of Education as a schedule A
attorney, she would have had as much job security as any other
civil service attorney in the government. And this is especially
true, isn't it, because of your friendship with Harry Singleton?

  Judge THOMAS. That is right. If she was concerned about job se-
curity, I could have certainly discussed with Harry Singleton what
should be done with her. He is a personal friend of mine. He is
also, or was, a personal friend of the individual who recommended
Anita Hill to me, Gil Hardy. Gil Hardy of course drowned in 1988,
but both of us or all three of us had gone to Yale Law School and
knew each other quite well.

  Senator HATCH. NOW, Judge Thomas, I understand that on occa-
sion, and you correct me if this is wrong, but I have been led to
believe that on occasion Professor Hill would ask you to drive her
home, and that on those occasions she would sometimes invite you
into her home to continue a discussion, but you never thought any-
thing--you never thought of any of this as anything more than
normal, friendly, professional conversation with a colleague. Am I
correct on that, or am I wrong?

  Judge THOMAS. It was not unusual to me, Senator. As I remem-
ber it, I lived in southwest Washington, and would as I remem-
ber--and again, I am relying on my recollection, she lived some-
place on Capitol Hill--and I would drive her home, and sometimes
stop in and have a Coke or a beer or something and continue argu-
ing about politics for maybe 45 minutes to an hour, but I never
thought anything of it.

   Senator HATCH. When Professor Hill worked for you at the
EEOC, did she solicit your advice on career development or career
opportunities?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I discuss with most of the members of
my personal staff, I try to advise them on their career opportuni-
ties and what they should do next. You can't always be a special
assistant or an attorney-adviser. And I am certain that I had those
discussions with her, and in fact it would probably have been based
                                      168

on that that I advised Dean Kothe that she would be a good teach-
er and that she would be interested in teaching.

  Senator HATCH. Did she treat you as her mentor at the time, in
your opinion?

  Judge THOMAS. Pardon me?
  Senator HATCH. Did she treat you as though you were a mentor
at the time?
  Judge THOMAS. She certainly sought counsel and advice from me.
  Senator HATCH. NOW at any time during your tenure at the
EEOC, did you ever discuss sexual matters with Professor Hill?
  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely not, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. At any time during your tenure at the EEOC,
did Professor Hill ever express discomfort or concern about your
conduct toward her?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. From your observations, what was the percep-
tion of Professor Hill by her colleagues at the EEOC? What did
they think about her?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, some of my former staffers I assume will
testify here, but as I remember it there was some tension and some
degree of friction which I attributed simply to having a staff. As I
have had 2 weeks to think about this and to agonize over this, and
as I remember it, I believe that she was considered to be somewhat
distant and perhaps aloof, and from time to time there would be
problems that usually involved--and I attributed this to just being
young--but usually involved her taking a firm position and being
unyielding to the other members of the staff, and then storming off
or throwing a temper tantrum of some sort that either myself or
the chief of staff would have to iron out.
  Senator HATCH. What was your opinion of the quality of Profes-
sor Hill's work at the EEOC, as her administrator and as the head
of the EEOC?
  Judge THOMAS. I thought the work was good. The problem was
that--and it wasn't a problem--was, it was not as good as some of
the other members of the staff.
  Senator HATCH. While Professor Hill worked for you at the
EEOC, did she ever seek a promotion?
  Judge THOMAS. I believe she did seek promotions. Again, most of
that was done through the chief of staff at that time.
  Senator HATCH. Well, if so, to what position?
  Judge THOMAS. She may have sought a promotion. In 1983, my
chief of staff left and I was going to promote someone to my execu-
tive assistant/chief of staff, which is the most senior person on my
personal staff, and I think that--again, I am relying on my
memory--she aspired to that position and, of course, was not suc-
cessful and I think was concerned about that.
  Senator HATCH. I see. When did Professor Hill leave the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission?
  Judge THOMAS. In 1983.
  Senator HATCH. In 1983. Why do you think she decided to leave
the agency at that time?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I thought that she felt at the time that
it was time for her to leave Washington and also to leave Govern-
ment. She had, I believe, expressed an interest in teaching and the
                                      169
opportunity at Oral Roberts University provided her both with the
opportunity to be in Oklahoma and to teach and, as I remember,
she did not lose any salary or any income in the bargain, and that
was attractive.

  Senator HATCH. Did you assist her in getting that job at Oral
Roberts University?

  Judge THOMAS. Yes, Senator, I discussed her with Dean Charles
Kothe, both informally and provided written recommendation,
formal recommendation for her.

  Senator HATCH. All right. Have you had any contacts with Pro-
fessor Hill since she left the EEOC in 1983?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, from time to time, Anita Hill would call
the agency and either speak to me or to my secretary and, through
her, she would leave messages. They had been friends, Diane Holt.
On a number of occasions, I believe, too, I am certain of one, but
maybe two, when I was in Tulsa, OK, I spent time with her, I saw
her, and I believe on one occasion she drove me to the airport and
had breakfast with me.

  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, with unanimous consent, I would
introduce into the record at this point excerpts from Judge
Thomas' telephone logs from 1983 to 1991, if I could.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.

  Senator HATCH. Judge Thomas, do you have
  The CHAIRMAN. These are the same excerpts that he has had.
  Senator HATCH [continuing]. These are the same ones that you
have had. Now, Judge Thomas, are you familiar with these?
  Judge THOMAS. I have seen those logs, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. DO you recall any of the telephone conversations
with Professor Hill reflected by these particular messages?
  Judge THOMAS. I do, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. For instance, on January 31, according to these
logs--and I think I have got them correct, I am quite sure--on July
31, 1984, at 11:30 a.m., a message from Anita Hill, "Just called to
say hello, sorry she didn't get to see you last week." Is that accu-
rate?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, that was I think one instance when she had
come to town, either on personal business or because of her job,
and my schedule conflicted with any opportunity to meet with her
and simply called to--that was a call from her, I think, to reflect
that.
  Senator HATCH. NO. 2, on May 9, 1984, at 11:40 a.m., Anita Hill
was the caller, the message was "Please call," and she left her
phone number, (718) et cetera. Do you remember that?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. NO. 3, on August 29, 1984, at 3:59 p.m., Anita
called, and the message was "Need your advice in getting research
grants." Do you recall that?
  Judge THOMAS. I remember that, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. What was that call about?
  Judge THOMAS. I can't remember exactly what the project was,
but she wanted some ideas as to how she could get I think some
grants, either from EEOC or some other agency, to do some re-
search I believe at Oral Roberts, and I believe we discussed that
and I may have put her in contact with someone. Again, my recol-
lection of that is vague, but we did have a discussion.
  Senator HATCH. Did you help her?
  Judge THOMAS. I tried.
  Senator HATCH. YOU tried.
  No. 4, on August 30, 1984, at 11:55 a.m., Anita was the caller, the
message "Returned your call (call between 1 and 4)." Do you re-
member that?
  Judge THOMAS. I don't remember the specifics of the call, but I
remember that on the log, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Was she calling you or were you calling her?
  Judge THOMAS. She was calling me. My secretary, when I placed
the call and someone returned it, my secretary noted "returned
your call."
  Senator HATCH. On January 3, 1985, at 3:40 p.m., Anita Hill was
the caller, "Please call tonight," and then left a phone number and
a room number. Do you remember that?
  Judge THOMAS. I remember that. I think she must have been in
town on a trip and that was her hotel room number. I don't know
which hotel. I again may have been out of town, either on a busi-
ness trip or somehow for some other reason inaccessible or unavail-
able.
                                         181

  Senator HATCH. NO. 6, February 6, 1985, 5:50 p.m., Anita Hill
was the caller, again it said, "Please call." Another call from her to
you?

  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator HATCH. NO. 7, on March 4, 1985, at 11:15 a.m., Anita Hill
called again, "Please call re research project." Do you remember
that?
  Judge THOMAS. I remember that, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Did you help her?
  Judge THOMAS. I did. I think the--I can't remember the details,
but I think she and Dean Charles Kothe were involved in some re-
search in a fairly large project and wanted some data from EEOC,
and I think we provided them with that data.
  Senator HATCH. NO. 8, March 4, 1985, at 11:25 a.m., call from
Susan Cahall, "With Tulsa EEO office referred by Anita to see if
you would come to Tulsa on 3/27 to speak at the EEO Conference."
Do you remember that?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, I remember the message. I think that was--
she would not have otherwise gotten through to me and used
Anita's name in order to gain access to me and perhaps receive a
positive response.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, I notice that my time is about

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU go right ahead.
   Senator HATCH [continuing]. But I just want to finish this one
line, if I can.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, you take all the time you want.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you. I really appreciate that.
(( No. 9, is July 5, 1985, at 1:30 p.m., Anita Hill is the caller,
"Please call," with a number clearly out of town. Do you remember
that?
  Judge THOMAS. Again, I remember it being in my log, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. OK. No. 10, October 9, 1986, at 12:25 p.m., Anita
Hill called, message, "Please call, leaving at 4:05," and an area
code number. Do you remember that?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, I do.
  Senator HATCH. NO. 11, August 4, 1987, 4:00 p.m., Anita Hill,
caller, "In town until 8:15, wanted to congratulate you on your
marriage." Do you remember that?
  Judge THOMAS. I remember that, Senator, because one of the--
my wife and I were on a delayed honeymoon in California when
she came to town.
  Senator HATCH. NO. 12, November 1, 1990, 11:40 a.m., Anita hill,
caller, "Re speaking engagement at University of Oklahoma School
of Law." Do you remember that?
  Judge THOMAS. That was since I have been on the Court of Ap-
peals, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. There are 12 phone calls between 1983 and 1990.
Did you try to call her back each time?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I tried, whenever I received calls from
her or from others, I attempted to return those calls. Although, as
I indicated before you started through those series of calls, I re-
member the messages in the log themselves, but I don't remember
                                      182

the nature of each call. It would be my practice to return those
calls, especially from someone such as Anita.

  Senator HATCH. SO, each and every time she called you, you tried
to call her back and tried to help her?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the log reflects only those calls where
she was unsuccessful in reaching me.

  Senator HATCH. Did you ever call her, other than to return these
calls?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I may have. Again, Anita Hill was some-
one that I respected and was cordial toward and felt positive
toward and hopeful for her career, and I may have on occasion,
and I can't remember any specific occasion, picked up the phone
just to see how she was doing. Again, the calls that you have there
are the calls that are reflected or that reflect her inability to get in
touch with me when she had called, as opposed to the instances in
which she was able to contact me successfully.

  Senator HATCH. Judge Thomas, before this day, have you seen
Professor Hill on various occasions since she left the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission?

  Judge THOMAS. Yes, Senator. As I indicated, I recall seeing her I
am certain one time and perhaps twice in Tulsa, OK, and on one of
those occasions it is my recollection that we had dinner with
Charles Kothe, we also had

  Senator HATCH. She was there?
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. Charles Kothe, the Dean of
  Senator HATCH. Was she there at that dinner?
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. She was at the dinner. We also
had--we being Anita and myself--breakfast with Charles Kothe at
his house. I usually slept at Charles Kothe's house, and I believe
she drove me to the airport, and for some reason I seem to remem-
ber that she had a Peugot.
  I may be wrong on that, but I remember her being very proud of
it, because, to my recollection, she did not have a car in Washing-
ton.
  Senator HATCH. I see. In addition to all the phone calls, you had
these contacts and these meetings. How would you describe these
meetings?
  Judge THOMAS. Very cordial, positive, always one--as I treat my
other special assistants, I tend to be the proud father type who sees
his special assistants go on and become successful and feels pretty
good about it. It would be that kind of a contact, as well as her tell-
ing me how her teaching assignments were going. Indeed, that was
similar to the conversation, again, that I would have with my other
special assistants or former special assistants.
  Senator HATCH. Overall, how would you characterize the nature
of your contacts with Professor Hill since she left the EEOC in
1983?
  Judge THOMAS. They have always been very cordial and very
positive, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Any unpleasantness?
  Judge THOMAS. Never.
  Senator HATCH. Any problems ever raised?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Any questions about your conduct?
                                      183

  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Can you think of any reason for her efforts to
continue to try to be associated with you?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator--could you repeat the question, Senator?
  Senator HATCH. Can you think of any reason why she would
want to continue this cordial professional relationship with you?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I would hope it would have been for the
same reasons that all of my other special assistants did, that I was
very supportive of them. The people, some of whom you will hear
from today, who have flown in, certainly at their own expense,
they feel warmly toward me and have a sense of loyalty and feel
that I will help them and that I will assist them as best I could,
and I believe that was as part of the reason and we certainly en-
joyed a cordial and professional relationship.
  Senator HATCH. Before you first heard of Professor Hill's allega-
tions during this confirmation process, did you have any reason to
believe that she was unhappy with you?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, on Tuesday, September 24, the day
before I heard from the FBI, I would have told you, if you asked
me, that my relationship with Anita Hill was cordial, professional
and that I was very proud of her for all she had done with her life
and the things that she had accomplished.
  Senator HATCH. Judge Thomas, this is your fourth confirmation
in 9 years, isn't that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, Senator. It is either my--yes, Senator, it is.
  Senator HATCH. In fact, three of those confirmations occurred,
the time of the allegations by Professor Hill.
  Judge THOMAS. Actually this, Senator, would be the fourth.
  Senator HATCH. That's right, this would be the fourth.
  So she actually has known you through four Senate confirma-
tions, four of them. No, this is the fourth. So four Senate confirma-
tions, right?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator HATCH. And none of those have been very easy, have
they?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right, now that I think about it, none of
my confirmations, aside from the first one, was easy.
  Senator HATCH. And you had your critics in each and every one
of them, didn't you?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator HATCH. DO you remember the details of each of those
calls that were made that we went over?
  Or do you just remember them generally?
  Judge THOMAS. I remember the calls generally, Senator. I don't
remember the specifics of each call. That has been quite some time.
  Senator HATCH. Well, let me just say this. I have kept everybody
too long and I know we can continue tomorrow, but I would like to
ask this question just to end the day with and I think it is an im-
portant question. I have to say, cumulatively, these charges, even
though they were made on all kinds of occasions, I mean they are
unbelievable that anybody could be that perverted. I am sure there
are people like that but they are generally in insane asylums.
What was your reaction when you first heard of these allegations
against you, just the first allegations, not all the other ones, and
                                      184

then you can tell me your reaction when you heard of these ones
that were brought forth for the first time today?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, when the FBI informed me of the allega-
tion, the person first, there was shock, dismay, hurt, pain, and
when he informed me of the nature of the allegations I was sur-
prised, there was disbelief and again, hurt. And I have reached a
point over the last 2 weeks, plus, I have reached a point where I
can't go over each and every one of these allegations again.

  As I said in my statement this morning, that when you have alle-
gations of this nature by someone that you have thought the world
of and felt that you have done the best for it is an enormously
painful experience and it is one when you ask yourself, you rip at
yourself, what could you have done? And why could this happen or
why would it happen?

  Senator HATCH. HOW do you feel right now, Judge, after what
you have been through?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I indicated this morning, it just isn't
worth it. And the nomination is not worth it, being on the Supreme
Court is not worth it, and there is no amount of money that is
worth it, there is no amount of money that can restore my name,
being an associate Justice of the Supreme Court will never replace
what I have been robbed of, and I would not recommend that
anyone go through it.

  This has been an enormously difficult experience, but I don't
think that that is the worst of it. I am 43 years old and if I am not
confirmed I am still the youngest member of the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the D.C. Circuit. And I will go on. I will go back to my life
of talking to my neighbors and cutting my grass and getting a Big
Mac at McDonald's and driving my car, and seeing my kid play
football. And I will live. I will have my life back. And all of this
hurt has brought my family closer together, my wife and I, my
mother, but that is not--so there is no pity for me. I think the
country has been hurt by this process. I think we are destroying
our country. We are destroying our institutions. And I think it is a
sad day when the U.S. Senate can be used by interest groups, and
hate mongers, and people who are interested in digging up dirt to
destroy other people and who will stop at no tactics, when they can
use our great political institutions for their political ends, we have
gone far beyond McCarthyism. This is far more dangerous than
McCarthyism. At least McCarthy was elected.

  Senator HATCH. Judge, I have a lot of other questions to ask you
and I think they are important questions. I think you deserve the
opportunity to tell your side of this and you have done it here so
far. And I have to tell you this has come down to this, one woman's
allegations that are 10 years old against your lifetime of service
over that same 10-year period. I have known you almost 11 years.
And the person that the good professor described is not the person
I have known.

  We are going to talk a little bit more about this tomorrow and
about what went on there and about how this could have hap-
pened. How one person's uncorroborated allegations, could destroy
a career and one of the most wonderful opportunities for a young
man from Pin Point, GA.
                                      185
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I repeat what I said, I have been hurt by
this deeply, and nothing is worth going through this. This has dev-
astated me and it has devastated my family. It is untrue. They are
lies. I have hundreds of women who work with me, and you can
call them, dozens who worked closely with me on my personal
staff. You can call them. You can bring them up and give them as
much air time as you have given this one, one person, with uncor-
roborated scurrilous lies and allegations. Give them as much time
and see what they say.
  Senator HATCH. I hope we will do that.
  Judge THOMAS. It is not just that, Senator, it is more than that.
You are ruining the country. If it can happen to me it can happen
to anybody, any time over any issue. Our institutions are being
controlled by people who will stop at nothing. They went around
this country looking for dirt, not information on Clarence Thomas,
dirt. Anybody with any dirt, anything, late night calls, calls at
work, calls at home, badgering, anything, give us some dirt. I think
that if our country has reached this point we are in trouble. And
you should feel worse for the country than you do for me.
  Senator HATCH. I feel bad for both.
  Mr. Chairman, I am sorry I have kept us over a little bit. I wish I
could proceed further tonight but I think we will wait until tomor-
row morning. I know everybody is dead tired, and I am sure you
are dead tired, I know that.
  So, thank you for giving me this extra time. You have always
been courteous and decent, and frankly, you have run this commit-
tee through this whole process in a courteous and decent way, in-
cluding the way in which you ran it with regard to the FBI report,
as well. We, on this side, know that but thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me, before we go, Judge Heflin, reserved
some of his time.
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Thomas, you describe Anita Hill and your
relationship with her up until you heard, on September, I believe
you said the 24th, as cordial, positive, had no trouble with her, in
any way. Now, you make rather strong statements. Do you think
that Anita Hill is lying?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I know that what she is saying is
untrue.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, what do you think that her motivations
are to come here and testify?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have agonized over that. I have
thought about it. I have thought about why she would say these
things, why she would come here, why it would keep changing. I
don't know.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, if you don't know, see we, in the commit-
tee, have a responsibility to figure out if she is not telling the
truth, why? When you worked with her did you feel that she was a
zealous civil rights supporter who was willing to consider and be
only a one-interest individual?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I cannot characterize her that way. I
have not thought about her that way. But I would like to address
what you said before that. I think you have more than an obliga-
tion to figure out why she would say that. I think you have an obli-

        56-273 O--93 7
                                      186

gation to determine why you would allow uncorroborated, unsub-
stantiated allegations to ruin my life.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, she has testified, that you, in effect, act as
a character witness for her. You have testified here about the rela-
tionship, her work, and her reputation and here we are trying to
get to the bottom of what the facts are. And we want to know what
the truth is, and you knew her probably better than any one of us.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there are others that you could bring as
witnesses. I have suggested to you there are dozens of people who
work there. And

  Senator HEFLIN. I think you have made a point and I hope they
are brought here.

  The CHAIRMAN. We are, we have agreed already to do that.
  Senator HEFLIN. But we are still faced with the fact, Judge, that
if she is lying why? We are still faced with the fact that if she is
telling a falsehood, what is the motivation?
  Now, we have watched her testify today and she is a meek
woman.
  Judge THOMAS. That is not as I remember Anita. Anita is, I can't
say that and you can ask others who visit here, Anita would not
have been considered a meek woman. She was an aggressive debat-
er. She stood her ground. When she got her dander up, she would
storm off and I would say that she is a bright person, a capable
person. Meek is not a characterization that I would remember.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, you say when she got her dander off she
would stalk off.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, she was a good debater. She fought for her
position. I don't remember her as being someone who was a push-
over.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, was she a vindicative woman?
  Judge THOMAS. I think, Senator, that she argued personally for
her position, and I took it as a sign of immaturity, perhaps, that
when she didn't get her way, that she would tend to reinforce her
position and get a bit angry. I did not see that as a character flaw
or vindictiveness.
  Senator HEFLIN. Did she have any indication to you that she
wanted to be a martyr in the civil rights movement?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I can't answer all those questions. What
I have attempted to do here is simply say to you that--you indicat-
ed that she was meek and suggesting that she was not an aggres-
sive, strong person. I remember Anita as aggressive, strong and
forceful and advocating the positions that she stood for. Again,
there are others who worked with her and I suggest that you have
them come before this committee and you ask them.
  With respect to why, as I saw through my own memory and my
own recollection of what could possibly have happened, particular-
ly at EEOC, the change in position, where she was no longer my
top assistant or my top aid and she became one of many, and cer-
tainly not the most senior and not the one who received the better
assignments and later not becoming the top assistant, that could
have been a basis for her being angry with me, but that doesn't
seem to be too much of a basis.
  I don't know, Senator. If I knew, I would not have been as per-
plexed as I am.
                                      187

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, did she ever show signs of being resentful?
  Judge THOMAS. I can't remember, Senator. I know that she has
shown signs that she was upset when she did not get her way.
Again, I am not going to sit here and attempt to criticize her char-
acter. I can only say that during the time that she worked with me,
she was not perfect, but there seemed to me nothing that would
suggest that she would do this to me.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, did she at any time during the time that
she worked with you at the EEOC, which most of--I mean at the
Department of Education, where most of the charges that she
makes against you pertaining to remarks about pornographic films
and pornographic materials, and then she says they continued
some, but that there were more at that time, she was your attorney
assistant, as I understand it.
  Judge THOMAS. Attorney adviser.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right. Did you at that time ever notice any-
thing about her that would indicate to you that she was out of
touch with reality?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, that is 10 years ago and my work-
ing relationship with her, she was professional and cordial, as I
suggested this morning. It did not involve, as I have indicated, any
discussion of pornographic material or any attempt to ever date
Anita. I view my special assistants as charges of mine. They are
students, they are kids of mine and I have an obligation to them. It
is the same way I feel toward interns and individual co-ops or stay-
in-school students.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, we are still left in a great quandary and
we are trying to get to the bottom of it. After she went to EEOC
with you, did she show any signs at that time of being out of touch
with reality?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, I am not a psychologist or psychi-
atrist, and at EEOC, I can tell you, I was enormously busy and
spent an enormous amount of time at the office, involved in any
number of activities. At EEOC, the assignments, as I remember
them, the individual in charge of the office, I had a chief of staff at
the time who would take care of the assignments and would be
more involved with the special assistants.
  My suggestion to you, as I have indicated, would be that this
committee spend some time with the people who worked there.
This committee has spent I think an inordinate amount of time
with someone making uncorroborated allegations against me, and
should have people who have worked with me, who have not seen
any such activity, who did not corroborate these allegations and
who had opportunities to work with and observe Anita Hill.
  Senator HEFLIN. I believe Chairman Biden adds to that, saying
that they will come and be available. But, now, at the Department
of Education and at the EEOC, did any fellow employee of hers, did
any supervisor of hers or anybody else indicate to you that she was
out of touch with reality?
  Judge THOMAS. The only one employee who indicated very
strongly to me during my tenure at EEOC that she was, I believe--
and I believe this may be a quote--my enemy, and I refused to be-
lieve that and argued with him about that and refused to act in
accordance with that.
                                      188

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, did he tell you any of the facts surround-
ing how he arrived at the opinion that she was your enemy?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I said, I ignored it. Loyalty is some-
thing that was important to me and I paid no attention to it and
he in recent days reminded me of what he told me.

  Senator HEFLIN. All right. Now, was there any other information
that came out while you were working with her that would indi-
cate to you that she lived in a fantasy world or anything?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, again, I don't know, I am not a psychia-
trist or psychologist. I was a busy chairman of an agency.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, here we are in a perplexed situation
trying to get to the bottom of it. I will ask you again, do you know
of any reason why she might purposely lie about these alleged inci-
dents?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't know why anyone would lie in
this fashion.

  Senator HEFLIN. I believe that is all.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, just because we take harassment serious-
ly doesn't mean we take the charges at face value. You have point-
ed out that when you worked with Anita Hill and up until the
moment that the charge was made available to you through an FBI
agent, you thought her to be a respected, reasonable, upstanding
person. When a respectable, reasonable, upstanding person, a pro-
fessor of law, someone with no blemish on her record, comes for-
ward, this committee has the obligation to do exactly what you
would have done at EEOC, investigate the charge.
  You are making a mistake, if you conclude that because this is
being investigated before all the evidence is in; the conclusion has
been reached by this committee.
  You have said some things tonight that are new information to
us. Assuming them to be true, it is the first time I've heard that
you were ever invited, drove home and/or were invited into Profes-
sor Hill's apartment to have a Coke or a beer. You have told us
things that are new. You should not in your understandable anger
refuse to tell us more. We have to figure this out.
  For us to have concluded, when faced with a person of Professor
Hill's standing and background that this is something we were not
going to look at would have been irresponsible.
  I don't disagree with you, it was irresponsible, the way in which
Professor Hill ended up before us. I understand that, and if I had
had anything to do with it, I would apologize for it, but in a very
much smaller fashion, I was at the other end of that one myself.
  So, do not in your anger refuse to tell us more tomorrow. This is
not decided. Witnesses are going to be coming forward, the wit-
nesses that you and your attorneys have asked us to hear, and
people we want to hear from.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, could I just make one last com-
ment?

   The CHAIRMAN. YOU may.

  Senator HATCH. I hope that nobody here, either on this panel or
in this room, is saying that, Judge, you have to prove your inno-
cence, because I think we have to remember and we have to insist
that Anita Hill has the burden of proof or any other challenger,
and not you, Judge.
                                      189
  The fact of the matter is, the accuser, under our system of juris-
prudence and under any system of fairness, would have to prove
their case.
  Judge we will go into some things tomorrow, and I look forward
to questioning again tomorrow, and we wish you a good night's rest
and we look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have been asked by one of my colleagues to
clarify one thing. I don't think you misunderstood it, but no one
else should. What I was referring to, that
  Senator HATCH. I wasn't referring to you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know you weren't. I am just referring to my
comment. I was referring to the fact that Professor Hill testified
here today that her statement, which we have attempted to keep
confidential, was leaked to the press. That is what I am referring
to as an injustice.
  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, just a moment, because Howell
Heflin and I came here to the Senate together in the class of 1978.
I have great respect for him and I see this terrible quandary that
he is in, because I have watched him work.
  Intimately we have worked together on a lot of things, and it is
the same thing we all feel, but there is a big difference here, and
Orrin has just touched on it, and that is what you said this morn-
ing, Mr. Chairman, in your very fair way, and I quote from your
statement, and I think we must not forget this, and this is a quote
from our Chairman this morning: "Fairness also means that Judge
Thomas must be given a full and fair opportunity to confront these
charges against him, to respond fully, to tell us his side of the story
and to be given the benefit of the doubt."
  Now, that's what we are doing here, and if there is any doubt, it
goes to Clarence Thomas, it does not go to Professor Hill.
  The CHAIRMAN. I made the statement and I stand by the state-
ment. That is why I--not that you need my recommendation,
Judge, but tell us what you know. We are trying to determine what
happened. It is as simple as that. And the mere fact, as I said, that
we take the allegation seriously does not mean that we assume the
allegation is correct.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I believe you mentioned
Clarence Thomas' attorneys. So far as I know, he has no attorneys.
He doesn't need any.
  The CHAIRMAN. Tomorrow, we will reconvene--I assume, Judge,
it is your choice, I assume you wish to come back tomorrow. The
committee is not demanding you come back tomorrow. Do you wish
to come back tomorrow?
  Judge THOMAS. I think so, Senator. I would like to finish this.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will reconvene at 10 o'clock.
  [Whereupon, at 10:34 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
on Saturday, October 12, 1991, at 10 a.m.]

  Good morning, Judge.

FURTHER TESTIMONY OF HON. CLARENCE THOMAS, OF GEOR-
  GIA, TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

  The CHAIRMAN. The Chair yields for the next round of question-
ing to the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Good morning, Judge. Judge, yesterday, you said--in answer, I
believe, to a question--that you had not watched or listened to the
6 or 7 hours of Professor Hill's testimony. You are obviously under
no requirement to do so, but I wonder if, since then, you have had
either an opportunity to read or be briefed about what she said?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, prior to coming here last night, I was
briefed about much of what she said. Of course, my wife watched
significant portions of it and talked about some of the things that
she had to say.
  Senator LEAHY. The reason I ask, is that you may have followed
a part of the testimony in which she spoke about going to dinner
with you at the time when you--when she, rather, was leaving the
EEOC. Are you familiar with that part of her testimony?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I am familiar that she said that. I didn't
see it. I was briefed that she said that.
  Senator LEAHY. Was there such a dinner?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I do not recall such a dinner. It was not
unusual for me, when a staffer was leaving, to go to lunch or to--
dinner would be more unusual, but not out of the question, but it
was not unusual to take them out and just simply say "thank you."
In later years, I know we had much bigger dinners. We would have

                                                        (191)
                                      192

many members of the staff go out and be a cause for great celebra-
tion. But I don't specifically recall such a dinner.

  Senator LEAHY. DO you recall any time ever taking Professor Hill
out to dinner?

  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, Judge, in her testimony, in which she
speaks of this dinner, she said that you had driven her to the res-
taurant--she did not recall the restaurant. You have heard, I am
sure, the conversation that she recounts as taking place. And then
after you left and went on to wherever you went, she took the
subway home, again according to her testimony. She said that the
two of you went there in your car. You were assigned, I believe, a
car and driver in your position. If that was so, would there be a log
that the driver keeps of where he might drive you?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator, we did not keep logs. I used my
driver more frequently in the early years and less frequently in my
later years at EEOC, but we didn't have logs.
  Senator LEAHY. Even though if drivers work late, they get paid
overtime, they don't keep logs of where they go?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my driver at that time worked with me
later. He was on my personal staff. I don't think the driver today is
on the personal staff. But the driver at EEOC was assigned to the
Chairman's office when I went onboard and would still have been
assigned to the Chairman's office.
  Senator LEAHY. At the time that Professor Hill was talking
about, just at the time that she was leaving the office, who would
have been the driver?
  Judge THOMAS. Mr. Randall, James Randall, who has since re-
tired.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. James Randall?
  Judge THOMAS. Randall.
  Senator LEAHY. I'm sorry, between the sound of the cameras
clicking, Judge, I still didn't hear the last name.
  Judge THOMAS. Mr. James Randall.
  Senator LEAHY. Randall. Thank you. But the bottom line is
that--well, let me make sure I understand this. Professor Hill said
the two of you went out to dinner as she was leaving. Professor
Hill, of course, further alleges--and this would be a major and ex-
plosive matter--that you said something to her to the effect, "If
you ever tell about this, it will damage or destroy my career." Now,
that was her statement. I want you to have a chance to give yours.
Am I correct in understanding your testimony now that you have
no recollection of ever having such a conversation at any time? Is
that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I have no recollection of having dinner with
her as she left, although I do not think that it would be unusual
for me to have gone either to lunch or to particularly an early
dinner with a member of my staff who was leaving. I would cate-
gorically deny that, under any circumstances, whether it is break-
fast, lunch or dinner, that I made those statements.
  Senator LEAHY. Then, would it be safe to say your testimony is:
At any time, whether in a social, business or any other setting, you
never made the statement, "If this comes out, it would ruin my
                                         193

career," or anything even relating to that kind of a statement. Is
that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Now, I just want to make sure I understand this and then we
will move on to another subject. Do you recollect ever going to
dinner with Professor Hill? I understand your saying it would not
be unusual to go with a member of the staff, but do you ever recol-
lect going to dinner with her at all?
  Judge THOMAS. I don't recall, other than the once I believe we
had dinner, perhaps, with Charles Kothe in Oklahoma subsequent
to her leaving EEOC, I don't recall ever having gone to dinner with
Professor Hill.
  Senator LEAHY. I understand that, and you have stated that
before, but I am just talking about the time when she was working
there. You did not have any such
  Judge THOMAS. I do not recall. Let me add one thing, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. Certainly.
  Judge THOMAS. I occasionally, with my personal staff as well as
with my personnel, when I am going out to lunch, I will grab the
first person available and say is anybody ready for lunch and walk
out to either a local place or perhaps just a deli to grab a sandwich.
That is customary with me, so I don't want to suggest that there
wasn't an occasion when I would do something like that.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge Thomas, I can't imagine a Member of the
Senate who doesn't do the same thing and say to some of the staff,
"Let's grab a sandwich, let's grab lunch," something like that, and
continue discussion of whatever might be going on. I don't think
you speak of something unusual, nor do I suggest you do.
  Tell me, Judge, you said yesterday that there were a couple of
occasions when you would go by Professor Hill's apartment, prob-
ably have a beer, and continue discussions. Do you recall? I forget
which Senator you had responded to.
  Judge THOMAS. That's not the way I said it, Senator. What I
said
   Senator LEAHY. Would you restate it the way you said it?
  Judge THOMAS. What I said was, when we were at the Depart-
ment of Education, there were, as I recall, a number of instances in
which I gave her a ride home and she asked me just to drop in to
continue discussion, and I would have a Coke or a beer or some-
thing and leave. That was, again, nothing, I thought nothing of it.
It was purely innocent on my part and nothing occurred with re-
spect to that, other than those conversations.
  Senator LEAHY. I'm not suggesting by the question that there
was anything that was not. I just wanted to make sure I under-
stand this. That was only when you were at the Department of
Education, is that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. That's the reason I recall that, is because I lived
in Southwest, and for a significant part of her tenure at EEOC, I
did not have a personal car, and she lived nearby on Capitol Hill.
The Switzer Building is in Southwest, and I would just simply give
her a ride to the other side of the Hill.
   Senator LEAHY. DO you recall where on the Hill she lived?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I do not.
                                      194

  Senator LEAHY. DO you recall anything at all about the apart-
ment, big, little, old, new?

  Judge THOMAS. She had a roommate, of course, and the area that
I remember was just a small living room-type area, where there
was a TV and I think a small couch or something.

  Senator LEAHY. OK. Do you remember whether it was an old
building, a new building or

  Judge THOMAS. I remember it as an old building or an older
building, and a duplex, for some reason a duplex in my mind.

  Senator LEAHY. NOW, Judge, you have spoken eloquently in the
past of the kind of racial harassment and racial discrimination
you've faced growing up--a lesson perhaps for everybody, realizing
that these are not some ancient things, that a man your age is
speaking within a generation of it.

  Let me ask you, since you have been in the work force for about
20 years since leaving law school, have you ever witnessed sexual
harassment first-hand?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have witnessed incidents that I would
consider sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct. As Chair-
man of EEOC, particularly, in the work force there, I was adamant
that this conduct would not take place, and anyone who has
worked with me understand that, I was adamant that it would not
take place.

  Senator LEAHY. In being adamant, how did you translate that to
staff or the people who worked for you? In statements, speeches,
memos, personnel--how would you do it, Judge?

  Judge THOMAS. If you engage in it, you will be fired, simple.
  Senator LEAHY. The easiest way to have it.
  Judge THOMAS. If you engage in it, you will be fired.
  Senator LEAHY. We have a similar rule in my office for drug
abuse and sexual harassment: If you do it, you're gone.
  Judge THOMAS. Anyone who, and you will have witnesses who
have worked with me, you ask them what my statements were. It
was very simple. That is particularly easy on a personal staff and
it is particularly easy with schedule C appointees.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, you said you have witnessed sexual har-
assment first-hand. What was the nature of--can you just give me
some idea of the type that you have seen?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, the types of things are, again, people using
graphic language to subordinates who are female, women, there
would be individuals who would expect certain conduct on the part
of women, that they expect to stay in the work force or to prosper.
Those kinds of things I have seen either when I was not in the po-
sition to do anything about it and I've heard about when I was in a
position to do something about it, and in the latter instance, I did
something about it.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, it is a very difficult thing to do here,
under the circumstances, but could you just step out of the role for
a moment of being a Supreme Court nominee and think back to
being head of the EEOC? You get a call from an investigator in a
district office who has just had a woman come in with a claim of
sexual harassment. He relays the claim to you and you look at it
and say, "Yes, this fits on all fours within the regulations and stat-
                                      195

utes." And he says, "But, Mr. Chairman, it was 5 years ago, the
statute has run." What would you say to him?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, that is certainly something that never
occurred during my tenure. There were instances in which there
were older charges of that nature. What we would generally find
would be that the person involved would have engaged in a pattern
of that kind of practice.

  To give you an instance, if that person is a manager that we are
talking about, you could find a pattern and you can find more
recent occurrences, to my knowledge--again, this may not always
be the case, but when you have a person who is engaged in gro-
tesque conduct or harassing conduct, you will find more than one
person. If the person has a habit of harassing secretaries, you will
find a series of secretaries. If the person has a habit of harassing
professionals, subordinates, or other employees, you will find a
series of those. You will not find generally just one isolated in-
stance, and I think that would be the trigger to look for more in-
stances of them.

  Senator LEAHY. Would it be unusual, though, to have the initial
allegation be something that happened sometime back? I under-
stand what you are saying about the pattern, that you didn't recon-
struct later, but would it be unusual to have the initial allegation
of sex harassment be of sometime past?

  Judge THOMAS. TO my knowledge, Senator, based on just what I
have seen personally, it would be unusual.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Judge THOMAS. Usually, what you would have is you would have
a recent occurrence that would trigger an instance, and then you
would look back and you will see a pattern.
  Senator LEAHY. Going back to the charges that Professor Hill
made yesterday, one was of your discussing pornographic films
with her. She stated this happened on a number of occasions and
that she had found it uncomfortable and asked you not to. Let me
ask you--she has been asked whether this happened--let me ask
you: Did you ever have a discussion of pornographic films with Pro-
fessor Hill?
  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely not.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you ever had such discussions with any
other women?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I will not get into any discussions that I
might have about my personal life or my sex life with any person
outside of the workplace.
  Senator LEAHY. I m not asking
  Judge THOMAS. I will categorically say I have not had any such
discussions with Professor Hill.
  Senator LEAHY. Please don't misunderstand my question, Judge.
I am confining it to the workplace. I have no interest in what
might be your personal life. That is yours. What I am asking about
is within--as she alleges--within the workplace. Let me make sure
I fully understand--I am asking you this question, so that you can
give the answer.
  Am I correct in understanding your answer that within the
workplace with Professor Hill, you never had such a discussion?
  Judge THOMAS. Right.
                                      196

  Senator LEAHY. YOU never had such discussions within the work-
place with any other women?

  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator LEAHY. Or anyone, for that matter?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Now, were you interviewed--you were interviewed by the FBI,
you have talked about that. Were you interviewed on--there seems
to be some confusion--on September 28 by the FBI?
  Judge THOMAS. I don't know which dates in September. I was
interviewed on Wednesday, I believe, September 25, I'm not sure.
  Senator LEAHY. I think we have some confusion. In your affida-
vit, it says, "I told the Federal Bureau of Investigation on Septem-
ber 28, 1991,1 categorically deny"
  Judge THOMAS. Well, it's Wednesday.
  Senator LEAHY. I've got--it says "date of transcription," the FBI,
it says 9-28-91. It was faxed on September 25, 1991, and I am just
wondering--we have in about five different places on here--if the
FBI has made a typographical error and has the dates off by 3
days. It was on a Wednesday, which is
  Judge THOMAS. It was on a Wednesday.
  Senator LEAHY. When you had that discussion with them, did
they ever mention or did you ever mention to them going to her
apartment at any time, going to Professor Hill's apartment at any
time?
  Judge THOMAS. I think I may have mentioned that I dropped her
off at home and I may have mentioned that I had been in her
apartment. I can't remember. I don't think they were focusing on
that. I think they were focusing more on whether or not I--the al-
legations that she made.
  Senator LEAHY. I understand. You said yesterday in your state-
ment that,

  I cannot imagine anything that I said or did to Anita Hill that could have been
mistaken for sexual harassment. With that said, if there is anything that I have
said that has been misconstrued by Anita Hill or anyone else to be sexual harass-
ment, then I can say that I'm so very sorry, I wish I had known; if I did know I
would have stopped immediately, and I would not, as I have done over the past 2
weeks, tear away at myself trying to think of what I could have possibly done, but I
have not said or done the things Anita Hill has alleged.

  I have heard people say was there something further to that.
Can you think of anything--I mean, you say if there was anything,
then you're very sorry, but you are also saying you cannot think of
anything that could approach this, is that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. That's right, Senator. I have agonized over this.
This has not been an easy matter for me, and I don't know how or
why she would say these things. I don't know what I could have
done that would have resulted in this, and that is just to simply
make that point, that if I did anything to anyone that would bring
them to a point to suggest or to think that I engaged in sexual har-
assment, then I am sorry, because it is certainly conduct that I
would not approve and conduct that I would not engage in.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, let me follow up on that a bit, since you
searched your mind for why she would do this. Now, if I under-
stand your testimony, I am trying to give a summary--and please
                                      197

correct me if I am inaccurate in the summary--you feel that you
gave Professor Hill opportunities in Government service, as you
have others, is that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator LEAHY. And you have stated that you felt a particular
responsibility, you spoke of them really basically almost as family,
to the people that have worked for you and for bringing them for-
ward and giving them these opportunities, is that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, Senator. In Professor Hill's case--and it is
important to me that this be understood--I believe that when I
have assistants or interns, that I have a personal responsibility for
them, as teacher, advisor, not employer. I am the employer, also,
but they are my personal charges for whom I have responsibility.
  Anita Hill came to me through one of my dearest, dearest
friends--he was the best man at my wedding, we were at Holy
Cross College together, we were at Yale Law School together, we
were the two slowest guys on the track team, we spent a lot of time
together, we lived across the way from each other in law school, we
lived together during the summer when my marriage broke up, I
slept at his apartment--this was my dearest friend, and when he
brought her to my attention, it was a special responsibility that he
asked me to take on, and I felt very strongly that I could discharge
that in the way that I did, and that was to be careful about her
career, to make sure she had opportunities, to be there to offer
advice and counsel, and that is something that I continued with my
other special assistants. They are family. My clerks are my family.
They are my friends.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, then, having done all this for Professor
Hill, and knowing now what she has said here, and what you have
read, and hearing her statement, under oath, explicit as it was--a
statement that you have categorically denied, to use your term--
why would she do this?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, you know, I, I have asked myself that
question, as I told you. I have not slept very much in the last 2Vfe
weeks. I have thought unceasingly about this, and my wife simply
said, "Stop torturing yourself."
  I don't know why family members turn on each other. I don't
know why a son or a daughter, or a brother or sister would write
some book that destroys a family. I don't know. All I can tell you is
that from my standpoint I felt that I did everything I could toward
Professor Hill in the same way that I would do with my other spe-
cial assistants to discharge my responsibilities. I don't know. I do
not have the answer.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you had any conversation with her since
this began? I mean, since these charges came out?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. I am not trying to be facetious, Judge, I am
just--I mean, was there any attempt, not by you, but was there
any attempt by Professor Hill--did she make any attempt to reach
you?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, not to my knowledge. Senator, I have had no
conversations with her since, to my knowledge, November 1991.
  Senator LEAHY. SO, when did you first hear of these allegations?
                                      198

  Judge THOMAS. When the FBI walked--I first heard that there
had been, in a call from the White House, allegations of an unspec-
ified nature which needed to be--and the FBI would be sent out.
That was Wednesday morning, the 28th or 25th. And that I was to
contact the FBI agent or the FBI and set up an appointment. I did
that and the agent came out, I think lVfe or 2 hours later. The first
I heard of the nature of the allegations was when the FBI agent,
after identifying himself, informed me.

  Senator LEAHY. At your home?
  Judge THOMAS. At my home.
  Senator LEAHY. And were you there alone meeting with him
or
  Judge THOMAS. I was there alone with two FBI agents.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, what was your reaction? I mean when
you heard this--you are saying you heard this for the first time--
what was your reaction?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my reaction initially, I was stunned. I
was hurt. I was confused. I was pained. I did not know what hap-
pened, I did not know where it came from. I did not know what the
basis of it was. I couldn't believe it and when he said there is an
allegation by Anita Hill, I think my words to him were, "Anita?"
And then when he told me what the nature of the allegations was,
I said, "You can't"--something, like you have got to be kidding.
This can't be true.
  I can't remember. All I can tell you it was painful.
  Senator LEAHY. There was no flash, could she have miscon-
strued
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator LEAHY. Fill-in-the-blank that?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, it is just like this is incredible, I can't believe
it.
  Senator LEAHY. Have you now--I don't want to go through repe-
tition of them here--but have you now heard the specific charges
that Professor Hill made yesterday during her 6 or 7 hours of testi-
mony against you?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I have heard the initial charges through
the FBI agent and I have been briefed on the specific charges from
yesterday that were different from the previous statements.
  Senator LEAHY. And, Judge, what is your response to those spe-
cific charges again?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my response is that I categorically, un-
equivocally deny them. They did not occur.
  Senator LEAHY. Incidentally, somebody just handed me a note,
and I missed this, too, but you said your last contact with Professor
Hill was November 1991.
  Judge THOMAS. 1990, I am sorry, 1990. I would have to be clair-
voyant I guess. [Laughter.]
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, I think that you and I may disagree on a
number of things, but I think both of us would agree on one thing.
Neither of us have been clairvoyant in these hearings or in this
process. But you meant 1990?
  Judge THOMAS. 1990.
                                      199

  Senator LEAHY. Have you spoken with any of the witnesses of
this hearing within the last week, the witnesses who are going to
be at this hearing?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't know. You would have to give me each of
the witnesses, Senator. I have spoken with friends of mine who
were at EEOC and maybe some of the witnesses. I have spoken to
them in the halls here, they have called to wish me well. These are
people who are like family to me. These are not--these are former
special assistants, I believe, and individuals who were in the inner
confines of my office. And again, as I indicated, my staff and I are
family.

  Senator LEAHY. DO you know whether personnel from the White
House have talked to the witnesses who are going to appear here?

  Judge THOMAS. I would assume they coordinated their appear-
ance here, Senator, so I would assume the conversations did occur
to make sure they were here and the timing, et cetera.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Judge.
  My time is up and I know that Senator Hatch and Senator Biden
have time and I will come back later on.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Chairman Biden.
  Judge there are a lot of things in Anita Hill's testimony that just
don't make sense to me. I liked her personally. I thought she pre-
sented herself well. There is no question she is a very intelligent
law professor. She has graduated from one of the finest schools in
the land, law schools that is, and her undergraduate work was ex-
emplary.
  She is clearly a very intelligent woman. And I think everybody
who listened to her wants to like her and many do. But, Judge, it
bothers me because it just doesn't square with what I think is--
some of it doesn't square with what I think is common experience,
and just basic sense, common sense.
  I hesitate to do this again but I think it is critical and I know it
outrages you, as it would me, as it would anybody who is accused of
these type of activities.
  In her first statement on this issue, given to the FBI she said
that about 2 or 3 weeks after Thomas originally asked her for a
date, he started talking about sex. He told her about his experi-
ences and preferences and would ask her what she liked or if she
had ever done the same thing. Hill said that he discussed oral sex
between men and women. Thomas also discussed viewing films of
people haying sex with each other and with animals. He told her
that he enjoyed watching the films and told her that she should see
them. He never asked her watch the films with him. Thomas liked
to discuss specific sex acts and frequency of sex.
  That is allegation No. 1, given in what I consider to be a pretty
decent FBI investigation, pretty thorough, by a man and a woman,
FBI agent.
  In the 4-page statement that she issued, which of course was
leaked to the press by somebody on this committee, in violation of
law, in violation of the Senate ethics, in violation of a stringent
rule formulated because these FBI reports contain raw data. And
information from the FBI report was released and this statement
                                               200

was given, in fact, the reporter who broke the story read the state-
ment to her, according to her own remarks.

  She then said in this statement--this is the second one--after
brief discussion about work he would turn the conversation to dis-
cussions about sexual interests. His conversations were very vivid.
He spoke about acts that he has seen in pornographic films involv-
ing such things as women having sex with animals and films in-
volving group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic
materials depicting individuals with large penises or breasts in-
volved in various sex acts.

  That is the second statement which is considerably different
from the first and adds some language in. And you denied each and
every one of these allegations last night.

  So I won't go through that again today, although if you want to
say anything about it further, I would be happy to have you do it.

  Then, yesterday, she appeared before this committee and in her
statement yesterday, her written statement of which I have a copy,
that was distributed to the press and everybody else, she said "his
conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had
seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women
having sex with animals and films snowing group sex and rape
scenes. He talked about pornographic materials depicting individ-
uals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex
acts. On several occasions, Thomas told me graphically of his own
sexual prowess." Three different versions, each expansive, each
successively expansive.

  Now, Judge Thomas, anybody who made all of those cumulative
statements--if you take one of them out of context, they are so
graphic and so crude, and so outrageous, and I think so stupid, that
would be enough, in my opinion, to find sexual harassment against
anybody, if it happened. But if you have all of those cumulatively
together the person who would do something like that, over a
period of time, really a short period of time according to her, and
in two different separate agencies, we will put it that way, that
person, it seems to me, would not be a normal person. That person,
it seems to me, would be a psychopathic sex fiend or a pervert.

  Now, Judge, you have had to have thought about this, I know
you are outraged by it, and you have denied all of these things, and
you said, these things did not happen, they are simply untrue.

  And you have had an evening to think about it, do you have any-
thing further to say about it?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my reaction to this has been, over the
last 2 weeks, has been one of horror. I can't tell you what I have
lived through. I can't tell you what my wife has lived through or
my family. I can't tell you what my son has lived through. I don't
know what to tell him about this. If I were going to date someone
outside of the work place, I would certainly not approach anyone I
was attempting to date, as a person, with this kind of grotesque
language.

  Senator HATCH. I have to interrupt you here, Judge, but there
was an implication that you not only repetitively asked her for
dates--I don't know, I guess that can be construed as sexual har-
assment, repetitively asking a woman for dates--but the implica-
                                      201

tion was, and the clear implication which she spoke about was that
you wanted more than dates, if her allegations were true.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I did not ask her out, and I did not use
that language. One of the things that has tormented me over the
last 2V2 weeks has been how do I defend myself against this kind of
language and these kind of charges? How do I defend myself?
That's what I asked the FBI agent, I believe, for the first time.
That's what I have asked myself, how do I defend myself?

  If I used that kind of grotesque language with one person, it
would seem to me that there would be traces of it throughout the
employees who worked closely with me; there would be other indi-
viduals who heard it, or bits and pieces of it, or various levels of it.

  Senator HATCH. Don't worry, Judge, probably before the week-
end's out they will find somebody who will say that.

  Judge THOMAS. Well, the difficulty also was that, from my stand-
point, is that in this country when it comes to sexual conduct we
still have underlying racial attitudes about black men and their
views of sex. And once you pin that on me, I can't get it off. That is
why I am so adamant in this committee about what has been done
to me. I made it a point at EEOC and at Education not to play into
those stereotypes, at all. I made it a point to have the people at
those agencies, the black men, the black women to conduct them-
selves in a way that is not consistent with those stereotypes, and I
did the same thing myself.

  Senator HATCH. When you talk in terms of stereotypes, what are
you saying here? I mean I want to understand this. First of all, let
me go back to your first spot.

  You said that if you wanted to date somebody or even if you
wanted to seduce somebody--you didn't say that--but just put
yourself in the mind of this, if you had wanted to seduce her, is
this the kind of language you would use? Is this the kind of lan-
guage a reasonable person would use, is this the kind of language
that anybody would use who wanted a relationship?

  Judge THOMAS. Outside of the work force, or outside of the work-
place that is not certainly the way I would approach someone I
would want to date. Whether I would date that person for a long
time or just go to dinner, that is not my approach. I think that--
and I have to reiterate this--that for someone in the work force to
use that kind of grotesque language it has to show up with other
staff members. When we looked at sex harassment cases, when we
looked at cases of people involved in unacceptable conduct of this
nature, there was always a pattern. The other point that I am
making that is of great concern to me is that this is playing into a
stereotype.

  Senator HATCH. Before we get to that, Judge, I am going to get to
that, that's an interesting concept that you have just raised, and I
promise I will get back to it. You are a very intelligent man, there
is no question about it. Anybody who watches you knows that. You
could not have risen to these high positions in Government, been
confirmed four times by the august U.S. Senate, three times by the
Labor Committee--upon which a number of us, here on this com-
mittee serve, and whose staff members were used in this investiga-
tion--and I might add, once now before the Judiciary Committee,
august committees.
                                               202

  She is an extremely intelligent woman and from all appearances
a lovely human being. Do you think an intelligent African-Ameri-
can male, like you, or any other intelligent male, regardless of
race, would use this kind of language to try and start a relation-
ship with an intelligent, attractive woman?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't know anyone who would try to
establish a relationship with that kind of language.

  Senator HATCH. Unless they were sick.
  Judge THOMAS. I don't know of anyone.
  Senator HATCH. I don't even know of people who might have
emotional disturbances who would try this. Now, I want to ask you
about this intriguing thing you just said. You said some of this lan-
guage is stereotype language? What does that mean, I don't under-
stand.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the language throughout the history of
this country, and certainly throughout my life, language about the
sexual prowess of black men, language about the sex organs of
black men, and the sizes, et cetera, that kind of language has been
used about black men as long as I have been on the face of this
Earth. These are charges that play into racist, bigoted stereotypes
and these are the kind of charges that are impossible to wash off.
And these are the kinds of stereotypes that I have, in my tenure in
Government, and the conduct of my affairs, attempted to move
away from and to convince people that we should conduct ourselves
in a way that defies these stereotypes. But when you play into a
stereotype it is as though you are skiing downhill, there's no way
to stop it.
  And this plays into the most bigoted, racist stereotypes that any
black man will face.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I saw--I didn't understand the television
program, there were two black men--I may have it wrong, but as I
recall--there were two black men talking about this matter and
one of them said, she is trying to demonize us. I didn't understand
it at the time. Do you understand that?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, I understand it and any black man in this
country--Senator, in the 1970's I became very interested in the
issue of lynching. And if you want to track through this country, in
the 19th and 20th centuries, the lynchings of black men, you will
see that there is invariably or in many instances a relationship
with sex--an accusation that that person cannot shake off. That is
the point that I am trying to make. And that is the point that I
was making last night that this is high-tech lynching. I cannot
shake off these accusations because they play to the worst stereo-
types we have about black men in this country.
  Senator HATCH. Well, this bothers me.
  Judge THOMAS. It bothers me.
  Senator HATCH. I can see why. Let me, I hate to do this, but let
me ask you some tough questions. You have talked about stereo-
types used against black males in this society. In the first state-
ment of Anita Hill she alleges that he told her about his experi-
ences and preferences and would ask her what she liked or if she
had ever done the same thing? Is that a black stereotype?
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
                                                  203

  Senator HATCH. OK. Anita Hill said that he discussed oral sex
between men and women. Is that a black stereotype?

  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HATCH. Thomas also discussed viewing films of people
having sex with each other and with animals. What about that?
  Judge THOMAS. That's not a stereotype about blacks.
  Senator HATCH. OK. He told her that he enjoyed watching the
films and told her that she should see them. Watching X-rated
films or pornographic films, is that a stereotype?
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HATCH. He never asked her to watch the films with him,
Thomas liked to discuss specific sex acts and frequency of sex.
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I don't think so. I think that could--the last,
frequency--could have to do with black men supposedly being very
promiscuous or something like that.
  Senator HATCH. SO it could be partially stereotypical?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. In the next statement she said,

  His conversations were very vivid. He spoke about acts that he had seen in porno-
graphic films involving such things as women having sex with animals and films
involving group sex or rape scenes. He talked about pornographic materials depict-
ing individuals with large penises or breasts involved in various sex acts.

  What about those things?
  Judge THOMAS. I think certainly the size of sexual organs would
be something.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I am concerned. "Thomas told me graphi-
cally of his own sexual prowess," the third statement.
  Judge THOMAS. That is clearly
  Senator HATCH. Clearly a black stereotype.
  Judge THOMAS [continuing]. Stereotypical, clearly.
  Senator HATCH. DO you think that--well, what do you feel about
that?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I have said before, this whole affair
has been anguish for me. I feel as though I have been abused in
this process, as I said last night, and I continue to feel that way. I
feel as though something has been lodged against me and painted
on me and it will leave an indelible mark on me. This is something
that not only supports but plays into the worst stereotypes about
black men in this society. And I have no way of changing it, and no
way of refuting these charges.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, let me just--people hearing yesterday's tes-
timony are probably wondering how could this quiet, you know, re-
tired, woman know about something like "Long Dong Silver"? Did
you tell her that?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I don't know how she knows.
  Senator HATCH. IS that a black stereotype, something like Long
Dong Silver?
  Judge THOMAS. TO the extent, Senator, that it is a reference to
one's sexual organs, and the size of one's sexual organs, I think it
is.
  Senator HATCH. There is an interesting case that I found called
Carter v. Sedgwick County, Kansas, a 1988 case, dated September
30. It is a Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals case. It is a district court
case. It is a district court case within the tenth circuit.
                                             204

  And do you know which circuit Oklahoma is in?
  Judge THOMAS. My guess would be the tenth circuit. I remember
serving on a moot court panel with a judge from the tenth circuit
and I believe she was from Tulsa.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I have to tell you something, I believe
Oklahoma is in the tenth circuit, and Utah is also.
  An interesting case and I am just going to read one paragraph, if
anybody wants to read it. I apologize in advance for some of the
language, I really do. It is a civil rights case, an interesting civil
rights case.
  And again I apologize in advance for the language. I just want to
read one paragraph. "Plaintiff testified that during the course of
her employment she was subjected to numerous racial slurs"--by
the way this is an extremely interesting case because the head note
says, black female brought suit against county and county officials
contending she suffered sexual harassment and was unlawfully ter-
minated from her employment with county on the basis of her race
and sex. Now, anybody who wants it, we will make copies for you
or you can get it. I will give the citation, as a matter of fact. The
citation is 705 F.Supp 1474, District Court Kansas, 1988.
  Let me just read the one paragraph.

  Plaintiff testified that during the course of her employment she was subjected to
numerous racial slurs and epithets at the hands of the Defendant Brand. And was
sexually harassed by Defendant Cameron. Specifically as to Plaintiffs claim of race
discrimination. Plaintiff testified that Defendant Brand referred to Plaintiff on sev-
eral occasions as John's [Cameron] token

  I apologize for this word, but it is in here--"nigger." That is cer-
tainly racist.

  And at other times, would tell Plaintiff that it was "nigger pick day". Plaintiff
claims that Defendant Brand kept a picture of a black family in his office, and when
Plaintiff questioned Brand about the picture he boasted of his own

  And the word is used again--"blood and of his sexual conquests
of black"--and I am not going to say that word, it is a pejorative
term, it is a disgusting term.

  So, this man was claiming sexual conquests.

  Plaintiff further testified that on one occasion Defendant Brand presented her
with a picture of Long Dong Silver--a photo of a black male with an elongated
penis.

  I apologize again.
  Well, it goes on, it gets worse, maybe not worse, but it goes on.
That is the public opinion that's available in any law library. I
have to tell you I am sure it is available there at the law school in
Oklahoma and it is a sexual harassment case.
  I am really concerned about this matter. Because, first of all, I
really don't believe for one instant, knowing you for 11 years, sit-
ting in on four confirmation processes, having them pick at you,
and fight at you, and find fault all the way through--and it is fair
game with regard to what you did and what you tried to do, what
your excesses were with regard to your job, what your failures
were, what your successes were--all of that is fair game and it
happened.
  And you went through it and you held your dignity and an-
swered all the questions. You were confirmed three times in a row.
                                               205

This is your fourth time. And you should be confirmed here. Never
once were you attacked like this by anybody and I know you, and
the people who know you the best and that involves hundreds of
people, think the world of you. They know you are a good man.
They know this woman's a good woman. And this is not consistent
with reality. And I am not going to find fault beyond that with
Professor Hill. I liked her, too, she presented herself well.

  I will tell you the Juan Williams piece in the Washington Post
telling how all these interest groups have scratched through every-
thing on Earth to try and get something on you, all over the coun-
try, all over this town, all over your agency, all over everybody.
And there are a lot of slick lawyers in those groups, slick lawyers,
the worst kind. There are some great ones, too, and it may have
been a great one who found the reference to "Long Dong Silver",
which I find totally offensive.

  And I find it highly ironic that you have testified here, today,
that used against you by one who taught civil rights, who came
from one of the five best law schools in the country, who is an in-
telligent, apparently decent African-American, used against you, a
bunch of black stereotype accusations.

  What do you think about that?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I have indicated before and I will con-
tinue to say this and believe this, I have been harmed. I have been
harmed. My family has been harmed. I have been harmed worse
than I have ever been harmed in my life. I wasn't harmed by the
Klan, I wasn't harmed by the Knights of Camelia, I wasn't harmed
by the Aryan race, I wasn't harmed by a racist group, I was
harmed by this process, this process which accommodated these at-
tacks on me. If someone wanted to block me from the Supreme
Court of the United States because of my views on the Constitu-
tion, that is fine. If someone wanted to block me because they felt I
was not qualified, that is fine. If someone wanted to block me be-
cause they don't like the composition of the Court, that is fine. But
to destroy me, Senator, I would have preferred an assassin's bullet
to this kind of living hell that they have put me and my family
through.
  Senator HATCH. Let me just give you one more. Everybody knows
that the worst nightmare for any trial lawyer is to have a person
who has an impeccable background, a good appearance and ap-
pears to believe everything that person is saying, testifying. And it
happens in lots of trials, lots of them.
  I have been there, believe it or not. I have lost a lot of the skills,
but I have been there. Sixteen years here causes you to lose a lot of
things. You almost lose your mind sometimes, and some have sug-
gested that I have, from time to time. But I am just going to give
you one more because it really offends me, maybe it doesn't any-
body else, maybe I am wrong. But I don't think so. I have been
through this a lot of times. I have been through this, only usual-
ly--Senator Biden, I am really going to have to take more time
than a half hour, if you will let me, I have got to finish this and I
have got to finish my line of questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, you can take the time you
want and then we will just reallocate the rest of the time.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you. I really appreciate that.
                                         206

  She testified:

  One of the oddest episodes I remember was an occasion in which Thomas was
drinking a Coke in his office, he got up from the table, at which we were working,
went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and asked, "Who has put
pubic hair on my Coke?"

  That's what she said. Did you ever say that?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, absolutely not.
  Senator HATCH. Did you ever think of saying something like
that?
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HATCH. That's a gross thing to say, isn't it?
  Whether it is said by you or by somebody else, it is a gross thing
to say, isn't it?
  Judge THOMAS. AS far as I am concerned, Senator, it is and it is
something I did not nor would I say.
  Senator HATCH. Ever read this book?
  Judge THOMAS. NO.
  Senator HATCH. "The Exorcist"?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Ever see the movie?
  Judge THOMAS. I have seen only the scene with the bed flapping.
  Senator HATCH. I am going to call your attention, and keep in
mind, Juan Williams said, this great journalist for the Washington
Post, I differ with him, but he is a great journalist. I don't differ
with him on everything, we agree on a lot of things.
  We certainly agree in this area. But he wrote down what they
have tried to do to smear you, he wrote down that they have the
whole country blanketed trying to dig up dirt, just like you have
said it, just like you have said it. And let me tell you these are not
itty-bitty tort attorney investigators. These are the smartest attor-
neys from the best law schools in the land, all paid for at the
public interest expense, that is what is ruining our country, in
large measure because some of these groups, not all of them--
many of these public interests are great, I don't mean to malign
them all--but a number of them are vicious. We saw it in the Bork
matter and we are seeing it here.
  You said you never did say this, "Who has put pubic hair on my
Coke." You never did talk to her about "Long Dong Silver." I
submit, those things were found.
  On page 70 of this particular version of the "Exorcist,"

  Oh, Burk, sighed Sharon. In a guarded tone, she described an encounter between
the Senator and the director. Dennings had remarked to him, in passing, said
Sharon, that there appeared to be "an alien pubic hair floating around in my gin."

  Do you think that was spoken by happenstance? She would have
us believe that you were saying these things, because you wanted
to date her? What do you think about that, Judge?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think this whole affair is sick.
  Senator HATCH. I think it's sick, too.
  Judge THOMAS. I don't think I should be here today. I don't think
that this inquisition should be going on. I don't think that the FBI

have been put through this ordeal, and I don't think that our coun-
try should be brought low by this kind of garbage.

  Senator HATCH. These two FBI agents told her to be as specific
as she could possibly be, and yet she never said anything about
Long Dong Silver or pubic hair to them. She didn't say it in her
statement, her 4-page statement, which is extensive, single-spaced,
4 pages. But she said it yesterday.

  I don't know whether you noticed, but I noticed that whole en-
tourage--not her family, they looked beautiful, they look like won-
derful people to me. Look at her parents, they are clearly good
people, clearly, her sisters, clearly good people. But I saw the en-
tourage come in, and I'm not saying they did this, but you can bet
your bottom dollar that someone found every possible stereotype,
to use your terms--but I never fully understood that--every possi-
ble stereotype that could be dug up.

  Judge Thomas, I just have to finish another short line of ques-
tions. I will have others later.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, you are welcome to do that. Can you
give us an idea how long you are going to go?

  Senator HATCH. If you could give me another 10 minutes, I would
appreciate it.

  The CHAIRMAN. Sure, just so we have an idea.
  Senator HATCH. First of all, I would like to put Juan Williams'
article into the record at this point.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.

  Senator HATCH. "The phone calls came throughout September,"
Juan Williams said.

  Did Clarence Thomas ever take money from the South African government? Was
he under orders from the Reagan White House when he criticized civil rights lead-
ers? Did he beat his first wife? Did I know anything about expense account charges
he filed for out-of-town speeches? Did he say that women don't want equal pay for
equal work? And finally, one exasperated voice said, "Have you got anything on
your tapes we can use to stop Thomas." The calls came from staff members working
for Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

  I didn't say that. I am just repeating it, but I know it's true.

  They were calling me, because several articles written about Thomas have carried
my byline. When I was working as a White House correspondent in the early 1980's,
I had gotten to know Thomas as a news source and later wrote a long profile of him.
The desperate search for ammunition to shoot down Thomas has turned the 102
days

  This is just a few days ago--

  102 days since President Bush nominated him for a seat on the Supreme Court
into a liberal's nightmare. Here is indiscriminate, mean-spirited mudslinging sup-
ported by the so-called champions of fairness: liberal politicians, unions, civil rights
groups and women's organizations.

  All of whom Juan Williams has regard for, or at least did up
until this article. I am just reading excerpts.

  Now the Senate has extended its attacks on fairness, decency and its own good
name by averting its eyes, while someone in a position to leak has corrupted the
entire hearing process.--

  It couldn't have been said better in one paragraph, somebody on
this committee--

  By releasing a sealed affidavit containing an allegation that had been investigated
by the FBI, reviewed by Thomas' opponents and supporters on the Senate commit-
tee and put aside as inconclusive and insufficient to warrant further investigation
to stop the committee's final vote.

  It is an interesting article. I commend it to everybody.
  Judge Thomas, I have a copy of a November 14, 1984, memoran-
dum concerning sexual harassment that you issued within the
EEOC. The memo emphasizes the importance of an earlier EEOC
order issued shortly before your arrival at that agency.
  Judge Thomas, before I get into that memo, I would just like to
say this to you, and I wrote it down, because I wanted to say it
right: I have to tell you, Judge Thomas, I have reflected on these
hearings--this is my handwriting--and what has unfolded this past
week is terrible. One of the things that I find most ironic is that
many have tried to turn this issue into a referendum on sexual
harassment.
  Well, let me say, this is not a referendum on sexual harassment.
We all deplore sexual harassment. We all deplore the type of con-
duct articulated here by Professor Hill. But the most ironic thing
to me is, it is easy for us on this committee to say that we deplore
sexual harassment, and many on this committee have said in the
past and during these proceedings and before the media.
  But you, Judge Thomas you have spent your career doing some-
thing about it, a heck of a lot more than deploring sexual harass-
ment. You and your people at the EEOC have been directly in-
volved and have done a lot about it, I know that, because, along
                                      212

with Senator Kennedy and the other members of the Labor Com-
mittee, we oversee what you do.

  Now, the memo that you issued at the EEOC on sexual harass-
ment, this emphasizes the importance of an earlier EEOC order
issued shortly before your arrival at the agency, and that memo
stated in unequivocal terms that sexual harassment is illegal.

  The final paragraph of the memo, which was signed by you,
reads as follows:

  I expect every Commission employee to personally insure that their own conduct
does not sexually harass other employees, applicants or any other individual in the
workplace. Managers are to take the strongest disciplinary measure against those
employees found guilty of sexual harassment. Sexual harassment will not be tolerat-
ed at the agency.

  Underlined.
  Now, Judge Thomas, does this memo reflect a major policy com-
mitment of yours?
  Judge THOMAS. It expresses my strong attitude and my adamant
attitude that sex harassment was not to take place at EEOC.
  Senator HATCH. Judge Thomas, I also have a copy of an EEOC
plan for the prevention of sexual harassment issued in 1987, while
you were Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, which clearly states that sexual harassment includes "un-
welcome sexual teasing, jokes, remarks or questions." Now, is this
consistent with the views that you personally have believed in and
have abided by during your lifetime?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. Or certainly during these last 10 or 11 years
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, Senator.
  Senator HATCH [continuing]. Which are the years in question.
Was sexual harassment tolerated within the EEOC by you, as
Chairman, or while you were Chairman?
  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely not.
  Senator HATCH. Did you make clear your views to those around
you or who were working with you on sexual harassment?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, on many occasions.
  Senator HATCH. I would like to just bring up briefly, to ask you
what your experience was in handling sexual harassment charges
within the EEOC itself while you were the Chairman of the EEOC.
I realize that most of the relevant information is contained in con-
fidential employee files, but a few general questions would be in
order at this point. You have been asked about this already, but
this I think needs to be clarified.
  There were a number of such charges brought and processed
within the EEOC while you were there, were there not?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. And these
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, let me interrupt, not on your time. I
made a ruling yesterday--you are fully within your rights and if
the Judge would like to go on it, we can continue--that the conduct
at EEOC on sexual harassment was not at issue. Now, you have
made it an issue again, which I understand. It is pretty hard
  Senator HATCH. I agree it is not an issue, but it was made an
issue.
                                      213

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I ruled it out of order yesterday, it was not
allowed to be an issue. Now, it seems to me that Senator Heflin
has a right to go back and question now on that issue.

  Senator HATCH. On this particular issue, I have no problem with
that.

  The CHAIRMAN. Fine. Yesterday I cut Senator Heflin off and I
still think it is beyond the scope of this hearing. I do not think he
should have to answer questions about his conduct at EEOC in
terms of what his policies were. If that's the case, however, then it
is going to be hard for me to fairly sit here and rule that one Sena-
tor can ask questions regarding an issue and another Senator
cannot ask countervailing questions.

  I just want to make that point.
  Senator HATCH. I appreciate it, but the real purpose of this is not
to go into the matter any deeper than Senator Heflin did, but just
to rebut what was said in his questioning, and that's the only
reason I am doing this. I don't want to go any further, I don't want
to particularly open up the whole issue, although I am sure that he
would be happy to discuss it.
  I think, frankly--let me just do this and I think you will see why
it is relevant under the circumstances. I did not object
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I think it is relevant. I just want to make
sure you understand.
  Senator HATCH. But I mean as a rebuttal to what was said.
  The CHAIRMAN. There is no rebuttal. I cut the Senator from Ala-
bama off. Go ahead.
  Senator HATCH. After a number of comments were made, I want
it clarified. Maybe I should have objected earlier, but I didn't and I
think this needs to be clarified.
  Again, I repeat, I believe most of the relevant information is con-
tained in confidential files there at the EEOC. I think the EEOC
maintains its confidentiality, unlike the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee.
  There were a number of such charges brought and processed, you
have just said, within the EEOC. You handled these matters, right?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator HATCH. And these cases would have been investigated by
the General Counsel's Office, with disposition recommended by
that office and then approved by yourself, as Chairman of the Com-
mission itself, is that correct? Is that a fair statement?
  Judge THOMAS. It would be approved by the whole Commission.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, just to the specific point, I want to give you
a chance to speak on it. Now, reference was made earlier today or
last night to the Harper case. In November of 1983, the very time
relevant to today's charges, you sent a memorandum to the Gener-
al Counsel of the EEOC, David Slate, in which you concurred in a
recommendation to terminate Mr. Harper's employment, because
of sexual harassment charges, and that you specifically noted your
view, your individual view that termination, as severe a punish-
ment as it is, was in that case "too lenient" punishment.
  Judge THOMAS. I generally remember either handwriting that on
the memo, I felt very strongly that he should have been fired, and
that was my view. I felt and continue to feel that individuals en-
                                      214

gaged in this conduct should be fired, and that's the approach I
took at the EEOC.

  Senator HATCH. Well, there are a lot of other things that I could
go into to show that you have been a champion in this area for
women. You have been a champion in many ways for a lot of us.

  I have taken way over the allotted time, but I thought it was es-
sential, because I really am starting to become, more than I have
been, outraged about the way you have been treated. I have been
outraged over the way this committee has treated you, and I think
Senator Biden and Senator Thurmond did everything they should
have done. They handled it like every prior difficult decision. The
chairman, I have great respect for him for that.

  But somebody on this committee has abused the process, and I
am not going to be happy with just an Ethics investigation. I don't
think anybody is.

  The CHAIRMAN. I am going to order one, though.
  Senator HATCH. I want you to order an FBI investigation. I want
an investigation by real appropriate, non-Senate staffers. I want
some people who are not affiliated with the Senate to look into this
matter, because I think that is the only way we even have the
slightest chance, anyway, of getting to the bottom of it, and then
we probably will not.
  But if we are fair, this is not, as I said at the beginning, the nom-
ination of a Justice of the peace to the some small county in some
small State. This involves the very integrity of and fabric of our
country.
  I also want to say that the burden of proof is certainly not on
Judge Thomas. This is America. The burden of proof is on those
who use statements that are stereotypical statements. I thought
when we were talking about stereotypes, that we were talking
about the Exorcist and some of these things that apparently some
very bright minds out there have found to help make this dramatic
in a destructive way to these good people.
  Mr. Chairman, I will come back again and try to ask the rest of
my questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Let me make one thing clear; there will be an investigation of
this matter, because I believe that not only has the Judge been
wronged, but Anita Hill has been wronged, and the process has
been wronged.
  I think it is appropriate to take a break in a moment, but I
would like to ask my colleagues to caucus with me for a minute. I
want to make it clear to the press, that there is nothing of any con-
sequence in the caucus. I want to try to figure out the schedule for
the rest of the day.
  While we recess for 15 minutes I would like my colleagues to
caucus across the hall with me for a few minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  In order to accommodate the schedules of the committee and the
nominee, we are going to adjourn--this is a committee decision--
for lunch until 1:30.
  [Whereupon, at 12:13 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 1:30 p.m., the same day.]

                                          AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Judge I will begin with a few questions. I will be asking ques-
tions off and on during the day. Both Senators Leahy and Heflin
may have questions, so we will go for roughly 40 or 45 minutes
with questions on this side, and then yield back to our friend from
Utah, and then maybe start to wind this down, hopefully.
  Senator THURMOND. I may have a few myself.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS pointed out by the ranking member, other
Senators may have questions, as well.
  Judge Thomas, yesterday and today, we heard about the obvious-
ly sharp and stark contrast between Professor Hill's testimony and
yours. You have indicated that you have no desire or willingness,
and I have agreed, to go into aspects other than those that have
been alleged in your personal life.
  We had a witness before us who is a tenured professor at a law
school and whom, prior to her coming forward, you viewed, as a
credible person. We have two very credible people, with very, very
diverse positions on an issue. I know of no way to make this proc-
ess enjoyable.
  Rather than ask you to go through her allegations, which you
have categorically denied and my colleagues, Senators Hatch and
Heflin and Leahy, have already questioned you about, I would like
to try to find out where there is agreement in the testimony, not
disagreement. Hopefully we can determine whether or not there is
any place from which we can logically begin to make the cut on
who is telling the truth. Obviously, someone is not.
  Again, I go back to the point that you have made time and again,
and admirably, that you had not second-guessed the professor's
credibility until now. It came as a shock to you.
  So, if you are willing, I would like to decide where there is agree-
ment between the testimony given by you and given by her. You
testified that Professor Hill was your attorney advisor at the Edu-
cation Department. Is that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. HOW many such attorney advisors did you have?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there was one other more senior profes-
sional on my staff, but she was not an attorney at the time--she
was going to law school, in fact--on whom I relied for some policies
as well as some management work. She would have been the only
other professional on my personal staff.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, on your personal staff, there were only two
people at the Department of Education
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. Professor Hill and this other person
who was going to law school at the time.
  Judge THOMAS. That's right. Two professionals, and there was
also a secretary.
  The CHAIRMAN. And a secretary.
  Judge THOMAS. That's right, Diane Holt.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I take it that it was not uncommon for you
to talk one on one with Professor Hill, while at the Department of
Education?
                                      216

  Judge THOMAS. That's true. That was also true with the other
person.

  The CHAIRMAN. With regard to both of these persons, I assume
conversations with either or both would take place fairly frequent-
ly. Let me not assume anything. Would they take place fairly fre-
quently? Would you see them more than once a day, for example,
in the conduct of your affairs at the Department of Education?

  Judge THOMAS. It would not be uncommon, but I would not
assign a number to it. It may be that some days I may see them
none and other days I might see them once.

  The CHAIRMAN. Up here, for example, as you know from working
with Senator Danforth's staff, the chief of staff, the head of the
committee, the person in charge of the legislative operation, those
people, generally speaking, have media access to Senators Dan-
forth, Thurmond, Biden. I mean that is kind of how it works up
here, but I don't want to confuse how it works here with how it
worked there. I assume that if Professor Hill wanted to see you,
she would have essentially the same kind of access that you ob-
serve the chief of staff would have here, on the Hill, to the office in
which you worked?

  Judge THOMAS. NO.

   The CHAIRMAN. NO?

  Judge THOMAS. That's not an accurate comparison.
  The CHAIRMAN. Then I would like to hear what yours was.
  Judge THOMAS. The Deputy Assistant Secretary would have that
kind of access.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Deputy Assistant Secretary would have that
access to you.
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN. I see. Would you describe the type of access that
Professor Hill, in her professional responsibilities at Education,
had to you?
  Judge THOMAS. I think it was my secretary who normally made
those kinds of judgments. If I were available, if I were not busy, if I
were not in the middle of something and the matter merited it, she
certainly didn't have to make an appointment.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, this other person who worked in the capac-
ity similar to Professor Hill, as you described it, what was his or
her name?
  Judge THOMAS. Her name was Tricia Healey.
  The CHAIRMAN. Healey, H-e-a-1-e-y?
  Judge THOMAS. I think so, but she perhaps had more access, be-
cause I believe--and that has been 10 years ago--we met at the be-
ginning and at the end of the day routinely. She was the person
who followed the list of assignments that I had within the organi-
zation, people who needed to be involved in certain projects, people
with whom I needed to touch base, projects that were finished and
unfinished, evaluations that needed to be done, and those kinds of
things.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, either at the Department of Education or
at EEOC, when Professor Hill would have access to you, either at
her initiative or your initiative, in the performance of your duties,
was it unusual for those conversations or exchanges to take place
alone, just with the two of you?
                                         217

  Judge THOMAS. It wasn't unusual, just as it wasn't unusual for
Tricia Healey, but normally I have basically an open door and my
secretary Diane would guard that door, basically.

  The CHAIRMAN. SO, like the conduct of any business, usually, not
all decisions or all judgments that are brought to you by staff re-
quire you to call in all the staff. Many of those decisions are made,
as they are here, one on one?

  Judge THOMAS. NO, I think that's going too far. I made those
kinds of decisions one on one, generally with the Deputy Assistant
Secretary.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Judge THOMAS. There were any number of problems that we had
within the agency, and I believe that when I made those kinds of
decisions, it would have been with him. I would have spent a signif-
icant amount of time with Tricia Healey, I think, going through
the assignments, and that would be one on one, but it would usual-
ly be more going through a list of things to get done.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, in your discussions, conversations, and
meetings with Professor Hill, you have indicated to the committee
or I have gotten the impression that you viewed yourself as her
mentor, the same role you have with all people who have been on
your personal staff. Is that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. I looked out for the members of my personal
staff. I made sure that I tried to be aware of their careers and
aware of their progress, et cetera, not just a mere employer-em-
ployee relationship. Again, that was true in the case of my other
assistant, who was I believe at that time either finishing night law
school and/or studying for the bar exam, and it was simply an
effort to make some accommodation. I thought it was a good idea
and she was doing very well.

  The CHAIRMAN. In attempting to find out where there is agree-
ment were there ever occasions that you would have an opportuni-
ty or occasion to be speaking with Professor Hill, in either capac-
ity, EEOC or as her boss at Education, where you would discuss
matters, either as her mentor, or in any other capacity, where you
would discuss matters other than business matters?

  Judge THOMAS. I think that there may be occasions when we
would debate politics, as I indicated. She was from Yale Law
School and, of course, I was interested in what had happened to the
law school. There were some people I think who had clerked on the
Supreme Court who had been in her class, and that sort of thing,
similar to what I do with my clerks. They have their own friends,
they have their ideas about the world, and occasionally they will
chat with me about those or if they have problems. I think Anita
Hill had some health problems from time to time. I can't remem-
ber exactly what they were, but I believe either back or allergies or
something like that. It would be those sorts of things.

  The CHAIRMAN. Professor Hill testified, for example, that you
sometimes discussed how your son was doing.

  Judge THOMAS. NO, I don't remember that. I brought my son to
the office quite a bit. He was a young kid then and my wife and I
were separated and he would be in the office, and

   The CHAIRMAN. I am not going anywhere in terms of your son. I
am just trying to get a sense of the flavor of the conversation.

       56-273 O--93 8
                                      218

  Judge THOMAS. I am trying to tell you, I don't remember that. I
discussed my son perhaps and the problems that I was having from
a financial standpoint, I may have mentioned it to my secretary,
but I don't remember mentioning that to Professor Hill. What I am
suggesting to you now is that my son, because he was living with
his mother, came to the office fairly frequently and was around.

  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that. Once when we were having a
full committee meeting over here, there was a knock on the door.
We had asked not to be disturbed, and in walked my 10-year-old
daughter, so I understand about children being at work.

  Senator DECONCINI. It raised the IQ of the whole meeting, didn't
it? [Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. HOW can I disagree with that? [Laughter.]
  Now, Judge, you testified that you never asked out the professor
on a date, is that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, I am sure it was pointed out to you, if you
don't know, that everything that is reported isn't true, not because
it is intentionally meant to mislead, but because sometimes there is
a miscommunication. It was reported in the New York Times, on
the October 7, on page A13, that "Judge Thomas told the investiga-
tors"--meaning the paper's investigators--"that he had asked the
woman out a few times and, after she declined, eventually dropped
all advances." I assume that is a misunderstanding?
  Would someone rapidly running back tell me, without my glass-
es, did I misread it? What's this say? I don't have my glasses. What
does that say?
  Senator THURMOND. DO you want to borrow mine?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. [Laughter.]
  Thank you. You are only twice my age, too.
  Senator THURMOND. We are young otherwise.
  The CHAIRMAN. That's exactly right.
  It says: "Senator Biden said in a statement today that the allega-
tions were investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, at
the request of the Judiciary Committee. Judge Thomas"--this did
not come from Senator Biden--"Judge Thomas told the Bureau's
investigators that he had asked the woman out a few times and,
after she declined, eventually dropped all advances." That is incor-
rect?
  Judge THOMAS. That is wrong.
  The CHAIRMAN. Wrong.
  Judge THOMAS. I had the occasion to be re-investigated by the
FBI agents prior to this hearing. In fact, I believe that it would
have been on Thursday afternoon, and the FBI agent, in my living
room, stated that it was wrong, the very same FBI agents who
interviewed me, and indicated that he was distressed that this
matter had been reported that way. At no time, did I ever indicate
that I ever asked her out. I categorically deny that I ever asked her
on a date.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is why I ask you the question, Judge, to
confirm on the record, what you said. I thought that is what you
had said, but it has been sitting out there.
  Let me return to your discussions, if any, with Professor Hill
that may have been of a non-work nature.
                                      219

  Judge THOMAS. Pardon me?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU indicated, there were some discussions you
have had with her about Yale Law School, discussions, conversa-
tions or exchanges at work that did not relate to what was going
on at work, which would be almost impossible for anyone in the
whole world to not have in a business setting. I want to make it
clear that you don't every time, and we don't, always talk to our
staff about business only. So, you have indicated that you have had
some discussions with her about Yale Law School, how it was
going, how it has changed
  Judge THOMAS. Mutual friends, frankly, Gil Hardy, it may have
been current events, those sorts of things, the things I talk with my
clerks about or the other members of my staff.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you ever inquire about or did she ever volun-
teer, to the best of your recollection, anything about her social life.
Such as, "I can't stay late tonight, I've got a date, yeah, that fellow
you mentioned at the Supreme Court from Yale, I'm dating him,"
or anything? Was there any discussion ever that you recall about
her social life?
  Judge THOMAS. Someone might--she may have said I've got to
leave tonight, because I'm going out to dinner. I can't recall a spe-
cific, nor would there be any reason for me. It would be simply a
reason for her not being at work. There may have been an indica-
tion of what she was doing. There could be no extensive discussion
about that. I don't see any reason why that would happen. I mean,
today, what my clerks would simply do is, "I'm having dinner with
a couple of friends of mine from law school."
  The only thing that I can remember, and this is very general,
was that I believe--and I could be misrecalling this--was that she
had dated someone in Oklahoma who came to New England or
something and they weren't together, or something like that.
That's really vague.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is kind of hard for anybody to remember any-
thing of a passing topic from a while ago.
  And again, we are all trying to find out what could be the moti-
vation, if, in fact, what you say is true and what she says is not
true. How has this happened?
  You indicated, today, that a friend of yours who was your Holy
Cross classmate, law school classmate, summer roommate is now
deceased.
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN. This friend had referred Anita Hill to you--and
I do not have the transcript from this morning, so please correct
me if I am wrong--so you said you believed you had a special obli-
gation as a consequence of his referral.
  Now, did that special obligation result in any additional impact
on your relationship, professional or otherwise, with Anita Hill in
a way any differently than it has with any other person that has
worked for you? Let me make it clear now, OK, for the moment I
am not talking about the allegations, I am trying to figure the rela-
tionship that you and Professor Hill had. Did you feel a special ob-
ligation to look out for her? She was a young woman, so did you
say be careful what you do because certain parts of this city are
dangerous. Or, you know, you have to be careful who you date, or
                                             220

make sure you call your mother. Or have you called, was his name,
Gil?

  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Have you called Gil, he is concerned about you,
you need to keep in touch, or anything of that nature?
  Judge THOMAS. I don't recall anything of that nature, Senator.
What I was referring to was to make sure that I looked out for her
career, that she got solid work, to make sure that everything was
OK at work, that she got her promotions, those kinds of things.
The kind of relationship that you are talking about, in your exam-
ples, those are the kinds of things I look out for with young in-
terns, who work with me during the summer, or individuals who
are in coop programs, those individuals.

  I have had some who were 19 or 20 years old who I would treat
more like my own son or daughter.

  The CHAIRMAN. SO there would be no reason for anyone, includ-
ing Professor Hill, to assume that you were asserting and/or you
were taking on a role, any other role, other than an employer who
was concerned about the work product. This is as opposed to what
all of us have when young interns, from our States, are sent down
here to work for us. We have unpaid interns in my office. A friend
will say, can my son or daughter come work for you, and the first
thing I say is they can't come down unless I know where they are
going to live. Is there a relative down here? I am not taking re-
sponsibility for a 17-year old kid to come, not just to this city, but
to any city.

  So, all of us, I am sure at one time or another have talked to
young women or men who are in college and in town to work as
interns. We have said how are you doing in school? Or tell me
what you are doing?

  Was there any reason for Anita Hill to think that there was that
kind of relationship between you and her?.

  Judge THOMAS. I can't think of a reason for her to think that. As
I indicated, Senator, or Mr. Chairman, there are any number of
younger kids that have worked for me that I would be concerned
about, individuals who are not from this city and who do not un-
derstand the city; individuals who occupy themselves after work
with other kids their age, again, without the guidance. I would be
concerned about them not knowing the rules of the city, but cer-
tainly not in her case.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, you said yesterday something that I don't
dispute--I don't know so I can't dispute it. When one of the com-
mittee members said that Professor Hill was a meek professional
woman, and she came across as a meek person, you replied well, I
would call her anything but meek.

  Can you elaborate on that a little bit more for me today?
  Judge THOMAS. Well, the point that I was making, Senator, if
you asked me to describe the Anita Hill who worked for me, meek
would not be the word. She was very bright. And she would argue
for, particularly with the other special assistants, argue for her po-
sition and, sometimes to a fault. And by that, I simply mean that
she would become entrenched in her own point of view and not un-
derstand the other point of view. And she was certainly capable of
                                         221

storming off and going to her office, and that happened on any
number of occasions.

  So, meek, would not be the word. She was also a forceful debater
on the issues that she was involved in.

  The CHAIRMAN. Was there any change between the Anita Hill
that first started to work for you at the EEOC and the Anita Hill--
I beg your pardon, at Education--who eventually worked for you at
EEOC? Just before she left, was it basically the same person, same
modus operandi, same professional relationship relative to you?

  Judge THOMAS. NO. The relationship, as I indicated in my open-
ing statement, Mr. Chairman, changed primarily because my job
changed and the staff went from those 2 professionals to maybe 10,
12, 15 professionals with a chief of staff, office directors of 14 indi-
viduals, and a chief of staff being in charge of my personal staff, as
opposed to the staff having direct access. So even the special assist-
ants could not see me on an as-available basis.

  The chief of staff could see me on that basis, but she could not.
  The CHAIRMAN. When you saw her, though, was it essentially the
same professional woman in terms of her professional attitude? Did
she seem more confident, less calm? Was there any difference in
the Anita Hill, not necessarily in terms of access, but in terms of
the professional lawyer who worked for Clarence Thomas? Was she
the same woman in terms of when you were with her?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I can't--all I can say is this, that I can't
tell you that there was a specific change. What I can say is that
she was having more of a difficulty, I thought, from my perspec-
tive, she was having more difficulty in the role at EEOC because
there were so many more staffers. And there were so many differ-
ent levels of communications.

  For example, on--or responsibilities--for example, I would rely
on individuals with more experience to work on projects that were
of great significance to me. There were routine assignments that
would be, what I could call grunt work, much more than we had at
Education. There was sort of a pecking order and I don't think that
she, in that role, at EEOC was very high on the pecking order be-
cause of experience.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you said yesterday, when you first ap-
peared, that you can't imagine what you could have said that
would have caused Anita Hill to say what she has said. But if there
was anything she misunderstood--I don't know this exact quote--
then you are sorry.

  Now, let me ask you this. On its face that seems to me to be a
completely reasonable statement for one to make. I think--I will
speak for myself--that things I might say, or jokes that I might tell
with a male, trusted aid that I have been with for 20 years, might
not be the same joke that I would be willing to tell with the female
members of my staff.

  And I suspect that, were I a woman, there are certain things
that I could say to the females on my staff that I couldn't say to
the males on my staff.

  Among the men on your staff did you ever kid about, make refer-
ence to, say you saw, or deal with any of the subjects that Anita
Hill says you dealt with, spoke to, and mentioned to her?
                                                222

  Judge THOMAS. NO. Let me go back a second. There are a couple
of comments I would like to make about that.

  The CHAIRMAN. Sure.
  Judge THOMAS. I attempted to conduct myself in a way with my
staff so that there were no jokes that I would listen to or tell to
men that I could not listen to or tell to women. There were no
jokes that I found acceptable that I could not listen to or tell to any
ethnic group.
  The other thing. When I was speaking about on something I may
have missed, I was talking about a kind of insensitivity--let me
give you an example.
  The CHAIRMAN. That's what I am trying to drive at.
  Judge THOMAS. And it doesn't mean mean-spirited and it's not in
the area we are talking about. A former member of your staff came
to work for me in 1982, Barbara Parris.
  The CHAIRMAN. One of the best people who have ever worked for
me.
  Judge THOMAS. That's right, and one of the best who has ever
worked for me and who is familiar with me.
  The CHAIRMAN. She has made me aware of just how familiar she
is.
  Judge THOMAS. That's right and she understands about why I
feel so strongly about being here. Barbara Parris, my offices were
on the fifth floor and the elevator panel, button panel, panel of but-
tons was at a level that Barbara Parris could not reach because she
is a short person. She did not tell me. And I was insensitive to it
because I could reach the panel. So someone had to inform me that
she was climbing up four or five flights of stairs because she could
not reach the panels.
  It is that kind of insensitivity, oversight, and I made it a point to
tell my staffers, if I do something, let me know what it is. If you
see something, tell me what it is so that we can correct it. If you
hear something, tell me what it is. My grandfather used to have a
statement, "I can read your letter, but I can't read your mind."
  And the point is, let me know if I am overlooking something, and
I think that the totality, the other component of my statement was
that if something happened, if I had known, I could have corrected
it. That has been my attitude.
  The CHAIRMAN. I was just referring to your comment, I think
you said, if there was anything I did or said.
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN. I was referring to the "said" part. I was not re-
ferring to telling ethnic jokes, but let's say that you and I are sit-
ting and watching a football game and you watch some 280-pound
tackle blow away a 158-pound flankerback. You and I might de-
scribe that in a way, sitting with one another and both having
played football, that we would not describe in the same way if
there were five women sitting in the room. I may be wrong, maybe
you would not.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, this may sound unusual to you, but I
would describe it the same way.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that's interesting. Maybe that is because
you were closer to the 280-pound lineman and I was closer to the
130-pound flankerback. [Laughter.]
                                                   223

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my attitude was, in my work environ-
ment, my staffs were almost invariably predominantly women. The
senior person on my staff was a woman. I could not tolerate indi-
viduals making that environment uncomfortable or hostile. I could
not tolerate individuals who had to segregate their language or
conduct in order to get along. The conduct had to be purged of of-
fensive attitudes and I made that a constant effort, and that's
something that I was proud of and it was something I am sure the
people who worked with me felt comfortable with and understood.

  The CHAIRMAN. In order to attempt to seek the truth I am ac-
cepting, for the sake of this discussion, the assertions that you
never said anything in the workplace or out of the workplace to
Ms. Hill. Let's, as we lawyers say, stipulate to that for the moment.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, you stipulated to my character earlier.
  The CHAIRMAN. I did, and I have again. All right, now let me ask
you this question. We are trying to find out why we are here. An
incredibly credible woman, who thus far has not had her character
or her integrity impugned, sat before us and, at a minimum, im-
pressed this committee on both sides. Now, we both know that em-
ployees form opinions about the person with whom they work not
based totally upon that person in the working environment.
  For example, no matter how well your boss treats you if you
knew, from observation or you heard from outside, that he did not
treat his children well, then you would not necessarily have a uni-
versally high regard for him. You treat your children well, I am
not making any innuendo. The point I am trying to make is how
can we figure out, if we can, why this very credible woman might,
as you are asserting, be telling a lie?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, she is asserting that I did something. I am
not asserting anything about her.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that. Well, she is asserting you did
something, and you are denying you did what she asserted. We
have two very credible people in front of us. Now, all I am asking
you is, if there is anything outside of the workplace that would rea-
sonably, unreasonably, or even remotely lead a person to form an
opinion of you different than they had of you in the workplace?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my relationship with my staff, although
I care about them, is in the workplace.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that, but opinions
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator, it is in the workplace. I did not
make these statements or do these things. And I cannot get into or
determine how she arrived at whatever it is that influenced her. I
am simply saying that I don't know what her motivation was.
These things did not happen. I did not allege anything, or I did not
say anything to her or I did not attempt to date her.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that. Let me give you an example
of what I am thinking of and maybe you can think of something
that relates to this. If not, we will drop the whole subject.
  I can think of specific employees with whom I have worked.
Their working relationship with me and with everyone in my office
has been exemplary. I have gone--I can think of a specific inci-
dent--to lunch with this person and several others, in this case the
person was a man. We ordered lunch and the lunch was late. We
are out of the work environment. This person berated the waitress
                                                    224

at which time I said, you don't work for me here, and you are not
going to work for me anywhere if you treat people that way. Now,
this occurred out of the work environment.

  After about 5 or 6 years working with this person, I had never
seen him this way, and yet I watched this person just read the riot
act to a waitress because she brought the wrong meal. So my opin-
ion of that person was colored by something totally unrelated to
the workplace.

  This is the last time I will ask you this and then I will drop it. Is
there anything you can think of outside the workplace that Profes-
sor Hill would have heard of, or witnessed, that might have shaded
her opinion of you?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, or Mr. Chairman, I attempt to conduct
myself with my staff, at lunch or walking down the street or what-
ever, in a way that they could be, or think, or feel was admirable. I
do not and did not co-mingle my personal life with my work life,
nor did I co-mingle their personal life with the work life.

  I can think of nothing that would lead her to this.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. I accept your statement.
  Let me ask you another question. Did you inform the FBI that
you had, on occasion, driven Professor Hill home or +1 t you had,
on occasion, gone in for a Coke or a beer after work?
  Judge THOMAS. I think I did, Senator, again these events have
unfurled very rapidly. And I don't think that was a particular
issue. Their response was, or their questioning went to specific alle-
gations.

  The CHAIRMAN. I am not suggesting if you didn't
  Judge THOMAS. I am just saying, I don't remember but I think I
did.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK, now, having asked you that, I have another
area I am confused about. I don't know whether it was Senator
Hatch, Senator Leahy, or Senator Specter, that asked these ques-
tions, but I am confused about cars.
  Senator LEAHY. About?
  The CHAIRMAN. Cars, automobiles. Now, I thought I heard you
say you did not own an automobile when you were at the Depart-
ment of Education. I thought I heard you say that you did not have
a driver assigned to you when you were at the Department of Edu-
cation. Did I miss that? What are the facts? Did you own an auto-
mobile when you were at the Department of Education, and/or did
you have a driver assigned to you or an automobile available to
you through the Government?
  Judge THOMAS. At the Department of Education I owned a car.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO you would drive to work?
  Judge THOMAS. NO. Some days--I lived in Southwest--and the
Department of Education is in Southwest, the Switzer Building,
and I would walk to work some days and other days I would drive
depending on what I needed the car for. My point was that I would
work late often, and if it was late or if for some reason she may
have needed a ride, I would give her a ride. Or if I were headed in
that direction or if I were leaving.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO you would drive her in your own automobile
is the point.
                                                   225

  Judge THOMAS. Yes, but it wasn't--I don't remember a large
number of times, but it has happened.

  The CHAIRMAN. Can you give us any sense of how often it hap-
pened that you would go in and have a coke or a beer after work?

  Judge THOMAS. Oh, it couldn't have happened any more than
maybe twice or three times. Nothing, there was no, it was nothing
major. It was just a matter of, you know, we may have been argu-
ing about something, debating something, a policy or something.

  The CHAIRMAN. What are the kinds of things you would argue
about?

  Judge THOMAS. I think we debated affirmative action, we debated
busing, those sorts of things, black colleges.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, you said she had a roommate. Did you ever
meet her roommate when you

  Judge THOMAS. Yes. To my knowledge, those were the only times
I have seen her. She was, as I remember, a basketball player, I
think she was in a basketball league. And occasionally she would
walk by in her sweats or be there in her sweats.

  The CHAIRMAN. At the apartment?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO you would be in the apartment with both
  Judge THOMAS. In an open area, yes, that's right.

   The CHAIRMAN. OK.

  I am almost finished here. I just want to make sure that I have
covered the things that I had questions about or that I misunder-
stood.

  Judge THOMAS. Let me make one point. I did not have a driver
assigned to me at Education. There was a carpool at the Depart-
ment of Education. I had a driver assigned to me as Chairman of
EEOC. After I arrived at EEOC, the car that I had, it was a Fiat
Spider, was recalled. And

  The CHAIRMAN. Was what? I am sorry?
  Judge THOMAS. Was recalled.
  The CHAIRMAN. Oh, rehauled.
  Judge THOMAS. Defective.
  The CHAIRMAN. Recalled?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Oh, because it was defective. I am sorry. Fiat
will appreciate that.
  Judge THOMAS. And I used the money to pay my son's tuition so
I didn't have a car.
  The CHAIRMAN. Gotcha. At Education?
  Judge THOMAS. At EEOC.
  The CHAIRMAN. At EEOC.
  Judge THOMAS. And I, subsequently, I believe in 1983, got a car a
year or so later.
  The CHAIRMAN. Another area where you both agree is that occa-
sionally, or at least on one or more occasions, you had lunch with
Professor Hill in the cafeteria.
  Judge THOMAS. I don't think I said that. I just
   The CHAIRMAN. NO, I think she said it. I'm not sure what you
said.
  Judge THOMAS. NO, I don't think I said that. I don't recall ever
having lunch with her in the cafeteria.
                                      226

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Judge THOMAS. I would rarely, at the Department of Education,
almost never, at EEOC, go to the cafeteria with the exception of
breakfast. That may not have been a good thing, but I rarely went
there in the early years. In the later years

  The CHAIRMAN. This was at EEOC?
  Judge THOMAS. At EEOC, in the later years I went more fre-
quently.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you ever have breakfast with her at EEOC
in the cafeteria?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, not to my knowledge. I am trying to finish
up with Education.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry.
  Judge THOMAS. At the Department of Education, my habits for
eating lunch usually consisted of--and I am giving my normal pat-
tern--my normal pattern was to work out at the NASA gym at
noon and then to run and then to grab takeout or have my secre-
tary grab takeout and eat at my desk. That was my normal pat-
tern. I rarely remember eating at the Department of Education caf-
eteria.

   The CHAIRMAN. OK.

  Judge THOMAS. That does not mean I didn't, it just wasn't
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I understand what you are saying. The one,
two, or three occasions that you drove Professor Hill home and
went into her apartment to have a Coke or continue a debate, were
they all at Education or did any of them also occur at EEOC?
  Judge THOMAS. TO my knowledge, it only occurred at Education
because it was very convenient for me. My car was parked right
outside of my office and easy just to drive over and drop her off.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Now, are there other employees, such
as this other person who had more access to you at EEOC, that you
were in a position to offer a ride home? The one going to night
school or law school or the bar exam, I apologize, but I forget the
name.
  Judge THOMAS. Her husband worked at the agency so they com-
muted together.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Judge THOMAS. SO that was not the problem. I have, over time,
with other members of my staff dropped them off some place if
they needed it, at a Metro station or if we were headed, I was
headed in the same direction.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, there has been a lot of reference to the
telephone logs. We went through them in detail with Professor
Hill, but we did not spend much time discussing them with you.

  And do you have the original telephone logs, by any chance?
  Judge THOMAS. I have the originals in my chambers, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have the originals, because EEOC doesn't
have them nor does Ms. Holt?
  Judge THOMAS. I have the originals in my chambers. I was ad-
vised, I believe, and I could be wrong that those were my property
when I left the EEOC.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am not suggesting they are not. I just wonder
where they are, that's all.
                                                  227

  Well, Judge, that's all. I have used up enough time. Now, I may
have a few more questions later, as I digest this, but thank you
very much.

  I yield to the ranking member, who indicates that he has a ques-
tion.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, in my opening statement I
appointed Senator Hatch and Senator Specter to question the wit-
nesses. However, I reserved the right, if I saw fit now and then, to
ask a question. I do care to ask a question at this time.

  Judge, we have your testimony and we have Ms. Hill's testimony.
Some of the press have asked me outside and some people, too,
what was the motivation? This question was raised by Senator
Heflin earlier and Senator Biden touched on it--the motivation for
these charges.

  In other words, why did she make these charges? In talking with
several people, some of them the press, and other people, various
reasons have been assigned. I just want to ask you if you care to
comment on any of them.

  One is she failed to get a promotion under you. Another is be-
cause you didn't date her she felt rejected. Another is she said in
her own statement to the FBI about differences in political philoso-
phy. Another is stated by the dean of the law school, Charles A.
Kothe, under whom she taught at the Oral Roberts University Law
School, he made this short paragraph and it covers that. He said,

  I have come to know Clarence Thomas quite intimately over the last 7 years and
have observed him and his relationship with members of his staff as well as his con-
duct at social gatherings, and never once was there any hint of unacceptable con-
duct with respect to women. In fact, I have never heard him make a coarse remark
or engage in any off-color conversation.

  And he makes this statement, "I find the references to the al-
leged sexual harassment not only unbelievable, but preposterous. I
am convinced that such is the product of fantasy." And I have had
several other people mention that as a possible reason. Then, as a
fifth reason that has been mentioned by someone is instability.

  Now, those things have come to me from other people, and I just
want to ask you if you care to comment on any of those?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't know what the motivation is
and, as I indicated, any of those may or may not be correct. I can't
speculate. But I think that the appropriate individuals to ask that
are the staffers who were involved in leaking this information and
who made contacts with her.

  Senator THURMOND. That is all, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. I understand that you still have
time. Whom do you wish to yield it to?
  Senator HATCH. I am happy to defer the balance of my time to
Senator Specter.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter has the remainder of this half
hour.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, at the start of my participation in today's hear-
ings I repeat what I said yesterday. I do not view this as an adver-
sary proceeding, and I do not represent anyone in this proceeding
except the people of Pennsylvania who elected me. I took on the job
of questioning at the request of Senator Thurmond, the ranking
                                             228

Republican, but that is not intended by me to mean that I am
taking sides.

  The questioning yesterday of Professor Hill was obviously diffi-
cult from many, many points of view. And I attempted with her, as
I attempted with you during the earlier part of these proceedings
to be scrupulously polite and professional and nonargumentative.

  The purpose of my questioning her and the purpose of the round
that I am about to undertake with you is to deal with the issue of
credibility. We have a situation here where many have character-
ized it as two very believable witnesses. And I had searched for a
long while to see if there was a way to reconcile the testimony
here, so that it would be possible to believe both of the critical wit-
nesses and that has not been possible to do.

  The next step, as I have seen it, is to try to make an analysis on
credibility from what we have. It would be fine to go out and con-
duct a very extensive investigation but we have been given the
charge here from last Tuesday to come to a conclusion so that the
Senate can vote on this matter by this coming Tuesday. We are
trying to do that. In the questions that I am about to ask you,
which relate to Professor Hill's testimony yesterday, it is not with
any intention of impugning Professor Hill at all, but in an effort to
see what indicators there are as to credibility here.

  The problem is a hard one because none of us wants to discour-
age women from coming forward with charges of sexual harass-
ment. And I have been working for the past year and a half to get
the civil rights bill which would improve the issue for women on
sexual harassment. The fellow who is sitting behind you is Senator
Danforth. It is obviously true that this hearing has raised the con-
sciousness of America on this issue of sexual harassment, but the
generalizations have to be put aside.

  We have to make a determination as to whether you did or did
not engage in the kind of conduct which is being charged. And with
that brief introduction what I would like to cover with you in this
round relates to questions on credibility, on four specific subjects.

  First, the USA article; second, her move from Education to
EEOC; third, her testimony on not documenting the alleged com-
ments; and four, the inferences on credibility arising from the tele-
phone logs.

  The issue of the article in USA Today, I think is a very compel-
ling one because I believe--and I am going to ask you about this--
that Professor Hill testified in the morning and demolished her tes-
timony in the afternoon. What I want to examine with you for the
next few minutes is an extremely serious question as to whether
Professor Hill's testimony in the morning was or was not perjury.

  I do not make that statement lightly. But we are searching here
for what happened. And nobody was present with a man and a
woman when this tragedy arose. The quality of her testimony and
the inferences are very significant on the underlying question as to
credibility.

  I am going to read you extensive extracts from the testimony
which I re-read this morning and I think it ought to be noted that
we proceed here on a very short timetable. Senator Thurmond
asked me to undertake this job on Wednesday. I started on it with
                                      229

Thursday. We are in hearings on Friday and are reading overnight
text this morning.

  And the start of it was my question to Professor Hill about the
USA article on October 9, "Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers
her signed affidavit alleging sexual harassment by Clarence
Thomas would be the instrument that would quietly, and behind
the scenes, would force him to withdraw his name."

  Now, I am about to go through the transcript where I asked Pro-
fessor Hill about this repeatedly. At one point she consulted her at-
torney and throughout an extensive series of questions yesterday
morning flatly denied that any Senate staffer had told her that her
coming forward would lead to your withdrawal. In the afternoon
she flatly changed that by identifying a Senate staffer who she fi-
nally said told her that she was told that if she came forward you
would withdraw or might withdraw your nomination.

  The transcript, which is prepared overnight, does not reveal the
part where she consulted with her attorney, but I asked my staff-
ers to review the tape, because I recollected that and they did find
the spot, which I shall refer to, but I want to make that plain that
it is not in the written transcript.

  I start, Judge Thomas, at page 79 of the record, where I ques-
tioned Professor Hill, that USA Today reported on October 9.

  Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers her signed affidavit alleging sexual harass-
ment by Clarence Thomas would be the instrument that, quietly and behind the
scenes, would force him to withdraw his name.

  I am not reading all of it, because I cannot in the time we have
here, but if anybody disagrees with anything I read, they are at lib-
erty to add whatever they choose.

  On page 80:

  Question: Did anybody ever tell you that, by providing the statement that there
would be a move to request Judge Thomas to withdraw his nomination? Ms. Hill: I
don't recall any story about using this to press anyone.

  Later, on page 80:

  Ms. Hill: I don't recall anything being said about him being pressed to resign.

  Page 81:

  Senator Specter: Well, aside from 'quietly and behind the scenes pressing him to
withdraw,' any suggestion that just the charges themselves in writing would result
in Judge Thomas withdrawing and going away? Ms. Hill: I don't recall that at all,
no.

  Skipping ahead to page 82--this is in the middle of one of my
questions:

   You have testified with some specificity about what happened 10 years ago. I
would ask you to press your recollection as to what happened within the last month.
Ms. Hill: And I have done that, Senator, and I don't recall that comment. I do recall
there might have been some suggestion that if the FBI did the investigation, that
the Senate might get involved, that there may be that a number of things might
occur, but I really, I have to be honest with you, I cannot verify the statement that
you are asking me to verify. There is not really more that I can tell you on that.

  Then skipping ahead to page 84:

   Senator Specter: Would you not consider a matter of real importance, if someone
said to you, professor, you won't have to go public, your name won't have to be dis-
closed, you won't have to do anything, just sign the affidavit, and this, as USA
Today reports, would be the instrument that, quietly and behind the scenes, would
force him to withdraw his name. Now, I am asking you whether it happened. I am
                                                  230

asking you now only, if it did happen, whether that would be the kind of a state-
ment to you which wculd be important and impressed upon you that you could re-
member in the course of four or five weeks.

  Now, it is at this time that she consulted with her attorney, ac-
cording to my recollection and according to my staffs, looking at
the tape. And then she says: "I don't recall a specific statement
and I cannot say whether that comment would have stuck in my
mind, I really cannot say this."

  In the afternoon session, I asked Professor Hill
  Senator SIMON. What page are you referring to?
  Senator SPECTER. Page 203--to begin, if you could, and proceed
from there to account who called you and what those conversations
consisted of as it led to your coming forward to the committee.
  Then, on a long answer inserted at the end, which was not re-
sponsive, because I wasn't asking about the USA Today article any
more, she says--and this appears at the bottom of 203.

  It even included something to the effect that the information might be presented
to the candidate and to the White House. There was some indication that the candi-
date--excuse me--the nominee might not wish to continue the process.

  Then, on the following page, 204, continuing in the middle of the
page: "Senator Specter: So, Mr. Brudney did tell you that Judge
Thomas might not wish to continue to go forward with his nomina-
tion, if you came forward? Ms. Hill: Yes."

  Now, Judge Thomas, what do you make of that change of testi-
mony?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that the individuals such as Jim
Brudney, Senator Metzenbaum's staffer on the Education and
Labor Committee, should be brought to hearings like this to con-
front the people in this country for this kind of effort, and I think
that they should at some point have to confront my family.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I would like to just make a statement.
Yesterday, I called for the Ethics Committee to investigate the
matter of the leak and anything else they consider appropriate.
Jim Brudney was performing his responsibilities as a member of
my staff.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I might make this statement,
that today I have called for an FBI investigation. I think that is
the one that will count, and the Republicans on this side of the
aisle, all I have talked with have agreed to sign it, all down the
line, I believe, and

  Senator SPECTER. Wait a minute. I am not getting into any collat-
eral issues at this time. I have not discussed signing anything. I do
not want to have any attention diverted from this issue, which is
the nomination of Judge Thomas, and the point we are on now is
where the credibility is. When Senators want to interrupt, that is
part of the process around here, but I am not going to discuss that
issue at this time.

  Judge Thomas, I went through that in some detail, because it is
my legal judgment, having had some experience in perjury prosecu-
tions, that the testimony of Professor Hill in the morning was flat-
out perjury, and that she specifically changed it in the afternoon,
when confronted with the possibility of being contradicted, and if
you recant during the course of a proceeding, it is not perjury, so I
state that very carefully as to what she had said in the morning.
                                      231

  But in the context of those continual denials and consulting the
attorney and repeatedly asking the question, with negative re-
sponses, that, simply stated, was false and perjurious, in my legal
opinion. The change in the afternoon was a concession flatly to
that effect.

  In searching for credibility, let me add that I am not represent-
ing that it is conclusive or determinative, but it certainly is very
probative and very weighty.

  Let me now move to another issue of credibility, which is an
issue very central to this proceeding. That is the factors relating to
Professor Hill's moving from the Department of Education to
EEOC, and whether she would have moved with you, had you said
the outrageous things which have been attributed to you.

  In her statement, on page 4, she states, among other reasons, "I
also faced the realistic fact that I had no alternative job." She then
quotes you in her testimony--I want to be precise, so I will cite the
reference, page 172, at the top of the page:

  Ms. Hill: I was relying on what I was told by Clarence Thomas. I did not make
any further inquiry. Senator Specter: And what are you saying that Judge Thomas
told you? Ms. Hill: His indication from him was that he could not assure me of a
position at Education. Senator Specter: Was that when you were hired or when he
was leaving? Ms. Hill: When he was leaving.

  Question, Judge Thomas: Did you tell her that you could not
assure her of a position at Education, when you made the move to
EEOC?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I do not recall that conversation, and as
I reflect back, there would be no reason for me to tell her that.
Anita Hill was a graduate of Yale Law School, was performing
well, and was a career employee. She was a schedule A. She was
not a political employee, so she could remain in the department in
other capacities. There were a significant number of attorneys,
both in the Department of Education, generally, and in the Office
of Civil Rights, specifically.

  In addition, my successor was a close personal friend of mine,
Harry Singleton, also a Yale Law School graduate, and if she
wanted to stay at the Department of Education, it would have been
a simple matter of bringing it to the attention of Harry.

  In addition to that, Gil Hardy was not only a personal friend of
mine, he was as personal friend of Harry's. We were all at Yale
Law School at the same time. So, there would have been no reason
for me to have said that she could not remain at the Department of
Education.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, Professor Hill later said or at
one point said, as it appears on page 160 of the record, "I was a
schedule A attorney." Now, based on your knowledge of her as an
attorney herself, is it credible that she would not know, as a sched-
ule A attorney, that she could stay on at the Department of Educa-
tion?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, it would seem more likely to me that
someone of her intellect and her capabilities would know what her
classification was and would certainly find out, when there is a
question of whether or not you are going to have a job during a
transitional period. Those are not complicated matters and they
                                                  232

are not hard to find out. Indeed, the other assistant who was on my
staff would have been knowledgeable in the area of personnel.

  Senator SPECTER. I want to now move to the issue of the record-
keeping relating to my questioning of Professor Hill on keeping a
record on the comments which she has said you made.

  At page 114 of the record, I asked her--let me back up for just a
minute to set the ground work for what I had asked her, and I read
her this, as well. In her statement, at page 5, she said, "I began to
be concerned that Clarence Thomas might take it out on me by
downgrading me or not giving me important assignments. I also
thought he might find an excuse for dismissing me."

  Now, in the context of that statement, I asked Professor Hill this
question, which appears at page 114 of the record:

  In a controversy, if Judge Thomas took some action against you and you had to
defend yourself on the ground that he was being malicious in retaliation for turning
him down, wouldn't those notes be very influential, if not determinative, in enabling
you to establish your legal position? Ms. Hill: I think they would be very influential,
yes. Senator Specter: So, given your experience, if all this happened, since all this
happened, why not make the notes? Ms. Hill: Well, it might have been a good choice
to make the notes. I did not do it, though.

  Now, my question to you is, knowing Professor Hill as you do
and based on your evaluation of her as an attorney, is it credible,
with these kind of things having been said and her being concerned
contemporaneously about possible dismissal, that she would not
make notes of these kinds of comments?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, it is not credible that any career em-
ployee would be concerned that one individual could effectuate a
dismissal. It would be a much better case, if this were a schedule C
employee who can be dismissed summarily. Nor can you summari-
ly downgrade an employee. The employees in the Federal system
have an array of rights and opportunities for hearings, so that
could not occur.

  I think you are also right that it is reasonable for any employee
who is faced with the possibility or fear of downgrading or dismis-
sal to document any adverse conduct that has resulted in that that
is in some way not appropriate conduct. That happens in many in-
stances in which you have employees against whom actions have
been taken.

  Senator SPECTER. When I pursued the question about making the
notes, Professor Hill responded in a collateral way, which I think is
relevant. I want to ask you about, on the issue of credibility, and
this appears at page 115 of the record:

  Ms. Hill: One of the things that I did do at that time was to document my work. I
went through very meticulously with every assignment that I was given. This really
was in response to the concerns that I had about being fired. I went through, I
logged in every work assignment that I received, the date that it was received, the
action that was requested, the action that I took on it, the date that it went out, and
so I did do that in order to protect myself, but I did not write down any of the com-
ments or conversations.

  My question to you is this, Judge Thomas: Where she says she is
concerned about being fired and she says that she is taking precau-
tions and writes down the details of work assignments, if she is
looking for retaliation from you, is it credible that, having state-
ments been made, that she would not make a written notation of
                                                   233

those statements in the context where she writes down notes on all
of these other matters?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, it does not sound credible to me, but I
think there is further point. Oftentimes, when individuals are con-
cerned about their ratings, they will document their work product,
the quality of their work product or copies of their work product
and the speed with which they turn around the work product, so
that they can then argue during the rating period that they should
receive a higher rating. That is not unusual, particularly if there
have been some complaints that the work was not being done in a
timely fashion.

  I was not aware of that and don't know that that was the case in
her situation, but it is not unusual for individuals who are con-
cerned about their ratings to document their work. I think it would
be unusual for someone who is thinking that they were going to be
dismissed to be documenting the work that they received.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I raise these issues and I ask you to am-
plify as to your view, knowing Professor Hill as you did, about the
documentation which she testified to and the absence of documen-
tation on these comments on the question of credibility.

  Judge Thomas, a final subject matter on this round is a matter
of the telephone logs, and I began this subject matter on the ques-
tion as to how many times Professor Hill called you. The evidence
already adduced demonstrated that there were 11 calls recorded, 10
at EEOC and 1 at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. My
first question to you on this subject is: Were there other calls
which got through, where you talked to Professor Hill on calls ini-
tiated by her, which, because they got through, would not have
been recorded in the logs?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there could well have been. If I were
available when the calls were received, they would have gotten
through and would not have been logged in. The purpose of our
telephone log was only to log messages, so that I could return calls.
So, there could have been any number of instances in which I
spoke directly to her, without having returned her call.

   Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, the Washington Post reported
on this issue that, "Ms. Hill called the telephone logs garbage, and
said that she had not telephoned Thomas, except to return his
calls." I questioned her about that at pages 173 and 174 of the
record.

  Then, to abbreviate this, when confronted with the logs, I asked
her, and this appears at page 175 of the record, "Then you now
concede that you had called Judge Thomas 11 times?" Answer, fol-
lowing some other material, "I will concede that those phone calls
were made, yes."

   My question to you, Judge Thomas, is what impact do you think
that has on her credibility?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is another of many inconsist-
encies that have occurred in her testimony.

   Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, I was a little disappointed,
maybe more than a little disappointed, that you did not watch the
proceedings yesterday, in terms of seeing precisely what Professor
Hill had to say, both from the point of view of wanting to know
                                                  234

what it was and from the point of view of being in a better position
to defend yourself. Why didn't you watch those hearings?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the last 1V% weeks have been a living
hell and there is only so much a human being can take, and as far
as I was concerned, the statements that she sent to this committee
and her statements to the FBI were lies and they were untrue, and
I didn't see any reason to suffer through more lies about me. This
is not an easy experience.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, I can understand that it is not
an easy experience for you. It hasn't been an easy experience for
anybody. But in the context where she comes forward and she is
testifying, and the fact is she said much more in her statement
here than she had in either her written statement to the commit-
tee on September 23rd or what she said to the FBI, and there was a
good bit of exchange above and beyond what she said, and it just
struck me a little peculiarly that you had not wanted to see what
she had said, realizing the difficulty, but also focusing on the ques-
tion of being able to respond. It is a little hard to ask you ques-
tions, if you haven't seen her testimony. It requires going through
a lot of the record. I just was concerned that you had taken that
course, in light of the seriousness, the importance, and the gravity
of the matter.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I wish there was more for me to give,
but I have given all I can.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, your time has expired, but we will come
back.

  Senator SPECTER. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Judge
Thomas.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Before I yield to my colleagues to question, I
must point out that reasonable people can differ and we certainly
do on this committee. I would just like to make sure, I say to my
friend from Pennsylvania, that the remainder of the record on
page 204, 205, and 206 appear in the record with regard to Mr.
Brudney. Senator Specter says:

  Mr. Brudney said to you that the nominee Judge Thomas might not wish to con-
tinue the process, if you came forward with a statement on the factors which you
have testified about. Ms. Hill: Well, I am not sure of exactly what he said. I think
what he said, depending on the investigation of the Senate, whether the Senate
went into closed session and so forth, it might be that he might not wish to continue
the process. Senator Specter: So, Mr. Brudney did tell you that Judge Thomas might
not wish to continue to go forward with his nomination, if you came forward? Ms.
Hill: Yes. Senator Specter: Isn't that somewhat different from your testimony this
morning? Ms. Hill: My testimony this morning involved my response to this USA
newspaper report, and the newspaper report suggested that, by making the allega-
tions, that would be enough, that the candidate would quietly and somehow would
withdraw from the process, so, no, I do not believe that it is at variance. We talked
about the matter of different options, but it was never suggested, just by telling inci-
dents that might, that would cause the nominee to withdraw. Senator Specter: Well,
what more could you do to make allegations as to what you said occurred? Ms. Hill:
I could not do any mo^e, but this body could. Senator Specter: Well, but I am now
looking at you're distinguishing what you just testified to, from what you testified
this morning. This morning, I had asked you about just one sentence from USA
Today.

  I emphasize that--Just one sentence from USA Today, "Anita
Hill was told by Senate staffers that her signed affidavit alleging
sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas would be the instrument
                                                   235

that quietly and behind the scenes would force him to withdraw his
name."

  Skipping:

  Ms. Hill: I guess, Senator, the difference in what you are saying and what I am
saying is that that quote seems to indicate that there would be no intermediate
stages in the process. What we were talking about was the process, what would
happen along the way, what were the possibilities, would there be a full hearing,
would there be questioning from the FBI, would there be questioning by some indi-
vidual members of the Senate. We are not talking about or even speculating that
simply alleging this would cause someone to withdraw.

  At the bottom of page 206: "Ms. Hill"
  Senator SPECTER. Why don't you continue reading, Senator
Biden, if you are
  The CHAIRMAN. I will read the whole thing, then:

  Senator SPECTER. Well, if your answer now turns on process, all I can say is that
it would have been much shorter, had you said at the outset that Mr. Brudney told
you that if you came forward, Judge Thomas might withdraw. That is the essence of
what occurred. Ms. HILL: NO, it is not. I think we differ on interpretation of what I
said. Senator SPECTER: Well, what am I missing here? Senator KENNEDY: Mr. Chair-
man, can we let the witness speak her own words, rather than having words put in
her mouth? Senator SPECTER: Mr. Chairman, I object to that. I object to that vocifer-
ously. I am asking questions here. If Senator Kennedy has anything to say, let him
participate in this hearing. The CHAIRMAN: NOW, let everybody calm down. Profes-
sor Hill, give your interpretation of what was asked by Senator Specter, and then
we can ask you further questions. Ms. HILL: My interpretation Senator THUR-
MOND: Speak into the microphone, so that we can hear you. Ms. HILL: I understood
Senator Specter's question to be what kinds of conversations did I have regarding
this information. I was attempting, in talking to the staff, to understand how the
information would be used, what I would have to do, what might be the outcome of
such use. We talked about a number of possibilities, but there was never any indica-
tion that, by simply making these allegations, the nominee would withdraw from
the process. No one ever said that, and I did not say that anyone ever said that.

  Let me make sure I read that correctly:

  No one ever said that, and I did not say that anyone ever said that. We talked
about the form that the statement would come in. We talked about the process that
might be undertaken post-statement. We talked about the possibilities of outcomes,
and included in that possibility of outcomes was the committee could decide to
review the point and that the nominee, the vote could continue as it did. Senator
SPECTER: SO that, at some point in the process, Judge Thomas might withdraw? Ms.
HILL: Again, I would have to respectfully say that is not what I said, that was one of
the possibilities, but it would not come from my simply making an allegation.

  Do you want me to keep reading?
  Senator SPECTER. Yes, please.

   The CHAIRMAN.
  Senator SPECTER: Professor Hill, is that what you meant, when you said earlier, at
best I could write it down, that you could control it so that it would not get to this
point? Ms. HILL: Pardon me? Senator SPECTER: IS that what you meant, when you
responded earlier to Senator Biden that the situation would be controlled so that it
would not get to this point in the hearing? Ms. HILL: Of a public hearing? In enter-
ing into these conversations with the staff members, what I was trying to do was
control this information, yes, so that it would not get to this point. Senator SPECTER:
Thank you very much. The CHAIRMAN: Thank you, Senator.

  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman?
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Massachusetts.
  Senator KENNEDY. If I could be recognized, just in one other part
of the record that was just referenced with regard to the telephone
calls, on page 175, it will just take a moment, because there was
                                      236

reference about inconsistency and the use of "garbage," as Ms. Hill
used it:

  Senator SPECTER: Did you call the telephone log issue garbage? Ms. HILL: I believe
the issue is garbage, when you look at what seems to be implied from the telephone
log, then, yes, that is garbage. Senator SPECTER: Have you seen the records of the
telephone logs? Ms. HILL: Yes, I have. Senator SPECTER: DO you deny the accuracy?
Ms. HILL: NO, I don't. Senator SPECTER: Then you now concede you have called
Judge Thomas 11 times? Ms. HILL: I do not deny the accuracy of the logs. I cannot
deny they are accurate. I will concede that those phone calls were made, yes. Sena-
tor SPECTER: SO, they are not garbage? Ms. HILL: Well, Senator, what I said was the
issue is garbage. Those telephone calls do not indicate that they are being used to
indicate that somehow I was pursuing something more than a cordial relationship
or a professional relationship. Each of those calls were made in a professional con-
text. Some of those calls revolved around one incident. Several of those calls, in fact,
three involved one incident where I was trying to act in behalf of another group. So,
the issue that is being created by the telephone calls, yes, indeed, is garbage.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Ohio.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, there seems to be some
issue made as to the conduct of Mr. Brudney, who is the director of
my Labor Subcommittee. Mr. Brudney is as honorable and able
and dedicated as any person on my staff.
  Mr. Brudney was performing his responsibilities in that connec-
tion by inquiring into the background of the nominee to be an As-
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court. That came about by reason of
the fact that Mr. Brudney and his staff had considerable knowledge
concerning Judge Thomas when he was up for confirmation by
reason of his activities at the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission. There is no secret about the fact, on the basis of those con-
clusions, this Senator decided not to vote for Judge Thomas' confir-
mation to the Circuit Court of Appeals.
  But Mr. Brudney was inquiring into what facts were concerning
the thoughts of your former employees. He and his staff were doing
it. The first call was actually made in September--earlier than
September 9. When Mr. Brudney was informed that there were cer-
tain allegations concerning the possibility of sexual harassment, he
did exactly what any other staffer should have done.
  He performed his responsibilities and performed them well. He
reported them to me and I told him to immediately turn them over
to the Judiciary Committee staff. That is what he did. The fact that
Ms. Hill and he had a conversation as to what might develop by
reason of her speaking out has already been spoken to in the tran-
script.
  Now, Judge Hill, I have a lot of respect for you--Judge Thomas,
excuse me, I apologize--Judge Thomas, I have to say to you that
these are important allegations. These are allegations concerning
the issue of sexual harassment, and I can only say this to you: Mr.
Brudney would have been irresponsible had he not brought the
matter to my attention, and I would have been irresponsible if I
did not direct him to bring it to the attention of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, in order that the Judiciary Committee might investigate
the matter. Mr. Brudney did not arrived at any conclusion, I did
not arrive at any conclusion, and the subject of this hearing has
not, as yet, arrived at any conclusion, and I doubt very much that
it will arrive at any specific conclusion.
                                                    237

  But I want to make it clear that Mr. Brudney was doing what he
should have done, and had he done less he would have been irre-
sponsible. And had this Senator and this committee done less, it
would have been irresponsible. Sexual harassment is too important
an issue to sweep under the rug.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, it was not swept under the rug. This
issue was investigated by the FBI and then leaked to the press, and
I do not share your view that this was not concocted. This has
caused me great pain and my family great pain, and God is my
judge, not you, Senator Metzenbaum.

  Senator BROWN. Mr. Chairman, the Senator from Ohio has
brought up the subject of his staffer and I understand his interest
in defending him

   The CHAIRMAN. If I may

   Senator BROWN [continuing]. Why can't this committee hear
from Mr. Brudney?

  The CHAIRMAN. If you will just yield for just a second.
  We are going a half hour and a half hour. The subject of Mr.
Metzenbaum's staff was not brought up by Mr. Metzenbaum. It was
brought up, appropriately, by Senator Specter. It was appropriate
for Senator Specter to bring it up.
   Now, on the half-hour time we have on this side, it was appropri-
ate for the Senator to respond. When we go back, it will be appro-
priate for you to pursue it, if you would like.
   It is true, Judge Thomas, that God is your judge and all our
judges, we all know that. But in the meantime, under the rules, we
have to make a vote, and we have to judge. We are not God and
none of us thinks we are, and none of us like this. Some of us have
been in a situation similar to yours, not many of us, but some of us,
and it is not very comfortable, but, unfortunately, there is a ques-
tion of judgment.
   Now, before I yield the remainder of our time, which is probably
only about 20 minutes. How much time is left? Fifteen minutes.
Before I yield the remainder of the time to either Senator Heflin or
Senator Leahy.
   Senator HEFLIN. I believe it is Senator Leahy.
   The CHAIRMAN. Before I yield to Senator Leahy, let me ask a
question, if I may, and that is: Did you, when the nominee first
moved into her apartment, help her and her roommate install a
stereo and a turntable, her roomate is the basketball player whose
name I don't remember? Did you
  Judge THOMAS. Sonia Jarvis is her name.
   The CHAIRMAN [continuing], Ms. Jarvis, her roommate. There is
nothing wrong with this, but did you help her install a stereo and a
turntable that took about a half hour or an hour or so? Did that
occur? I'm just trying to find out where we agree.
   Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't recall that at all.
   The CHAIRMAN. I thank you.
   Now, I yield the remainder of the time to my friend from Ver-
mont.
   Senator LEAHY. Judge, you said that you remember seeing her
housemate there. I understand you don t remember the name of
her housemate?
  Judge THOMAS. Sonia Jarvis.
                                               238

  Senator LEAHY. That was Sonia Jarvis?
  Judge THOMAS. She is on my phone logs, also.
  Senator LEAHY. And if Anita Hill were to say that you came to
her house once to install stereo equipment and a turntable, and
that was the only time you were in her home, would that be accu-
rate?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, it would have been--I don't remember help-
ing her install a stereo or turntable. I do remember several times
just dropping in after I had driven her home, just to chat, but that
was it. It was no significant--it was nothing of great moment. But I
do not recall helping her install a--I don't know when she moved
into her apartment.
  Senator LEAHY. Of the times that you brought her home or to
her apartment, how many times was Sonia Jarvis there, if you
recall?
  Judge THOMAS. I think each time. She would have wandered in
or came by or something like that. I just simply remember her
being in sweats, from a basketball game or something. That's the
only time I can remember seeing her, I think.
  Senator LEAHY. But you think that she was there each time?
  Judge THOMAS. That S right.
  Senator LEAHY. And if
  Judge THOMAS. That's my recollection.
  Senator LEAHY. I understand. And if Anita Hill said that--other
than that stereo and turntable, which you say you do not recall--if
she said other than that time, that Judge Thomas never drove her
home and never came in to visit and talk politics or any other
thing, that would not be accurate?
  Judge THOMAS. Not to my recollection, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. And if Sonia Jarvis said that she saw you there
only once and it was to help install stereo equipment and that is
the only time that she ever saw you in the house, that would be
inaccurate?
  Judge THOMAS. That would not be my recollection, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. It would be contrary to what you just testified to.
That is, your recollection was that she was there each time you
were there?
  Judge THOMAS. My recollection was, as I stated this morning,
again, we are talking 10 years ago, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. I understand.
  But I am talking about what you stated just 1 minute or 2
ago
  Judge THOMAS. That she would have been there, yes, that would
have been my recollection.
  Senator LEAHY. Judge, I want to yield to Senator Heflin, but I
have tried throughout all of this to ask very short questions and to
stay away from the speech making. But bear with me just for a
moment.
  A robbery takes place, an armed robbery say, and two people are
standing there, two witnesses see it. And one says, "that robber
was tall." The other one says, "No, that robber was short." Well,
the fact is, the robbery took place. Everybody, including the victim,
agrees the robbery took place, but you have two people, honest
people, standing there and one says, "By God, it was a tall robber,"
                                      239

and the other one says, "No, it was a short robber," but the rob-
bery takes place. We can understand that. And we can understand
the difference of view in how two people might observe an event.

  But here, it is like two ships in the night. I mean you seem to be
diametrically opposed, certainly, in your testimony and Anita
Hill's. I think we would both agree that, on the basic substance of
what we are talking about here, you are diametrically opposed, is
that correct?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I just simply said that I deny her allega-
tions categorically.

  Senator LEAHY. I understand. If her allegations were correct, if
what she has stated under oath was so, that would be sexual har-
assment, would it not?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it would be.
  Senator LEAHY. But, at the same time, you categorically deny
that those events ever took place?
  Judge THOMAS. I categorically deny, Senator, in the strongest
terms.
  Senator LEAHY. It would be sexual harassment if they happened,
but you say they did not happen?
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator LEAHY. Then we have one of two possibilities, obviously.
One of you is not telling the truth. Or is there any possibility that
both of you are seeing the same thing, both of you seeing the same
robbery but seeing it entirel> differently? Which is it? Is it that one
of you absolutely is not telling the truth or one of you--or both of
you, rather, are viewing the same events differently?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I am not going to get into analyzing
that. I will just simply say that these allegations are false. They
were false when the FBI informed me of them, when they were
subsequently changed to additional allegations they were false.
And they continue to be false.
  Senator LEAHY. And there is nothing in her testimony of these
allegations, in your mind, where the two of you could be seeing the
same thing?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my relationship with Anita Hill was cor-
dial and professional, just as it was with the rest of my special as-
sistants. And I maintain that that is all there was. My other spe-
cial assistants are available for you to talk to them to determine
exactly how I treated them.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge, Senator Hatch brought up the issue of
the tenth circuit case pertaining to Long Dong Silver, and in your
responsibility as head of the EEOC, do you keep up with cases in-
volving discrimination and sexual harassment that the circuit
court of appeals may decide?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, the way that that is normally done is
that if there is a significant case, I did not read specific cases, but if
there were a significant case the general counsel would summarize
that, would analyze it, and if necessary, would simply provide us
with a copy of it.
  I would not normally read circuit court opinions unless it was
breaking new ground.
                                               240

  Senator HEFLIN. In the field of employment discrimination, how
many circuit court of appeals opinions have been written, per year,
over the last several years?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't know.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, let me ask you, did you read this case of
the tenth circuit that involved this Long Dong Silver?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, this is the first I have heard of it, and I
have not read it.
  Senator HEFLIN. I have been told that there is a pornographic
movie in regards to "Long Dong Silver". Have you ever heard of
that name?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, this issue of pubic hair in the Coke--did
you read the book, the Exorcist?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. Quite a few people have read it, from what I un-
derstand. I haven't read it, but
  Judge THOMAS. I don't know. I can't testify. I think the publisher
would have to tell you that, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right, have you seen the deposition of
Angela Wright that has been taken in this case?
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, then I will wait on that. It has some refer-
ence to your relationship with Juan Williams. I suppose Angela
Wright is going to testify and the proper time would be to ask
then.
  You, in your opening remarks made a statement about the lack
of corroborating witnesses. I had some discussion with two other
people and we were talking about how unusual this case was and
how it has attracted attention nationally because of its unusual-
ness. And one of them remarked it is not unusual that this occurs,
and the type of situation we are in today occurs in almost every
date rape case--that there are no witnesses.
  Usually in regard to the prosecution and the defense of those
cases, a somewhat wider latitude is allowed relative to background
pertaining to it.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, excuse me, Senator, I have to
object to this line of questioning. I don't know of anybody who has
accused him of date rape. Is that what you are driving at?
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, it is a common term as I understand it.
Date rape is where people go out on dates and rape occurs.
  Senator HATCH. What does that have to do with this?
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, the analogy between the two is that in the
trial of such cases, a broader leeway is given relative to investiga-
tions of people that have a past history of such tendencies. And the
only thing I am asking you, Judge, is whether or not you refuse to
answer any questions other than what may have occurred in em-
ployment. Do you continue to do that?
  Judge THOMAS. Oh, absolutely, Senator. I will not be further hu-
miliated by this process. I think I have suffered enough, my family
has suffered enough. I think that I have attempted to address all of
the questions with respect to my relationship with Ms. Hill in the
work force and I think enough is enough.
                                         241

  Senator HEFLIN. I had an old trial lawyer tell me one time,
Judge, that if you've got the facts on your side, argue the facts to
the jury. If you've got the law on your side, argue the law to the
judge. If you've got neither, confuse the issue with other parties.

   Senator HATCH. YOU mean like date rape?
   Senator HEFLIN. That's a statement. I don't simply ask questions.
You have been asked questions that really have been asked for the
purpose of making speeches. After a long period of time they would
ask you a question.

  And they would ask you questions about whether that is credi-
ble, which, in effect, is asking a participant if such occurred. Let
me just ask you these other things. This might have some bearing
and it might not.

   But I think it should be asked. What was the date of your di-
vorce?

   Judge THOMAS. I think it is irrelevant here, Senator. I was sepa-
rated during--I will only answer during the relevant time period.
All of that material is in my FBI file and was available to the com-
mittee before. I will only discuss the allegations in this case. My
family, Senator, has been humiliated enough. I have been humiliat-
ed enough. I was separated from my former wife, once in January
of 1981; we reconciled during the summer; and then we separated
again in August of 1981.

   Senator HEFLIN. All right, I will respect you. Whatever you want
to state and however you want to answer it.

   There was a question that I believe was asked of Ms. Hill or she
brought it out, or I have seen it in files, affidavits, or somewhere,
that Professor Hill said you made a statement to her, "You know,
if you had any witnesses, you would have a good case against me."

   Did any such thing like that ever happen?
   Judge THOMAS. That's nonsense, Senator. I never made any
statement like that. I never made the statements that she has al-
leged.
   Senator HEFLIN. Well, we get back to the issue of who is telling
the truth, and what the motives are. Has any thought come to your
mind as to what her motive might be?
   Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I said before, I think you should ask
the people who helped concoct this and the people who leaked it to
the press what the motives were.
   Senator HEFLIN. That is when we talk about other issues of both
parties.
   Judge THOMAS. I understand.
   Senator HEFLIN. We are still left with a quandary as to where we
are. And as I stated in the first hearing, what is the real Clarence
Thomas like? I think an issue now is what is the real Anita Hill
like? And we have to make the decisions relative to those issues.
   Senator LEAHY. I wonder if I just might--if the Senator would
yield on that--I wonder if I might follow on the last, when Senator
Heflin spoke to the question of motivation, Judge, and asked what
could be her motivation? And you said, we ought to ask the people
who concocted this. I think I am accurately re-stating what you
said, is that correct? I don't want to put words in your mouth.
   Judge THOMAS. Yes.
                                               242

  Senator LEAHY. I am not sure that that's an answer that many
might accept. Let's think about this just for a moment. You have
Anita Hill, a woman who has gone to Yale Law School, certainly
one of the finest law schools in this country and I am sure, as a
graduate, you accept that.

  She is obviously quite bright, and you have certainly stated in
the past a high regard for her. You have hired her in two positions
of significant trust and responsibility. She went through the bar
exam, and all of that, not an easy task for anyone.

  She held those two positions of high trust and responsibility,
both at the Department of Education and at the EEOC, and she
then went to a university where she is a law professor and has
done well enough to become tenured. Holding that, not only the
law degree, but a license to practice law, something she has worked
extremely hard for for years, protected and nurtured all this way
through, as well as her experience. Why would she come here and
perjure herself, throw away all of that? For what? What would she
possibly get out of throwing all of that away?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't know. I know the Anita Hill that
worked for me and the relationship that I have had with her from
time to time on the intermittent calls or the few visits over the
years. I don't know what has happened since 1983. All I know is
that the allegations are false and that I don't have a clue as to why
she would do this.

  Senator LEAHY. DO you know Angela Wright?
  Judge THOMAS. Angela Wright?
  Senator LEAHY. Yes.
  Judge THOMAS. Yes. She was a schedule C employee at EEOC.
  Senator LEAHY. Would she have any reason to attack you or
  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. And what would that be?
  Judge THOMAS. I terminated her very aggressively a number of
years ago. And very summarily.
  Senator LEAHY. Not with extreme prejudice, as the term is some-
times used?
  Judge THOMAS. It was summarily.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you. I just realized, I have been handed a
note that says my time is up.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. First of all, Judge, would you like to break for a
moment?
  Judge THOMAS. Yes, my back is giving me some problems.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry I have been out of the room for a few
moments. The Senator from Ohio is asking unanimous consent to
speak for two minutes. Is there an objection to that?
  Senator THURMOND. I have no objection.
  Senator HATCH. I have no objection.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, I thank you and I thank
my colleagues on the other side. There has been continued discus-
sion and suggestions with respect to the matter of how this matter
was leaked to the press. One Senator actually made a public state-
ment that was carried in the New York Times indicating that this
Senator or my staff had been responsible for the leak.
                                             243

  I went to the floor of the Senate and demanded an apology from
that Senator and said I had not leaked it, neither had my staff. I
am pleased to say that he acknowledged that and indicated a cor-
rection. But I want to make it clear today to you, Judge Thomas,
and to any of the rest of the world that neither this Senator nor
any of my staff have been the source of any leaks to the press on
this subject.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, 15, 10, 20? How much time do you want.
You are the guy under the gun, how much time do you want?
  Judge THOMAS. Ten is fine.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will recess for 10 minutes.
   Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, if I could just ask the Judge, I
was not aware that the Senator from Ohio was going to make the
comment, but I, too, want to indicate here, before this committee
and in this forum that neither I nor my staff were involved in any
of these leaks. I regret that we all have to get into a situation
where we have to deny these matters, but I want to give that as-
surance in this forum, in this committee to the Judge.
   Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak on behalf of
all of the Republicans, none of us did it, I will guarantee you that.
  Judge THOMAS. Somebody did it, Senator.
   Senator LEAHY. Well, obviously nobody did it.
  The CHAIRMAN. The chair will recess for 10 minutes.
   [Recess.]
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I would like to correct something. I was
just informed by someone who is more informed than I was about
my staff at Education. Again, this has been quite some time. I had
two attorney advisors and I think two or three Schedule C appoint-
ees who also reported to me.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry, I could not hear the last part, Judge.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I indicated that I only had two profes-
sional staffers.
  The CHAIRMAN. Correct.
  Judge THOMAS. It appears that I had two attorney advisors, one
other than in addition to Anita Hill, as well as a second profession-
al, and then, in addition to those, two political appointees, two or
three political appointees on my personal staff, so that is six.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I am not sure it is relevant, but can
you
   Judge THOMAS. Well, the
   The CHAIRMAN. NO, no, I appreciate you correcting it. Do you
recall the names of the two attorney advisors?
   Judge THOMAS. Well, Anita Hill and Kathleen Flake, I think was
the second
   The CHAIRMAN. Kathleen?
  Judge THOMAS. Flake.

   The CHAIRMAN. F-l-a

  Judge THOMAS [continuing], k-e, I think.
   The CHAIRMAN. YOU also had two or three political appointees.
  Judge THOMAS. Whom I can't remember. That's easy enough to
check.
   The CHAIRMAN. OK, and then you mentioned one other person,
the woman who was in law school at the time?
                                             244

  Judge THOMAS. Right. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN. She was not an attorney advisor, but she was
one who was in frequent contact.
  Judge THOMAS. Exactly.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Thank you for correcting the record.
  I think we are pretty well ready to wind up here, Judge, but it is
now the opportunity of Senator Hatch to question, and he says he
would like to have 30 minutes and he is entitled to that.
  Senator HATCH. I hope I don't have to take the whole 30 minutes,
Judge, but I do want to cover just one or two other points before
we are through here today.
  Judge Thomas, yesterday, Senator Heflin repeatedly asked you
to ascribe some motivation to Professor Hill's allegations, and I
think, from the way I look at this record, there are some profound
differences in political philosophy between you and her.
  I am about to read an excerpt of one of her statements that I
think is worth putting in the record:

  Hill said that her initial impression of Thomas was very favorable and she re-
spected him for his accomplishments and concern for others. She said that she also
came from a poor family, so she related closely to his circumstances. She said that
when she started working for Thomas, he supported quotas for minorities in em-
ployment and Federal sanctions against employers who did not comply with the
quotas, and then went on.

  That is the relevant part.

  Later, Hill said that she has also seen Thomas change his political philosophy
since 1981 to the present, from supporting quotas for minorities in employment with
sanctions for non-compliance to no quotas. She is concerned that these may be
changed for personal political expediency and may not represent his true philoso-
phy. If that is the case, he may no longer be open-minded, which is essential for an
Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, what are you reading from?
  Senator HATCH. I am reading from her statements made to the
FBI agents.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, you are reading from the FBI report?
  Senator HATCH. That's right.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, we agreed that we would not violate the
committee rules and read from the FBI report. You and I agreed
with the remainder of the committee in the room across the hall 2
hours ago. It is incredible to me that you would walk in here and
read from an FBI report, when we all know it is against the com-
mittee rules to read from FBI reports.
  Senator HATCH. NOW we are concerned with FBI reports. I didn't
agree to that. If you will recall, I stepped out to use the men's
room. [Laughter.]
  Which I do with regularity at my age, I have to say. But to make
a long story short, how does that hurt anything?
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, let me tell you how it hurts. It is
beyond the issue related to here. I may be mistaken, but I thought
you were one who said in the other room that having dealt with
these reports as much as any of us have, that they are full of noth-
ing but hearsay on most occasions. The reason why I have worked
so hard to keep FBI reports totally secret is because they have
little or no probative weight, because they are hearsay. The FBI
does their interviews by walking up to person A and saying will
                                             245

you speak to us, and the guarantee is anonymity. That is what the
FBI tells the person, and the FBI speaks to the person.

  Now, for us to summarily go back and say, as a matter of policy,
that we are going to break the commitment the Federal Govern-
ment makes to an individual, in order to get that individual to co-
operate in an investigation, is disastrous.

  Senator HATCH. That is exactly my point, Senator. You just made
the best argument in the world against why this is the most unfair
process for Judge Thomas we have ever had. But if you listened in
that meeting, I said yes, in the future, let's abide by that rule,
there is a very good reason for it, but we have to be able to use it
here, because there has to be some evidence of motivation, and I
told you at the beginning of this hearing I was going to use it, be-
cause there are inconsistencies with Professor Hill's testimony and
statements.

  Now, let's be fair. I mean these are not hearsay statements.
These are statements made by her. Let me back it up further with
a statement she made to the press, because it says the same thing,
basically.

  The CHAIRMAN. Precisely. Why don't you ask from that? Ask him
the FBI report, without

  Senator HATCH. Senator, listen, I refuse to accept a process
where someone on this committee releases her statement and ma-
terials from the FBI report for all the world to see and the newspa-
pers to print and the media to show, that are tremendously damag-
ing to the Judge, because they have been brought up in open forum
that had to occur, because somebody in a sleazy way broke the
rules.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator
  Senator HATCH. NOW, wait, let me just finish.
  The CHAIRMAN. I'm going to let you finish and then I'm going to
cut you off real quick.
  Senator HATCH. Well, if you think you're going to cut me off, I
think you're wrong. I'm going to listen to you and I'm going to pay
attention to you, Mr. Chairman, but let me just finish. This is all
I'm going to say about it and I won't read any more from that par-
ticular report, but I am going to read from the newspaper.
  Let me tell you something, this never had to occur, if whoever
did this was honest. They could have brought this up before the
vote, we could have decided this matter, we could have determined
to have an executive session here, and you know that and you
would have done it. I don't find any fault with you and I don't find
fault with you feeling this way now, but I felt this way from the
beginning and I know you did.
  But those are fair comments. These matters have been leaked. I
don't know that people out there don't have every aspect of the
report, and I think some of them probably do and others, and to
prevent me from bringing this up, when it is an important point at
the last minute of this I think would be a travesty, under the cir-
cumstances. I have never, never leaked an FBI report.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU just did, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Oh, no, I didn't. Oh, no, I didn't. I used an FBI
report under very fair circumstances, and they couldn't be more
fair. Like I say, this is no longer, this is not some insignificant ap-
                                               246

pointment. This is one of the most important appointments in our
country.

  The CHAIRMAN. Are you finished, Senator?
  Senator HATCH. This is not the Soviet Union. This is the United
States of America. And let me tell you, let me tell you something--
well, I didn't mean it quite that way--[Laughter.]
  Let me go on. I won't
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator
  Senator HATCH. GO ahead, I will listen to you, but if I can, I
would like to go ahead.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO one has worked harder or has been more dili-
gent in the 19 years I have been in the Senate about keeping confi-
dential anything that was sent to me as confidential. No one on
this committee has been more damaged by the leak by an unethi-
cal person than me. I fully understand.
  Senator HATCH. I agree.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW to turn around and decide that because
somebody was unethical about releasing not an FBI report, not an
affidavit, but a memorandum from a woman who asked that it be
confidential is justification for discussing, from that point on, any-
thing that appears in an FBI report, including the FBI report mat-
ters that had to do with Mr. Thomas or any of the witnesses who
were spoken to, is totally inappropriate. I sincerely hope we won't
go through this again.
  Senator DeConcini.
  Senator HATCH. I did not have my time.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Arizona.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, let me say a word, because I
agree with what you just said.
  Senator HATCH. I do, too.
  Senator DECONCINI. I also agree that this is most unfair, and I
think the Senator from Utah has pointed that out, I think a
number of us have pointed that out, even members who have al-
ready taken a position in opposition to Judge Thomas, that this
thing is unfair because of the unauthorized leak.
  But I do not believe that old saying "two wrongs make a right",
and to do it again I think is improper, and the only thing that I
differ with you, Mr. Chairman, in your statement is that no one
has been hurt more than you, an unauthorized leak, because
that
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, no, I mean on this matter in this committee.
  Senator DECONCINI. NO, I understand. I just take exception to
that personally, and I can
  The CHAIRMAN. Whether or not
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. It is irrelevant, whether I was hurt the most. Let
me just make this point. If we began to read from FBI reports, the
ability of the FBI to conduct further investigations with witnesses
will come to a screeching halt.
  Senator DECONCINI. I agree.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman, let me just
  Senator SIMPSON. May I?
  Senator HATCH. Surely.
                                               247

  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, may I just say
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, please.
  Senator SIMPSON [continuing]. I think we have done that already.
To say that we haven't done that here, I think more than several
of us, particularly with Ms. Hill, have referred continually--the
record is full of references--to her FBI report; as comparing it with
her second version with more explicit sexual material, and to her
third version with ever more vivid sexual material. We have used
that several times by various members of this committee.
  Senator HATCH. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. If the Senator from Wyoming would yield to
  Senator SIMPSON. I am ready to do what you suggest. I would
concur with what you are doing and I support that, but it is a diffi-
cult thing. We have injected this entire record with quotes from
FBI reports, not the report, but a paragraph, a sentence. I have
heard it now for three
  Senator HATCH. Everybody has. Everybody has. Now, if I
could
  The CHAIRMAN. I yield now to the Senator from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, how would it do to just elimi-
nate the words "FBI" from the report and let him go ahead?
[Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. Let me say this: Mr. Chairman, I said at the be-
ginning, when I raised my voice at the beginning of these hearings,
that now that the FBI report has been leaked, it is not fair for the
media to have it and not the general public.
  On the other hand, I agree with your statement, it should never
have been leaked
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, do you have evidence that the press has
the FBI report? You keep saying that. Do you have evidence that
the press or anybody has the report? Is there any place it has been
printed, is there any place it has been quoted from?
  Senator HATCH. Senator, why don't you let me finish my state-
ment? I will--you just let me do that--I respect you as chairman, I
have stood up for you as chairman, I have said this hasn't been
your fault, it hasn't been your doing, and I believe it, and I believe
what you are saying is true now, and I hope in the future nobody
will leak any of these reports or use them in any untoward
manner.
  Senator THURMOND. Just check the newspaper, it is in there, the
same thing. Go ahead with that.
  Senator HATCH. Let me just say what I intended to say. That is
what I intend to do from here on in.
  I will tell you, to sit here and say that something that is rele-
vant, when I told you I was going to do what I wanted to do at the
beginning, because of the unfairness of it, because I want the Judge
to have a square shake, and I made it clear, I didn't mince any
words, I said that's going to happen and nobody really disagreed
with me at that time
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator
  Senator HATCH, [continuing]. And I apologize, if you think I had
agreed in that room, but I made it clear to you that, in this con-
text, with the unfairness that has gone on, that I thought that it
could be used. Now, I won't use it from here on out.
                                                  248

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, aren't we wasting time?
  The CHAIRMAN. We are now, Mr. Chairman. Let's move ahead.
  Senator THURMOND. Let's move ahead.
  Senator HATCH. Well, you people think you are wasting time, but
I don't. I think he has been getting
  Senator THURMOND. Use the newspaper, it's the same thing.
  Senator HATCH. I will use what I will.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, use the newspaper and you will be
  Senator KENNEDY. Can you get them to stop fighting over there?
[Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Will the Senator proceed, and proceed under the
rules, please.
  Senator HATCH. I always follow Senator Kennedy's advice.
  So, I will use the newspaper: "Anita Hill, a former special assist-
ant to"--I think this is in the Washington Post, dated Monday,
September 9, 1991, just shortly after she was contacted--

  Anita Hill, a former special assistant to Thomas at the Education Department
and the EEOC, was particularly disturbed by Thomas' repeated public criticism of
his sister and her children for living on welfare. It takes a lot of attachment to pub-
licize a person's experience in that way and a certain kind of self-centeredness not
to recognize some of the programs that benefited you, said Hill, now an Oklahoma
law professor. I think he doesn't understand people, he doesn't relate to people who
don't make it on their own.

  Then it says in this article, "If liberals consider him a traitor,
conservatives within the administration suspect that he was a
closet liberal, Thomas said in a 1987 speech."

  Now, the reason I brought that up, Judge, is because, basically,
what Hill said in that article and what I have brought up was that
she thought you had changed your political philosophy and that
had been for quotas and now you are against them.

  Now, my question is, just the day before the committee hearings
began she was one of your opponents, and that was before any of
the charges were aired. Now, is political philosophy part of this
problem?

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I have indicated about other motives,
I have no reason to believe that it is not a basis for what has hap-
pened to me. It is obvious--there is another comment, though, that
I would like to make, and that is that there is no record, to my
knowledge, and I have no recollection of ever making a statement
about my sister in any speeches. That was in one news article on
December 16, 1981.

  The references with respect to changing my position on quotas,
my position on quotas has been pretty much the same, from a
policy standpoint, since the mid-1970's.

  Senator HATCH. And what is that--well, I can let that go. Judge
Thomas, I take it that she disagrees with you on your stand on
quotas?

  Judge THOMAS. She disagreed with me when she was on my per-
sonal staff on that issue, Senator.

  Senator HATCH. Was that a matter of some contention between
you?

  Judge THOMAS. I think in the instances she would get a bit irate
on that particular issue, as I remember it.

  Senator HATCH. Because she took the opposite position?
                                      249
  Judge THOMAS. That's right.
  Senator HATCH. She was for quotas?
  Judge THOMAS. I think she was adamant about that position.
  Senator HATCH. OK. Well, I think that
  Judge THOMAS. That is my recollection, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I think that needed to be brought up.
  Judge, when the President asked you at Kennebunkport whether
you and your family could take what would follow in the process,
did you have any idea what you were going to have to "take"?
Could you have guessed that some people, including people on this
committee, people in the media and others would dredge up stories
about drug use, wife-beating, advocating Louis Farahkan's anti-
semitism, lying about your neutrality in Roe v. Wade, sexual har-
assment, maybe even implications of other things? Did you think
you would have to face scurrilous accusations like those, which you
have refuted?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I expected it to be bad and I expected
awful treatment throughout the process, I expected to be a sitting
duck for the interest groups, I expected them to attempt to kill me,
and, yes, I even expected personally attempts on my life. That is
just how much I expected.
  I did not expect this circus. I did not expect this charge against
my name. I expected people to do anything, but not this. And if by
going through this, another nominee in the future or another
American won't have to go through it, then sobeit, but I did not
expect this treatment and I did not expect to lose my name, my
reputation, my integrity to do public service. Again, I did not ask
to be nominated, I did not lobby for it, I did not beg for it, I did not
aspire to it.
  I was perfectly happy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.
Circuit, which is a lifetime appointment. I did not expect to lose my
life in the process.
  Senator HATCH. A Washington Post article just today said that
you said--and I recall you saying--you told of reporters sneaking
into my garage, interest group lobbyists swarming over divorce
papers looking for dirt. I remember you said this is not the Ameri-
can dream, this is Kafka-esque, it has got to stop, enough is
enough.
  The Post article goes on to say some activists were unmoved by
Thomas' emotional plea, dismissing it as a last-ditch effort to sal-
vage his nomination. "The major groups don't have anything to
apologize for," said one of the civil rights activists. He went on to
say, "The battle has been fought on policy and philosophy," al-
though he acknowledged "it has taken a distressing turn."
  The article goes on to say,

   That turn illustrates the increasingly symbiotic relationship between committee
staffers, liberal interest groups and the news media. It is a phenomena that acceler-
ated with the Reagan administration's attempts to insure conservative domination
of the judiciary in the 1980's. Many thought it reached its ultimate expression in
the battle over the nomination of Robert H. Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987. But
within days after President Bush announced Thomas' nomination, liberal activist
groups began the search for ammunition they hoped could defeat him. An informal
coalition that included Cropp.

  I suppose he is with people for the American Way.

       56-273 O--93 9
                                             250

  Kate Michelman of the National Abortion Rights Action League, Nan Aaron of
the Alliance for Justice, and others began holding almost daily strategy sessions, at
first restricting their probes to exposing what they viewed as his track record as a
rigid Reagan administration ideologue. Cropp said that his organization, which had
played a pivotal role in the Bork fight.

  I might add that they put ads in the paper and I accused them of
99, as I recall, errors in the ad, and they never answered the accu-
sations, they could not, really.

  Cropp said that his organization, which had played a pivotal role in the Bork
fight, assigned four full-time staffers, several interns and four other field organizers
to anti-Thomas activities. The group also filed Freedom of Information requests for
copies and videotapes of all his public speeches and videotapes while he headed the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office of Civil Rights in the
Department of Education.

  Naturally, they can do that if they want to, but these are only a
few groups that are mentioned, and there are literally hundreds, if
not thousands of groups in this area, and the groups, many feel,
have taken over the process.

  And in the process the ideology becomes more important than
truth, it becomes more important than integrity, it becomes more
important than ethics, it becomes more important than preserving
people's reputations, it becomes more important than simple, basic
decency to human beings.

  I think it was said best, again I cite Juan Williams' statement,
he said:

  This desperate search for ammunition to shoot down Thomas has turned the 102
days since President Bush nominated him for a seat on the Supreme Court into a
liberal's nightmare.

  Now, this is a journalist who is not particularly conservative, but
nevertheless a great journalist.

  "Here is indiscriminate"--didn't quite mean it the way that
some have taken it, he is a great journalist and I mean that. I
don't know how people take that implication but I mean that.

  Senator THURMOND. Tell them the name.
  Senator HATCH. Juan Williams. "Here is indiscriminate"--he is
describing, he is describing this desperate search for ammunition.

  Here is indiscriminate mean-spirited mud slinging supported by the so-called
champions of fairness. Liberal politicians, unions, civil rights groups, and women's
organizations, they have been mindlessly led into mob action against one man by
the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. Moderate and liberal Senators operating
in the proud tradition of men, such as Hubert Humphrey and Robert Kennedy, have
allowed themselves to become sponsors of smear tactics that have historically been
associated with the gutter politics of a Lee Atwater or crazed right-wing self-promot-
ers like Senator Joseph McCarthy. During the hearings on his nomination, Thomas
was subjected to a glaring double-standard.

  Now, for those of you who laugh, why is it that Juan Williams is
one of the few who has pointed out this glaring double-standard.
Laugh at that, laugh at that. That's what I am talking about here.
I am not talking about liberal and conservative politics. I am talk-
ing about decency. I am talking about our country, America.

  Thomas was subjected to a glaring double-standard. I have never
seen it worse, never. When he did not answer questions that
former nominees David Souter and Anthony Kennedy did not
answer he was pilloried for his evasiveness. One opponent testified
that her basis for opposing him was his lack of judicial experience.
                                      251

She did not know that Supreme Court Justices, such as liberal
icons Earl Warren, and Felix Frankfurter, as well as current Chief
Justice William Rehnquist had no judicial experience before taking
a seat on the high court.

  There is a lot more that could be said. But he says a very inter-
esting paragraph and I think it does sum it up, he said:

  This slimy exercise orchestrated in the form of leaks of an affidavit to the Leader-
ship Conference on Civil Rights is an abuse of the Senate confirmation process, an
abuse of Senate rules, and an unforgivable abuse of a human being named Clarence
Thomas.

  Laugh at that. Everybody here knows what I am talking about,
everybody here. People have tried to make this, have tried to make
sexual harassment the only issue here. Now, sexual harassment is
ugly, it is unforgivable. It is wrong. It is extremely destructive, es-
pecially to women, but to men, too. Sexual harassment should not
be allowed.

  I would like you to describe now, for this gathering, what it is
like to be accused of sexual harassment. Tell us what it feels like.
And let me add the word, unjustly accused of sexual harassment.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, as I have said throughout these hear-
ings, the last 2V2 weeks have been a living hell. I think I have died
a thousand deaths. What it means is living on one hour a night's
sleep. It means losing 15 pounds in 2 weeks. It means being unable
to eat, unable to drink, unable to think about anything but this
and wondering why and how? It means wanting to give up. It
means losing the belief in our system, and in this system, and in
this process. Losing a belief in a sense of fairness and honesty and
decency. That is what it has meant to me.

  When I appeared before this committee for my real confirmation
hearing, it was hard. I would have preferred it to be better. I would
have preferred for more members to vote for me. But I had a faith
that, at least this system was working in some fashion, though im-
perfectly.

  I don t think this is right. I think it's wrong. I think it's wrong
for the country. I think it's hurt me and I think it's hurt the coun-
try. I have never been accused of sex harassment. And anybody
who knows me knows I am adamantly opposed to that, adamant,
and yet, I sit here accused. I will never be able to get my name
back, I know it.

  The day I get to receive a phone call on Saturday night, last Sat-
urday night, about 7:30 and told that this was going to be in the
press, I died. The person you knew, whether you voted for me or
against me, died.

  In my view, that is an injustice.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, Judge
  Judge THOMAS. AS I indicated earlier, it is an injustice to me, but
it is a bigger injustice to this country. I don't think any American,
whether that person is homeless, whether that person earns a min-
imum wage or is unemployed, whether that person runs a corpora-
tion or small business, black, white, male, female should have to go
through this for any reason.
  The person who appeared here for the real confirmation hearings
believed that it was okay to be nominated to the Supreme Court
and have a tough confirmation hearing. This person, if asked by
                                               252

George Bush today, would he want to be nominated would refuse
flatly, and would advise any friend of his to refuse, it is just not
worth it.

  Senator HATCH. Judge, you are here though. Some people have
been spreading the rumor that perhaps you are going to withdraw.
What is Clarence Thomas going to do? What is Clarence Thomas
going to do?

  Judge THOMAS. I would rather die than withdraw. If they are
going to kill me, they are going to kill me.

  Senator HATCH. SO, you would still like to serve on the Supreme
Court?

  Judge THOMAS. I would rather die than withdraw from the proc-
ess. Not for the purpose of serving on the Supreme Court but for
the purpose of not being driven out of this process. I will not be
scared. I don't like bullies. I have never run from bullies. I never
cry uncle and I am not going to cry uncle today whether I want to
be on the Supreme Court or not.

  Senator HATCH. Well, Judge, I hope next Tuesday you make it
and I believe you will, and I believe you should. And I believe it is
important for every American that you do.

  Because I think in your short 43 years of life that you have just
about seen it all and if anybody's in a position to help their fellow
men and women under the Constitution, then I have to say you
are. And I am proud of you. I am proud of you for not backing
down.

  That's all I have, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Now, we are down to Senators having 5 minutes and I will begin
to yield back and forth. Judge, let me make sure I understand one
thing. Do you believe that interest groups went out and got Profes-
sor Hill to make up a story or do you believe Professor Hill had a
story, untrue from your perspective that groups went out and
found. Which do you believe?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I believe that someone, some interest
group, I don't care who it is, in combination came up with this
story and used this process to destroy me.
  The CHAIRMAN. A group got Professor Hill to say or make up a
story?
  Judge THOMAS. I believe that in combination this story was de-
veloped or concocted to destroy me.
  The CHAIRMAN. With Professor Hill? I mean it is a critical ques-
tion. Are you saying a group concocted a story with Professor Hill
and then went out
  Judge THOMAS. That's just my view, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know, I am trying to make sure I understand
it.
  Judge THOMAS. There are no details to it or anything else. The
story developed. I do not believe--the story is not true. The allega-
tions are false and my view is that others put it together and devel-
oped this.
  The CHAIRMAN. And put it in Professor Hill's mouth?
  Judge THOMAS. I don't know. I don't know how it got there. All I
know is the story is here and I think it was concocted.
                                               253

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, I know you believe that and I am
not going to be able to or attempt to, at this moment, refute that.
There has been an assertion that has just been made and I want to
know whether you would agree with it. It is important for us to
keep our eye on the ball here. There are two versions of this story.
Either Professor Hill had a story that she told someone and it was
taken advantage of by being leaked, or a group sat down, decided
to make up a story and found a willing vessel willing to speak out
in Professor Hill.

  Professor Hill suggests the first version. I want to know what
you believe.

  Now, they are fundamentally different things in terms of culpa-
bility.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, those distinctions are irrelevant to me.
The story is false. And the story is here and the story was devel-
oped to harm me.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Judge THOMAS. And it did harm me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me go down the line here. Senator Kennedy?
  Senator KENNEDY. NO, Judge, we just thank you for coming
under extraordinary difficult circumstances.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Thurmond?
  Senator THURMOND. I believe he is coming back to answer any
other charges and I will wait until then.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum?
  Senator METZENBAUM. I have no comment.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, it has been a powerful presentation by a
powerful person. And I have known you for several years and I
have known Ginny before I knew you. I think it is very well that
you were not here to hear the testimony of Ms. Hill. That was a
good step, whosever idea that was that you did not, of course, you
were not here, but you didn't watch it. It would have driven
you
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you.
  Senator SIMPSON [continuing]. In a way I do not think would
have been appropriate. And here we are. You have been before us
for 105 days. We have seen everything, known everything, heard
every bit of dirt, as you call it so well. And what do we know about
Professor Hill? Not very much. I am waiting for 105 days of sur-
veillance of Ms. Hill and then we will see, you know, who ate the
cabbage, as we say out in the Wild West. This is an impossible
thing.
  And now, I really am getting stuff over the transom about Pro-
fessor Hill. I have got letters hanging out of my pockets. I have got
faxes. I have got statements from her former law professors, state-
ments from people that know her, statements from Tulsa, OK,
saying, watch out for this woman. But nobody has the guts to say
that because it gets all tangled up in this sexual harassment crap.
  I believe sexual harassment is a terrible thing. I had a bill in a
year ago, doubling the penalties on sexual harassment. I don't need
any test. I don't need anybody to give me the saliva test on wheth-
er one believes more or less about sexual harassment. It is repug-
                                               254

nant, it is disgusting in any form. And the stuff we listened to, I
mean, you know, come on--from the moon.

  And it is a sexual stereotype. Just like asking you sexual stereo-
type questions about your personal life, any woman would be of-
fended by that--about your divorce, you did this, you did that. Talk
about in reverse. There is not a woman alive who would take the
questions you have had to take, would be just repelled by it. That's
where the watershed is here.

  It is a good thing that this awareness goes up. It is a terrible,
tragic, thing that it should bruise you. And if we really are going to
do it right, we are all mumbling about how do you find the truth? I
will tell you how you find the truth, you get into an adversarial
courtroom and everybody raises their hand once more and you go
at it with the rules of evidence and you really punch around in it.
And we can't do that. It is impossible for us to do that in this place.

  The Chairman knows it and he has been exceedingly fair. And so
here we are and we will not get to the truth in this process. But
there is truth out there and that is in the judicial system. Thank
God that there is such a system. It has saved many, many a disillu-
sioned person who was, you know, headed for the Stygian pits.

  So, if we had 104 days to go into Ms. Hill and find out about her
character, her background, her proclivities, and all the rest I would
feel a lot better about this system. And I am talking about the stuff
I am getting from women in America who are sending me things
and especially women in Oklahoma. That will all become public. I
said, at the time it would be destructive of her and some said, well,
isn't that terrible of Simpson, a menacing threat. It was not menac-
ing. It is true.

  That she would come forward and she would be destroyed. She
will, just as you have been destroyed. I hope you can both be reha-
bilitated. I have a couple of questions, if I may, Mr. Chairman.

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

  Senator SIMPSON. I have not taken time and I will get to that.
Angela Wright will soon be with us, we think, but now we are told
that Angela Wright has what we used to call in the legal trade,
cold feet. Now, if Angela Wright doesn't show up to tell her tale of
your horrors, what are we to determine about Angela Wright?

  Did you fire her and if you did, what for?
  Judge THOMAS. I indicated, Senator, I summarily dismissed her,
and this is my recollection. She was hired to reinvigorate the
public affairs operation at EEOC. I felt her performance was inef-
fective, and the office was ineffective. And the straw that broke the
camel's back was a report to me from one of the members of my
staff that she referred to another male member of my staff as a
faggot.
  Senator SIMPSON. AS a faggot?
  Judge THOMAS. And that is inappropriate conduct, and that is a
slur, and I was not going to have it.
  Senator SIMPSON. And so you just summarily discharged her?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator SIMPSON. That was enough for you?
  Judge THOMAS. That was more than enough for me. That is my
recollection.
  Senator SIMPSON. That is kind of the way you are, isn't it?
                                                  255

  Judge THOMAS. That is the way I am with conduct like that,
whether it is sex harassment or slurs or anything else. I don't play
games.

  Senator SIMPSON. And so that was the end of Ms. Wright, who is
now going to come and tell us perhaps about more parts of the
anatomy. I am sure of that. And a totally discredited and, we had
just as well get to the nub of things here, a totally discredited wit-
ness who does have cold feet.

  Well, Mr. Chairman, you know all of us have been through this
stuff in life, but never to this degree. I have done my old stuff
about my past, and shared those old saws.

  But I will tell you, I do love Shakespeare, and Shakespeare
would love this. This is all Shakespeare. This is about love and
hate, and cheating and distrust, and kindness and disgust, and ava-
rice and jealousy and envy, all those things that make that re-
markable bard read today.

  But boy, I will tell you, one came to my head, and I just went
and got it out of the back of the book. Othello, read Othello, and
don't ever forget this line: "Good name in man and woman, dear
my Lord"--do you remember this scene?

   * * * is the immediate jewel of their souls. Who steals my purse, steals trash. Tis
something, nothing. Twas mine, tis his, and has been slave to thousands. But he
that filches from me my good name, robs me of that which not enriches him, and
makes me poor indeed.

  What a tragedy. What a disgusting tragedy.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator DeConcini?
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, I have some questions, and it
may take more than 5 minutes. I hope I could just follow them up
and get this over with, rather than waiting around.
  Judge I have great empathy with what you have been through. I
happen to have a little experience, going through an awful process.
I think this is atrocious. I went through an atrocious process that I
thought I would never get over, but I did. Just like you, I had a
strong family, I believed in myself, and I did not do the things I
was accused of, so I have a kind of a feeling of what you have gone
through. Mine was not a sexual harassment charge, but I felt just
about as bad as you did. I thought I was going to die. Thanks to my
wife and family and some good friends, that didn't happen.
  And when the leaks came toward this Senator, I must say there
wasn't a howl except from the Chairman of the Ethics Committee,
who stood up on the floor of the Senate, and the Majority Leader,
and very few other people stood up on the floor of the Senate, as
they did when the leaks came about you. So if nothing else, at least
for this Senator, somebody gives a damn about leaks and breaking
the rules, and maybe we will finally put an end to leaks, which I
think caused you to go through what you have had to go through.
  Now, Judge Thomas, I think the question that Chairman Biden
asked you, and you answered it in such a manner that it really is
irrelevant, was how all this happened. The fact is that it happened,
no matter whether Ms. Hill plotted it, whether she was paid to do
it, whether her conscience drove her to do it. The fact is that it
has, in your judgment, ruined your name, and that you died two
weeks ago.
  Is that fair, to restate your position?
                                         256

  Judge THOMAS. It is fair.
   Senator DECONCINI. NOW, Judge, based on that--and I think that
the circumstances that give rise to these allegations against you
are--I can't believe I am here myself. I can't believe that this proc-
ess is taking place, to a U.S. Appellate Court Judge who has been
confirmed three times by this body, a life appointment, I can't be-
lieve you are even here and I am even here. I am ashamed to be
part of this process.
  But nevertheless, that is my job, and I am here because the
Senate said, "Go back and do it again." We did it. We did it right, I
believe. I think the chairman protected Ms. Hill, as she wanted to
be protected, and he did it with the spirit of protecting her rights.
And now, I won't go into the press any more, I have beat up on
them enough I guess, but we are here because it was leaked and
the press released it.
  I don't think Professor Hill will ever fully recover from what she
has gone through, regardless of what happens to you, and I don't
know whether you will. And my question to you is, do you think
you can recover from dying a thousand deaths, having your name
and your reputation ripped from you through this process? Can you
recover as an individual and serve on the Supreme Court?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there is also a positive side of this.
  Senator DECONCINI. Tell me what it is, except raising the aware-
ness of sex harassment, and I don't say that is minimal, but I think
that awareness is out there and has been out there for a long time,
if I may say myself, and I didn't need this experience to raise it for
me, but please don't let me interrupt what you say is the positive
side. Believe me, I am looking for one; I am praying for one.
  Judge THOMAS. During this process, the last 105 days, and the
last 2V2 weeks especially, I have never had such an outpouring of
love and affection and friendship in people who know me, not
people making these scurrilous assertions but people who know me,
supporting me and caring for me, helping me to recover from it
and survive it--my wife; my son, whose reaction is just to be terri-
bly angry.
  I think it showed me just how vulnerable I am as a human being,
and any American, that these kinds of charges can be given validi-
ty in a process such as this, and the destruction it can do. It has
given me that sense.
  I think it has also shown people in our country what is happen-
ing. I didn't want them to see what happened to me. I didn't want
my personal life or allegations about my sexual habits or anything
else broadcast in every living room in the United States. But they
see this process for what it is, and I think that is good, and hopeful-
ly it never happens to another American.
  Yes, I can heal. As I said in my opening remarks, I will simply
walk down the Hill, if I am not confirmed, that will be it, and con-
tinue my job as Court of Appeals Judge, and hopefully live a long
life, enjoy my neighbors and my friends, my son, cut my grass, go
to McDonald's, and drive my car, and just be a good citizen and a
good judge and a good father and a good husband. Yes, I will sur-
vive. My question was, will the country survive, and hopefully it
will.
  Senator DECONCINI. And if you are confirmed?
                                      257

  Judge THOMAS. I will survive, a different person. I would have
hoped, Senator, when I was nominated, that it would have been an
occasion for joy. There has never been a single day of joy in this
process. There has never been one minute of joy in having been
nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States of America.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge Thomas, you said--correct me if I am
wrong--after 10 days or whatever it was, 90 witnesses and your 5
days, I thought you were not just being gracious but being sincere,
where you thanked the chairman and this committee and, as you
said today, you would have liked to receive more votes here but
you didn't, and that was the process. As I remember your words,
you said, "I think I have been treated fairly, and I have no quarrel
or no ill feelings." Am I restating that correctly, how you felt after
your formal hearing?

  Judge THOMAS. That is right, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. And I can understand that you don't feel
that way today, and my question continues to go to the sense of
you being confirmed. What does it do to somebody? Does it affect
their ability to approach cases, as you indicated, and satisfactorily
so to this Senator, approach cases as a Supreme Court Judge? Can
you be reborn in the sense of the loss that you have had to suffer
here in the last 2 weeks? And how do you cope with it, if you care
to say? And if you don't, I will understand.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, there is one thing that I have learned
over my life, and that is that I will be back.
  The other thing that I have learned in this process are things
that we discussed in the real confirmation hearing, and that is our
rights being protected, what rights we have as citizens of this coun-
try, what constitutional rights, what is our relationship with our
Government. And as I sit here on matters such as privacy, matters
such as procedures for charges against individuals in a criminal
context or a civil context, this has heightened my awareness of the
importance of those protections, the importance of something that
we discussed in theory--privacy, due process, equal protection, fair-
ness.
  Senator DECONCINI. Judge, is it safe to say that--what a way to
have to come to it, and this Senator was satisfied you didn't have
to come to it, that you met the threshold for my vote--what you
are now saying to us is that through this God-awful experience you
will be more sensitive towards the rights of the accused, and that is
because your rights have been violated. Is that correct?
  Judge THOMAS. I have been an accused.
  Senator DECONCINI. And your rights
  Judge THOMAS. Were violated, as far as
  Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. Were violated?
  Judge THOMAS. I think strongly so.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge Thomas.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, it has been mentioned here
about he has been confirmed three times. My recollection is four
times, as the assistant in the Civil Rights Division, and twice in
EEOC, wasn't it?
  Judge THOMAS. That is right, Senator.
                                      258

  Senator THURMOND. And then in the civil court. Four times.
  Judge THOMAS. That is right.
  Senator THURMOND. SO this will be the fifth time.
  Judge THOMAS. That is right, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. I just want to make the record straight.
  Judge THOMAS. Thank you, Senator Thurmond.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Thomas, the thing that keeps going
through my mind is, all 14 of us sit here, while you are being ques-
tioned all the time. I am reminded of the verse that says, "He who
is without sin, let him be the first to cast the stone." I know you
have gone through a lot of things. I have sinned; I can't cast that
stone. And there isn't anybody perfect on this side, either. As you
stare at us, I keep hoping you know that at least half of the mem-
bers of this committee voted for you, and that not everybody on
this side of the aisle is your enemy.
  I heard something on one of the commentaries on television,
more than once. I want to bring it up for you to give a response to,
because I think it has put a very unfair message out there. I don't
think it has come from anchor people; I think it has come from
people that have appeared to make commentary, other than politi-
cians.
  The contrast you and Professor Hill, saying, why would she come
forward? She doesn't have anything to gain by coming forward and
didn't have to come forward, so she obviously would have to be tell-
ing the truth, while in your case it is considered implicit that you
are lying because you have everything to lose.
  I would like to have you tell the American people your reaction
to that comparison.
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think that people can rationalize just
about anything. I have learned through this process that people
have fit square pegs into round holes, and they do it very well and
have no problem with that inconsistency. I don't know what Anita
Hill has to gain; I don't know. I don't know what goes on in her
mind. But I have already lost. I have lost my name.
  As I said before, I never aspired to the Supreme Court. I am on
the Court of Appeals. I love my job. I love what I do every day. I
have lost everything in this process. I am here not to be confirmed;
I am here to get my name back. All I have to gain from this proc-
ess is to salvage a little bit of my integrity and a little bit of my
name. Nothing more.
  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU haven't mentioned your grandfather at
all this particular sitting. I would like to have you tell me what
advice you think, he would give to you if he were advising you
today.
  Judge THOMAS. Well, Senator, in 1983--and this is something
that I said during my real confirmation hearings--when I was get-
ting hammered in the public and getting criticized, and I com-
plained to him, he told me to stand up for what I believe in. That is
what he would tell me today: not to quit, not to turn tail, not to cry
"uncle," and not to give up until I am dead. He had another state-
ment: "Give out but don't give up." That is what he would say to
me.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simon.
                                      259

  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Thomas, most of us have made the decision on the basis
that you have asked for. There are, I think it is safe to say, a few
Members of the Senate who have not made the decision yet, and
what is happening here may be the decisive factor. I read in one of
the morning newspapers where Senator Brown was quoted as
saying, "We have two very credible witnesses." I think there are
those who, whether they are reporters in this room or people view-
ing it on television, have come away with a good impression of both
of you; but obviously one person is telling the truth and one is not,
and it is difficult to determine that.
  And you look at factors that weigh on either side that, in a small
way, may be measurable. Let me just outline for you some of these
factors, and if you would correct me if I am leaving out anything
on your side of the fact. First, that she followed you from one job to
another. I understand her statement that the harassing ceased and
she needed the job, but she did follow.
  Second, the phone calls, 11 phone calls in 7 years. Some of them
can be explained, maybe all of them can be, I don't know. And
some additional contact with you, limited, but some additional con-
tact. While psychiatrists say for those who have sexual abuse, this
is not an uncommon occurrence, nevertheless, it seems to me those
weigh on your side.
  On the other side is, first of all, the much discussed question of
motivation. She is clearly a reluctant witness and, as I sense it, her
motivation may be public service. It is very difficult. You can
stretch, but it is hard to find other motivation.
  Second, the detailed facts that she comes up with could be cre-
ated, but it is difficult to imagine that. I don't happen to be a fan
of lie-detectors, but she volunteered to the FBI that she would take
a lie-detector test. I don't find generally that people who are not
telling the truth volunteer to take lie-detector tests.
  Finally, she experienced stomach pains only one time in her life,
due to job stress, she says, and her physician at least apparently
partially confirms, and that was during this period that she was
working for you.
  Now, none of these factors alone is enough, and maybe in combi-
nation they are not enough. But what would you say to my col-
leagues in the Senate who are trying to weigh this thing and say
what are some more objective criteria that can be used, as you
weigh this?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I don't think there are objective criteria
in weighing evidence. That is why you have rules of evidence and
procedures in courts of law. This is not a court of law. That is why
you have judges and finders of fact. That is why you have a careful
review process. That is why you have statutes of limitations. That
is why you have cross-examination by experienced trial counsel.
That is why you have precedents. That is why you have a judicial
system.
  Senator SIMON. Let me ask you another question about the proc-
ess. If you were on this committee and we came up with another
similar situation, would we be better off having such a hearing in
executive session, without cameras, without reporters, without tele-
vision sets in executive session?
                                      260

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think you should in these instances
trust the FBI or experienced investigators. If you don't like their
reports, I think you should stop relying on them. I don't think that
this body can serve as a judicial system.

  Senator SIMON. But we have to make judgments.
  Senator THOMAS. I don't think that this body can serve--this is a
political body, I don't think it can serve as a judicial system.
  Senator SIMON. I guess, again, the FBI does not draw conclu-
sions, as you know, as you have seen FBI reports, and we have to
make judgments and I don't think the--I don't know how we are
going to improve the process.
  Judge THOMAS. I think that this is clearly wrong.
  Senator SIMON. I think we are in agreement that the process has
to be improved.
  Judge THOMAS. NO, Senator, in the strongest terms, this process
can only go in one direction and that is improvement. This is clear-
ly wrong.
  Senator SIMON. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter has already asked questions. If
he has any more, we will go to him later.
  Senator BROWN. In trying to review what we have had before us,
it strikes me that we have taken on a question that, by any meas-
ure, is very difficult. It is not just that we have had two very per-
suasive people before us, but I have tried to make some notes as to
what it is we are looking at. We are looking at a very serious
charge. We are looking at a charge about activities, about very re-
pugnant statements of an extreme nature, and the case is one
where there are no witnesses.
  Normally, when you have a disagreement, you have got some
witnesses, but we don't have any witnesses here. There is no docu-
mentation here. There is nothing we can check, in terms of the
documents, because there are no documents that were made up at
the time. There was no notification. Normally, with an event like
this occurred, someone would bring a charge and there would be a
notice to the person who is accused. There is no notification here.
  We are looking at a charge that is 10 years old. It wasn't done
yesterday, it wasn't done last week, it wasn't done 6 months ago or
5 years ago, it was done 10 years ago. That is some 20 times beyond
the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations, as I under-
stand it, is a number of days, or in some events as long as 6
months. This is 20 times the statute of limitations.
  Basically, what we are called upon to prove or you are called
upon to prove is a negative. You are called upon to prove that 10
years ago you didn't do something. I am not sure how you do that.
I am not sure how you prove a negative.
  One thing I guess that does come to mind is that you could call
in every woman that has worked closely with you and show this
committee whether or not you have exhibits that type of activity
with others. That is, it is difficult to prove a negative, but that is
one thing to do. As I understand our rules, we have requested that
those women be called in, and the committee has not allowed that.
I don't fault the chairman with that. I believe the chairman has
                                      261

tried very hard to be fair. We do have time limitations. Neverthe-
less, we are faced with trying to prove this question and not be able
to listen to them.

  Now, I also followed up with a letter to ask that we at least re-
quire the FBI to take statements from these women who we don't
have time to hear, and that request was turned down by this com-
mittee. I think that evidence is important and should be taken, but
that evidence was turned down by this committee. I have asked
and the chairman has allowed to allow statements, if these women
want to make them, to be entered in the record, and I think that
will be helpful.

  I have also asked that the staffers who there is reason to believe
has evidence to offer here be called. In talking with Professor Hill
and in listening to her testimony, it became very clear that the
reason she came forward with these charges is because these staff-
ers told her there were rumors about sexual harassment and there
was an implication that she was involved in those rumors, and part
of the reason I believe she came forward was in response to the sto-
ries they told her, and to not take that testimony I just think is
wrong. We have made that point and that request has been turned
down.

  The bottom line I think is it is tough to decide this case. I think
there are two avenues that we can look at: One, if the event took
place, what kind of conduct would it have engendered in her and
what kind of conduct would it have engendered in you. I haven't
got a complete list, but I think there is a possibility, if the very
severe conduct took place, that it could have resulted in a com-
plaint from her. It did not. No complaint was made. Is that deter-
minate? No. There are certain reasons that complaints would not
be brought forth, but it is one question to look at.

  No notes were made of the incident. There was no effort at the
time of the incident to find another job. There was no effort at the
time of moving to the EEOC to find another job. Even though she
indicated that she didn't want to continue on, she made no effort to
check for another job at the Department of Education or in the pri-
vate sector.

  Even after the incident, there was no effort to cut off contacts,
either in terms of finding another job or in terms of even, after
having left the job, contacts continued. Now, it strikes me that the
incident, as vile as it is described, took place, that there may well
be a reason to not continue contacts.

  There was no mention of these charges when you were up for
confirmation in 1982. There was no mention of these charges when
you were up for re-confirmation in 1984. No one came forward.
There was no mention of these charges when you were up for con-
firmation for the Circuit Court of Appeals.

  There are even some reports that have come of her praise of you
after the incidents. Now, none of these by themselves determine
the issue, but all of them I think bear on the question of whether
or not it happened. Because if it did happen, as vile conduct as is
described, it surely must have affected these nine specific exam-
ples, and I suspect more.

  That brings me to what I hope you will search your mind for: It
strikes me, if this incident happened, it would not only affect her
                                               262

conduct toward you, but it would affect your conduct toward her.
What is alleged is that you repeatedly asked her out and she re-
fused. What is alleged is that you uttered very vile words, and she
did not react the way you wished her to.

  I would like you, if you are willing, to itemize for us decisions
you had to make about Professor Hill in terms of job references, in
terms of retention for jobs, in terms of pay, in terms of evaluation,
in terms of references, and in terms of assistance, what did you do
in terms of your conduct after this alleged event took place.

  Judge THOMAS. Senator, my treatment of Anita Hill was consist-
ent throughout. As I have indicated, her allegations are false. She
repeatedly received promotions, as scheduled, as far as I can re-
member. In fact, she may have been promoted on an accelerated
basis. Her assignments, for her age and experience at that time, I
think were fairly aggressive.

  I certainly made sure that when she decided to leave, that I as-
sisted her and I have kept contact with her, not on a regular basis,
but certainly returned her calls and, whenever she needed help, re-
sponded to that. That is during and after. My conduct is consistent
with my treatment of all of my special assistants, particularly
those who do a good job. There is nothing in my conduct toward
her that would indicate any negative events.

  Her conduct toward me over the years has been precisely the
same, it has always been warm and cordial, professional. This is
the first I have heard of any allegations and, certainly, as I have
indicated, or two and a half weeks ago, certainly as I indicated, it
did not occur. But my conduct toward her is the same as my con-
duct toward my other special assistants who were successful or who
performed well.

  I would look for, if these events had happened, some disparity in
that, and there is no disparity in that. My relationship with her I
think at this time or prior to this event was pretty much the same
as my relationship with my other former special assistants.

  Senator BROWN. IS there anything you can think of in your con-
duct that would suggest you retaliated?

  Judge THOMAS. Absolutely not, Senator.
  Senator BROWN. I yield back. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kohl.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge, all of our hearts and our concerns and our sympathies go
out to you and your family, for the travail which you have under-
gone here, and I think it is important to recognize that it is a col-
lective travail--that extends to institutions of government, the
American people and Anita Hill. This has been a very damaging
affair and many, many people have gotten hurt. I don't know as
there is anybody in our country who has been helped by this un-
happy situation.
  I would like to offer the observation and get your response to it,
that, regardless of all the other reasons that brought us here--in-
cluding things like leaks which should not have occurred--there is
a single most important reason without which we would not be
here today, and that is Professor Hill, an African-American, hired
by you, trained by you, promoted by you, a person that you have
                                             263

described repeatedly as smart, tough-minded, resilient, and effec-
tive.

  That person leveled a charge against you of sex harassment, a
charge that you have said is a very, very serious charge and cannot
be taken lightly. And Anita Hill and all that she represents in the
relationship that you had with her is what brings us here today.
Do you have a comment on that, sir?

  Judge THOMAS. I don't agree with that, Senator. I have been ex-
posed to this process for 105 days--105. I wasn't nominated last
week and confirmation hearings set for this week. I think this is
wrong.

  Senator KOHL. But at the
  Judge THOMAS. I think this is wrong.
  Senator KOHL [continuing]. But at the end of the nomination
process, you said--you said to Senator DeConcini and he repeated
back to you--you said that you had been treated fairly up to that
point.

  Judge THOMAS. I was treated fairly, Senator, but this is 105 days.
That is a month ago. That is a month ago.

  Senator KOHL. That's 30 days ago.
  Judge THOMAS. Yes.
  Senator KOHL. Right.
  Judge THOMAS. This process is wrong, Senator. There is no way,
as far as I am concerned, that you can validate it.
  Senator KOHL. I don't want to
  Judge THOMAS. The allegations, anyone can make an allegation.
I deny those allegations. I have always cooperated with the FBI.
Think about who you are talking to. I have been a public figure for
10 years. I have been confirmed four times. I have had five FBI
background checks. I have had stories written about me, I have
had groups that despise me, looking into my background.

  I have had people who wanted to do me great harm. You are
talking about a person who ran an agency--two agencies to fight
discrimination, who, if I did anything stupid like this, gross like
this, had everything to lose, who adamantly preached against it. It
just seems as though I am here to prove the negative in a forum
without rules and after the fact.

  I think that all this has done is give a forum to people who can
make terrible charges against individuals who have to come here
for confirmation. I think this is all this has done and it has harmed
me greatly, Senator.

  That is not to say that sex harassment is not serious. My record
speaks for itself on that. But there is a forum for that. You have
agencies for that. You have courts for that to deal with those. You
cannot deal with those in this process in this manner.

  What you are doing is you are inviting and validating people
making very serious charges against other individuals who do not
have the capacity to extricate themselves from it.

   Senator KOHL. I think you are absolutely right. I still would like
to make the point, if I may, very respectfully, that the charge was
brought not by somebody who was a stranger to you but by some-
body who was very close to you in a very important job with you,
for a very long time.
                                             264

  Judge THOMAS. She was not there a very long time, Senator, and
it was in 1983 that she left.

  Senator KOHL. OK.
  Finally, I would like to say, Judge Thomas, and to all of us who
are here today and listening that this is obviously not what Amer-
ica ought to be. And while we want to get to the truth in this par-
ticular case, the truth will be well-served if all of us stop and think
long and hard about what we are doing to our Nation.
  We simply have to restore civility and decency to the public
debate.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator Kohl.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter and then to you. I hope the prin-
cipals will limit their questions to 5 minutes or less. They have had
plenty of time to question.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, just a couple of
more questions.
  Judge Thomas, the visits which you have testified about to the
home of Professor Hill had not been known, at least to me, and my
question to you is, how do you square that with your policy of not
socializing or not dating anybody in the office? Was there any ele-
ment of socializing at all in the visits which you have described to
Professor Hill's apartment?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I did not consider it socializing. It was,
of course, it would be more the nature of my talking to my clerks
or my talking to my special assistants outside of the office. I did
not consider it anything other than a professional cordial talk or
chat. And, of course, she has indicated, I guess, in some communi-
cations with the committee that I went over to help her with a
stereo, but I would not have considered it socializing.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Thomas, when I met with you on the
morning of September 27, before the Judiciary Committee voted, I
had asked you at that time about these charges, having seen the
FBI report the night before.
  And I was asking you about the question of motivation. You
made some comments to me at that time, although they are some-
what sensitive, I think they are worth exploring for just a moment
now. That was the comment you made about a possible concern
that Professor Hill might have had regarding your dating a woman
who was of a lighter complexion. Would you amplify what had hap-
pened, respond, and testify as to what had happened in that
regard?
  Judge THOMAS. Senator, I think it is sensitive, and I think
enough sensitive matters have been discussed here. I would reluc-
tantly discuss it but I was merely speculating and groping around
for some rationale. And the point I was making to you was that
there seemed to be some tension between, as a result of the com-
plexion, the lighter complexion of the woman I dated and the
woman whom I chose to be my chief of staff, or my executive as-
sistant and some reaction, as I recall it to my preferring individ-
uals of the lighter complexion.
  Senator SPECTER. Did Professor Hill not get a promotion that she
was working for within your staff?
                                                    265

  Judge THOMAS. Again, I can't remember the exact details of it,
but I think she wanted to have that position, the executive assist-
ant position. But that's again, Senator, that is speculation as to
what the motivation would be and I hesitate to even mention it
here.

  Senator SPECTER. Finally, you mentioned that there had not been
any detailing given to the comment about an associate of yours
who classified Professor Hill as your enemy which you had disre-
garded because of your overall view of the generalized loyalty of
your staff. Can you amplify what happened in that regard?

  Judge THOMAS. Well, there were some members of my--at least
one member of my staff who felt that she did not have my best in-
terests at heart and he would continue to, as I remember it, articu-
late that point of view, and I would, again, dismiss it.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, did he tell you why he felt that way?
  Judge THOMAS. It must have been based on specific things at that
time. I don't recollect the bases of his conclusion nor his state-
ments, but he would say it repeatedly when he saw evidence of it.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, very much, Judge Thomas. I am
glad to conclude before the red light went on.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much.
  Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, I will just take 30 seconds. I
want to clarify one thing. One member of my staff thought there
might be some misunderstanding about it. I accused no one of rape.
And the only reason I was using it as a comparison is because
when you have date rape offenses you seldom have any witnesses,
any corroborating witnesses. I was using that analogy in this in-
stance because we don't have any witnesses or any corroborating
witnesses, that's all.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. We can go around and around and
we will be back basically at the same position. Judge, when you
and I left off, I think we agreed on the fact that there is irreconcil-
able conflict in the testimony. I know you feel strongly about which
way that should come down.
  I am not at all happy with the whole process. This is my third
term here and I have sat on four different committees that have
had confirmation processes. We have spent more time on this one
than any other nomination in nearly 18 years. I can only gather
how difficult it has been for you, and your family, your wife, son,
others. You are here with a good friend of all of ours, and a tower
of integrity in the U.S. Senate, Senator Danforth. I know how diffi-
cult it has been for him, I chatted briefly with him this morning.
  As a U.S. Senator--I do not like at all the way we have been
brought here. The Chairman stated and virtually everybody on the
committee has supported the position that he took about how we
got here. I was glad to hear the Chairman and the ranking
member state that an investigation will be made of where this ma-
terial came from. I assume that is going to be completed and we
will find out.
   I especially want to know because I got to see that FBI report
about 3 days after it was in the newspapers for the first time. I
                                                266

would like to read them in a little bit different sequence. But we
were sent by the Senate to try and find an answer and this is a
very difficult process.

  I suspect that everybody watching this is trying to figure out
what the answer is, just like we are. Telephone calls, I have just
been advised, into my office are absolutely split down the middle. I
would hope that nobody would decide this by polls but, that we
would do it by our best independent judgment.

  And I would hope that we might find a way where we are sure
that when we do a confirmation process, we are always dealing
with the facts. I don't know the answer to this one. We still have a
long time to go. You can think of 100 places you would rather be, I
can think of at least 100 places I would rather be--all in my home
State.

  And we may never come to the final conclusion we want. We
may never come to the final conclusion of what has happened here.
And you know, if that happens, it is even a greater tragedy than
many think.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Let me, Judge, say a couple of things and we will let you go.
  First of all, this unfortunately is not the first time this commit-
tee has been presented with a situation like this. It has been the
first time we have been presented one that involved a Supreme
Court Justice. We have other people nominated before this Court
where there are allegations by former wives of mistreatment and
wife beating. There is no appropriate forum to resolve that, as you
point out.
  Now, we have an option in that particular case to say, well, we
will send it to the court first. Before we decide whether to confirm
this particular person, have the court decide that issue. Believe me,
I would like that. I did not sign onto this job or run for it to be a
judge. If I wanted to do that, I would be a judge now in my home
State. I don't want to be a judge. I hate this job.
  But all my colleagues here were telling everybody how awful the
process is. Let me be completely blunt about it. It is like democra-
cy. It is a lousy form of government, except that nobody has fig-
ured out another way.
  Now, I can turn around and I can say to this particular person
whose wife has come forward and said, I have been abused, I can
say, I will tell you what, we are going to disregard that and we are
going to confirm you anyway. Or I can say I don't believe it and
therefore, I am not going to tell these fellows, which I have done on
other matters unrelated to wife beating.
  There has been more nominees sent up here in the last two ad-
ministrations that have had drug problems, and I never even told
these folks about, because it happened 10, 20, 30 years ago.
  So I take the heat and I take the responsibility and I will contin-
ue to do it as long as I am Chairman, no matter what these guys
think of this process, okay? Number one.
  Number two, when an allegation of consequence comes forward I
do not have the recourse to send it to the courts. I have the re-
course only to send it to my colleagues. There is no other institu-
tional way of doing it. I made a judgment on this one. My trust was
                                                  267

violated by somebody. And then the fat was in the fire. And we
would be in the same position if the day before the hearing began
Ms. Hill, unrelated to any statement of this committee, stood up
and held a press conference and said, as I spoke with counsel, as
the possibility could happen, from the White House and just held a
press conference. We would be in the same spot. We could say we
are not going to resolve that, let's put this nomination on hold and
send it to the courts.

  Not a possibility. Not able to do that no matter what my col-
leagues who are now telling everybody how wrong this process is.
And let me say another thing. This isn't over. Your grandfather is
right, you have no right to give up. There are compelling argu-
ments to be made for you and they may end up being made by me
and others.

  For example, one of the arguments made against you constantly
by those who opposed your nomination is here is a guy who sought
this. He has suckered it. He has gone out and he has laid down for
people for it and he is not dumb. A guy who wanted this in the
beginning. I heard people coming to us and testifying and saying
you wanted this and planned this since the late 1970's. Well, if you
planned this in the late 1970's and you did this you are one of the
dumbest people I have ever run across in my life.

  And you don't impress me as being dumb. Your defenders here
are not even smart enough to figure out to make that defense for
you. My job is not to defend you or to prosecute you. It is to see to
it that you get a fair shot in a system that is imperfect but it is a
good system.

  Now, everybody points out what hasn't been made here. Every
expert that has ever testified before me in this committee on an
issue that I do know something about and I have spent, with the
exception than maybe one person on this committee, more time
dealing with abuse against women and the surrounding circum-
stances than anybody else in the Senate.

  And every expert comes forward and says, there's a pattern. It
doesn't happen in isolated instances. It is a pattern. If there is not
a pattern, to me that is probative. That has some dispositive
weight. No one has proved a pattern here of anything. We are not
finished yet. But no one has proved a pattern.

  Again, these people have decided already, once and for all, they
are for you or against you. You need better lawyers. You need to
hire me.

  I am getting fed up with this stuff about how terrible this system
is. I hear everybody talking about how terrible the primary system
is. We are big boys. I knew when I ran for President that every-
thing was free game. Anybody who runs for the Supreme Court or
who is appointed to the Supreme Court, to be more precise, should
understand, this is not boyscouts, it is not cubscouts. In the case of
the President and the right to be leader of the free world, well no
one ever said it would be easy. And whoever goes to the Supreme
Court is going to determine the fate of this country more than any-
body. For the next 20 years we are going to have people scrupulous
and unscrupulous respond and react.
                                              268

  And this is not a referendum on whether or not, whether or not
sexual harassment is a grave offense. I said from the beginning,
this is about whether or not sexual harassment occurred.

  And lastly, Judge, with me, from the beginning and at this
moment, until the end, the presumption is with you. Now we are
going to hear more witnesses they are going to come in and cor-
roborate your position and hers. And we will find out whether they
are telling the truth or not as best as we are capable of doing, just
like you as a judge are when you look them in the eye and make a
judgment.

  So, Judge, this is less directed at you, than it is to my pontificat-
ing colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, so, Judge, I have
not made my judgment, based upon this proceeding, because we
have not heard all the evidence.

  And the last thing I will point out, the next person who refers to
an FBI report as being worth anything, obviously doesn't under-
stand anything. FBI explicitly does not, in this or any other case
reach a conclusion, period, period. So, Judge, there is no reason
why you should know this.

  The reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report, you would not
like it if we did because it is inconclusive. They say he said, she
said, and they said, period.

  So when people wave an FBI report before you, understand they
do not, they do not reach conclusions. They do not make, as my
friend points out more accurately, they do not make recommenda-
tions.

  Judge, it is no fun but there are certain things in our society
that have occurred that the nature of the offense is an offense that
is almost always takes place there can be and will be no corrobo-
rating evidence, and all of us are susceptible to that errant charge.

  And if you don't think that we are going to see individuals up
here charged, individuals in the Senate, individuals in the work
place charged, maybe even not without merit charged.

  But Judge, everybody says, "We know how you feel." No one can
know how you feel. That always excites me, when I hear people tell
me how it feels.

  "Oh, you lost family. I know how it feels."
  "Oh, you lost this. I know how it feels."
  "You went through that, and they ruined your reputation by it. I
know how it feels."
  No one knows how it feels, but I hope we stop this stuff. The
press did nothing wrong; it is not their fault. It is the nature of
what happens here when something goes public. This is not a right
and wrong, until it comes down to a decision about you, and the
presumption is with you. With me, the presumption is with you,
and in my opinion it should be with you until all the evidence is in
and people make a judgment.
  So, Judge, I don't know exactly how you feel, but you have clear-
ly demonstrated how you feel, and some of us, not all of us here,
have an inkling how you feel. And like I said, I ran for this job to
affect foreign policy, to affect domestic policy, not to be a judge. If I
wanted to be a judge, I would have arranged for that a long time
ago.
                                      269

  Judge wait until it is over--it will be over in the next 2 days--to
make your judgment. You will not be unaffected by this, no matter
what happens. Nobody goes through the white hot glare of this
process, any level, for any reason, and comes out unaffected. But,
Judge, nobody's reputation, nobody's reputation is a snapshot. It is
a motion picture, and the picture is being made, and you have
made the vast part of it the last 43 years.

  Senator THURMOND. Can I say just a word?
  Judge the chairman is a good man. He frequently votes with me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I voted against you. It had nothing to do
with this. I voted against you, and you and I disagree, like you said,
on philosophy, as I can best understand it.
  Judge go home, do whatever you are going to do. Thank you for
being here. You are entitled to come back any time you want to
come back, after we hear the rest of the witnesses, and no one
should make any judgment about anybody until we hear the rest of
the witnesses.
  We are recessed for 15 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will please come to order.
  I apologize for keeping the witnesses waiting, and as the old
saying goes, we have got good news for you and bad news for you.
After a caucus of the committee, the full committee, Democrats
and Republicans, in deciding how we would meet our responsibil-
ities to the full Senate to be able to conduct and conclude this hear-
ing in as fair a way to everyone involved, and particularly to the
nominee, it has been concluded as follows, and essentially unani-
mously concluded:
  That we will reconvene tomorrow at noon; that the reason why
we are not going to go forward with this panel tonight, is that if we
go forward with this panel tonight, under the agreed procedures we
would be required to, understandably, go forward with the next
panel tonight. The likelihood of that occurring and finishing in any
remotely reasonable hour is incredibly unlikely.
  So if the witnesses are able, and we sincerely hope they are, we
will ask them to come back, this panel, Ms. Hoerchner, Ms. Wells,
Mr. Carr, Mr. Paul, tomorrow at noon. It is our hope, although not
full expectation, to finish this hearing tomorrow, to give our col-
leagues in the Senate, as we were charged, an opportunity to con-
template and mull over the record and what they have heard and
seen on Monday and Tuesday, and to vote Tuesday.
  There is no question, as I informed the leadership when they
asked if we could conduct this hearing fully by the vote Tuesday
night and still give the Senate time to fully consider every aspect
of it, my unequivocal answer was no, we could not. And the Senate
decided that we were going to do it within that time, so that there
would be a final vote in order to lift the unanimous consent agree-
ment from last week.
                                             270

  So we are operating under some limitations. Our goal continues
to be to find the truth. We believe that a full night's sleep may
help elucidate that goal somewhat--not for the panel, but for the
committee and the staff--and so we will reconvene tomorrow at
noon and go hopefully as long as it takes to finish.

  [Whereupon, at 6:30 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 12 p.m., Sunday, September 13, 1991.]
NOMINATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS TO
  BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME
  COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                         SUNDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1991

                                                                     U.S. SENATE,
                                                 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                         Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 12:04 a.m., in room
SR-325, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
(chairman of the committee) presiding.
  Present: Senators Biden, Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini,
Leahy, Heflin, Simon, Kohl, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley,
Specter, and Brown.
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order.
  I thank the witnesses, the first panel and others, for doing what
they obviously believe to be their civic duty and step into the
breech. It is not comfortable for anyone at all involved in this proc-
ess.
  I would like to begin, prior to introducing the panel, by indicat-
ing how we are going to proceed. The designated questioners will
proceed for 15 minutes per questioner, and then nondesignated
Senators will have an opportunity to question for up to 5 minutes.
  In addition, I want to make it clear that we thought it best to
come back with clear heads this morning and start this morning.
That was the only reason for us not going into the night last night.
Third, we are going to try our best to accommodate the truth
emerging in this process, but it is hard to do that in this process.
  One senior correspondent said to me on the way into the building
today, as I saw him, "You know, this criticism of the process of this
all being done in the cold light of day or the hot lights of televi-
sion," he said, "when I got here, I spent the first so many years of
my professional career criticizing all these hearings that were held
closed."
  So, the only thing I want to emphasize, if there is any witness
anywhere along the process today who wishes to have their com-
ments made in closed session, because they believe it would be em-
barrassing to say something or repeat something, we will do that.
We will do that.
  Finally, last night, as I defended the process as the only one we
have, I want to make it absolutely clear, I am not defending, have
not defended, will not defend, and will pursue to determine who
caused us to have to defend this whole matter and leaked this in-

                                                        (271)
                                               272

formation. Whoever leaked this information did something that I
believe to be totally unethical, if not illegal.

  But we here, we will pursue this question and we will attempt to
end the process today, although I must say at the start what I said
at the start of this entire process: We could go on legitimately for
another 10 days, seeking out corroborators of corroborators, seek-
ing out additional information, further investigating.

  That is not a luxury that we have, and it is not the condition
upon which this vote was postponed. The postponement, I might
add, was called for by the nominee, as well as by the Senate as a
whole when this information was leaked to the press.

  Having said that, let me introduce our panel today, our first
panel, who includes the following witnesses:

  The Honorable Susan Hoerchner, a workers compensation judge
in Norwalk, CA. Thank you for coming all the way across the coun-
try, Judge.

  Helen Wells, project manager for the American Welfare Associa-
tion, in Washington, DC.

  John Carr, a partner in a law firm in New York City.
  And Joel Paul, an associate professor of law at the Washington
College of Law, at the American University, in Washington, DC.
  Now, would you each prepare to proceed in the order in which
you were called. Prior to that, I am going to yield to my colleague,
the Senator from South Carolina, to see if he has anything he
would like to say at the outset of today's hearing.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, we are
going to stay in session now until we finish all of the witnesses. It
will be completed when we end today or tonight, whenever it is?
  The CHAIRMAN. Will you all stand and be sworn--I beg your
pardon. We are going to attempt to finish this this evening. I have
learned, after almost 19 years in the Senate, not nearly however
many it has been for you, Senator, that I never predict what the
Senate can do, and as has been observed by everyone, I cannot con-
trol what any one Senator on this committee will or will not do, or
I cannot predict what is going to happen in terms of the desire on
the part of the nominee or anyone else to have additional wit-
nesses. But it is my sincere hope that we will bring this matter to a
close in terms of the public hearing this evening.
  Now, will the witnesses stand to be sworn: Do you swear to tell
the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

   Ms. HOERCHNER. I do.
   Mr. PAUL. I do.
   Ms. WELLS. I do.
   Mr. CARR. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, we will begin with Ellen Wells. Ms. Wells,
if you will proceed.

TESTIMONY OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF ELLEN M. WELLS,
  PROJECT MANAGER, AMERICAN WELFARE ASSOCIATION,
  WASHINGTON, DC; JOHN W. CARR, ESQ., NEW YORK, NY; SUSAN
  HOERCHNER, WORKER'S COMPENSATION JUDGE, NORWALK,
  CA; AND JOEL PAUL, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, AMERICAN UNI-
  VERSITY LAW SCHOOL, WASHINGTON, DC

                     TESTIMONY OF ELLEN M. WELLS

  Ms. WELLS. Thank you, Senator.
  Good afternoon, Senators. My name is Ellen M. Wells
  The CHAIRMAN. Please do not have anyone in or out the door
during the testimony of these four witnesses, during their state-
ments, I mean.
  Senator THURMOND. If you will speak into the machine, so as we
can hear.
  The CHAIRMAN. Unfortunately, this is an old room and you have
to pull the microphone very close, if you could.
  Thank you.
  Ms. WELLS. Good afternoon, Senators.
  My name is Ellen M. Wells. I am a project manager at the Amer-
ican Public Welfare Association, in Washington, DC.
  I received a master's degree in public affairs and a juris doctor-
ate from the George Washington University.
  I met Professor Hill in 1981 at a social gathering, and we devel-
oped a friendship. I was also acquainted with Judge Thomas during
the late 1970's and early 1980's, as a result of our joint membership
in the Black Republican Congressional Staff Association.
  In the fall of 1982, Professor Hill shared with me, in confidence,
the fact that she considered Judge Thomas' behavior toward her in
the office
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, if I might interrupt, I don't
mean to, but if there are prepared statements that they are read-
ing from, I think it would be helpful to the members of the com-
mittee if they had copies of the--I don't have one. If there is a copy
of the prepared statement, I would like to follow it in writing, as
well as by ear.
  The CHAIRMAN. While Ms. Wells is doing her statement, if the--
do we have statements? The statements have not been provided,
Senator. It is too late now.
   Senator HEFLIN. All right.

   Ms. WELLS. I can

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, it is not your fault. Just proceed.
   Ms. WELLS. All right.
   In the fall of 1982, Professor Hill shared with me, in confidence,
the fact that she considered Judge Thomas' behavior toward her in
the office to be inappropriate. Professor Hill did not at that time
nor in subsequent conversations provide exact details about the ac-
tions she found inappropriate conduct. She did tell me they were
sexual in nature.
   I should note that I did not ask for details, for two reasons: Nei-
ther Professor Hill nor I would have been comfortable discussing
such matters. Women typically don't talk in sexually explicit
                                                    274

terms. Second, she appeared to simply need a sympathetic ear and,
as her friend, that is what I tried to provide.

  I believed the statements made by my friend, Professor Hill. As
she told me of the situation, she appeared to be deeply troubled
and very depressed, and later I remember talking to her by tele-
phone while she was in the hospital, and she explained to me that
what she was suffering from appeared to be job related, job-stress
related.

  I think it is important for me to state that Professor Hill did not
contact me in connection with this hearing. In fact, because of the
way our lives have been proceeding, I have not seen or spoken to
Prof. Anita Hill in 2 years.

  I called the law school and left a message of support and willing-
ness to be of assistance, if needed. My call jogged her memory of
what she had said to me. As a consequence, Professor Hill asked
her attorneys to get in touch with me.

  Finally, Senators, I would like to say that I am not a party to
any effort to derail Judge Thomas' confirmation to the Supreme
Court by any interest group or by individuals who may not agree
with his political philosophy. I am here as an individual simply as
a matter of conscience to tell you what I was told by Anita Hill,
and I believe this information relevant to the decision that you are
called upon to make.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Carr.

                       TESTIMONY OF JOHN W. CARR

  Mr. CARR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, members of the
committee: My name is John William Carr. I reside in the city of
New York. I am an attorney, by profession, and a partner at the
law firm of Simpson, Thatcher & Bartlett.

  I met Anita Hill in the spring of 1981. At the time, we were in-
troduced by a mutual friend, while they both were employed at the
law firm of Wald, Harkrader & Ross, in Washington, DC.

  I was a student at the time at Harvard University, where I was
simultaneously pursuing a law degree at the Harvard Law School
and an MBA degree at the Harvard Business School. During the
final semester of the 1982-83 academic year, I developed a social
relationship with Anita Hill.

  I lived in Cambridge, MA, and she lived in Washington, DC,
which made seeing one another very difficult. However, during this
particular period, we spoke several times at length on the tele-
phone.

  During one of these telephone conversations, Anita Hill revealed
to me that her supervisor was sexually harassing her. I recall that
she did not initially volunteer this information. Rather, during the
telephone conversation, it quickly became clear to me that she was
troubled and upset. In response to my expressions of concern about
her feelings, Anita Hill told me that she was upset, because her
boss was making sexual advances toward her. I recall that she was
clearly very disturbed by these advances and that she cried during
the telephone call.
                                             275

  I knew that Anita Hill worked for Clarence Thomas at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. In this telephone conversa-
tion, it was immediately clear to me that she was referring to
Judge Thomas.

  I asked her to tell me what he had done. It is my recollection
that she told me that Clarence Thomas had asked her out on dates
and showed an unwanted sexual interest in her. She was very un-
comfortable talking about these events, and said that she did not
want to go into any detail about the actions that so upset her. I do
recall, however, that she said these sexual advances had taken
place before.

  It was clear to me at that time that she found this very painful
to talk about, and I did not push her to speak of it further. At this
point, the conversation turned to how appalling it was that the
head of the EEOC would engage in sexual advances toward one of
his own employees.

  I thought it was outrageous and, in a perverse sort of way, ironic
that the person in charge of fighting discrimination in the work-
place could harass an employee in this way. This portion of the
conversation I dominated with my own repeated expressions of out-
rage. It is because of this outrage and irony that I recall our con-
versation today.

  It was clear that Anita Hill did not want to continue to dwell on
these incidents, and the conversation moved to other subjects.
Later in the spring of 1983, my relationship with Anita Hill subsid-
ed. We did not have the opportunity to see one another and lost
touch. I believe we last spoke prior to my graduation in June 1983.
Except for seeing her at these proceedings, I have not seen or
spoken to Anita Hill since 1983.

  On Sunday evening, October 6, I saw television reports that Pro-
fessor Hill had accused Judge Thomas of sexual harassment. I im-
mediately remembered that she had told me of his sexual ad-
vances. The next day, Monday, October 7, I discussed with col-
leagues at my office that these conversations had taken place with
Professor Hill and her comments about Judge Thomas.

  As I discussed these conversations, my recollection of them
became clearer. On the following day, Tuesday, October 8, I dis-
cussed my recollections with a few of my partners, whose experi-
ence and judgment I respect. Later that day, I sent Professor Hill
an overnight letter in which I stated that I remember our conver-
sation about sexual harassment. In my letter, I also expressed my
admiration for the public stance she had taken, particularly in
light of the pain it might cause her.

  The next day, Wednesday, October 9, I received a telephone call
from a man who identified himself as a friend of Anita Hill at the
University of Oklahoma. He said that Professor Hill had received
my letter, and he and I discussed its contents briefly. I also spoke
that day about my recollections of our 1983 telephone call with an
attorney representing Ms. Hill in Washington.

  On Thursday morning, October 10, I traveled to Chicago on busi-
ness, where I received a message to call another attorney, Janet
Napolitano, who I was told was also representing Professor Hill.
Ms. Napolitano asked me if I would be willing to come before the
                                         276

Senate Judiciary Committee and tell of my 1983 telephone conver-
sation with Anita Hill. I agreed to come.

  Later that evening, I was interviewed over the telephone by vari-
ous members of the staff of the Judiciary Committee. After this
interview, I immediately flew to Washington, where on Friday, Oc-
tober 11,1 received a subpoena to appear before this committee.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Judge Hoerchner.

              TESTIMONY OF JUDGE SUSAN HOERCHNER

  Judge HOERCHNER. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond and mem-
bers of the committee: My name is Susan Hoerchner.

  I am here testifying pursuant to this committee's subpoena. I
have not seen any FBI report or any other written record of any
information I have supplied in the course of this investigation. Nei-
ther have I seen Anita's affidavits.

  I am a workers' compensation judge in California. I have known
Anita Hill for about 13 years. We met when she was my editor for
a project at Yale Legislative Services, when we were first-year law
students. We soon became friends.

  While at Yale, Anita had good friends across every spectrum:
men and women, black and white, conservative and liberal. Rea-
sons for her popularity were apparent. It's not just a question of
my never having known her to lie--I have never known Anita even
to exaggerate. I have never known her to express anger. I have
never known her to condemn a person, rather than particular be-
havior. I have never known her to use profane or offensive lan-
guage.

  In law school, Anita was always gracious and generous with her
understanding and her time. Many times, she would invite me and
other of her harried law student friends to her apartment for a de-
licious home-cooked dinner, which she somehow found time to pre-
pare, even though she was as busy and hard-working law student
herself. Perhaps most important of all to me personally, Anita was
always somebody to whom I could talk and with whom I could
laugh.

  When Anita and I graduated from law school, both of us, as it
happened, came to Washington for our first jobs. We lived in differ-
ent parts of the city. We were both busy with our new jobs, so we
did not get together with great frequency. What we did do, howev-
er, was keep in touch by telephone. Those conversations would
often last as much as an hour.

  I remember, in particular, one telephone conversation I had with
Anita. I should say, before telling you about this conversation, that
I cannot pin down its date with certainty. I am sure that it was
after she started working with Clarence Thomas, because in that
conversation she referred to him as her boss, Clarence.

  It was clear when we started this conversation that something
was badly wrong. Anita sounded very depressed and spoke in a dull
monotone. I asked Anita how things were going at work. Instead of
a cheery "Oh, just busy," her usual response, this time she led me
to understand that there was a serious problem.
                                             277

  She told me that she was being subjected to sexual harassment
from her boss, to whom she referred by name. That boss was Clar-
ence Thomas. Anita's use of the words "sexual harassment" made
an impression on me, because it was the first time I had heard that
term used by a friend in personal conversation.

  Anita said that Clarence Thomas had repeatedly asked her out.
She told me she had, of course, refused, but that he wouldn't seem
to take "no" for an answer. He kept pressing her and repeating
things like "I'm your time" and "You know I'm your kind of man,
but you refuse to admit it."

  One thing Anita told me that struck me particularly and that I
remember almost verbatim was that Mr. Thomas had said to her,
"You know, if you had witnesses, you'd have a perfect case against
me."

  She told me that she was very humiliated and demoralized by
Mr. Thomas' behavior and that it had shaken her faith in her pro-
fessional ability.

  At the end of the conversation, Anita seemed more depressed
than when it began. Contrary to my hope, talking things out did
not seem to have given her any relief or comfort.

  After our conversation, I was both saddened about my friend. Be-
cause it had been so painful for Anita to talk about the matter, I
did not try to pull information out of her. In subsequent conversa-
tions with Anita, I learned that the problem continued, but I do
not recall in detail further conversations about this matter.

  Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, as a result of the high esteem in
which her law school classmates hold her, 65 members, over 65
members of Anita's law school class have been contacted and have
signed the following statement:

  It has been our privilege to know Anita Hill, professionally and personally, since
the late 1970's, when we were in law school together. The Anita Hill we have
known is a person of great integrity and decency. As colleagues, we wish to affirm
publicly our admiration and respect for her.

  She is embroiled now in a most serious and difficult controversy, which we know
is causing her great pain. We make no attempt to analyze the issues involved or to
prejudge the outcome. We do, however, wish to state emphatically our complete con-
fidence in her sincerity and good-faith, our absolute belief in her decency and integ-
rity. In our eyes, it is impossible to imagine any circumstances in which her charac-
ter could be called into question. We are dismayed that it has been. We know that it
could not be by anyone who knows her.

  Anita has imperiled her career and her peace of mind to do what she felt was
right. We know we are powerless to shield her from those who will seek to hurt her,
out of ignorance, frustration or expediency in the days ahead, but we will have
failed ourselves, if we did not at least raise our voices in her behalf. She has our
unhesitating and unwavering support.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Paul.

                       TESTIMONY OF JOEL PAUL
  Mr. PAUL. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond and members of
the Committee: I am an associate professor of law at the Washing-
ton College of Law at American University here in Washington.
Before joining the faculty at American University in 1986, I prac-
ticed banking and corporate law in California. I presently teach
international business and trade and foreign relations law.
                                               278

  I am here to give my account of what I was told in the summer
of 1987 by Prof. Anita Hill

  The CHAIRMAN. The summer of when?
  Mr. PAUL. The summer of 1987.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Mr. PAUL [continuing]. And to give my impressions of her charac-
ter and credibility.
  As soon as I read Professor Hill's allegations in the Washington
Post, on Monday morning, I realized that I had a duty to come for-
ward and to give my account, because I knew that Professor Hill's
allegations were not an llth-hour fabrication, as some have said,
but, rather, a more specific description of the events she related to
me more than 4 years ago.
  I first met Professor Hill at a 10-day conference of the Associa-
tion of American Law Schools, in June 1987, at the University of
New Mexico Law School. I was impressed by her intellect and her
professional achievements.
  At that time, she was interested in coming to Washington to re-
search an article she was then writing. I suggested to her that she
might want to spend some time at the Washington College of Law,
since we are always looking for good teachers and scholars to join
our faculty.
  Subsequently, I arranged for Professor Hill to come to our school
during July 1987, where she was given an office, secretarial sup-
port, and use of our library facilities for the summer.
  At that point, a number of our faculty were very interested in
encouraging Professor Hill to apply for a visiting professorship at
the American University. During the course of her research at our
school, we had a number of occasions to talk about her interest in
the American University and our interest in having her join the
faculty.
  During one such occasion, over lunch in the university cafeteria,
I asked Professor Hill why she had left the EEOC. This was a logi-
cal question to ask in the course of discussing with her her employ-
ment history. Professor Hill responded, reluctantly and with obvi-
ous emotion and embarrassment, that she had been sexually har-
assed by her supervisor at the EEOC.
  I was shocked and astonished by her statement, which is why I
remember the incident so vividly. I do not recall whether she went
on to say the name Clarence Thomas, but if she had said it, the
name would not have meant anything to me at that time, because I
had no idea who Judge Thomas was. I asked Professor Hill if she
had sought any recourse for her situation, and she said no. When I
asked her why not, she said that she felt she had no effective re-
course in that situation.
  I believe that Professor Hill's statement to me was truthful. Pro-
fessor Hill at that time had no reason to claim sexual harassment
as an explanation for leaving the EEOC. Many people leave govern-
ment jobs for teaching positions. Thus, I concluded then and I still
believe that she was telling the truth.
  On Monday morning, after I read the news of Professor Hill's al-
legations, I phoned some of my colleagues from my home to ask
their advice about what to do with this information that I had.
                                      279

  When I arrived at school later that morning, another colleague,
Ms. Susan Dunham, on her own initiative, came to me, having read
the article in the Post

  The CHAIRMAN. What day was this, again?
  Mr. PAUL. This was on Monday morning, sir--and she reminded
me, that is, Ms. Susan Dunham reminded me of the fact that I had
communicated to her the substance of my conversation with Pro-
fessor Hill shortly after it occurred.
  I then recalled that, indeed, right after my lunch conversation
with Professor Hill, I went to Ms. Dunham, who had some practical
experience in the field of employment discrimination, and told her
of Professor Hill's problems at the EEOC. Ms. Dunham said at that
time that this was the case of the fox guarding the hen house. That
phrase stuck in my mind. I was pleased that Ms. Dunham inde-
pendently could confirm my memory of these events.
  I had at that time, and I have now, no reason to question the
facts as Professor Hill related them to me. I always regarded her as
having the highest integrity. I know her to be a deeply religious
person.
  Moreover, I cannot believe that she could be politically motivat-
ed. I know from numerous conversations with her that she served
faithfully in the Reagan administration, that she was generally in
sync with the goals of that administration, and that she did not dis-
agree with the overall policies of the administration.
  Indeed, when Judge Robert Bork was nominated to the Supreme
Court in the summer of 1987, I remember vividly that Professor
Hill supported his nomination and told me that she held him in
extremely high esteem, as a former teacher of hers at Yale. Her
strong support of Judge Bork led to a number of loud lunch table
disagreements between Professor Hill and other colleagues of mine.
Thus, I cannot accept the conclusion that her statements have been
motivated by political ideology.
  In closing, I would reemphasize that I am here simply to aid the
Senate Judiciary Committee in its efforts to determine these facts.
I have not taken any position with regard to Judge Thomas' nomi-
nation prior to these allegations. Indeed, a national petition of law
professors opposing his nomination was circulated at my law school
several weeks ago. I was asked to sign it and I refused, despite the
fact that 18 of my colleagues signed that petition, as well as many
others from other law schools.
  I came forward on my own initiative to recount what I was told
by Professor Hill. I have not spoken to Professor Hill since some-
time prior to the nomination of Judge Thomas. I have never dis-
cussed my testimony or any aspect of these hearings with Professor
Hill or any person representing Professor Hill, or with any organi-
zation or anyone representing any organization.
  Mr. Chairman, I am here to help you get to the facts. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me begin by asking you again, for the record,
just go down the line starting with the judge, if you will, tell me
your college education, your post-graduate education and what jobs
you have held since your graduation from post-graduate school,
please.
  Judge HOERCHNER. I have a bachelor of arts degree from the
University of the Pacific, and, more specifically, from their honors
                                               280

college, Raymond College, which has since been re-absorbed into
the university. I have a Ph.D. in American studies from Emory
University. I have a J.D. from Yale University Law School.

  The CHAIRMAN. A J.D. law degree.
  Judge HOERCHNER. Right.
  The CHAIRMAN. And upon graduating, was Yale Law School,
your last formal education?
  Judge HOERCHNER. That is correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, you graduated with honors from under-grad-
uate school, you went on to get a Ph.D. from Emory University,
and then you went on to get a law degree from Yale University.
  Judge HOERCHNER. That is almost correct. We did not have the
classification, I believe, of graduating with honors.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Judge HOERCHNER. It was an honors college.
  The CHAIRMAN. An honors college, excuse me. Now, upon grad-
uating from Yale, where did you go to work?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I went to work for the National Labor Rela-
tions Board, in Washington.
  The CHAIRMAN. And from there?
  Judge HOERCHNER. And from there to a San Francisco law firm,
Littler, Mendelssohn, Baskiff & Tiche.
  The CHAIRMAN. And from there?
  Judge HOERCHNER. And thereafter, I was self-employed and
worked as an independent contractor. Thereafter, I went into
teaching--I skipped one point.
  After I had accepted a teaching position at Valparaiso University
School of Law in Indiana, I worked on a temporary basis for an
elected city auditor in the city of Berkeley. I taught at Valparaiso
University School of Law and at Chase Law School in Northern
Kentucky University. Thereafter, I returned to California, where I
worked for the State Compensation Insurance Fund for about SV2
years, before becoming a workers compensation judge, a little bit
more than a year ago.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. I think it is important we establish
each of your backgrounds, because this is all coming down to back-
ground and credibility, the credibility of everyone involved in this
matter. I am not questioning your credibility. I want to establish
for the record who you are, before I question you.
  Now, let me ask you, Judge Hoerchner, you indicated you had
numerous conversations, as I understand it, with Professor Hill
during the period of the alleged harassment, while she was work-
ing at EEOC and the Department of Education. Is that correct?
  Judge HOERCHNER. That is not exactly correct, Senator. I have
said that I remember mainly one conversation. I believe there were
other conversations in which she led me to understand that the
problem was continuing, but I do not have any detailed recollec-
tion
  The CHAIRMAN. All I am trying to establish now is the nature of
the relationship you had with Anita Hill when you were both in
Washington during that period.
  Judge HOERCHNER. OK.
                                         281

  The CHAIRMAN. Was it an unusual thing for you to talk to Pro-
fessor Hill during that period, or was that a fairly normal under-
taking? Did you keep in contact with one another?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes, we did, we kept in contact, namely by
telephone, due to our busy schedules.

  The CHAIRMAN. And how often during this period, would you es-
timate, you spoke to Professor Hill, either on a weekly basis, a
monthly basis or during the entire period? Did you speak to her
once a week, once a month? Did you see her frequently? Can you
give us some estimation of the frequency?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I believe that while I was living in Washing-
ton, we spoke at least once a week.

  The CHAIRMAN. And how long were you living in Washington?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I left Washington in late November, late No-
vember 1981.
  The CHAIRMAN. And you arrived when?
  Judge HOERCHNER. In early June 1980.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, you were there about a year and 4 months or
5 months?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Approximately.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, it is fair to say you spoke to her more than a
couple dozen times during that period?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Oh, yes. I would like to clarify: In September
and October 1981, I was on a temporary assignment in California.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let me ask you further: You recalled for
our committee minority and majority staff, you have recalled in
other inquiries made of you officially, and you have recalled today
one specific conversation where Professor Hill said to you that she
was being harassed, that she was being repeatedly asked out on
dates.
  Now, you said you did not ask her for any detail and she did not
offer any detail. In light of the frequency with which you spoke to
her, did you find it unusual that she would not tell you more about
this? It sounds like you had an ongoing close relationship, at least
by telephone. Did it surprise you?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Not after hearing the tone of her voice when
she initially told me how depressed and demoralized she was. In
addition, as I mentioned in my statement, I have never known
Anita to use offensive language. The situation was to me too clear-
ly painful to her for me to try to pull out any further information.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you advise her to take any action? Did she
seek your counsel? Did
  Judge HOERCHNER. She did not ask for advice.
   The CHAIRMAN. Did you say, you should complain. Did you give
her any advice?
  Judge HOERCHNER. She did not ask for advice, and I did not give
her any advice.
  The CHAIRMAN. Why did you think she was calling you then to
tell you this?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I have not said that she telephoned me. I
don't remember who called whom.
   The CHAIRMAN. Why did you think she initiated this with you?

      56-273 O--93-
                                      282

  Judge HOERCHNER. I believe she initiated this part of the conver-
sation in response to a question about how things were going at
work.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, you said, in your testimony, that you knew
the problem continued after that conversation. How did you know
that the problem continued after first being made aware of it in
the conversation that you related to us, here today?

  Judge HOERCHNER. In telephone conversations I asked and she
led me to understand that it was happening, and often would say,
she didn't want to talk about it at that time.

  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Carr, you were dating Anita Hill. I assume
that's what you meant by having a--we use a lot of euphemisms in
this town and an old fashioned word--you were dating Professor
Hill at some point in the past, is that correct?

  Mr. CARR. I think that's close.
  The CHAIRMAN. OK. Well, maybe
  Mr. CARR. Let me explain, if I may? When you say, dating, I
think of a relationship that was going on.
  The CHAIRMAN. I admit that I find it difficult---I mean these
phrases, my sons are 21 and 22 and I use phrases like dating and
they look at me like I--did you go out alone with her from time-to-
time? [Laughter.]
  Mr. CARR. Yes. I would characterize it that we met, we dated,
and the bulk of our relationship was on the telephone getting to
know one another.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see. Now

  Mr. CARR. I guess I would say we didn't get but so far.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that. [Laughter.]
  All right. Seriously, I am not trying to get into anything, the de-
tails of your relationship. I just want to get a sense of what this is.
Because the reason I ask, I would like you to tell me, Mr. Carr, you
said that--please correct me if I am wrong; I am paraphrasing--
that you were angry or outraged when you heard from her on the
telephone that her boss was doing what?
  Mr. CARR. He said her boss was making sexual advances.
  The CHAIRMAN. Making sexual advances. Now, would you char-
acterize your response, again, for us. When she told you that, at
the time, do you recall
  Mr. CARR. I was outraged.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, did you give her any advice?
  Mr. CARR. I don't recall giving her any advice, other than to
calm down and to try to
  The CHAIRMAN. TO what? I'm sorry.
  Mr. CARR. TO calm down and to try to cheer up. I don't think I
gave her any advice about what to do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Your testimony, in case she didn't mention to
you--did she mention to you any other form of harassment, and it
can be harassment, any other form of harassment other than re-
peatedly being asked out? Did she indicate to you the nature of the
harassment, beyond being asked out?
  Mr. CARR. My recollection is that she did not go into detail as to
the nature of the harassment, but I have a clear recollection that
the advances toward her were sexual in nature and something
beyond merely, would you go out with me?
                                                   283

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, you indicated you spontaneously contacted
Professor Hill via a letter when this all broke.

  Mr. CARR. That's correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU were then contacted by several of her attor-
neys, or you ended up speaking to several of her attorneys. Now,
have you spoken to any interest group, have you been contacted by
anyone other than members of this committee or the Federal Gov-
ernment that have called you to encourage you to do, say, or char-
acterize anything at all?

   Mr. CARR. NO.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Wells, you were quite emphatic about not
being--I'm not sure it's your phrase--"a tool of or pushed by or
any

  Ms. WELLS. A party to--·--
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. Any interest group. Let's go back, if
I may. Again, would you tell me the dates or the approximate dates
of the conversation you had with the professor. Just tell me the
date, and I will follow it from there.
  Ms. WELLS. It was in the fall of 1982. And that, I know, well, I
have a recollection that we had other conversations concerning the
situation, but the one that stands out and is most vivid for me is
that initial conversation when she made the disclosure.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, what makes you remember that you had
other conversations relative to her displeasure with her boss and
how he was treating her relative to sexual advances?
  Ms. WELLS. My--well, because of the way we operated, we were
in frequent contact. We were a support mechanism for one an-
other. I mean we shared the good news and we shared the bad
news.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you ever see her, or was this merely a tele-
phone relationship?
  Ms. WELLS. Oh, no, she told me this in person.
  The CHAIRMAN. She told you that in person?

   Ms. WELLS. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. Give me a sense of the relationship that you had
with her at the time. Did you go to dinner with her? Did you meet
her for lunch? Would you visit each other in your apartments or
homes? I mean, what was the nature of your social relationship?

  Ms. WELLS. Senator, we had a very warm and close relationship.
I would not say that we were best friends, we had other friends,
but she and I shared certain values, and outlook about life. She
would come to my home and have dinner. She would go on shop-
ping sprees with my mother and sister.

   We went out, did a lot of things together.
   The CHAIRMAN. NOW, you seem like a very strong-willed person?
   Ms. WELLS. My friends say so.
   The CHAIRMAN. Why did you not give her any advice, during this
period when you knew she was unhappy. I mean did you not pull
her aside, at any point, and say, hey, look, Anita, whatever? Or, did
you do it at all? Did you ever raise the subject with her or did it
only come up from her to you?
   Ms. WELLS. It was something that came up from her. If I--to
open the conversation--if I were to do something like that, I would
say, well, you know, how are things going? I know Professor Hill as
                                               284

a very private person. And I am a very private person. And I do
not believe, and it is my experience that she shares this, that you
don't walk around carrying your burden so that everyone can see
them. You are supposed to carry that burden and try to make the
best of it.

  Now, if you need to talk about it, you need a good ear for that,
then I am there for you. And if you want my advice, and you let
me know that you want that, then I will give it to you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Did it surprise you that she stayed?
  Ms. WELLS. NO, it did not, because I think that is something that
a woman in that situation would do. I know, in my situation, when
confronted with something not quite as of a long-term nature as
Professor Hill's experience, I stayed.
  The CHAIRMAN. Right. Now, Mr. Paul, you are corroborating that
you were told about Professor Hill's displeasure with her boss and
his sexual advances. Let me not characterize; what did she say to
you? Did she use the term that she was harassed or sexual ad-
vances or uncomfortable? What was the term that she used to you
when you asked her why she left EEOC?
  Mr. PAUL. Senator, the specific terms that I recall were, that she
said that she was sexually harassed by her supervisor at the EEOC.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, who is Susan Duncan that you refer to?
  Mr. PAUL. Susan Dunham, D-U-N-H-A-M
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry.
  Mr. PAUL [continuing]. Is the head of the legal methods program
at our law school, Washington College of Law.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO she teaches at law school as well?
  Mr. PAUL. Yes, she does. She teaches courses on legal methods
and she also runs the legal methods program.
  The CHAIRMAN. Why would you go from the lunch table to the--I
assume that's where you were told this
  Mr. PAUL. Susan's office at the time was adjacent to mine. Susan
had a practice prior to working on the faculty which involved em-
ployment discrimination cases. I was shocked and disturbed by
what Professor Hill had told me. I did not know anything about
that area of the law, as I have testified. My area of expertise is
business law, and corporate law. So I went to Susan to sort of ask
her, you know, what could have been done? Why wasn't any re-
course taken, and that was how we had this conversation.
  The CHAIRMAN. Were you going to her in the expectation or hope
that there might still be recourse that could be taken? Were you
thinking of going back and advising
  Mr. PAUL. NO, Senator, no.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, you say, well, I am still curious. If you
were not doing it for that reason, to see if there was still a cause of
action to go back and try to convince Professor Hill to do some-
thing. What was the motivation of going to your fellow colleague?
  Mr. PAUL. My motivation was to try to understand better the po-
sition that women may be in, in that situation. It was simply a
matter of academic
  The CHAIRMAN. What were you told
  Mr. PAUL [continuing]. Curiosity.
  The CHAIRMAN. What were you told?
  Mr. PAUL. I am sorry?
                                                   285

  The CHAIRMAN. What were you told by your colleague as to why
women stay in that situation, or did she volunteer anything?

  Mr. PAUL. MS. Dunham said--and this is all that I really can say
that I recall on my own--is that she said that this was a case of
the fox guarding the hen house. That portion of the conversation I
can recall on my own. I believe Ms. Dunham has had a conversa-
tion with the Judiciary Committee staff, but I don't recall.

  The CHAIRMAN. She has. I just want to ask one last question. I
realize my 15 minutes are up. Judge, I would like to ask you, you
read a letter from your classmates at the law school. Now, were
they classmates who were from the same graduating class, or were
they people who were contemporaneously at Yale Law School at
the time that Professor Hill was at Yale Law School? Do you
know?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I believe that they were from the same grad-
uating class.

  The CHAIRMAN. HOW many were in your graduating class, do you
recall, roughly?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I believe 131 people graduated and I am not
sure whether or not that included people who were getting degrees
other than the J.D.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, the last question; how did this letter mate-
rialize? Did you circulate this letter?

  Judge HOERCHNER. NO. Due to the last-minute nature of these
proceedings, I have not at all been involved in the letter.

  The CHAIRMAN. HOW did it come to be placed in your hand then?
  Judge HOERCHNER. When I came to the hearings, Friday, I saw a
copy of it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Who gave you the letter?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I think my attorney, Ron Allen, had a copy
and he passed it over.
   The CHAIRMAN. Judge, help me out here. Do you know where the
devil the letter came from? That's what I am trying to find out.
  Judge HOERCHNER. I am not quite sure
  The CHAIRMAN. Fair enough.
  Judge HOERCHNER. [continuing]. What you are asking.
   The CHAIRMAN. All right, my time is up.
   Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I yield to Senator Specter,
who will examine the witnesses supporting Anita Hill.
   Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I begin today with a statement that I made before that I have
been asked to raise the questions by Senator Thurmond. But I do
so in the context of I do not believe this is an adversarial proceed-
ing. I do not represent anyone except Pennsylvania, and what we
are trying to do here is to find out what the facts are.
   Judge Hoerchner, you said when you were questioned by staff
members, there had been a brief questioning of you a few days ago,
back on October 10, and this appears on page 14 of the record.

   Question: Did she ever relate to you that you were the only person that knew
about these allegations or these problems she was having at work?

   Answer: I think she told me that more recently.
   Question: More recently that you were the only person that knew?
   Answer: Yes.
                                                  286

  When was it that Professor Hill told you that you were the only
person she had told about this incident?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I do not have a copy of the transcript, but I
know that very shortly after that, I corrected that statement. The
agent

  Senator SPECTER. In the transcript, Judge Hoerchner?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I do not have a copy of the transcript.
  Senator SPECTER. Are you saying that you corrected that at the
time that you were questioned about other people?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Right. That it was the FBI agent who told me
that there were only three names mentioned, and now that was
either in her original statement or in her FBI interview. Those
names were Anita Hill, Clarence Thomas, and Susan Hoerchner.
And from that I concluded, I understand wrongly, that I was the
only one she had told.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, let us make a copy of the transcript avail-
able to you, Judge Hoerchner. May we have an extra copy present-
ed to the judge, so that she can have it while she responds to the
questions, please?
  Judge Hoerchner, the first reference that I made was at page 14,
where I had read to you the short exchange beginning in the
fourth line down:

  Did she ever relate to you that you were the only person that knew about these
allegations or these problems she was having at work?

  Answer: I think she told me that more recently.
  Question: More recently that you were the only person that knew?
  Answer: Yes.

  Do you find that on page 14?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes; I do.
  Senator SPECTER. NOW, there is a later reference in the transcript
to the FBI. It appears on page 24 of the record. About the middle,
Ms. Hoerchner:

  OK, I recently came to the conclusion that I was the only one that she had told at
the time and I believe that the basis for the conclusion was that I was told by the
FBI agent who interviewed me that there were only three names on, either the affi-
davit, or stemming from her FBI interview. I am not sure which, I think the affida-
vit, and that my name was the only one she had listed as a corroborating witness.

  Is that the reference that you had to what you said to the FBI?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, did the FBI tell you that anything other
than that you were the only person that she was supposed to have
told about this?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I am not sure that the FBI actually said that
I was the only corroborating witness. I know he told me that there
were only three names listed on one or another of the documents
that he had.
  Senator SPECTER. May I ask you to refer now to the bottom of
page 21 of the transcript, the last three lines?
  You said, you were the only person Anita Hill told. You were the
only person who knew about the allegations of sexual harassment,
and you said that she reiterated that recently to you.

  Was this in one of those phone conversations?
  Answer: No, she never told me until recently.
  Question: That you were the only person who knew?
                                                  287

  Answer: Right.
  Question: When did she tell you that?
  Answer: It may have been around the time that she wanted to know if I would
talk to the FBI?
  Question: So we are talking about the last couple of weeks of September?
  Answer: Very recent, yes.

  Is that accurate, Judge Hoerchner?
  Judge HOERCHNER. NO, that was my mistake. I corrected that, as
you have noted, on page 24 of the transcript.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, on the part that I read?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I beg your pardon?
  Senator SPECTER. On the part that I read about the FBI?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, the part about the FBI says this:

  Ms. Hoerchner: OK. I recently came to the conclusion that I was the only one she
had told at the time, and I believe that the basis for the conclusion was that I was
told by the FBI agent who interviewed me that there were only three names on
either in the affidavit or stemming from her FBI interview--I'm not sure which, I
think the affidavit--and my name was the only one she had listed as a corroborat-
ing witness.

  Is that what you are referring to that you told the FBI?
  Judge HOERCHNER. NO, I did not tell the FBI that. That is what
the FBI agent told me, and I drew a conclusion.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, in your statement about what the FBI
told you, on the part I just read to you, that's the same thing as in
your two prior segments of testimony, and you conclude in that
sentence--and this is at the bottom of that paragraph--"and that
my name was the only one she had listed as a corroborating wit-
ness."
  Are you saying, Judge Hoerchner, that you--as I read these
three statements, they all say the same thing to me, that it was
recently that--where they all say that you thought you were the
only person she had told about this, and the extract that I read at
page 22 said that it was very recently that she had told you that,
within the last couple of weeks of September.
  Judge HOERCHNER. And on page 24, which is my better recollec-
tion, it was the FBI agent who said that to me, and not Anita.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, where on page 24 does it say that it was
the FBI agent who--well, on page 24, it does say that the FBI
agent told you that your name was the only one. But you're saying
that your prior reference to--well, let me ask you this: Did you say
anywhere in this interview that when you had said Professor Hill
told you that you were the only one she had told this about, that
you were incorrect on that?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I don't think that I explicitly retracted that. I
do believe that that was incorrect.
  Senator SPECTER. Let me move to another point, Judge
Hoerchner, and that is when did Professor Hill tell you about this
incident, Judge? And I ask you this, because in a couple of parts of
your testimony you said it was in September 1981, and at page 28,
the following question and answer session occurred:
  "Question: Can you give us maybe how that came up, why she
talked to you about Judge Thomas"--are you with me there,
Judge?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Not yet.
                                      288

  Senator SPECTER. OK. It is about two-thirds of the way down:
"Question: Can you give us maybe how that came up, why she
talked about Judge Thomas to you?"

  Judge HOERCHNER. OK. Is that a question? I'm sorry.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I want to refer to the transcript.
  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes, line 16, page 28?
  Senator SPECTER. Right. It reads as follows:

  Can you give us maybe how that came up, why she talked about Judge Thomas to
you? She said she was changing jobs and going to work for him in the Office of Civil
Rights, Department of Education and how excited she was. Question: Do you re-
member roughly when you all may have had that conversation, when that came up?
Answer: Have to be that it was before the part where we talked about his behavior.
I don't really know.

  Now, my question to you is, when you said that it "have to be
that it was before the part where we talked about his behavior,"
did she change jobs before she told you about this incident as you
testified, where she said that he sexually harassed her?

  Judge HOERCHNER. She changed jobs from her law firm to go to
work for Clarence Thomas in the Department of Education before
she mentioned any problems with sexual harassment.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, did she tell you about the sexual harass-
ment after she moved from the Department of Education to EEOC?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I have made clear to the FBI and in the staff
interview that I simply cannot pin down the date with certainty.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Hoerchner, you called, according to the
information you have given us before, you called Professor Hill the
day of the appointment of Judge Thomas to the Supreme Court of
the United States. Is that correct?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes, I did.
  Senator SPECTER. And what was the purpose of that call?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I called to ask her whether she had heard
about the nomination, and she said she had been contacted by tele-
phone by the press and she heard about it that way and that her
stomach turned. I asked her whether she was going to say any-
thing. She did not give me a direct answer.
  Senator SPECTER. Why did you ask her whether she was going to
say anything? Was there some thought in your mind that she
should come forward?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I had no thought or should or shouldn't. I
wanted to see what she was going to do.
  Senator SPECTER. And what was her response to you at that
time?
  Judge HOERCHNER. She replied that she was appalled at the
treatment of Professor-then Judge Bork in his confirmation hear-
ing, and from that I concluded that she did not intend to step for-
ward.
  Senator SPECTER. And did she tell you at that time that she
thought that both Judge Bork and Judge Thomas should stand or
fall on their ideas?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I believe she did.
  Senator SPECTER. At page 21 of the transcript, looking at the top,
the first line, you said,

  And she said that she was told that her only option was to be investigated by the
FBI, and we both thought it was odd and I thought that there should have been
                                             289

some alternative where she could make a statement with her name being used as
some sort of an intermediate measure, so I guess some days later the phone started
ringing.

  When did that conversation with Professor Hill occur, Judge
Hoerchner?

  Judge HOERCHNER. That was after she had made a statement to
a member of the Chairman's staff and I had made a statement to
the member of the Chairman's staff.

  Senator SPECTER. Was there a thought that you had expressed
that it might be possible for Professor Hill to come forward, is that
the alternative that you were referring to, where there would be
an intermediate measure, or just what did you mean by that?

  [Pause.]
  Senator SPECTER. I ask this, Judge Hoerchner, because there has
been a good bit of testimony as to whether Professor Hill might
have come forward, without having these public hearings and had
Judge Thomas withdraw, and my question to you is: When you had
that discussion with her about some alternative and some sort of
intermediate measure, whether you were discussing with her at
that time the possibility that there could be some action taken to
have Judge Thomas withdraw, without having these proceedings?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Neither she nor I had ever used the term
"withdraw," nor had that thought ever occurred to me, until I ap-
peared here and listened to the committee hearings.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, what did you mean, when you said "alter-
native and intermediate measure?"

  Judge HOERCHNER. I was under the impression that the informa-
tion had not been disseminated to the committee, and I understood
that we both had requested confidentiality. I'm not sure that even
today I know exactly what confidentiality entailed.

  Senator SPECTER. But you know what it doesn't entail?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I am beginning to think I am learning.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, what I am getting at is did you have
some thought that your identity and her identity could have been
kept confidential, and had the matter concluded without coming
forward, and if so, in what way?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Senator, I am a judge. My job is to look at
evidence and apply the law and make a decision. When I first
made my statement to a member of the Chairman's staff, that is
what I expected the Senate to do. I still expect the Senate to do
that, and at this point I have no idea what the result will be. My
concern is simply telling the truth.

  Senator SPECTER. I see that my time is up, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Leahy?
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge you live in California now, correct?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes, I do.
   Senator LEAHY. Judge, let me ask you, you have not testified
before Senate committees before, have you?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I certainly have not.
                                      290

  Senator LEAHY. Would it be safe to say that has never been high
on your agenda of things that you might want to do on a Sunday
afternoon? [Laughter.]

  Judge HOERCHNER. That would be extremely high or very near
the top.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge, we have had a number of discussions in
answer to Senator Specter's questions about the transcript of your
interview, and I ask you to turn to page 4 of that transcript. Would
you read lines 15 through 18, please?

  Judge HOERCHNER.

  I remember, in particular, one statement that I am remembering almost verba-
tim, but not completely verbatim. That was that he said to her, you know, if we had
any witnesses, you would have a perfect case against me.

  Senator LEAHY. NOW, who was it who made that statement to
you, and who was that person talking about?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Anita Hill was quoting to me what her boss
Clarence had said to her.

  Senator LEAHY. And by Clarence, did you understand Clarence
Thomas?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I understood Clarence Thomas.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Would you turn to page 11 of your transcript, please. On page 11,
there is a question asked of you, and let me read the question to
you. It begins on page 10, and then I would ask you to read your
answer:

  Let me get back to a comment you made about the first telephone call you relat-
ed. You said that Anita Hill had related to you that there had been sexual harass-
ment at work by my boss. I may be paraphrasing part of that, except that I know
the words sexual harassment were used in your quote. Do you specifically recall her
using those two words?

  Judge, would you please read on lines 18 and 19 what your re-
sponse was to the question, whether you specifically recall Anita
Hill using the words "sexual harassment?"

  Judge HOERCHNER. "Yes, I do. I think they were the first time I
had ever heard them on a personal basis from a friend."

  Senator LEAHY. Then, last, would you turn to page 29, please,
Judge. There is a question that begins on line 11, and I will read
the question to you. The question was, "Did she give specific de-
tails, or how specific did she get?" Judge, what was your answer?

  Judge HOERCHNER.

  Well, my memory, I remember two specific aspects about his behavior, and that
was the repetitive pushing himself upon her as a social partner and his statement,
if we had any witnesses, you would have a great case against me."

  Senator LEAHY. Lastly, in your statement this morning, you say,
"It's not just a question of my never having known her to lie, I've
never known Anita to even exaggerate."

  Judge, on each of these statements, the ones that you have just
read and, of course, the one I just referred to from this morning's
statement, is that your testimony here today?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes, that is correct.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, did the FBI agents at one point in their dis-
cussion with you tell you that in the FBI report they could keep
your name anonymously, if you requested that?
                                         291

  Judge HOERCHNER. I believe we finished the interview, with the
understanding that the agent would have interviewed Susan
Hoerchner, who would have said "no comment," and that my inter-
view, the interview that I gave him would go out under something
like L.A. No. 1.

   Senator LEAHY. Judge, you were given the opportunity, if you
just wanted to stay anonymous, not to have to testify here, to be in
California this afternoon. Why did you come forth?

   [Pause.]
  Judge HOERCHNER. I think my reasons were similar to those of
Anita and the sense that I have a duty, as a citizen, to tell the
truth.
   Senator LEAHY. And what you have told me here today is the
truth?
   Judge HOERCHNER. Yes, it is.
   Senator LEAHY. I will just ask you one more question about Pro-
fessor Hill. Is she, in your estimation, a woman who suffers from
fantasies in any way, or is she pretty level-headed?
   Judge HOERCHNER. She is one of the most level-headed people I
have ever known. Her feet are firmly on the ground. She has never
conveyed any fantasy to me whatsoever.
   Senator LEAHY. Thank you, very much.
   Ms. Wells, in speaking of Anita Hill, you said, "we are both very
private persons." Is that a fair restatement of what you said?
   Ms. WELLS. Yes, Senator.
   Senator LEAHY. But you said something else and I think maybe
it's important--especially for this panel to hear, and probably a lot
of other people to listen to--you said, you weren't surprised that
she stayed.
   Ms. Wells--I am sorry to delve into your privacy and everybody
else's--tell me, why do you say that?
   Ms. WELLS. Well, when you are confronted with something like
that you feel powerless and vulnerable. And unless you have a pri-
vate income, you have no recourse. And since this is generally done
in privacy, there are no witnesses, and so it is your word, an under-
ling, against that of a superior, someone who is obviously thought
well of or they would not have risen to the position that they hold.
And so if you hope to go forward, and by going forward, move out
from under their power and control, you sometimes have to put up
with things that no one should be expected to put up with.
   Senator LEAHY. NO one should be expected to put up with--but,
Ms. Wells, it's your experience that this is something that goes on?
   Ms. WELLS. Yes, it is my experience.
   Senator LEAHY. And Ms. Wells, sitting here today do you feel
that this is what Anita Hill experienced?
   Ms. WELLS. Yes, I do, Senator.
   Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
   Now, Mr. Carr, thinking back on it, you said that you did not
give her any advice on filing a complaint or anything else. Now
that you have thought about it, and listened to all that has hap-
pened, if you had it to do over again, what do you think you might
have given for advice?
   Mr. CARR. I think I would have advised her to leave her job. I
just, I have no recollection that I gave her any advice or didn't give
                                      292
her any advice, and we may have discussed that. I mean she may
have told me that she was planning to leave her job at some point.
I just don't recall it.

  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Carr, would it not be right to say if a friend
comes to you and says, "Look, I've got this problem"--well, let's do
it in the abstract: A friend comes to you with a problem. What is
going to be your first reaction? Interrogate the heck out of them on
the problem? Or, if they are troubled, offer them comfort?

  Mr. CARR. I am sorry, the first choice was?
  Senator LEAHY. Interrogate the heck out of them on the problem
or offer them comfort?
  Mr. CARR. I think my first inclination is going to be to try to find
out exactly what they are talking about, but I think I will be very
hesitant to push to find out too much information if they are reluc-
tant.
  And realizing that they are reluctant and I think I would cer-
tainly worry about comforting them.
  Senator LEAHY. And Ms. Wells, I want to deal with one point you
said. And correct me if I am not restating your testimony correctly.
You said that if somebody, not independently wealthy, needs a job,
and hopes that maybe if they stay at that job they might advance
to a different job, that's one reason for not just walking away. Is
that correct?
  Ms. WELLS. That is correct.
  Senator LEAHY. Was Anita Hill somebody who was independent-
ly wealthy who could just say, "I will take my trust fund or what-
ever and walk out of here"?
  Ms. WELLS. By no means. If she was, she certainly never dis-
closed it to me. One of the things we liked to do was to bargain
hunt.
  Senator LEAHY. Would it be fair to say that your impression of
her was of the single woman in the workplace living on her salary?
  Ms. WELLS. Precisely, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, Mr. Paul, account again what Professor
Hill's demeanor was when she told you about this?
  Mr. PAUL. We were sitting in the university cafeteria. It was in
the course of an informal conversation about her employment op-
portunities. She was obviously embarrassed that I had asked the
question. She was reluctant to answer the question. She was emo-
tional, hesitant.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU remember that attitude on her part?
  Mr. PAUL. I remember quite vividly because I felt embarrassed,
Senator, that I had asked what may have been an inappropriate
question with no intention of asking an inappropriate question.
  Senator LEAHY. Did you have any reason to doubt what she was
saying to you?
  Mr. PAUL. Absolutely not.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, back to you, Judge Hoerchner. You have
come here and you have testified under oath about a conversation
some years ago. The conversation, because of its nature, apparently
stands out strongly in your mind. Is that correct?
  Judge HOERCHNER. There are certain aspects of the conversation
that stand out in my mind. They are the fact that her boss' name
was Clarence. He repeatedly asserted to her that he was her kind
                                         293

of man, she would not admit it, he said, and that if she had any
witnesses she would have a great case against him.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge, has anybody forced you or enticed you to
come forward here?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Absolutely not. In fact, Anita has never asked
me to come forward.

  Senator LEAHY. MS. Wells, I will ask you the same question. Has
anybody enticed you, forced you to come forward here?

  Ms. WELLS. NO, they have not, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. IS this a process you would have just as soon
passed up?
  Ms. WELLS. Oh, yes, I--oh, yes, I would not be here if I could
have, you know, done something else.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Carr, you are a partner in a law firm in New
York City, is that correct?
  Mr. CARR. That's correct.
  Senator LEAHY. And would it be safe to say that this type of a
Sunday afternoon testifying is not the sort of thing that the part-
ners in your law firm normally do?
  Mr. CARR. That's true, Senator. I would tell you that I am a cor-
porate lawyer. I represent clients in business transactions that we
try to keep quiet and confidential and discreet. I do not believe any
client I have represented would be pleased to know that their
lawyer was before you or before the cameras. It is something that I
have been concerned about and worried about and was very hesi-
tant to do this.
  But I think it is, I think it is important to speak the truth when
you know it, and I felt that I had an obligation to do this.
  Senator LEAHY. And, Mr. Paul, you stated earlier that when
many of your colleagues signed a letter or petition or whatever op-
posing Judge Thomas for confirmation to the Supreme Court, you
declined to sign that, that you did not join with the others.
   Mr. Paul, did anybody force you to come forward here?
   Mr. PAUL. Absolutely not, Senator.
   Senator LEAHY. And why are you here?
  Mr. PAUL. I am here because I read the reports in the newspaper
on Monday and credibility and character of a professional col-
league of mine was called into question. I felt that it was my duty
to come forward. My duty both with respect to my colleague and
also, more importantly, with respect to the U.S. Senate.
   Senator LEAHY. Thank you very much.
   Mr. Chairman, I see the red light is on.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much, Senator.
   Now, we will have one more, an additional 15-minute round for
Senator Specter.
   Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Judge Hoerchner, turning now to page 7 of the previous deposi-
tion which you have given on line 4, the question was, the last part
of the question:

   You tried to talk to her about it later; did you have any idea about when your
attempt was? Answer: I think it would have been once or twice when we spoke on
the phone. It was very unsuccessful and I just know that it was after the one time
we talked about it at length.

   Judge HOERCHNER. I am sorry, Senator, we are page 7, line?
                                         294

  Senator SPECTER. NO, we are on page 13, line 4.
  And the question is:

  You tried to talk to her about it later; did you have any idea when your attempt
was? Answer: I think it would have been once or twice when we spoke on the phone
and it was very unsuccessful and I just know that it was after the one time that we
talked about it at length.

  And my question to you is, Why did you think or was there any
indication given to you by Professor Hill why she wouldn't talk
about it again?

  Judge HOERCHNER. The reason would have been apparent to me
from her initial pain and humiliation when she told me about it
the first time. I agree with Ms. Wells, that Anita is a very private
person. She has no desire to discuss these things, particularly in a
public forum.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, my question goes to her having talked to
you about it once and her declining to talk to you about it again,
and whether there was any thought in your mind as to what had
actually happened on her unwillingness to talk about it when you
had asked her about it on one or two occasions after that?

  Judge HOERCHNER. AS I mentioned in my statement, to my sur-
prise at the end of the conversation she did not seem to be cheered
or comforted in any way. Apparently talking about it was of abso-
lutely no help to her.

  Senator SPECTER. Let me turn now, Judge Hoerchner, to the
question about a couple of the job changes. You had commented in
your deposition, which appears at page 7, line 4--picking up at the
end of line 4

  Judge HOERCHNER. Just a moment.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. "She was going to leave because of
that, whether or not she had another job." And that was in re-
sponse to the question of her reasons for leaving her job at EEOC.
  Were you aware of the fact that she did not leave her job at
EEOC, or that the circumstances as represented to you did not
cause her to leave the job at EEOC without finding another job
first?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I believe after she left she told me--I met her
at a professional conference--and it was clear that she did have an-
other job. In that conversation she did not say that she was going
to leave her job and refuse to get another job. She just said that
she would give herself some time and then she would leave no
matter what.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, my question to you goes to the point as to
whether when you said that she was going to leave EEOC whether
she had another job or not. Whether from the conversation which
you had with her, you thought that she was so upset that she
would leave EEOC even if she couldn't find another job? It goes to
the issue of how upset she was on the conversation that she had
with you when she did not leave immediately, but did not leave
until she found another job?
  Judge HOERCHNER. At the time that we spoke, she was very
upset.
  Senator SPECTER. Let me move on then, Judge Hoerchner. You
talked, on page 30 of your deposition, about your view of Judge
                                         295

Thomas. And it starts on page 30, line 5, I will skip up to line 2,
where it said:

  Question: And you based, you said an attitude toward power. Where did come
from? Why would you think that Judge Thomas had an attitude about power, where
did that come from?

  Answer: It came from the idea that most of the positions that he had, that I knew
about were in civil rights, equal employment opportunity and that his behavior
really showed a disregard for general principles of equal opportunity or the rights of
individuals and it led me to believe that he possibly thought that the law was for
other people.

  My question, Judge Hoerchner, did you ever consider in the light
of Professor Hill telling you that Judge Thomas had sexually har-
assed her and he was the Chairman of the EEOC, which was the
Nation's chief law enforcement officer on this issue, did you ever
consider giving Professor Hill advice that she ought to come for-
ward and expose him so that he would not be in the position to
thwart appropriate enforcement of equal rights, and laws against
sexual harassment?

  Judge HOERCHNER. NO, Senator, I did not. I believe that the tre-
mendous inequity in power between them would have been disposi-
tive.

  Senator SPECTER. On page 37, Judge Hoerchner, you refer to a
conversation with Mr. James Brudney, would you tell us what the
circumstances were of that, please?

  Judge HOERCHNER. A conversation between Anita and Jim Brud-
ney?

  Senator SPECTER. Between you and Jim Brudney.
  Judge HOERCHNER. Between myself and Jim Brudney. Yes. After
I was interviewed by the FBI, we left, I left the interview, I believe,
with the understanding that a pseudonym, a number LA-1, would
be used instead of my name. The next day I was in a training class
with other judges and the presiding judge of the board where we
were being trained pulled me out of class because I had a telephone
call from the FBI. It was the FBI agent who had interviewed me.
He said that the people in Washington wanted me to give my
name. He led me to understand that because there were only three
names involved everyone would know who LA-1 was. At that
point, I was still unsure whether I wanted to give my name.
  The State court system that I work in is part of the executive
branch under a Republican administration. I feared retaliation. I
knew that there was one person on the Hill, I knew of the name of
one person who was at Yale at the same time that I was who was a
member of my brother's class. I wished to speak with him about
the ramifications of having my name used in the FBI report.
   Senator SPECTER. Did Mr. Brudney urge you to come forward?
   Judge HOERCHNER. Absolutely not. He refused to give me any
advice. He repeated many times very kindly that he understood my
reluctance.
   Senator SPECTER. Judge Hoerchner, have you heard Ms. Hill's
testimony about details as to what she said Judge Thomas said to
her, without repeating them now?
   Judge HOERCHNER. I believe I heard almost all of it.
   Senator SPECTER. Did she give you any details at all, except for
saying that he pushed himself on her and tried to date her and the
                                      296

statement about if they had a witness, it would be a good case? But
did she tell you about any of the other materials, about the films,
about the rest of it?

  Judge HOERCHNER. About that--I'm sorry?
  Senator SPECTER. About the films and about the rest of what she
had testified here, which you say you think you heard?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I do not have a specific memory of that and
that would be very much in keeping with her reserved character.
  Senator SPECTER. Let me ask you about one final part of the
transcript, and it appears at page 12, line 14. The question is:

  Is it possible, Judge Hoerchner, that she was referring to--again, I understand
the comments you made about your recollection--is it possible that she was refer-
ring to the same time period in which she worked at EEOC? Answer: Well, I was
trying to remember all of this at first. At one point, I thought it was EEOC, but I
was drawing conclusions based on other parts of my memory. I really don't know
which it was, and, again, I really don't know if it was 1981 versus another time.

  I was concerned, when I saw this reference that you said that "I
was drawing conclusions based on other parts of my memory," and
my question to you is what did you mean by that?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Well, I did know that Clarence Thomas
became the Chair for the EEOC. Now, whether I knew that at the
time I spoke to Anita and we had the most memorable conversa-
tion or not, I can't really say.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, what was there that you were drawing
from other parts of your memory, though?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I think I mentioned to the staff member that
I have a vague memory of something about education films that
they had reviewed for civil rights, sexual harassment-related
issues, and that is a very vague memory.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Hoerchner, did Professor Hill ever have
any discussion with you about her move from the private law firm
to the Department of Education? She has testified that one of the
reasons she left the Department of Education to go with Judge
Thomas to EEOC, notwithstanding the incidents, was that she was
fearful that the Department of Education would be abolished, be-
cause that was one of the planks in President Reagan's program.
Did you ever have any conversation with her or any insight into
any of her thinking, when she left the law firm to go to the Depart-
ment of Education, any concern that that might be insecure, be-
cause the department might be abolished?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I don't remember anything about the aboli-
tion of the department. The only thing I remember her saying
about her desire to go to the Department of Education was that she
was very interested in working in a policy-making position.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Carr, you have testified that Professor Hill
told you about comments during the course of the telephone con-
versation. How did they happen to arrive during the course of a
telephone conversation?

  Mr. CARR. My recollection is that we spoke periodically and that
it was natural in those conversations to inquire about how we were
each doing. In this conversation, it was clear that she was not
doing very well, and I asked her why she was upset or what was
bothering her, and this is what she explained.
                                         297

  Senator SPECTER. When you say it was clear from your conversa-
tion that she was not doing very well, can you amplify that? I ask,
because it is rather unusual, obviously, to bring up the subject of
sexual harassment, and I am interested to know what there was in
the conversation that would have led you to that inquiry and
would have led her to that disclosure.

  Mr. CARR. Well, my recollection is that, in response to a general-
ized "how are you doing," that the tone of her voice was a little
different, that she was trying not to express something, that she
was holding something in, that she could not make the standard
and sort of normal affirmative declaration that things were fine,
and then I inquire further as to what was wrong.

  Senator SPECTER. In response to Senator Biden's questions and
also in your deposition, you were precise on both occasions in
saying that she said that her boss was making sexual advances
toward here. Did she specify what those advances were?

  Mr. CARR. I don't recall that she did, no.
  Senator SPECTER. And in the deposition, at page 3--and I don't
think you will need the transcript, but we can give you one--the
question was, "Did she identify who her boss was? Answer: I knew
she worked for the EEOC and that it was Clarence Thomas."

  And in your testimony here today, you said that it was clear to
you that she was referring to Judge Thomas, but she did not identi-
fy Judge Thomas by name, did she?

  Mr. CARR. I don't recall that she identified him by name. I do
recall, though, that I spoke very strongly about the irony, I guess,
in how I guess disgusting it was that the head of the EEOC should
be making sexual advances toward her. There's no question in my
mind--in fact, I think of how do I remember this, and the reason I
remember this is because it was the Chairman of the EEOC.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, aside from what is clear in your mind,
my question to you is did she say it was Clarence Thomas?

   Mr. CARR. I don't recall.
   Senator SPECTER. I see that my time is up, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
   We are going to go now to 5-minute rounds. Mr. Carr, let me ask
you, before I yield to
   Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, I have some more questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we agreed we can do this, but we are going
to have to begin to change the ground rules here. We will confer on
this.
   Senator SPECTER. Well, there was no agreement as to a total
length of time.
   The CHAIRMAN. NO, but we will go to 5-minute rounds. You can
have your questions in 5-minute rounds like other Senators.
   Senator SPECTER. OK. Fine.
   The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Carr, how would you know someone was
upset on the telephone? Are you married?

   Mr. CARR. NO.

   The CHAIRMAN. IS there anyone you have had a relationship with
for an extended period of time?

   Mr. CARR. Yes.
                                      298

  The CHAIRMAN. Did you ever have any doubt when you picked
up the phone and say how are you, whether or not you know
whether they are all right or not?

  I wonder if any man or woman in the world has ever picked up
the phone and called someone with whom they had a relationship
and said how are you, and heard that silence on the other end of
the phone and not wondered whether something was wrong. The
inability to know whether someone on the other end of the phone
is upset seems to me to be an experience every American has prob-
ably shared at one time or another.

  Mr. CARR. I would agree that it is very easy with anyone that
you have even the slightest of relationship, to be able to tell wheth-
er they are happy or sad with the slightest of cues over the phone.

  The CHAIRMAN. Were you surprised that--did you find it unusual
at all that, notwithstanding the fact that the relationship had
not--whatever your phrase was--not matured, not gone forward,
that she would discuss or raise the subject of sexual harassment?

  The Senator from Pennsylvania said it was rather unusual to
bring up the subject of sexual harassment. Did you find it unusual
that she would confide in you to the extent that she would tell you
she was upset and she was being harassed? What did you think
when she told you? Did you say well, our relationship just hit a
new high? What did you think?

  Mr. CARR. If someone would have asked me, sort of in the ab-
stract, whether Anita Hill would have shared such a thing with me
at that point in our relationship, I would not have been able to say
yes. I would have wondered whether she would have. But as I
think about it, my recollection is that Anita Hill is a very honest
and forthright person, and maybe, in a simplistic sense, when
asked the question, she was visibly upset, she could not--she did
not think to avoid telling me.

  The CHAIRMAN. I yield to my friend from Alabama.
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Hoerchner, you are a workmen's compen-
sation judge, and in the experience that you have had relative to
judging, have you found that when confronted with an issue of fact,
that the recollection process, where the fact occurred several years
previous, that recollection of the incident and the details of the in-
cident do not always come to mind in the witness' recital of them
and his recollection, the continuing process, particularly if these
events, incidents, facts and conversations occurred a number of
years ago?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes, Senator, I definitely believe that is the
case.
  Senator HEFLIN. DO conversations with people who bring back to
your memory certain instances help in regard to trying to compre-
hensively refresh your memory?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I believe that is the case, as well. I do wish to
say, though, that I have never discussed with Anita since that
main conversation that I remember, the substance of that conver-
sation or when it took place.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, we are faced with the issue here between
two people, both Yale Law School graduates, both who appear to
have had prior to all of this arising, good reputations among people
that had worked with them. We have the problem of trying to sift
                                      299

through all of the facts and come up with some decision, if it is hu-
manly possible--and it may not be humanly possible--of who is
telling the truth.

  The issue of motivation as to someone coming forward and
making a statement that was untrue arising--now, we have gone
into various elements that people might think of in regard to moti-
vation, and I want to ask you, and all of you and each of you can
answer it: Was she, in your observation, a zealous-cause person,
whether it be in civil rights, the feminist movement, or whatever?
Did she ever indicate to you that she was as zealous-cause person,
who was willing to do great things, move forward, and take drastic
steps in order to advance whatever her cause would be?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Most definitely not, Senator. I know that she
worked under the Reagan administration. To this day, I have no
idea how she votes. I have very little sense of where she would fit
on a political spectrum. Further, due to the quiet and gentle
strength of her nature, she is not someone who seeks a public
forum.

  Senator HEFLIN. Certainly, you wouldn't use the word "militant"
in any degree?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I think she would be very offended by that
word.

  Senator HEFLIN. All right. Ms. Wells?
  Ms. WELLS. I would agree with the judge. In all the time that I
have known Professor Hill, we have not had a conversation that
would indicate a militant viewpoint about current affairs or any
particular philosophy. She is very even tempered, in my estima-
tion.
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Carr?
  Mr. CARR. Your characterization of her as militant I found
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I don't mean to necessarily use "militant."
It is probably the extreme word to use.
  Mr. CARR. Well, just to respond to that, I am a corporate, sort of
a Wall Street lawyer, my profession, and I would consider myself
militant compared to Anita Hill. [Laughter.]
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Paul.
  Mr. PAUL. I recall on one occasion asking her specifically about
whether she agreed with the policies of the Reagan administration
specifically on civil rights issues, and I remember her saying that
she didn't have any disagreements with them.
  The only time I remember her being at all animated in a politi-
cal discussion was the lunch table discussion that I referred to in
my testimony, where she very strenuously defended her former
mentor-teacher Judge Robert Bork.
  Senator HEFLIN. I am limited to 5 minutes, and I will sort of go
over these and ask each of you to make comments on it: Vindictive-
ness, a martyr-type complex, desire to be a hero, write a book,
spurned woman or scorned woman in regard to romantic interests,
and then the issue of whether or not she has any fantasy or out of
touch with reality.
  I suppose most of you have heard what we have attempted to go
over to find motivation, and if you would comment on those, each
one of you.
  Judge HOERCHNER. IS that to start with me, Senator?
                                                300

  Senator HEFLIN. Yes.
  Judge HOERCHNER. On vindictiveness, I have never known Anita
to express a desire for revenge in any context. I will address the
characteristics that I remember, and then I hope you can refresh
my memory.
  She was not a spurned woman, and I am unaware of any context
in which she has ever felt herself to be a spurned woman.
  And what are the other qualities?
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I don't know if I remember them all. I will
have to go back and read them--martyr complex--you could look
at it from a group basis and give them--because my time is up--
just an overall response relative to these matters and give us a
thumbnail viewpoint.
  Judge HOERCHNER. They are all sound like the product of fanta-
sy, frankly, Senator. As we have all commented, she is as very pri-
vate, reserved person, whose personal style is that of gentleness,
dignity, and understatement. She is very uncomfortable with the
prospect of being in the public eye.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right.
  Ms. Wells.
  Ms. WELLS. The answer would be in the nature for all of the
qualities, if you will, that you listed, Senator. I would say that the
thing that attracted me to Professor Hill made me feel I want to
know this person is the fact that she is a very sweet-natured
person, and yet you can feel from within her a wonderment, a
sense of joy about life, and I love to hear her laugh and she loves to
laugh. She is a happy person, a very giving person and one of the
best friends anyone could hope to have.
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Carr.
  Mr. PAUL. YOU have to remember that my recollections of Anita
Hill are I guess 9 years ago. I can't remember any of those charac-
teristics being particularly applicable to her. I heard earlier this
characterization as a spurned woman, and for a moment I tried to
recall whether I had spurned her or she had maybe spurned me,
but I don't recall. [Laughter.]
  Professor, I don't know Professor Hill in the same personal way
as these other individuals. I know her as a professional colleague
and she has always struck me as a person with two feet very firmly
planted on the ground. The only book, Senator, I could conceive of
her wanting to write would be a book on the Uniform Commercial
Code. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Again, we are going to continue this going back
and forth for 5 minutes. I have indicated to Senators on both sides
that, as we get to the end of the process and people have no ques-
tions, but if one Senator continues to have questions. He will have
an opportunity to ask those questions. We will alternate, so that
every Senator gets an opportunity to participate this way I will
just recognize the ranking member each time and he can deter-
mine who will move next.
  I recognize the Senator from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I am going to yield my 5
minutes to Senator Specter and suggest to other members that
they yield their time to him such as they are don't need.
  I now yield to Senator Hatch.
                                         301

  Senator HATCH. I would be happy to yield my 5 minutes to Sena-
tor Specter, as well.

  Senator THURMOND. Senator Simpson?
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask a couple of
questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Wyoming.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Because the anguish of the committee is just encompassed in the
immediate remarks of Ellen Wells saying those things about Ms.
Hill in a beautiful way is just exactly what Jack Danforth said
about Clarence Thomas, that he was a man of joy, you said, and
laughter and a great friend to be around, and that was said the
first day, and now you add to it this day and that is the anguish of
the moment for us.
  We are, you know, trying our best. We really are not open-
minded, but trying, because we have had a vote here already. The
vote was 7 to 7, and when you hear people speak, the two speaking
from that side of the aisle, they are speaking on the basis that they
voted against Judge Clarence Thomas to confirmation to the U.S.
Supreme Court, and when you hear Senator Specter and Senator
Hatch, they voted for his confirmation.
  So, this is really not--we are not here as judges, as our chairman
has so clearly reminded you, and it becomes ever more clear every
day. But we are doing our best, and they can chuckle and giggle
and laugh about the process and be cynical, but cynics have no
heroes and they never will. Something terribly, something terribly
bad has happened here. I don't know that we will ever find it.
  I just wanted to ask--just to be sure that I have--Mr. Paul just
one question. In your statement, you said when she told you of this,
you did not recall whether she went on to say the name Clarence
Thomas. You have been very frank about that. You don't remem-
ber that?
  Mr. PAUL. I don't recall that she did, Senator. She may have, but
it would have meant nothing to me.
  Senator SIMPSON. And then you said, "If she said it, the name
would not have meant anything to me, since I would not have rec-
ognized it at the time."
  Mr. PAUL. That's correct, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. YOU know, part of this terrible process has
been about sexual harassment, a great deal of it, but some of it has
been about leaks, a lot of it, too. So, I looked in your testimony
here in the transcript of proceedings, and on page 18, you name a
person who spoke with you who told you that you were going to be
subpoenaed later that day.
  That person is on Senator Biden's staff and a very reputable
man. His name I do not bring up. He is a senior staff person, and
that would have been his job, for him to call you and say you are
going to be subpoenaed. But I was interested in your comment,
only because I had my old bald dome battered in the other day by
this person. ,
  It says here on page 18 that Mr. Biden's person spoke to you to
say that "I was going to be subpoenaed later today, although I had
already learned that from Nina Totenberg."
  Mr. PAUL. Senator, I should explain
                                               302

  Senator SIMPSON. Would you tell me how that came to pass? I
just have a passing interest.

  The CHAIRMAN. I would like to know the answer to that, too.
  Mr. PAUL. Senator, I apologize. I didn't mean to take sides be-
tween you and Ms. Totenberg.
  Senator SIMPSON. NO, no, we are both able to do that. [Laughter.]
  Mr. PAUL. I was being perhaps too glib there. I've never spoken
to Ms. Totenberg. What I meant was that I had been woken up by
my clock radio going off and I heard Ms. Totenberg say my name,
as I woke up, saying that I had been subpoenaed to appear before
this committee.
  Senator SIMPSON. I see.
  Mr. PAUL. It was quite a wake-up call, Senator. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. That saved us a further round. [Laughter.]
  Now, wait until I tell you what she told me. [Laughter.]
  I have it here before me, but it is Sunday in America, so I shall
leave it out. [Laughter.]
  One final question, and here it really is. You are speaking with
passion and with truth, and this is my question: Does it seem odd
to any of you here that these universally crude and obscene things
which we have all heard, it is all that is out there, and we know
that they took place, according to Ms. Hill, between 1981, 1982,
1983, and 1984, somewhere in all that pattern, perhaps, that is
what we are told, and that she has stated to this panel that pres-
sure, that this man was exerting power over her, authority, status,
a threat of a loss of a job.
  Those things are all in this record, and yet others have said that,
because she was a schedule A attorney, there was never any fear of
that and that she knew that or should have known that, and others
have given us information that there was plenty of budget there
and she would have been taken care of, and that will come in later
in the next panel.
  So, here is, this foul, foul stack of stench, justifiably offensive in
any category, that she was offended, justifiably, embarrassed, justi-
fiably, and that she was repelled, justifiably. And I ask you why,
then, after she left his power, after she left his presence, after she
left his influence and his domination or whatever it was that gave
her fear--and call it fear or revulsion or repulsion--why did she
twice after that visit personally with him in Tulsa, OK, had dinner
with him in the presence of others, had breakfast with him in the
presence of others, rode to the airport alone with him in the pres-
ence of no one, and we have 11 phone calls initiated by her from
1984 through the date of Clarence Thomas' marriage to Ginni
Lamp, and then it all ended and not a single contact came forward.
  What does that say about behavior? Because Ms. Hill is not al-
leging sexual harassment--go back and look, go back and look at
her press conference, go back and look at all of it--she is alleging
behavior.
  We are here today because of behavior. If we are here today be-
cause of behavior, may I please have a summary from you of what
this says about her behavior? I would ask each of you--and I will
defer my next round--I just think it is critical. We are talking
about behavior. As human beings, I would like you to respond to
this as behavior.
                                               303

  Mr. PAUL. Senator, I am not an expert in the field of sexual har-
assment and I think I probably should defer to someone who has
had a bit more experience in the area.

  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you. Mr. Carr?
  Mr. CARR. Neither am I an expert in sexual harassment or, for
that matter, behavioral sciences. However, I do know that in look-
ing forward as a young professional at my career, I am concerned
that I will be on good terms with the people who have a say or an
impact or are in a position to judge my career, and I would be ex-
tremely, extremely hesitant to say anything to offend or cut them
off, for fear that in the future they might adversely impact my
career.
  I may need them for a reference or anything of that sort, and it
may well be that Anita Hill--and I am just telling you, this is my
own view on the way people act--it may well be that a good por-
tion of Anita Hills', so to speak, professional claim to fame was due
to her experiences with Clarence Thomas, and it may well be that
to categorically cut off that relationship would have been detrimen-
tal to her career going forward.
  Senator SIMPSON. Even in the face of this stuff. Now, may I ask
Ms. Wells?
  Ms. WELLS. Yes, Senator, I think Mr. Carr has stated the case
very well, and even in the face of that, you would, until she got to
be in a position that would be, shall we say, higher, she would not
wish to find herself on less than cordial terms with him. It is some-
thing that--I know my mother told me, and I am sure Anita's
mother told her, when you leave, make sure you leave friends
behind, because you don't know who you may need later on, and so
you at least want to be cordial.
  I know I get Christmas cards from people that I don't see from
one end of the year to the other and, quite frankly, do not wish to,
and I also return their cards and will return their calls, and these
are people who have insulted me and done things which perhaps
have degraded me at times, but they are things that you have to
put up with, and, being a black woman, you know, you have to put
up with a lot, and so you grit your teeth and you do it.
  Senator SIMPSON. Judge.
  Judge HOERCHNER. Senator, I believe Anita has testified very cre-
dibly in response to the issues that you raised. I would like to add
my voice to what Mr. Carr has said, that simply the realities of
business and professional life are such that she could not afford to
burn that particular bridge behind her, particularly, to extend the
metaphor, when that bridge is the highest person in her field and
her claim to fame.
  And to that, I would add the understanding of her character,
that she, in my impression, only wanted the behavior to stop. She
has no desire to get even or to harm him.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. I am afraid that
will remain a puzzlement for me forever, as to how that can be,
where one would continue a relationship with a person that had
done this foul, foul presentation of verbiage, verbal garbage to him
or her, and I shall never understand that, and it remains one of my
great quandaries.
                                               304

  Another thing that puzzles me deeply, she was in Washington,
DC, where there would have been a very fertile ground for her
complaint. It might not have been out in the land. It might not
have been in some other State of the Union, but she was in Wash-
ington, DC, at a time of public consciousness and awareness, and it
just seems to me impossible to believe that something that hap-
pened 10 years or 8 years ago can come out of the night like a mis-
sile and destroy a man, after 43 years of exemplary life.

  Senator THURMOND. Senator Grassley.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, we go to this side, if we could.
  Senator THURMOND. Excuse me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum next.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I address these comments to the two
ladies on the panel. These hearings have brought forth comments
from women, and I am not sure we men totally appreciate the sig-
nificance of sexual harassment.
  During these hearings, one lady came to me and told me that
when she was 16 years old, she was fondled by a male, a friend of
the family, and she never told her parents, never told anybody
about it for 27 years, until the night before she spoke to me, she
had told her husband. And all during that entire 27 years she had
felt that she was somehow guilty, that she had done something
wrong, but she hadn't done anything, nothing. She was in the pres-
ence of this person and it occurred.
  Another lady told me that she had worked at a company where
the chief executive had made numerous approaches to her, and she
said I didn't quit talking to him, I didn't quit having a relationship
if he gave me a ride home, I didn't create a chasm between us, be-
cause I, as a black woman, was concerned about my future.
  I just want to ask you, Judge and Ms. Wells, if you can maybe
explain to us 14 men and the balance of our colleagues in the
Senate and maybe the rest of the country, what it is to experience
sexual harassment or how a woman feels and the repression that
she places upon herself not to talk about it or do anything about it
or to sever the relationship with the person who has harassed her,
either one of you.
  Ms. WELLS. I think one of the first things you would ask yourself
is what did I do. You blame yourself, you say is it something I'm
wearing. I have been in this sort of situation. OK, perhaps it's the
perfume I have on.
  I went to a Catholic school, and the nuns certainly taught me to
be careful in my dress. I remember one sister telling us that you
had to be careful of the perfume that you wore, because the title
indicated the kind of emotions you would generate in a gentleman.
[Laughter.]
  I laughed, but, I will tell you, Sr. Ganier, the advice you have
given me has held me in good stead, so I paid attention to that. But
you do ask yourself what did I do, and so you try to change your
behavior, because it must be me, I must be the wrong party here.
  Then I think you perhaps start to get angry and frustrated, but
there is always that sense of being powerless and you are also
ashamed. I mean, what can you tell your friends and family, be-
cause they ask you, well, what did you do, and as you keep it in,
you don't say anything. Or someone says, well, you should go for-
                                             305

ward, you have to think again, well, how am I going to pay the
phone bill, if I do that. Yes, perhaps this job is secure, but maybe
they will post me in an office in a corner with a telephone and the
Washington Post to read from 9 to 5, and that won t get me any-
where. So, you are quiet and you are ashamed and you sit there
and you take it.

  Judge HOERCHNER. Senator, I agree that there is a tremendous
tendency toward self-blame in women who are subjected to this
sort of experience. It goes so far back into our history, even in the
Garden of Eden, who was the bad person there who offered the
apple to Adam and had to suffer for that for the rest of eternity or
for the rest of human history.

  I believe that most women who are in a situation of sexual har-
assment really only desire cessation of the problem. They have,
very often, I believe, little desire for revenge. If the behavior stops,
then they are much more comfortable, I believe, but I think the
pain remains. I think it is indelible.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me reiterate here that there are two distinct
issues here. One is the response of those victimized and the other is
whether or not someone was victimized here. This is relevant testi-
mony, what we just heard.

  I always find it difficult as to why men can't understand it. I
wonder how many tens of thousands of millions of men in this
country work for a boss who treats them like a lackey, tells them
to do certain things and they stay on the job. We never ask why
does that man stay on the job.

  I wonder how many men there are, if in fact they are ap-
proached by a man on the job who had a different preference than
they do, I wonder how ready they would be to go open and say, "By
the way, my boss, that fellow up there, approached me." A lot
would, just like a lot of women do go forward, and a lot wouldn't.

  I don't know why we have so much trouble understanding the
pattern of the victimized person, but that is not the issue here
today. The issue here today is whether or not there was victimiza-
tion, whether or not there was harassment. Although this is rele-
vant, I want to keep bringing it back.

  The only reason it is brought up now is because those who are
making, as they should, Judge Thomas' case keep coming forward
and saying, "why would you stay?" I have not brought forward, as
was suggested, ' expert testimony" on the pattern of victimization,
the pattern of behavior that people would engage in.

   I have held numerous hours of hearings on that subject, but we
are here again, please, as a fellow I used to talk for, a great trial
lawyer in Delaware, used to say, please keep our eye on the ball,
and the ball is not the overall pattern of harassment in America,
but whether or not Anita Hill was harassed. This will only contin-
ue to be brought up as long as we continue to ask the question
"why would she stay?" There are both legitimate questions but
let's keep our eye on the ball as best we can.

   Now I yield to my friend from South Carolina.
   Senator THURMOND. Senator Grassley.
   Senator GRASSLEY. None of you have claimed close friendship
with Anita Hill. What bothers me in this whole hearing is the fact
that these allegations, as serious as they are and as serious as she
                                         306

felt about them to come forward at this time, it seems to me would
also be told to close friends who would come and want to testify,
and I don't have any indication that we have any close friends who
are willing to come and testify.

  Do you know that she is a person who has close friends, or does
this bother you that you have not had this close friendship with
her, and yet you come forward and other people don't come for-
ward?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Senator Grassley, I believe that you are la-
boring under a misapprehension. I consider Anita Hill a very close
friend and one of my very best friends from law school.

  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU do consider her a close friend?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes.
  Senator GRASSLEY. OK, what about for the other three?
  Ms. WELLS. I consider myself a close friend. In my comments at
the start of this session, I mentioned that I had not seen or spoken
to her in 2 years, but that was scheduling problems, shall we say.
We kept in contact occasionally through correspondence, and one
of the reasons I will--and that is just the last 2 years--one of the
reasons I know that we are close is, because the moment the phone
rings and I hear her voice or she hears my voice, we pick up as
though the conversation had just ended an hour before.

  So I have these ties to her, this invisible tie to her that exists
across the miles that separate us.

  Senator GRASSLEY. But not close enough in either one of your two
cases, although you say you were close friends to her, to offer her
any advice. If she is a close friend, why would you not offer advice
in a time of trial and tribulation like she evidently was going
through?

  Ms. WELLS. In my case it was because the situation was so per-
sonal and painful, it would have been very presumptuous of me to
try to tell her what to do. I would like to add that there are other
very close friends of her under subpoena to testify before this com-
mittee.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Wouldn't your friendship, the more trying the
situation is, demand your help, the closer that relationship is?

  Ms. WELLS. My feeling seems to have been pretty much what Mr.
Carr said that his was, that I wanted to listen and to comfort, and
it is very painful to me that my listening apparently did not pro-
vide comfort.

  Mr. CARR. I would just say that you may find this difficult to un-
derstand, but the limitations on our relationship had to do with
time. It began and it ended, but during that period of time I would
have considered us close. I would have considered us very close.

  Ms. WELLS. Senator, on that point of why I would not have of-
fered her advice, as I indicated, she wanted a sympathetic ear, and
the nature of the complaint is such that you have to be very care-
ful what you suggest to someone in terms of how they ought to pro-
ceed, because of the very serious ramifications. And quite frankly,
although I may very well have said something that sounded like
advice, I am afraid I would have told her to do exactly what she
did. I would have been wrong, but that is what I would have done.

  Mr. PAUL. Senator, as I have testified, I am not a close personal
friend of Professor Hill's. I am a professional colleague of hers who
                                               307

has always been very impressed by her, and so my recollections are
not colored by a personal relationship to her.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I will yield the rest of my time
to Senator Specter.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, since there are only a few seconds left of
that time, we will give Senator Specter more time.

  Senator THURMOND. Senator Brown?
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, no. I'm sorry. We are going back to this side
again.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, that is what I was thinking. Did you
change your mind?
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I didn't. I misled you. I'm sorry. We will not
go to Senator Specter now. We will go to Senator Kennedy, and
then we will go to Senator Brown, and then we will go to Senator
DeConcini, then back to Senator Specter. And if he needs more
than 5 minutes, we will do more than 5 minutes.
  Senator Kennedy?
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I am sure I want to join in welcoming the panel, and I am sure
in their own minds they must be wondering why they are being so
questioned about what they understand were conversations that
took place over a period of years. And I commend them for the
honesty of their comments and for the helpfulness that they have
provided this committee. I think it has been a very important serv-
ice.
  Some people just don't want to believe you. You have to under-
stand that. They just don't want to believe you, and they don't
want to believe Professor Hill. That is what the fact of the matter
is, and you may be detecting some of that in the course of the hear-
ing and the questions this afternoon.
  But I hope, Mr. Chairman, that after this panel we are not going
to hear any more comments, unworthy, unsubstantiated comments,
unjustified comments about Professor Hill and perjury, as we
heard in this room yesterday. I hope we are not going to hear any
more comments about Professor Hill being a tool of the various ad-
vocacy groups, after we have heard from Ellen Wells and John
Carr and Joe Paul, all of whom have volunteered to come forward
after they heard about this in the newspapers--comments about in-
dividual groups and staffers trying to persuade her.
  I hope we are not going to hear more about politics. You can
imagine what Professor Hill would have gone through if she had
been a Democrat, and we hear this afternoon she was a Bork sup-
porter; worked in a Republican administration. I hope we are not
going to hear a lot more comments about politics.
  I hope we are not going to hear a lot more comments about fan-
tasy stories picked out of books and law cases, after we have heard
from this distinguished panel, or how there have been attempts in
the 11th hour to derail this nomination. I hope we can clear this
room of the dirt and innuendo, that has been suggested by Profes-
sor Hill as well, about over-the-transom information, about faxes,
about proclivities. We heard a good deal about character assassina-
tion yesterday, and I hope we are going to be sensitive to the at-
tempts of character assassination on Professor Hill. They are un-
worthy. They are unworthy.
                                               308

  And, quite frankly, I hope we are not going to hear a lot more
about racism as we consider this nominee. The fact is that these
points of sexual harassment are made by an Afro-American against
an Afro-American. The issue isn't discrimination and racism. It is
about sexual harassment, and I hope we can keep our eye on that
particular issue.

  I want to thank the panel for their testimony, for their response
to questions. I found it enormously enlightening. I think the Mem-
bers of the Senate will. It is very clear from your presence here,
the comments you have made, the way you have responded to ques-
tions, that you are doing this as a matter of responsibility and jus-
tice--justice to an individual who has had the courage in very diffi-
cult and trying times, and everyone who has seen the attempts to
go after her over the period of the last 3 days has to understand
her hesitancy, but your presence here I think has been enormously
helpful to this committee and to the Senate, and I thank you for
responding.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Brown.
  Senator BROWN. I think your coming today is not only appreciat-
ed but very helpful for us to understand the state of mind of Anita
Hill, and I think very helpful in giving some verification to her
thoughts at the times that you all had conversations with her.
  As I review the various comments that each of you have made, it
strikes me that you have given verification to the fact that she
indeed talked about being asked out, talked about inappropriate ac-
tions. I believe one of you or several of you used the term "sexual
harassment."
  I want to try and get a feel, if there were other things besides
these involved in what she related to you. Specifically, did she
relate to you that there was any touching, any physical contact ini-
tiated by Clarence Thomas? Anyone have that conversation?
  Judge HOERCHNER. No, Senator, she did not relay that to me.
  Ms. WELLS. Nor to me, Senator.
  Mr. CARR. She never told me that, I don't believe. I don't recall.
  Mr. PAUL. I don't recall.
  Senator BROWN. We have heard some comments about very gross
language being used, with extremely descriptive terms being used.
Were those terms related to any of you?
  Ms. WELLS. I beg your pardon? I don't think I understood.
  Senator BROWN. We have heard comments that Judge Thomas
used very gross language, very explicit terms. Were those specific
terms related to any of you, in the conversation you had with her?
  Mr. PAUL. I don't recall.
  Mr. CARR. My recollection is that I attempted to find out more
about what had happened, briefly, but that she did not want to
talk about it.
  Ms. WELLS. She did not relay those terms to me. As I said, it
would have been a use of sexually explicit language, and neither
she nor I engage in such conversation.
  Judge HOERCHNER. I do not recall her use of such terms with me,
either.
  Senator BROWN. Well, thank you. I appreciate your very straight-
forward responses.
  I will give the balance of my time to Senator Specter, as well.
                                         309

  Senator THURMOND. Senator Specter.
  Senator DECONCINI. Wait a minute.
  Senator THURMOND. I beg your pardon.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. He does have remaining time. We
will go to Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. IS that OK?
  Senator THURMOND. If he can pick that up, when Specter ques-
tions, just go ahead.
  Senator KENNEDY. Senator DeConcini.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am sure
that Senator Specter is going to have all the time.
   I want to thank you, too, for coming forward. We all have some
judgments that we all took here on Judge Thomas before we had to
come back, so we all have staked out a position. The other 84 Sena-
tors, some have and some haven't. So all of us here, as you may
know, have already taken a position, but our job is to listen, and I
have listened, and I thank you for coming forward.
   My questions I hope are really observations, first of all. Mr. Carr,
it just really got to me when you said that--or did you say this?--
that your appearance here, not only would you much rather be
doing something else, but it was not going to enhance your career,
and that your corporate clients wouldn't like this. Is that what you
said, or did I misinterpret you?
   Mr. CARR. I don't know the political views of my corporate cli-
ents, per se, Senator. What I meant was that I doubted that any of
them would find it a positive thing.
   Senator DECONCINI. They wouldn't?
   Mr. CARR. I don't think so.
   Senator DECONCINI. YOU don't think so?
   Mr. CARR. Although I don't know whether they would find it a
negative thing.
   Senator DECONCINI. Just out of curiosity, and it has nothing to
do with the proceedings, and you don't have to do this, I would like
to know, just if you would call me sometime, if your corporate cli-
ents really do object to you coming forward and doing this, and you
don't even have to tell me who they are. But it just struck me
funny, I think any corporate client would be proud of you, that you
are that kind of a man, but maybe I am wrong. I haven't practiced
law for 15 years, and so maybe corporations and corporate clients
are different than they were when I practiced.
   The other thing is, Mr. Carr, did you say that no outside group
or anybody contacted you, that you came forward on your own?
   Mr. CARR. I saw the accusations on the television. I remembered
them. I wrote a letter to Anita Hill, telling her that I remembered
our conversation, and then I was contacted by people working with
her and asked if I would testify.
   Senator DECONCINI. If you would, and your lawyer is Janet Na-
politano? Or is that----
   Mr. CARR. NO, she is, I assume she is Anita's lawyer.
   Senator DECONCINI. She is Anita's lawyer. I didn't know if she
also represented you. She is a very fine lawyer. I happen to know
her.
                                         310

  Ms. Wells, let me ask you this: I appreciate your explanation of
why a woman--and perhaps this applies to men, too, in different
senses--why a woman would stay on under sexual harassment, and
you said you would have done that, and you would have advised
her to stay, even though now you say that was wrong, and I appre-
ciate that honesty.

  If Professor Hill had told you the explicits that she told this com-
mittee, No. 1, would you have felt obligated to give her advice? And
would that advice have been, as you said it would have been, to
stay on?

  Ms. WELLS. If I had learned of the actual nature of the behavior,
I would--well, I was stunned, first of all, just to hear the news
without details. To hear the details, I think I would have been so
outraged that I perhaps would have said, "Well, we have to do
something. You cannot live through this."

  Senator DECONCINI. DO something. And personally, you know,
nobody can really get inside someone else's moccasins or shoes, but
if that had happened to you, would you have stayed on and moved
on in the job--given the explicitness of the testimony given yester-
day?

  Ms. WELLS. Without getting into details, Senator, and I say this
only to try to help you understand what I think went on here, I
would be unsure, simply because I was touched in the workplace,
not merely on one occasion, and I stayed in that position.

  Senator DECONCINI. And you stayed on.
  Ms. WELLS. SO therefore, I really can't say what I would have
done with words.
  Senator DECONCINI. And, judge, did Professor Hill at any time in
your conversations mention to you her desire to be advanced in the
EEOC, of another position she would like to have had or was seek-
ing?
  Judge HOERCHNER. No, not to my recollection.
  Senator DECONCINI. There was never any discussion, in that
hour-long conversation, of her aspirations or her disappointment or
her ambitions?
  Judge HOERCHNER. NO, but let me clarify, if I may. I don't know
how long that conversation lasted. I do know that we often spoke
for up to an hour.
  Senator DECONCINI. And none of those conversations, whether
they were 10 minutes or up to an hour, ever contained any discus-
sion about her ambitions or her desires to move on and what she
thought her chances were, or any discussions along that line?
  Judge HOERCHNER. NO, absolutely no. The only thing I clearly re-
member her saying about the nature of the work was that she
liked being
  Senator DECONCINI. Excuse me. I didn't hear your answer.
  Judge HOERCHNER. She made no comments about moving upward
or
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. I did hear your answer.
  Judge Hoerchner, did you have to hire a lawyer to come here
today?
  Judge HOERCHNER. NO.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU didn't? Do you have a lawyer represent-
ing you here?
                                     311

  Judge HOERCHNER. I have a lawyer who was my moot court di-
rector at Yale Law School. His name is Ron Allen.

  Senator DECONCINI. And he is a pro bono lawyer, or are you
paying him?

  Judge HOERCHNER. He has not submitted a bill yet. [Laughter.]
  Senator DECONCINI. Lots of luck, Mr. Allen.
  Thank you.
  And just lastly, Dean Paul, you don't consider yourself a friend
of Professor Hill. A professional acquaintance, is that fair to say?
  Mr. PAUL. I would say that we were professional colleagues.
  Senator DECONCINI. Professional colleagues.
  Mr. PAUL. We are on friendly terms. I see Professor Hill typical-
ly once or twice a year at the annual meetings of the Association of
American Law Schools.
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes. Do you think you fall into the category,
then, in her statement where she said:

  It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration that I am able to talk of
these unpleasant matters to anyone but my closest friends.

  She must consider you a friend, don't you think?
  Mr. PAUL. I think that she considers me a friendly professional
colleague. I don't know why she chose to relate the story to me. I
don't know if she remembers relating the story to me. As I say, I
haven't spoken to Professor Hill since prior to the Thomas nomina-
tion.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  And thank you, Chairman, for the additional time. I appreciate
it.
  Senator THURMOND. Senator Specter?
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Ms. Wells, let me pick up with your statement as I wrote it
down, when you heard the details as to what Professor Hill had
said that Judge Thomas said to her, "so outraged you would have
to do something." The issue which we have before us is one of
credibility, as to whom to believe. We have gained substantial in-
sights in a lot of testimony which has been given as to the view of
a woman in a position of this sort.
  You did not know the details. You only knew that it was inap-
propriate and sexual in nature, as to what Professor Hill had told
you. That is what your testimony has been here today.
  When you get the details and, as you say, you were outraged that
you thought something would have to have been done, we have a
situation where Professor Hill went from the Department of Educa-
tion to the EEOC, and she was a classification attorney where she
could have kept her job, and then she went with him voluntarily
on a trip to Oral Roberts. I am not suggesting any impropriety, but
she went with him. And, after that she called him on many occa-
sions. There are 11 in a log, and we will have a witness later who
will testify that she called him on many other occasions that
weren't written down in the log because they got through to Judge
Thomas.
  And we have an astute professor, a law professor, a lawyer, who
was concerned about being fired by Judge Thomas, so that when he
gave her work assignments she wrote them all down, the date she
                                      312

received them, the nature of the work, how long it took her to
finish them.

  But in the context of that kind of concern, and she testifies about
these outlandish statements having been made, she doesn't write
any of them down.

  And we are trying to figure out what really happened. If it is
sexual harassment, the man ought not be on the Court. Ought not
be on any court. He ought not be the head of EEOC.

  And the testimony has been that, I think it was, that he was her
claim to fame, should not burn that bridge. But, even considering
all of that and knowing Professor Hill as you do, and in the light of
your statement "so outraged, have to do something," what would
that something have been? Would it have been to follow him from
one job to another? To call him up? To drive him to the airport? Or
would it at least have been not to maintain that kind of an associa-
tion?

  Ms. WELLS. Well, Senator, as I believe I indicated earlier, one of
the reasons that I would be hesitant to offer advice on this kind of
issue is because of the ramifications, and it is such a personal
thing. So, yes, if she had something like that, sitting outside of the
situation I would have said, "Oh, this is terrible. Yes, you must do
something."

  But what could I actually expect her to do? When I told a close
friend about my occurrence, in terms of being touched, I was told
immediately, "Oh, you should file a suit." I wasn't going to do that.
I couldn't do that. First of all, who saw it? Nobody. But I would tell
you this: I didn't need to write it down because I remember the
places on my body that he touched, just as she did not need to
write down the words he used because they are burned indelibly
into her brain.

  And so, yes, it may seem strange that you maintain contact, but
I think it is something that you just school yourself to do. And I
understand that that seems difficult, but that is what happens of-
tentimes.

  And it takes a great deal of strength and courage to not main-
tain some kind of a cordial relationship, if you will, because we are
all told about networking. I mean, my goodness, graciousness. You
can open up any women's magazine and you go to seminars on how
women are supposed to learn to network since we don't have the
old boys club. Take up golf, ladies. Take up tennis. Learn to get out
there so you can do these things to maintain these contacts. And so
you don't burn your bridges.

  Senator SPECTER. SO, in essence, you are saying that even though
you were so outraged you would have to do something that ulti-
mately you would have done nothing?

  Ms. WELLS. I think that is the case.
  Senator SPECTER. And would she have maintained that kind of a
friendly relationship, called him up, drive him to the airport, et
cetera?
  Ms. WELLS. I don't know all those--all the circumstances, but
given the kind of work--I am sorry?
  Senator SPECTER. Well, Professor Hill has said that she made
those calls. She admits to 11 calls.

   Ms. WELLS. Yes.
                                      313

  Senator SPECTER. I think the record is plain that she did drive
him to the airport. And it is, of course, very plain that she moved
with him from one agency to another and that she went to Oral
Roberts. She accompanied him on a trip.

  We are interested in your perspective, and interested if you
would have maintained all of those kinds of activities, given the
feelings that were involved with the reprehensible statements al-
leged to have been made.

  Ms. WELLS. Well, over the course of, let's see, what--I am not
sure. I think it was 1983 when she started at Oral Roberts and we
are at 1991. I don't see 11 calls, some of them on behalf of other
people, as a lot of contact. It is business in nature.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, there were more calls than that 11 which
were recorded where he was not present.

  Mr. Carr, you said that you found the comments outrageous. Did
you give any thought, at the time you had this telephone conversa-
tion with Professor Hill, to saying to her what are you going to do
about it; let's consider taking some action; here you have a man
who is the head of the EEOC, chief law enforcement of the country
on sexual harassment?

  Did the thought cross your mind, whether or not she did any-
thing, that these outrageous comments should at least warrant
some consideration of some action?

  Mr. CARR. I don't recall that we discussed that or that we did not
discuss it. I, it may well be that at that point she had decided to
leave his employ and she told me that. I just don't recall.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, my question to you is did you give her
any such advice? Are you saying that you might have given her
that advice or am I to consider it if it were simply now? Do you not
recall?

  Mr. CARR. I am saying I don't recall today. That is right.
  Senator SPECTER. Professor Paul, you testified about a comment
made by an associate of yours, the fox in the hen house, and I be-
lieve as you characterized it you were shocked and astonished by
what Professor Hill had told you.
  Did you give any thought to any suggestion about her taking
some action given the fact that this happened at EEOC, the agency
which was charged with enforcing laws against sexual harassment?
  Mr. PAUL. AS I testified, Senator, I asked her if she had taken
any recourse and she said no. And I asked her why not and she
said that she felt that she had no recourse. I don't recall more than
that conversation.
  Senator SPECTER. Your testimony was that she said she had been
sexually harassed by her supervisor. I am advised, and we have to
have testimony on this, but I am advised reliably that she had two
supervisors besides Judge Thomas, who was her ultimate supervi-
sor as the Chairman of the EEOC.
  Would the statement she made to you about a supervisor compre-
hend as well a supervisor other than the Chairman of the EEOC?
  Mr. PAUL. Well, Senator, she said that she had been sexually
harassed by her supervisor. From what I know of Professor Hill, it
is not conceivable to me that she would now be blaming Judge
Thomas for the actions of another man. So I would have to con-
                                      314

elude that no, Senator, I believe that she was talking about Judge
Thomas.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I am not asking you for a conclusion. I
am asking you about what she said in terms of supervisor and
whether that, aside from any other inferences which you may
make whether the category supervisor or whatever it was she said
would comprehend other supervisors, if, in fact, there were? And
we have to hear about that.

  Mr. PAUL. I don't know, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Hoerchner, let me come back to a couple
of points which have been asked, that I asked you about by some
other people. I turn to page 5 of the notes and testimony, and line
6.
  Senator KENNEDY. Repeat the page, please.
  Senator SPECTER. Page 5, line 6.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, I am not going to cut you off. But again,
there are some who haven't asked over here, so you are beyond the
5 minutes.
  Senator SPECTER. That is fine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. We are going back and forth.
  Senator SPECTER. Glad to yield?
  The CHAIRMAN. Why don't we do that? And you will have an op-
portunity to ask again.
  Now, Senators Simon and Kohl have not had an opportunity to
ask, as I understand it. So, Senator Simon?
  And again, any member of the panel who continues to have ques-
tions, we will allow them the opportunity to question. But I just
want to make sure everybody gets a shot first.
  Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  First, not to the panel, but on a talk show this morning one of
the commentators said that I was the source for the leak of the af-
fidavit. That is just absolutely false. I don't operate that way. I
have seen how leaks have damaged people, our colleagues. Senator
DeConcini suffered a great injustice because of a leak. And I just
want everyone to know that there is simply no truth to that. Nei-
ther I nor my staff leaked the documents.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator?
  Senator SIMON. Yes, sir?
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry. If it is on that matter, continue. But
before you get to questioning I want to ask the panel a question
about
  Senator SIMON. GO ahead.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have been on for a while now. Would you all
like to break--yes. I can see the heads shaking.
  Senator would you rather continue your questioning now or give
them a break and then question? How would you like to do it?
  Senator SIMON. The panel would like to take a break right now. I
will take my 5 minutes after the break, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will recess for 15 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come back to order.
  To explain to the witnesses what we are doing, we are trying to
figure out the remainder of the schedule. I emphasize again that
                                         315

Senator Thurmond and I are under strict time constraints placed
on us, understandably, by the entirety of the Senate, the leadership
in the Senate and the remainder of the Senate, to resolve this
entire matter in time for all of our colleagues to be able to consider
all the testimony here and make a judgment.

  As I have indicated at the outset, were this a trial, which is not,
all of you who are sitting as the panel members here know that
there would be a legitimate reason for this trial to go on for an-
other week or more. We do not have that luxury.

  The nominee insists on a resolution of it. The White House in-
sists on a resolution of it. And the Senate insists on a resolution of
it. So what we are attempting to do is work out not only a time
when we are going to vote on this on the Senate floor, which is
done 6 o'clock Tuesday night, but an agreement on an absolute end
time when these hearings will end.

  And I assure this panel, you will not have to be here till the end.
We are about to do that with you all now, and we will probably
recess very briefly after this panel is completed to discuss the final
witness list and the time frame within which each witness or panel
will be coming before the Committee.

  I thank the panel and I thank everyone in this room for their
indulgence, and I hope they understand. But based upon the knowl-
edge of the arcane processes of the Senate I am sure no one will
understand. But nonetheless, that is where we are.

  Now, where were we in questioning? Who was next?
  Senator Simon has 5 minutes.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, first, if I may comment on some-
thing said by Senator Specter just before my time came up. He
said, and I wrote it down, there were more than 11 calls, that only
11 were documented. To my knowledge, that is an inaccurate state-
ment.

  We know Judge Thomas
   Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, I said we would produce a wit-
ness who would testify to that. That there other calls, that 11 were
documented when he wasn't there, but we would produce a wit-
ness.
   So, if Senator Simon is going to quote me, please be accurate.
   Senator SIMON. Well, perhaps you know that there were more.
So far there has been nothing entered into the evidence suggesting
that there were more than 11 calls.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, has
the name of that witness been made available to the Committee as
a whole?
   Senator SIMON. Yes, that is Ms. Holt, who is the custodian of the
records
   The CHAIRMAN. MS. Holt. All right. Fine.
   Senator SPECTER [continuing]. And also the secretary, who is pre-
pared to testify that there were many more calls made by Professor
Hill which got through to Judge Thomas, so there was not a nota-
tion.
   The CHAIRMAN. But it is Ms. Holt we are talking about?
   Senator SPECTER. That is right.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
                                      316

  Senator SIMON. And let me just add that one or more of those
calls were made with great reluctance. We have evidence on that
also.

  Now, getting to the panel, and we will get to you here. Judge
Hoerchner, you said in your deposition you were asked:

  Question. "Did you see her press conference on television?"
  Answer. Yes, I did.
  Question: Did you find her to be credible?
  Answer. I saw most of it. Absolutely. If you knew Anita you couldn't doubt her
word on anything. I've never known her even to exaggerate. As you can tell from
what you've seen of her on television and in person, her style is understatement in
everything she does.

  Now, yesterday it was suggested by one of the Members of the
Senate that the fact that she did not document what was happen-
ing to her questions her credibility. I would be interested in any
reflections you might have, all four witnesses, on whether or not--
on the mater of documentation in that kind of a situation, and does
the fact that she did not document this in any way diminish her
credibility in your mind?

  Judge if we can call on you first.
  Judge HOERCHNER. Absence of documentation could never dimin-
ish Anita's credibility to those of us who have known her since
1977 and 1978. Documentation is usually in my experience some-
thing that someone would do who is contemplating a lawsuit. It
was always my impression that Anita had no intention to sue then
Mr. Thomas and that she has had no agenda vis-a-vis Judge
Thomas.
  Senator SIMON. MS. Wells?
  Ms. WELLS. The lack of documentation does not trouble me, Sena-
tor, because I think, as I tried to indicate to Senator Specter earli-
er, I don't see what a record would have accomplished. She knew
what was done to her.
  And furthermore, to put it down on paper, to say he said X to me
on Thursday, would have been no more evidence for us today than
anything else.
  Senator SIMON. And, of course, she didn't anticipate anything
like this.
  Ms. WELLS. NO. SO there was no reason. As the Judge said, she
wasn't thinking of bringing a suit.
  Senator SIMON. And, if I could relate it, it says to me that she
didn't intend to prosecute or carry on in that way.
  You have mentioned your own experience. Did you document
that in any way, writing it down in a diary or anything?
  Ms. WELLS. NO, I did not. It is just something that will always be
with me and so I have no need to write it down. I would like to
forget it and I cannot. So I would not want it to be anywhere
where it could be picked up and read by anyone.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Carr?
  Mr. CARR. I would echo that, I guess. But in addition, my recol-
lection of discussing these things with Anita Hill is that they were
very painful for her, and I think she did not want to, certainly,
talking about them with me, and she may well have wanted to
forget them, and that writing them down may, in fact, in and of
itself have been additionally painful for her.
                                         317

  Senator SIMON. Mr. Paul?
  Mr. PAUL. Senator, I would have to say as a lawyer that the ab-
sence of documentation is completely consistent with my recollec-
tion of her reluctance in wanting to discuss it and her statement
that she felt she had no recourse.
  Senator SIMON. If I may ask one more question, Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Briefly.
  Senator SIMON. Each of you has explained why you are here.
Why do you think Anita Hill came forward and testified?
  Judge HOERCHNER. She has said that she came forward out of a
sense of her obligation as a citizen. I think the incidents that oc-
curred those many years ago have raised a serious question of
character in someone who has been nominated for one of the most
important positions in the country.
  I know that she was very reluctant to come forward. I think she
felt she had a duty to her country.
  Senator SIMON. MS. Wells?
  Ms. WELLS. Well, I can only echo what the judge has said. Anita,
Professor Hill, is a very loyal person and therefore she is loyal to
what she believes she ought to do, and so therefore she has come
forward only because she felt that that was the right thing to do.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Carr?
  Mr. CARR. Senator, I can really only, I guess, speculate on it, on
why she has come forward. I would think my recollections of her
personality are that while she would like to come forward in this
manner she would be terrified of the invasion of privacy and she
would have been extremely hesitant.
  At the same time, I have the recollection that she is a forthright
person and when asked a question she feels compelled to give an
honest answer. And I would think here that she has somehow
found herself on the sort of proverbial slippery slope. That she has
felt obligated to make some statement when asked and that that
has snowballed totally out of control to the point where she had no
alternative but to come forward in a total and fulsome way.
  Senator SIMON. And, if I could ask you, and then I want to hear
from Mr. Paul, she is both a lawyer and a law professor. I assume
she has a very elevated feeling, as we all do, for the Supreme
Court.
  Do you think this was a factor in coming forward also?
  Mr. CARR. It may well have been that when she looked at the
price she would have to pay to do this that because it was the Su-
preme Court she viewed it as of such great importance that she
was willing to pay that price.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Paul.
  Mr. PAUL. Of course, I haven't discussed with Professor Hill, Sen-
ator, her reasons for coming forward, but I would imagine that if I
were in her situation, when asked the question by an agent of the
FBI, I would feel compelled to answer the question honestly as a
servant to the court.
  I cannot imagine anything that Professor Hill could think to
gain as a legal academician by coming forward. I think her career
has, frankly, probably suffered as a result of her coming forward. I
think that she had a very bright career. I think that if someone
had asked me a few weeks ago I would say that I could imagine
                                         318

Professor Hill coming before this Committee in a very different ca-
pacity, as a judicial nominee herself. I think her opportunities for
that now have been destroyed. I think she paid a big price for her
conscience.

  Senator SIMON. I thank you. And I thank all four of you for
coming forward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Senator Thurmond.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And thank
you for being here today, folks.
  Senator KENNEDY. I think it goes Senator Thurmond, and then,
Senator Kohl, I will recognize you.
  Senator KOHL. Oh, I am sorry.
  Senator THURMOND. I would like to ask you this question. From
your testimony, it appears that none of you four witnesses have
any personal knowledge of the charges made by Professor Hill
against Judge Thomas, and that all you know about the matter is
what Professor Hill told you. Is that correct?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I was not a precipitate witness, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. What was that?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I was not a precipitate witness.
  Senator THURMOND. What did she say?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I said that is correct.
  Senator THURMOND. MS. Wells.
  Ms. WELLS. That is correct, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Carr.
  Mr. CARR. It is correct. I was not in the room.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Paul.
  Mr. PAUL. That is true, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. That is all. Thank you very much.
  I yield the rest of my time to Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  When my time last expired, Judge Hoerchner, I was asking you
to refer to page 5 of your prior testimony before the staff. A ques-
tion where you said, at line 6, on page 5, "I did run into her very
briefly at a professional conference in 1984, late December."

  My question to you is did you, at that time, ask Professor Hill
anything about these alleged statements made by Judge Thomas?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I did not remember asking her that.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Hoerchner, can you be any more specific
than you have been about where you were at the time this conver-
sation occurred where you say Professor Hill made these state-
ments about Judge Thomas' comments? We have been trying to fix
the date. It would be helpful if you were able to at least say where
you lived at that time, in an effort to try to pin that down. Can you
help us on that?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Unfortunately as I have explained to the FBI
and here, I really cannot pin the date down. The one thing I can be
absolutely certain about is the fact that she was working for Clar-
ence Thomas at the time because she stated that she was experi-
encing sexual harassment from her boss, Clarence.
  Senator SPECTER. Can you, at least, tell us whether you were
living in Washington at the time you had that conversation with
her?
                                         319

  Judge HOERCHNER. I cannot pin down the date with any further
specificity.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Hoerchner, shifting over to the contacts
you had with other people at or about the time you called Professor
Hill on the day of Judge Thomas' nomination for the Supreme
Court, have you received a call from anyone prior to the time you
called Professor Hill asking her what she was going to do?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Absolutely not.
  Senator SPECTER. When did you have the first call, if any, from
any member of the news media?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I am trying to remember who called whom.
The first person from the news media with whom I spoke was Nina
Totenberg from National Public Radio and PBS.

  Senator SPECTER. What did she say to you?
  Judge HOERCHNER. That was after Anita had already spoken to
her. She just briefly asked me the same types of things that I had
been asked by the staff member of the Chairman.

  Senator SPECTER. And what did you respond?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I responded with essentially the same infor-
mation that I had given in my statement. I also asked her not to
use my name.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Hoerchner, you are not in a position to
corroborate Professor Hill's statement that Judge Thomas spoke
about acts that he had seen in pornographic films, are you?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I do not have an explicit memory of that.
   Senator SPECTER. Judge Hoerchner, are you in a position to cor-
roborate Professor Hill's statement that Judge Thomas talked to
her about such matters as women having sex with animals?

  Judge HOERCHNER. I do not have a memory of references of
women having sex with animals. But I do have a memory of her
telling me that he said to her, if we had any witnesses, you would
have a perfect case against me.

  Senator SPECTER. I understand that. What I am trying to do now
is to go through the real essence or gravamen or testimony which
Professor Hill gave against Judge Thomas to be sure that we un-
derstand you. Because as I understand it, you do not, but I want to
be sure, that you said you don't have, you can't corroborate her
claim that Judge Thomas spoke to her about pornographic films.
You can't corroborate Judge Thomas' statement about women
having sex, et cetera, as I just said.

   Can you corroborate her claim that Judge Thomas spoke about
pornographic materials depicting individuals with large sex
organs?

  Judge HOERCHNER. NO.
   Senator SPECTER. Can you corroborate her claim that Judge
Thomas spoke to her graphically about his own sexual prowess?
   Judge HOERCHNER. NO.
   Senator SPECTER. Can you corroborate her claim that Judge
Thomas spoke to her about the odd episode, or Judge Thomas par-
ticipated in the odd episode about drinking a coke with the allega-
tion of the pubic hair?
   Judge HOERCHNER. NO.
                                              320

   Senator SPECTER. MS. Wells, are you in a position to corroborate
Professor Hill's testimony that Judge Thomas spoke to her about
pornographic films?

   Ms. WELLS. NO, I am not.

   Senator SPECTER. Are you in a position to corroborate Professor
Hill's claim that Judge Thomas spoke to her about women having
sex, et cetera, with others than men?

   Ms. WELLS. NO.

   Senator SPECTER. Are you in a position to corroborate that he
talked about pornographic materials with large private parts?

   Ms. WELLS. NO, I am not.

   Senator SPECTER. Are you in a position to corroborate that Judge
Thomas talked to her about his own sexual prowess?

   Ms. WELLS. NO, I am not.

   Senator SPECTER. Or about the coke incident?

   Ms. WELLS. NO, I am not.

   Senator SPECTER. Mr. Carr, are you in a position to corroborate
any of that?

   Mr. CARR. Those are all consistent with the things she has told
me but I am not in a position to corroborate them specifically.

   Senator SPECTER. And, Professor Paul, are you in a position to
corroborate that Judge Thomas talked to Professor Hill about por-
nographic films?

   Mr. PAUL. NO.

  Senator SPECTER. About any of the specifics I have asked Ms.
Wells and Judge Hoerchner about?

   Mr. PAUL. All of that, Senator, would be consistent with sexual
harassment, but she did not talk to me--I don't recall that she
talked to me about any of those particulars.

   Senator SPECTER. Professor Paul, did you know prior to the time
these hearings started, that when Professor Hill accompanied
Judge Thomas from the Department of Education to EEOC that as
a matter of fact she had a classification at the Department of Edu-
cation that she could have stayed there?

  Mr. PAUL. NO, Senator.
   Senator SPECTER. Professor Paul, did you know that prior to the
time that this hearing started that Professor Hill had made at
least 11 calls which were recorded to Judge Thomas, and others un-
recorded?
   Mr. PAUL. NO, Senator.
   Senator SPECTER. Did you know, Professor Paul, that Professor
Hill drove Judge Thomas to the airport and was with him alone on
what occasion in Oklahoma City or Tulsa?
   Mr. PAUL. NO, Senator.
   Senator SPECTER. Did you know any of that, Mr. Carr?

   Mr. CARR. NO.

   Senator SPECTER. Did you know any of that, Ms. Wells?
   Ms. WELLS. NO, Senator.
   Senator SPECTER. Did you know any of that, Judge Hoerchner?
   Judge HOERCHNER. I didn't hear her testify about driving him to
the airport.
   Senator SPECTER. SO you didn't know about that?
  Judge HOERCHNER. NO, I did not know about that.
                                         321

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Hoerchner, if you had to vote on Judge
Thomas, yes or no, what would it be?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Senator, I don't have a vote here.
  Senator SPECTER. MS. Wells, if you had to vote yes, or no, on
Judge Thomas, what would it be?
  Ms. WELLS. Senator, the hearings are not over and you have
more witnesses for Anita Hill to hear and I think then you would
have a better understanding of her and why we are here saying
that her allegations are true.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Carr, if you had to vote yes or no on Judge
Thomas, what would it be?

  Mr. CARR. Senator, I have not followed the hearings earlier
before the Senate decided to delay, and so I can't make an in-
formed decision based on that, but I do believe the sexual harass-
ment charges, and I think he would have to be one incredible jurist
to get over my view that those are true. So I would vote, no.

  Senator SPECTER. Would you want to hear the rest of the testimo-
ny?

  Mr. CARR. I think if I was in the official position to make that
choice, then I would definitely hear the rest of the testimony.

  Senator SPECTER. Professor Paul, you have already testified that
when they came to you, you wouldn't sign the letter.

  Mr. PAUL. That's correct, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. DO you have an opinion today, would you vote
yes, or no on Judge Thomas?
  Mr. PAUL. If these allegations are proved true, Senator, I would
say that he is not fit for the Supreme Court.
  Senator SPECTER. But you would want to hear the rest of the evi-
dence?
  Mr. PAUL. Yes, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. SO that none of you is in a position, sitting
there today without hearing the rest of the evidence to reject Judge
Thomas solely on the basis of what Professor Hill has said?
  Mr. CARR. Sir, I am in a position to do that.
  Senator SPECTER. I thought you wanted to hear the rest of the
evidence, Mr. Carr.
  Mr. CARR. I said that I would--I think it would be incumbent
upon me to review all of the evidence, but that I have great diffi-
culty imagining that he could be such a great jurist as to justify
being confirmed in light of my belief that there was sexual harass-
ment.
   Senator SPECTER. NO further questions, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Senator Kohl.
   Senator KOHL. Thank you, very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Just to follow up on what Senator Specter has been asking you.
You are in a position, do I understand it, on the basis of your testi-
mony today, to state as a matter of fact that Professor Hill in-
formed you in a way that satisfied you that she was being sexually
harassed by Judge Thomas, by Clarence Thomas? Is there any
question in your mind about the clarity of the information that she
provided to you? The sense that she provided to you?
  Judge Hoerchner.
                                               322

  Judge HOERCHNER. There is no question in my mind that that
happened.

  Senator KOHL. In specific, did she tell you and corroborate to you
that he had asked her out on numerous occasions in a manner that
made her very uncomfortable and felt that she was being harassed?

  Judge HOERCHNER. Yes, she did.
  Senator KOHL. MS. Wells.
  Ms. WELLS. She did not get into that detail. She helped me to un-
derstand that she was the recipient of inappropriate and offensive
behavior in the office.
  Senator KOHL. Mr. Carr.
  Mr. CARR. My recollection, at the time, is that I believed her and
I believed her without question. Since recalling that conversation
and listening to and hearing much of the testimony here, I have
rethought that view, and I have racked my brain trying to under-
stand it. Having done that, I nonetheless come back to the same
position that I believe her.
  Mr. PAUL. There is no question in my mind, Senator, that she
told me she was sexually harassed by her supervisor at the EEOC
and I believed her then and I believe her still.
  Senator KOHL. Has she ever discussed with you being sexually
harassed by anybody else, any other supervisor?
  Mr. PAUL. NO, Senator.
  Senator KOHL. Any other evidence except this evidence with re-
spect to Clarence Thomas?
  Judge Hoerchner.
  Judge HOERCHNER. She has never done so. She has been very
poised in dealing with men and has had little trouble in laughing
off or brushing off unwelcome advances, but in a situation like this
where there is such a gross inequity in power she was not able to
do so to her satisfaction.
  Senator KOHL. MS. Wells, did she ever discuss with you sexual
harassment from anybody else?
  Ms. WELLS. NO, never, just concerning Judge Thomas.
  Senator KOHL. Mr. Carr.
  Mr. CARR. NO, she didn't, but to be fair, we only discussed for a
brief period of time. Our contact was over a limited period of time.
No.
  Senator KOHL. Judge Hoerchner, we have discussed today the
pain and suffering that Anita Hill has endured. I would like to ask
you from your vantage point, as a judge, do you have any comment
to make on the pain and the suffering that has been endured by
Judge Thomas' family here?
  Can you give us some insight, offer some words?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Yesterday Judge Thomas spoke here very elo-
quently about the pain that he has experienced. There is only one
person to blame for that pain, and I know no one who takes any
joy in his suffering. His suffering is very apparent. There is, howev-
er, only one person to blame. It is not the press. It is not the person
or persons who leaked the information. It is not Anita Hill. He is
suffering as a result of his own actions. And there is another
person who has been suffering much, much longer. She is suffering
now, she was suffering 10 years ago, and she is not suffering as a
result of her actions. And that person is Anita Hill.
                                               323

  Senator KOHL. Anybody else wish to comment on that?
  [No response.]
  Senator KOHL. One more question. This is 1991, that was 1981.
Do you have any comment on how you think that sexual harass-
ment might be approached in our society today compared to 10
years ago?
  Are we 10 years further ahead, or are we in the same place?
  How do you imagine a woman might handle a similar situation
today, Judge?
  Judge HOERCHNER. Senator, even today, a woman who is 23, 24
years old, as Anita was, just out of law school, working in a situa-
tion of such tremendous inequity of power, I really could not realis-
tically advise her that she would have adequate protection were
she to make a complaint.
  Senator KOHL. MS. Wells.
  Ms. WELLS. I think there is, to a certain extent, a greater sensi-
tivity among men about this, not overwhelming, but there is a
greater one. And so I have seen some progress to that extent. But if
there is anything that will help women deal with this, I think it is
the fact that women seem to rely so much more on one another
and have a better understanding that you can come together and
talk about this and the best thing to do is to talk about it and to
try to work together to resolve it, and to realize that you are not
the guilty party. And the sooner that you throw off that idea, the
sooner that you can get some healing and some closure to it.
  Senator KOHL. Mr. Carr, anything different today from 10 years
ago?
  If she would have called you today, versus 10 years ago and dis-
cussed her problem with you, what might you have recommended
differently today from 10 years ago?
  Mr. CARR. I am not sure how I would have differed today from
then. I may well, at this point, being 10 years older and having a
better sense of how my own career has gone and how careers do go,
on the one hand been extremely cautious in advising her about the
risk. On the other hand, upon reflection, I may have been more
supportive of her to take the risk.
  Mr. PAUL. Senator, as you know, the Supreme Court did not es-
tablish hostile work environment as a cause of action until 1987, I
believe, so that in that sense perhaps we have made some progress
in our understanding of the law. But I must admit, as a person who
does not teach in this area and is not familiar with the law in this
area, that 4 years ago when Anita Hill came to me and told me
this story and said that she felt she had no recourse at the EEOC, I
did not understand why. I think now, when I see what has hap-
pened to Professor Hill as a result of these hearings, as a result of
coming forward, I can better understand why victims of sexual har-
assment don't feel that they have any recourse.
  Senator KOHL. Well, I, too, want to thank you for coming here
today. I think you have given us dramatic evidence of what it is
like in our society today to be female and not powerful and not
wealthy, and still make an attempt to try and get by what the diffi-
culties are in many cases. In that respect, you have been very en-
lightening to me, I would like to hope to my colleagues, and to
many millions of Americans, so I thank you for being here today.
                                               324

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I really will be much less than
5 minutes.
  It is a very puzzling thing here for me. You are all lawyers, and
you are all lawyers telling us that the system does not work for
sexual harassment. What a curious and extraordinary thing. It is
1991, and these laws have been on the books for years, and Joe
Biden, our chairman, has been involved deeply in these issues. So
have many of us.
  Sexual harassment is talked about all over America, and you are
telling us as four lawyers that the system doesn't work, and this is
very troubling to me. Obviously we have a great deal to do. I
thought it worked. I thought if you went forward, that things took
place. A consultation takes place; supervisors; anonymous; and
these things take place. And you are saying just--it is like saying
the process doesn't work.
  I can understand why the chairman bridles. The process does
work, but you are telling us it doesn't, and I don't understand that,
in this day, in this city, that sexual harassment claims aren't done
in the way the statute was drawn, in the sense of a way to get
them expressed to protect both--both the victim and the harasser.
  Because here is a pattern--if there is a pattern, we are told
that--psychologically, of the victim and their response, and there is
also a pattern of the harasser. It is seldom a singular thing. And
that is the way it is, and that is what we are dealing with.
  And my question is this. I understood Ellen Wells very effective-
ly and passionately describes sexual harassment. Did you say--and
I am asking you, if I didn't hear, with all this going on--you said
you had been touched. Did you bring a claim of sexual harassment?
No, you said not. OK. I'm sorry.
  Judge Hoerchner, have you ever brought a claim of sexual har-
assment?
  Judge HOERCHNER. There was an incident of sexual harassment
where I now work, and the main victim of this contained it
through the internal system, and an investigation was done. I
spoke to the investigator and I wrote a statement which was not
sent to the decisionmaker in that instance, because the perpetrator
and his attorneys had worked out a settlement, the terms of which
are secret.
  Senator SIMPSON. But you were involved in that in some way?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I was involved in a very minor way.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I am not trying to be sinister. I was just
thinking if you were involved in it or you were helping someone
else with a sexual harassment charge, either as a counsel or friend,
I am wondering why you didn't help your closest friend, Anita Hill,
when she was faced with the same information, and why you didn't
give her that same counsel, and that is, "Do something."
  Judge HOERCHNER. YOU are making an unwarranted assumption.
  Senator SIMPSON. I am not trying to; I am just asking.
  Judge HOERCHNER. In this more recent situation I did not coun-
sel the person, and as I said, I did try to help Anita. I tried to help
                                             325

her by listening and providing comfort, and apparently there was
no comfort to be found.

  Senator SIMPSON. Would you have done it differently now, know-
ing what you know, than what you did then?

  Judge HOERCHNER. If I were dealing with Anita at her present
age, confidence, professional status, I would consider advising her
to do something or say something. To be frank, I don't remember
ever giving Anita advice about anything in my life.

  Senator SIMPSON. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  I have a few questions, and there are still some more, if you are
prepared. Let me ask each of you to answer each of these ques-
tions, if you would.
  Did Professor Hill ever complain to you that any other employer
she had or anyone else other than the nominee had harassed her
or had made unwanted sexual advances toward her, had asked her
for a date, anything? Can anyone? Let's just go down the list.
Judge?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I will just repeat essentially the same thing
that I said the last time I was asked that question. No, she has
never complained of that. She was very poised and very capable of
brushing off or laughing off unwanted sexual advances. In this sit-
uation, in part I am sure because of the great disparity in power,
she was not able to successfully do that.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Wells.
   Ms. WELLS. She has never described to me a situation similar to
this or any way remotely similar to this, in terms of a work situa-
tion where a supervisor or a superior was making unwelcome ad-
vances.
   The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Carr.
   Mr. CARR. NO, Senator.
   The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Paul.
   Mr. PAUL. NO, Senator.
   The CHAIRMAN. NOW have any of you ever known, under any cir-
cumstances--and you are under oath--has there been any circum-
stance in your relationship at any time with Professor Hill where
you have known her to lie? Judge?
   Judge HOERCHNER. Absolutely not.
   Ms. WELLS. Never.
   Mr. CARR. Never.
   Mr. PAUL. Absolutely not.
   The CHAIRMAN. And it is an obvious question, but do any of you
have any reason to believe, because there have been a lot of no-
tions proffered here as to whether Professor Hill, who has obvious-
ly made an impression of sincerity on the committee as well as
many other people, is doing anything other than simply telling the
truth? Judge Thomas has come across as very forceful and sincere
in his denials. Do you have any reason to believe that any of the
reasons that have been offered here, raised here, suggested here
over the last several days as you have watched this, amount to any-
thing other than she is simply telling the truth and the facts as
they occurred? Anyone?
   Mr. PAUL. Senator, if there were any desire on the part of Profes-
sor Hill for some sort of advancement in the profession of legal
                                         326

education, this whole proceeding was not the way to advance her
career. She had tremendous opportunities. I feel confident that
there were many law schools in this country that would have been
happy to have offered Professor Hill a position, prior to this pro-
ceeding. She chose to stay where she was because she wanted to be
close to her family.

  The CHAIRMAN. DO any of you, anyone else, have any reason?
For example, does anybody have any reason to believe--and again,
you are under oath--that, as has been suggested by some here,
there is a possibility that Professor Hill is fantasizing? Is there
anything in her background or character, in any aspect of your re-
lationship with her, that would lead you to believe--and remem-
ber, you are under oath--that she is possibly fantasizing about
what happened?

  Ms. WELLS. She is one of the most truthful people that I know.
She is not one subject to bouts of fantasy. At best, she might be a
little sentimental, but to make up a story, for what purpose? To
bring this kind of public exposure to herself, it would not be in
character.

  Mr. CARR. Senator, I certainly would echo that there is absolute-
ly nothing in her character, as I recall, and that the things in her
character that I do recall would not support the notion that she
would fantasize.

  The CHAIRMAN. What in her character do you recall that would
not support the notion that she would fantasize?

  Mr. CARR. My recollection is that she is a very level-headed and
factual person.

  The CHAIRMAN. There has been suggested here the possibility
that--and I know this has been raised, but I want it on the
record--that she might be so ambitious that although. Professor
Paul, she would not be looking to advance her career this way, she
might be looking to advance her financial situation by being able
to turn this into a book or a movie. That has been suggested by
some here. Is there anything in her character that would lead you
to believe that is a possibility?

  Mr. PAUL. Senator, as I said earlier, I believe that the only book
Professor Hill has any interest in writing would be a book on the
Uniform Commercial Code. She is a private person, as has been tes-
tified already. I can't imagine her wanting to reopen this episode.
She was so reluctant in her discussions with me. And, moreover,
once again going back 4 years ago in our discussion, there is no
conceivable, possible gain or advantage she could have imagined 4
years ago, in a discussion in a university cafeteria about her
coming to work at my university, in telling me then that she left
the EEOC because she was sexually harassed by her supervisor.

  The CHAIRMAN. I would like each of you to answer the question.
  Mr. CARR. I can only imagine that the rationale for wanting to
write a book would be fame or money, and I do not think those are
significant motivations for Anita Hill. I don't believe she would
have made the career choices she has made with the hope of soire-
how cashing in at some late date in her life. I think if she was mo-
tivated by money, she would have made different career choices.
  The CHAIRMAN. Are you a partner in your law firm?

   Mr. CARR. I am.
                                                    327

  The CHAIRMAN. Without naming your law firm, how large is
your law firm?

  Mr. CARR. About 430 lawyers; about 100 partners.
  The CHAIRMAN. Would Anita Hill have any difficulty getting a
job with your law firm?
   Mr. CARR. Today she might, but I think that is a reference to the
economic times, but I have no doubt she would have--I don't think
she would have any difficulty getting a job at a major law firm,
either in New York or in some other city.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Wells, with regard to the question of writing
a book, is there anything in her background? Did she ever indicate
to you that, "Boy, I saw such-and-such a story, they could turn that
into a mini-series," or anything?
   Ms. WELLS. There is nothing. I wouldn't even be tempted to say
that she was particularly romantic in outlook. By that I mean, she
is not even the type, as I know her, to want to sit down and talk
about the latest best-seller, and get into the characterizations there
and talk about how this character appeals to you, as though that
individual were real. I don't even think she likes soap operas.
   The CHAIRMAN. Does she enjoy, like some men and women do,
gossip?
   Ms. WELLS. We never gossip. She and I never gossip, so I can't
speak to that. I mean, we knew many of the same people, and we
never sat around talking about them and gloating over juicy tid-
bits. That wasn't in her nature.
   The CHAIRMAN. Judge, it has been suggested by some, as well,
that she may just be a very malleable person. It was clearly sug-
gested yesterday, at least as one possibility, that she had an ideo-
logical bent that was inconsistent with the nominee, she felt
strongly about that, and that she found herself placed in the hands
of interest groups who used her like putty to accomplish this ideo-
logical end that she felt was important to accomplish and they felt
was important to accomplish.
   Is she that malleable a person, or is there anything in her char-
acter--and again you are under oath--in your knowledge of her, to
indicate to you that she is someone that is that malleable or so in-
clined?
   Judge HOERCHNER. Well, as I testified just a moment ago, I have
never given her advice, and the reason is that she is so independ-
ent and that I respect her judgment so much that I would not pre-
sume to advise her. I cannot imagine a force that could take her
and use her as a malleable object.
   The CHAIRMAN. I say to my colleagues, I know my time is up, I
only have two more questions. It may be useful for me to finish
them, if that is all right, and then move on to anyone else who may
have questions.
   I would like to ask a question of Mr. Carr and Mr. Paul. Mr.
Paul, Professor Paul, at the university did you find her one that
was malleable, that shrank from intellectual combat, that was
easily able to have her opinions formed? I mean, is there any evi-
dence of that?
   Mr. PAUL. I would not describe her as shrinking from an argu-
ment, no, Senator.
   The CHAIRMAN. HOW would you describe her?
                                                    328

  Mr. PAUL. My impression is that she is a very strong person. I
think my impression of her is that she feels very deeply about her
own being. She has a strong sense of roots, a strong sense of who
she is and what she is, perhaps based on her religious upbringing,
and she doesn't shrink from anything.

  The CHAIRMAN. Notwithstanding the fact that maybe a more
senior professor who is sitting having a discussion on a legal point,
she is not the kind who would yield her opinion to an ad hominem
argument?

  Mr. PAUL. That is correct, Senator. The summer that she was vis-
iting at our school was the summer of Judge Bork's nomination to
the Supreme Court. If you recall, that was a very controversial
nomination.

  The CHAIRMAN. I had forgotten that. [Laughter.]
  I would like to forget that.
  Mr. PAUL. Members of my faculty were, I would say, mostly op-
posed to the nomination, and in defending Judge Bork as she did at
that time, she could not have thought she was advancing her op-
portunities to return to our school. She did so. She did so eloquent-
ly. She did so with tremendous force and conviction.

  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Carr, on the same point, is she strong-
willed? Is she malleable? Was she someone who yielded to intellec-
tual or any other kind of pressure?

  Mr. CARR. I would not call her malleable. I don't recall strenuous
intellectual debate with her.

  The CHAIRMAN. I guess that wasn't what you had in mind.
[Laughter.]

  I don't mean that in a bad way. I wasn't trying to be facetious. I
mean, there was a different relationship you had. I should drop
this. [Laughter.]

  Senator HATCH. Yes, you should drop that.
  The CHAIRMAN. I should drop that part. You understand what I
mean. I am being very serious. I mean, was there anything in her
character that would lead you to believe that groups or individuals
could use her for their advantage, to promote another cause? That
is what I am trying to get at because that is what has been raised
here. It has been flatly suggested that is what happened.
  Mr. CARR. I don't believe that that would be possible. My recol-
lections of Anita are that she had some fundamental, basic beliefs
about what was right and what was wrong, and I would venture to
guess that these kinds of sexual accusations were clearly wrong,
and that she was not expedient or willing to subvert or change her
views inconsistent with the way they in fact were.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have one last area to cover. Did any of you
attend her going-away party that was, we have heard testified to
here, at the EEOC when she decided she was going to leave?
  Ms. WELLS. I attended a going-away party at the Sheraton-Carle-
ton.
  The CHAIRMAN. Was that the going-away party, do you recall?
What was the purpose of the going-away party?
  Ms. WELLS. Well, she was saying good-bye to her friends here.
  The CHAIRMAN. TO go to where?
  Ms. WELLS. TO Oral Roberts.
                                         329

  The CHAIRMAN. TO go to Oral Roberts University. Were there
anyone else at that party among the four of you?

  Judge HOERCHNER. No, she did tell me about it later.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO any of you know a Mr. Doggett, John Dog-
gett?
  Judge HOERCHNER. NO.

   Ms. WELLS. NO.

  Mr. CARR. I went to business school with John Doggett, and I
would consider him a friend.

  The CHAIRMAN. DO you know, did John Doggett ever indicate to
you that he went out with, wanted to go out or thought that Ms.
Hill wanted him to go out with her?

  Mr. CARR. NO, I don't.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have no further questions now.
  Senator THURMOND. On our side, I don't believe anyone else
except Senator Grassley.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Brown?
  Senator BROWN. Senator Specter had none and Senator Brown
had none, and the rest of them have none, except Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, maybe it is more of a comment than a
question.
  The lawyers on the committee refer you to you folks as corrobo-
rating witnesses, and I guess, as I understand it, you are supposed
to confirm what Professor Hill has alleged about Judge Thomas.
There is no doubt in my mind that you folks are telling the truth,
so I don't raise any fault with that, that you are telling us what
Professor Hill told you.

  But it seems to me that, in this role, you do not confirm any
sexual harassment by Judge Thomas of Professor Hill. Of course,
you couldn't give any details about what Professor Hill says hap-
pened to her, because she didn't give you any of these details. I
have sat here and listened to you, I haven't heard of any details, so
it would be very helpful to us, if you could provide confirmation of
details that she discussed Friday.

  I also find it surprising that you didn't really offer any advice to
her, but Senator Simpson covered that point.

  It seems to me that someone as forthright and independent as
Professor Hill would have given some details, if they really had
them. It just doesn't make sense that she simply told her friends or
acquaintances that she was being harassed at work, and that's it,
that's it. It just doesn't seem to fit.

  I have one question, which does not follow up on that. Senator
Specter asked--and I guess I would ask everybody but Mr. Carr
this. Senator Specter asked if you would vote for Judge Thomas. I
want to know if you want to see Judge Thomas on the Supreme
Court. And I would start with you, Judge Hoerchner.

  Judge HOERCHNER. Senator, I am only here to tell the truth
about what I was told back in the early 1980's. You have heard the
truth today, and it is up to you to decide what to do with it.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Ellen Wells?
   Ms. WELLS. I echo what the judge says. I am here to give you this
information that I know to be the truth, and for me to sit here and
to say what my personal opinions may be about Judge Thomas'
                                             330

qualifications for the Supreme Court, I think would not be appro-
priate, it would not answer to what I am here for.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Professor Paul?
  Mr. PAUL. Senator, as a legal scholar and an attorney, I have
been asked the question many times prior to these allegations,
whether or not Judge Thomas should be confirmed. I did not take a
position then, I am not taking a position now. I am simply here to
tell the truth about what I was told by Professor Hill 4 years ago,
that she was sexually harassed by her supervisor at the EEOC.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, you said you didn't sign the letter. I am
kind of puzzled. If you have reason to believe that Judge Thomas is
a sexual harasser or guilty of sexual harassment, why wouldn't you
sign a letter against him?
  Mr. PAUL. First of all, Senator, I was asked to sign a letter prior
to these allegations. Second of all, Senator, I believe that Professor
Hill told me the truth in 1987, but I believe that you, Senator, and
the other members of this committee sitting here trying to deter-
mine the facts should wait to hear all the evidence, before making
a determination.
  As I said in response to Senator Simpson's question, if Judge
Thomas, in fact, committed the acts alleged, then I don't think he
should be confirmed. If he did not commit the acts alleged, I have
no position.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I guess maybe I can't go any further and ask
you further, if you don't want to answer my questions, but I can at
least tell you why I asked. As I understand lawyers, you take an
oath to uphold the Constitution in practicing your profession, Pro-
fessor Paul. You are a student of the Constitution and of the Su-
preme Court decisions. It seems to me like people in your position
ought to have a personal view of whether or not Judge Thomas
ought to be on the Supreme Court and that you would welcome an
opportunity to express it, and that you would think that, for a
nonlawyer like me, it would be important for me to know it to de-
termine whether or not you have got any bias.

  Mr. PAUL. Senator, I didn't have the opportunity during the
original round of hearings to review the record, but if you would
like me to review the record, I will be happy to come back and
present you with my opinion. [Laughter.]

  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I would note, on the question of
whether Mr. Paul, because he is a lawyer and has taken an oath as
a lawyer, should be able to tell us how to vote on this. There are
only 100 people in this country who have taken an oath that re-
quires them to vote on this confirmation, and 14 of them are here.
We are the only ones who must state an opinion. I don't want to
leave any kind of impression out there that, simply because some-
body is a lawyer, they must have an opinion on whether Judge
Thomas goes on the Supreme Court or not. There are only 100
people who have taken the oath of office that requires them to vote
on it.
  Judge Hoerchner, without going into everybody's testimony, you
said you came here to tell the truth and that we should use that
                                         331

truth. None of you said you saw the activity. The nature of the ac-
tivity is such that nobody would have. But each of you has testified
that, years ago, Anita Hill came to you and told you of that. I just
remind everybody who is watching these proceedings that corrobo-
ration is this: The woman who is sexually harassed is not going to
go and tell you people about it, so that some day, 9 or 10 years
later, you would be in this room to tell about it. But you are, and
we will use your testimony.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator HATCH. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch wants to say
something.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Let me just ask you, Professor Paul--I have de-
liberately stayed out of asking any questions, but I have been in-
trigued--when Professor Hill chatted with you, did she seem upset
when she was chatting with you?
  Mr. PAUL. Yes, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Bitter?
  Mr. PAUL. NO, I wouldn't describe her as bitter.
  Senator HATCH. But upset?
  Mr. PAUL. Yes, Senator, she was embarrassed.
  Senator HATCH. And she was not very happy with the person
who did this to her, whoever it was?
  Mr. PAUL. I would hesitate to express an opinion on that, Sena-
tor.
  Senator HATCH. Well, how would you appraise her demeanor?
  Mr. PAUL. I would appraise it by saying that she was embar-
rassed that I had raised the subject by asking her why she had left
the EEOC, and she responded to my direct question, I guess honest-
ly--that is my assessment--and she was embarrassed that I had
brought it up.
  Senator HATCH. This was in 1987?
  Mr. PAUL. Correct, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. OK. That's all.
  Senator THURMOND. I guess we are through with the panel, Mr.
Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, we're not, we have two over here that wish
to ask questions.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, if I could have the attention of
Senator Specter here, there was a discussion about how many
phone calls were made, and he said Ms. Holt's deposition indicates
that more than 11 calls were made. If he will look at the deposi-
tion, on page 32, line 15, the question is asked, "Do you recall any
other times that Anita Hill called, where you did not note that on
the telephone log? Answer: I don't."
  On page 44, line 20:

  You mentioned the Vice Chairman showed you three or maybe more pages. Do
you have a recollection of Ms. Anita Hill calling Clarence Thomas any more times
than may have sporadically shown up on three such pages? Answer: I would not
even guess about that. I don't know.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                              332

   Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, I am advised that Ms. Holt will
appear as a witness and testify that there were other calls made by
Professor Hill. On the first citation where Senator Simon has read
the record, which I am having pulled and will review, it was relat-
ed to recordings which I think referred to occasions when Judge
Thomas was not present. But she is up in the next panel, and we
will soon see.

   Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman?
   The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Wyoming.
   Senator SIMPSON. I have one further question of Judge
Hoerchner.
   The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, does the Senator yield?
   Senator BROWN. I Kohl. I yield.
   Senator SIMPSON. Oh, I'm sorry.
   The CHAIRMAN. I apologize. The interruptions--they are not
interruptions. The reason that I am occasionally turning around is
because of this constant administrative question as to who comes
on next and how in timing, and that is why the minority and ma-
jority staff, when I turn around, it is not for lack of input from my
colleagues questioning.
   The Senator from Wyoming.
   Senator SIMPSON. Judge Hoerchner, I asked you if you had ever
filed a charge of sexual harassment. I don't think you indicated to
me that you had.
  Judge HOERCHNER. That's correct.
   Senator SIMPSON. I have a record from California, in Norwalk
County or Norfolk County, CA, that you did file a claim against a
fellow judge, a man named Judge Foster. Is that correct?
  Judge HOERCHNER. I was not sure how far in the proceedings
that went. It was my understanding that he had negotiated a set-
tlement. I was told that my statement was never taken up to the
home office of our board, so
   Senator SIMPSON. But you did file a claim of sexual harassment
against a fellow judge within your system?
   Judge HOERCHNER. I cannot say that I didn't. I did not fill out
any papers. It's possible that the result of my having spoken to the
investigator was taken as filing a claim within our system, and in
that case it would be correct.
   Senator SIMPSON. But he did eventually resign and the process of
his resignation and the activities around that were rather widely
publicized within that county, weren't they?
   Judge HOERCHNER. The terms of the settlement were secret, were
supposed to be secret. I am not aware of the full extent of them.
   Senator SIMPSON. Again, I am interested only in your intent to
do those things and you feel strongly about it, and I am wondering
why that counsel was not given to your friend.
   Judge HOERCHNER. Senator Kohl, did you have
   Senator KOHL. Yes, just one quick question.
   Yesterday, Judge Thomas said that there was a plot afoot in this
country to derail his nomination to the Supreme Court. As I hear
your comments today, it is obvious to me that if there was as plot
afoot, it must have originated 10 years ago. So, do you think that
Anita Hill plotted for as long as 10 years ago to derail Judge
Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court?
                                             333

  Judge HOERCHNER. I think that would have been impossible.
  Ms. WELLS. The same, Senator, that would have been impossible
and unthinkable.
  Mr. CARR. I don't think that is possible.
  Mr. PAUL. NO, Senator, she would be not only deserving of an
Academy Award, but she would be a prophet.
  Senator KOHL. But he yesterday did, as you know, if you followed
his testimony, he made a very, very big point of stating that what
was happening here was that there was as huge plot among Anita
Hill and others to see to it that he never achieved his nomination.
Are you saying that you regard that sort of an analysis on his part
to be almost out of the question?
  Ms. WELLS. Senator, I would like to point out that the members
of this panel met when they walked into this room, so in order for
us to have been part of a conspiracy or a plot, we needed to have
met one another at some point to get our facts straight and what-
ever, and we did not have that opportunity.
  Mr. PAUL. That's correct, Senator.
  Judge HOERCHNER. That is correct.
  Mr. CARR. I agree with that.
  Mr. PAUL. That's correct, Senator, we don't know each other.
  Senator KOHL. You've never met before you met here today?
  Mr. PAUL. I've never met any of these people before.
  Mr. CARR. We met yesterday.
  Judge HOERCHNER. Yesterday, when we walked into the hearing
room.
  Senator KOHL. Yesterday was the first time?
  Ms. WELLS. That's correct.
  Judge HOERCHNER. Right.
  Senator KOHL. Thank you very much.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Chairman, any other questions?
  Senator THURMOND. NO.
  The CHAIRMAN. There being none, I want to thank this panel
very, very much. We kept you a long time, over 5 hours.
  We are now going to recess for 5 minutes, but I want to call the
next panel witnesses to come forward while we do this. The next
panel will be J.C. Alvarez, Nancy Fitch, Diane Holt and Phyllis
Berry Myers.
  We will reconvene in 5 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Ladies and gentlemen, I thank the panel. I know
they had to take a little break while we were taking a break, we
had them sitting there so long.
  Let me indicate what the committee has agreed upon as to how
we are going to proceed from now to the moment we end this hear-
ing. And let me reiterate the constraint under which the Senate
has placed this committee.
  For those who don't know the Senate rules, which are, hopefully,
100 percent of the American people, there has been essentially a
motion to recommit here; that is, we have been instructed by the
Senate as a whole to take this matter back to the full committee,
given a specific time constraint that we report back to the Senate
as a whole on this specific issue, the allegation relating to sexual
                                             334

harassment; we have all our testimony in and concluded, so that
there are 24 hours in which our colleagues can have time to recon-
sider or consider this matter; and there is a vote scheduled, by
unanimous consent of the Senate, to take place at 6 o'clock on
Tuesday night.

  What we were taking our time doing a moment ago is deciding
on how we were going to specifically accommodate the rights and
interests of all the parties, in particular the nominee, and meet the
requirement of the Senate. And this is what we have agreed upon,
majority and minority.

  We are going to proceed tonight with potentially all of the fol-
lowing panels, but with no more than, no one additional other than
the people I am about to read. The distinguished panel that sits
before us, and has been sitting before us very patiently.

  When that panel is finished, there will be a panel that will be
made up of up to three people, maybe fewer--made up of David
Swank, Kim Taylor, and Sonya Jarvis. It may be fewer than that,
but it can be up to those three people.

  The next panel after that will be made up of Stanley Grayson,
Carlton Stewart, John N. Doggett, III, or Charles Kothe, the Dean
of Oral Roberts. That is the maximum number of people who will
appear on the panel. None of them have to appear. But that is the
maximum that can appear.

  And then there will be an additional panel of nine individuals,
all of whom worked for Clarence Thomas, all women who wish to
come and testify to how he related to them: Patricia Johnson,
Pamela Talkin--T-a-1-k-i-n, Janet Brown, Ricky Silberman,
Connie Newman, Linda Jackson, Nancy Altman, Anna Jenkins,
Lori Saxon. They will each have 3 minutes to make whatever state-
ment they wish to make on behalf of the nominee. There will be 32
minutes remaining in the time they will be allowed to be on the
stand. Sixteen minutes will be divided on each side for cross-exami-
nation, if there is any cross-examination.

  Then we will bring forward, if it is the decision of the witness to
want to come forward, and that is not fully decided yet, Ms. Angela
Wright. We are talking with Ms. Wright now, the committee as a
whole, majority and minority. Ms. Angela Wright.

  After Ms. Angela Wright there will be, if it is decided by any of
member of the committee to call this individual, a Ms. Rose
Jordan, who allegedly--I emphasize allegedly--can corroborate the
testimony of Angela Wright. Staffs have taken her deposition. It
will be reviewed by members of the committee, majority and mi-
nority. If the deposition taken by the majority and minority is suf-
ficient, that will suffice. If not, any member can call that individ-
ual forward for cross-examination.

  We will then end tonight. If that takes till 9, 11, 12, or 4 in the
morning, that will be done.

  Tomorrow we will reconvene at 10 o'clock. Professor Anita Hill
will have the right, if she so chooses, to come back at 10 a.m. She
will be able to testify and/or be cross-examined up until 2 p.m.
Whether or not her statement is finished, whether or not the cross-
examination is finished, we will politely excuse her. She cannot
remain beyond 2 o'clock.
                                      335

  At 2 o'clock the nominee, if he so chooses, will come forward. He
will be able to say whatever he wishes and/or be cross-examined or
examined on direct up until 6 o'clock.

  At 6 o'clock p.m. tomorrow this committee shuts down. Period.
  There is no requirement, as a matter of fact, we are explicitly
asked by the Senate as a whole not to vote on this matter. It will
be left to the Senate. This committee has already voted on Clar-
ence Thomas. The transcripts of this committee proceeding will be
made available almost immediately to every Member of the U.S.
Senate. They will have 24 hours to make any judgment they wish
to make and determine whether or not what has transpired here
the previous 4 days influences their vote one way or another.
  Any Senator can go to the Senate floor after 6 p.m., if the Senate
is in, and I don't know whether it is in or not--but if the Senate is
in, up until 6 p.m. on Tuesday, for as long as the Senate is in up to
that point, and say anything they want about anything having to
do with this matter, whether they wish to go in and say Cock
Robin told them the following happened or a little bird dropped in
from the blue and gave me this affidavit. But that is not the busi-
ness of the committee.
  So, I want to turn to my distinguished colleague from South
Carolina and ask him whether or not what I related is in fact what
the majority, overwhelming majority of the committee voted to do?
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I think you have stated it
correctly. The only thing, if you wish to bring Ms. Wright here, you
have that right. And we will have a chance to cross-examine her.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is absolutely correct.
  Senator THURMOND. But we object to any statement by her, or
affidavit, being put in the record without cross-examination.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is absolutely correct. No affidavits at all
will be placed in this record from now until the time the committee
completes its responsibility.
  Is there anyone on the committee that has heard what I have
said that disagrees with what I laid out as being the majority will
of the committee?
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes?
  Senator SIMPSON. I believe there was one further addendum.
That there would be no closing statements.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct. There will be no closing state-
ments by any member on the committee.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania?
  Senator SPECTER. I would just like the record to note my dissent.
  The CHAIRMAN. The record will note the dissent of the distin-
guished Senator from Pennsylvania as to the manner in which we
have otherwise I believe unanimously
  Senator BROWN. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes?
  Senator BROWN. I would also like my dissent noted.
  The CHAIRMAN. Dissent as to all of it or--well, never mind. It
doesn't matter. Senator, I don't mean that flippantly. I mean it is
not worth going back into
  Senator BROWN. Sure.
                                               336

  The CHAIRMAN. The committee voted 12 to 2 to proceed as I have
outlined, with the dissents noted. Obviously, everyone else other
than Senator Specter and Senator Brown, voted affirmatively to
proceed as I have stated.

  Now, thank you all for your patience. That is the unanimous
consent agreement that has just been agreed to. Ladies and gentle-
men, let us proceed.

  I thank this panel for their absolute patience here. You have
been very gracious.

  And there will be no dinner break, I say to our friends in the
press. There will be no break, other than occasionally requiring, if
the witnesses are here longer than their constitutions would war-
rant, we will break for that purpose.

  And I say to the panel, if you have any preferred order of pro-
ceeding--why don't we begin by first swearing you all in?

  Do you all swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth
and the whole truth, so help you, God.

   Ms. ALVAREZ. I do.
   Ms. FITCH. I do.
   Ms. HOLT. I do.
   Ms. BERRY. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. I was just, as usual, properly corrected by my
colleague. I should have said instead of the truth and the whole
truth, the truth and nothing but the truth. But we understand
what you all just swore to.

  Now, why don't we begin then, if you have no preferred order,
with Ms. Alvarez and work our way across. Or either way. Do you
have a preference?

  There being none, we will start with Ms. Alvarez. And welcome
back. I know you were here, it seems like 100 years ago, but not too
long ago.

  I have been instructed by my colleague from South Carolina to
ask you if you can keep your statements to 3 minutes because
there is going to be a lot of questions of you.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, Mr. Chairman, that was your--I think
that it was agreed that there would be a 3-minute limit.

  The CHAIRMAN. I think that is correct. Five minutes.
  Senator THURMOND. That was the last panel. Excuse me. I was in
error on that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Keep your statements to 5 minutes, if you would,
and then we will begin the questions.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I will do the best I can.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very, very much.

TESTIMONY OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF J.C. ALVAREZ, RIVER
  NORTH DISTRIBUTING, CHICAGO, IL; NANCY E. FITCH, PHILA-
  DELPHIA, PA; DIANE HOLT, MANAGEMENT ANALYST, OFFICE
  OF THE CHAIRMAN, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COM-
  MISSION, WASHINGTON, DC; AND PHYLLIS BERRY-MYERS, AL-
  EXANDRIA, VA

                        TESTIMONY OF J.C. ALVAREZ
  Ms. ALVAREZ. My name is J.C. Alvarez. I am a businesswoman
from Chicago. I am a single mom, raising a 15-year-old son, run-
ning a business. In many ways, I am just a John Q. Public from
Middle America, not unlike a lot of the people watching out there
and not unlike a lot of your constituents.
  But the political world is not a world that I am unfamiliar with.
1 spent 9 years in Washington, DC. A year with Senator Danforth,
2 years with the Secretary of Education, a short stint at the Feder-
al Emergency Management Agency, and 4 years as Special Assist-
ant to Clarence Thomas at the EEOC.
  Because of this past political experience, I was just before this
committee a couple of weeks ago speaking in support of Clarence
Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I was then and I still
am in favor of Clarence Thomas being on the Supreme Court.
  When I was asked to testify the last time, I flew to Washington,
DC, very proud and happy to be part of the process of nominating a
Supreme Court Justice. When I was sitting here before you last
time, I remember why I had liked working in Washington, DC, so
much--the intellectual part of it, the high quality of the debate.
Although I have to admit when I had to listen to some of your
questioning and postulating and politicking, I remembered why I
had left. And I thought at that point that certainly I had seen it
all.
  After the hearings, I flew back to Chicago, back to being John Q.
Public, having a life very far removed from this political world,
and it would have been easy to stay away from politics in Washing-
ton, DC. Like most of your constituents out there, I have more than
my share of day-to-day challenges that have nothing to do with
Washington, DC, and politics. As I said before, I am a single mom,
raising a teenager in today's society, running a business, making
ends meet--you know, soccer games, homework, doing laundry,
paying bills, that is my day-to-day reality.
  Since I left Washington, DC, I vote once every 4 years for Presi-
dent and more frequently for other State and local officials. And I
could have remained outside of the political world for a long, long
time and not missed it. I don't need this. I needed to come here like
I needed a hole in the head. It cost me almost $900 just for the
plane ticket to come here, and then there is the hotel and other
expenses. And I can assure you that especially in these recession-
ary times I have got lots of other uses for that money.
  So why did I come? Why didn't I just stay uninvolved and apoliti-
cal? Because, Senators, like most real Americans who witness a
crime being committed, who witness an injustice being done, I
could not look the other way and pretend that I did not see it. I
had to get involved.
                                         338

   In my real life, I have walked down the street and seen a man
beating up a woman and I have stepped in and tried to stop it. I
have walked through a park and seen a group of teenage hoodlums
taunting an old drunk man and I have jumped in the middle of it. I
don't consider myself a hero. No, I am just a real American from
Middle America who will not stand by and watch a crime being
committed and walk away. To do so would be the beginning of the
deterioration of society and of this great country.

  No, Senators, I cannot stand by and watch a group of thugs beat
up and rob a man of his money any more than I could have stayed
in Chicago and stood by and watched you beat up an innocent man
and rob him blind. Not of his money. That would have been too
easy. You could pay that back. No, you have robbed a man of his
name, his character, and his reputation.

  And what is amazing to me is that you didn't do it in a dark
alley and you didn't do it in the dark of night. You did it in broad
daylight, in front of all America, on television, for the whole world
to see. Yes, Senators, I am witnessing a crime in progress and I
cannot just look the other way. Because I am John Q. Public and I
am getting involved.

  I know Clarence Thomas and I know Anita Hill. I was there
from the first few weeks of Clarence coming to the Commission. I
had the office next to Anita's. We all worked together in setting
and executing the goals and the direction that the Chairman had
for the EEOC. I remember Chris Roggerson, Carlton Stewart,
Nancy Fitch, Barbara Parris, Phyllis Berry, Bill Ng, Allyson
Duncan, Diane Holt--each of us with our own area of expertise
and responsibility, but together all of us a part of Clarence Thom-
as's hand-picked staff.

  I don't know how else to say it, but I have to tell you that it just
blew my mind to see Anita Hill testifying on Friday. Honest to
goodness, it was like schizophrenia. That was not the Anita Hill
that I knew and worked with at EEOC. On Friday, she played the
role of a meek, innocent, shy Baptist girl from the South who was
a victim of this big, bad man.

  I don't know who she was trying to kid. Because the Anita Hill
that I knew and worked with was nothing like that. She was a very
hard, tough woman. She was opinionated. She was arrogant. She
was a relentless debater. And she was the kind of woman who
always made you feel like she was not going to be messed with, like
she was not going to take anything from anyone.

  She was aloof. She always acted as if she was a little bit superior
to everyone, a little holier than thou. I can recall at the time that
she had a view of herself and her abilities that did not seem to be
based in reality. For example, it was sort of common knowledge
around the office that she thought she should have been Clarence's
chief legal advisor and that she should have received better assign-
ments.

  And I distinctly remember when I would hear about her feeling
that way or when I would see her pout in office meetings about as-
signments that she had gotten, I used to think to myself, "Come on,
Anita, let's come down to Earth and live in reality." She had only
been out of law school a couple of years and her experience and
                                         339

her ability couldn't begin to compare with some of the others on
the staff.

  But I also have to say that I was not totally surprised at her
wanting these assignments because she definitely came across as
someone who was ambitious and watched out for her own advance-
ment. She wasn't really a team player, but more someone who
looked out for herself first. You could see the same thing in her
relationships with others at the office.

  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Excuse me. Ms. Alvarez, we had
the 5 minutes, you know, for the other panel. But we have very ex-
tensive questionings. I don't want to cut you off when you have
been waiting a long time.

  Ms. ALVAREZ. Well, Senator, if you would just give me a few
more minutes.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a state-
ment. The other panel has been on all day long. This is a panel in
reverse now. And the only limitation was the nine, No. 9, for 1
hour, and that is the last panel to come on.

  I object to cutting these people off. They are entitled to speak.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, we made an agreement just about
10 minutes ago and it is already being broken. Let's stick to the
agreement.

  Senator THURMOND. There is no agreement on this panel at all.
It was the last panel of nine people that we agreed to take 1 hour
on and no more. This panel is answering the first panel that has
been on here for hours and hours, and they are entitled to speak,
and we are going to contend for it.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think the record will show that there
were as many questions focused on the other panel from that side
as it was from this side. I distinctly heard the chairman say that
they were going to be 5 minutes and then it is unlimited.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, he suggested 5 minutes.
  Senator KENNEDY. All right. Let's make it 7.
  Senator THURMOND. NO, we don't want to limit them.
  Senator KENNEDY. Let's make it 7.
  Senator THURMOND. YOU didn't limit this morning. You didn't
limit all day long. They were in Ms. Hill's favor. Here are some in
Judge Thomas' favor. They are entitled to speak.

  Senator HATCH. And they read their full statements, the last
panel.

  Senator KENNEDY. I will ask the clerk to read back what Chair-
man Biden said about this panel.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, send it to Chairman Biden.
  Senator KENNEDY. I will ask the clerk to read back what was
agreed to.
  Senator THURMOND. These was no agreement.
  Senator LEAHY. It was agreed to.
  Senator THURMOND. He just said he suggested 5 minutes.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Chairman?
   Senator KENNEDY. GO ahead, Ms. Alvarez. Continue.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, if I
  Senator KENNEDY. MS. Alvarez is going to continue.
                                             340

  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, if I could, I think we all con-
curred on the one panel with 3 minutes and that is separate and
apart from this.

  Senator THURMOND. The last panel.
  Senator SIMPSON. And this is the regular panel and the regular
time that we did this morning with the other group. And we just
ask for the same courtesies here.

  Senator KENNEDY. That is exactly, the Senator has stated. What-
ever time was given to the earlier panel ought to be given to this
panel.

  I am glad the Chair is back. [Laughter.]
  Good to see you, Joe.
  The CHAIRMAN [presiding]. Please go on.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. If I could finish.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know I don't know, and I don't want it repeat-
ed. Did you all settle it? Are we all square?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. It is settled. I am going to finish.
  The CHAIRMAN. There is no limit on this panel. What is the
motion?

  Senator THURMOND. There is no motion at all. Just let them
speak till they get through.

  The CHAIRMAN. Speak.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Please. I made an awful lot of effort to come here.
I would like to just finish saying what I have to say.

  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. You go right ahead.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. YOU could see that Anita Hill was not a real team
player, but more someone who looked out for herself. You could see
this even in her relationships with others at the office. She mostly
kept to herself, although she would occasionally participate in
some of the girl-talk among the women at the office, and I have to
add that I don't recall her being particularly shy or innocent about
that either.

  You see, Senators, that was the Anita Hill that we all knew and
we worked with. And that is why hearing her on Friday was so
shocking. No, not shocking. It was so sickening. Trust me, the
Anita Hill I knew and worked with was a totally different person-
ality from the Anita Hill I heard on Friday. The Anita Hill I knew
before was nobody's victim.

  The Clarence Thomas I knew and worked with was also not who
Anita Hill alleges. Everyone who knows Clarence, knows that he is
a very proud and dignified man. With his immediate staff, he was
very warm and friendly, sort of like a friend or a father. You could
talk with him about your problems, go to him for advice, but, like a
father, he commanded and he demanded respect. He demanded
professionalism and performance, and he was very strict about
that.

  Because we were friends outside of the office or perhaps in pri-
vate, I might have called him Clarence, but in the office he was
Mr. Chairman. You didn't joke around with him, you didn't lose
your respect for him, you didn't become too familiar with him, be-
cause he would definitely let you know that you had crossed the
line.
                                         341

  Clarence was meticulous about being sure that he retained a
very serious and professional atmosphere within his office, without
the slightest hint of impropriety, and everyone knew it.

  We weren't a coffee-klatching group. We didn't have office par-
ties or Christmas parties, because Clarence didn't think it was ap-
propriate for us to give others the impression that we were not se-
rious or professional or perhaps working as hard as everyone else.
He wanted to maintain a dignity about his office and his every be-
havior and action confirmed that.

  As his professional colleague, I traveled with him, had lunch and
dinner with him, worked with him, one-on-one and with others.
Never did he ever lose his respect for me, and never did we ever
have a discussion of the type that Ms. Hill alleges. Never was he
the slightest bit improper in his behavior with me. In every situa-
tion I have shared with Clarence Thomas, he has been the ultimate
professional and he has required it of those around him, in particu-
lar, his personal staff.

  From the moment they surfaced, I thought long and hard about
these allegations. You see, I, too, have experienced sexual harass-
ment in the past. I have been physically accosted by a man in an
elevator who I rebuffed. I was trapped in a xerox room by a man
who I refused to date. Obviously, it is an issue I have experienced, I
understand, and I take very seriously.

  But having lived through it myself, I find Anita Hill's behavior
inconsistent with these charges. I can assure you that when I come
into town, the last thing I want to do is call either of these two
men up and say hello or see if they want to get together.

  To be honest with you, I can hardly remember their names, but I
can assure you that I would never try and even maintain a cordial
relationship with either one of them. Women who have really been
harassed would agree, if the allegations were true, you put as
much distance as you can between yourself and that other person.

  What's more, you don't follow them to the next job--especially, if
you are a black female, Yale Law School graduate. Let's face it, out
in the corporate sector, companies are fighting for women with
those kinds of credentials. Her behavior just isn't consistent with
the behavior of a woman who has been harassed, and it just doesn't
make sense.

  Senators I don't know what else to say to have you understand
the crime that has been committed here. It has to make all of us
suspicious of her motives, when someone of her legal background
comes in here at the 11th hour, after 10 years, and having had four
other opportunities through congressional hearings to oppose this
man, and alleges such preposterous things.

  I have been contacted by I think every reporter in the country,
looking for dirt. And when I present the facts as I experienced
them, it is interesting, they don't print it. It's just not as juicy as
her amazing allegations.

  What is this country coming to, when an innocent man can be
ambushed like this, jumped by a gang whose ring leader is one of
his own proteges, Anita Hill? Like Julius Caesar, he must want to
turn to her and say, "Et tu, Brutus? You too, Anita?"

  As a mother with a child, I can only begin to imagine how Clar-
ence must feel, being betrayed by one of his own. Nothing would
                                             342

hurt me more. And I guess he described it best in his opening
statement on Friday. His words and his emotions are still ringing
in all of our ears and all of our hearts.

  I have done the best I could, Senators, to be honest in my state-
ment to you. I have presented the situation as it was then, as I
lived it, side by side, with Clarence and with Anita.

  You know, I talked with my mom before I came here, and she
reminded me that I was always raised to stand up for what I be-
lieved. I have seen an innocent man being mugged in broad day-
light, and I have not looked the other way. This John Q. Public
came here and got involved.

  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Ms. Fitch.

                      TESTIMONY OF NANCY E. FITCH

  Ms. FITCH. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, members of the
committee: My name is Dr. Nancy Elizabeth Fitch. I have a BA in
English literature and political science from Oakland University,
which was part of Michigan State University at the time

  Senator THURMOND. Would you please pull the microphone closer
to you, so that the people in the back can hear you.

  Ms. FITCH [continuing]. And a masters and Ph.D. in history from
the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I have taught at Sanga-
mon State University in Illinois, was a social science research ana-
lyst for the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Con-
gress, been a special assistant and historian to the then Chairman
of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Clarence
Thomas, an assistant professor of history at Lynchburg College in
Virginia, and presently assistant professor of African-American
Studies at Temple University, in Philadelphia.

  From 1982 to 1989, I worked as a special assistant historian to
then Chairman Clarence Thomas of the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. I worked for and with him 7 years and
have known him for 9. I researched the history of African-Ameri-
cans, people of color and women and their relationship to issues,
including employment, education and training. These were used for
background on speeches, special emphasis programming at the
Commission and for policy position papers.

  I reported only to Judge Thomas, and my responsibilities also in-
cluded outreach efforts to local colleges and universities and to the
D.C. public schools. Judge Thomas was interested in his staff and
himself being mentors and role models, especially, but not only to
young people of color.

  In these 9 years, I have known Clarence Thomas to be a person
of great integrity, morally upstanding, professional, a decent
person, an exemplary boss. Those years spent in his employ as a
schedule C employee, a political appointee, were the most reward-
ing of my work life to that time. My returning to higher education
I attribute to his persuading me to return to what I loved, not con-
tinuing as a bureaucrat, but returning to teaching.

  I would like to say Judge Thomas, besides being a person of great
moral character, I found to be a most intelligent man. Senator
Biden was correct yesterday, when he indicated that the Republi-
                                                   343

can side of the panel might have overlooked its easiest defense,
that of dealing with the judge's intelligence.

  If these allegations, which I believe to be completely unfounded
and vigorously believe unfounded, were true, we would be dealing
not only with venality, but with abject stupidity with a person
shooting himself in the foot, having given someone else the gun to
use at any time.

  There is no way Clarence Thomas--CT--would callously venally
hurt someone. A smart man, concerned about making a contribu-
tion to this country as a public official, recognizing the gravity and
weightiness of his responsibilities and public trust, a role model
and mentor who would, by his life and work, show the possibilities
in America for all citizens given opportunity, well, would a person
such as this, Judge Clarence Thomas would never ever make a par-
allel career in harassment, ask that it not be revealed and expect
to have and keep his real career. And I know he did no such thing.

  He is a dignified, reserved, deliberative, conscientious man of
great conscience, and I am proud to be at his defense.

  As I told the FBI agent who interviewed me on Tuesday, October
1, I trust Judge Thomas completely, he has all of my support and
caring earned by 9 years of the most positive and affirmative inter-
acting, not only with me, but with other staff and former staff,
men and women, and I know he will get back his good name.

  Thank you.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  Ms. Holt.

                        TESTIMONY OF DIANE HOLT

  Ms. HOLT. Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond, and members of
this committee: My name is Diane Holt. I am a management ana-
lyst in the Office of the Chairman of the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission.

  I have known Clarence Thomas for over 10 years. For 6 of those
years, I worked very closely with him, cheek to cheek, shoulder to
shoulder, as his personal secretary. My acquaintance with Judge
Thomas began in May 1981, after he had been appointed as Assist-
ant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department of Education.

  I had been the personal secretary to the outgoing Assistant Sec-
retary for several years. Upon Judge Thomas' arrival at the De-
partment, he held a meeting with me, in which he indicated that
he was not committed to bringing a secretary with him, and had no
wish to displace me. Because he was not familiar with my qualifi-
cations, he made no guarantees, but gave me an opportunity to
prove myself.

  That is the kind of man he is.
  In May 1982, Judge Thomas asked me to go to the EEOC with
him, where I worked as his secretary until September 1987.
  I met Professor Hill in the summer of 1981, when she came to
work at the Department of Education as attorney adviser to Judge
Thomas.
  After about a year, Judge Thomas was nominated to be Chair-
man of the EEOC. He asked both Professor Hill and myself to
transfer with him.
                                                    344

  Both Ms. Hill and I were excited about the prospect of transfer-
ring to the EEOC. We even discussed the greater potential for indi-
vidual growth at this larger agency. We discussed and expressed
excitement that we would be at the right hand of the individual
who would run this agency.

  When we arrived at the EEOC, because we knew no one else
there, Professor Hill and I quickly developed a professional rela-
tionship, a professional friendship, often having lunch together.

  At no time did Professor Hill intimate, not even in the most
subtle of ways, that Judge Thomas was asking her out or subject-
ing her to the crude, abusive conversations that have been de-
scribed. Nor did I ever discern any discomfort, when Professor Hill
was in Judge Thomas' presence.

  Additionally, I never heard anyone at any time make any refer-
ence to any inappropriate conduct in relation to Clarence Thomas.

  The Clarence Thomas that I know has always been a motivator
of staff, always encouraging others to grow professionally. I person-
ally have benefited from that encouragement and that motivation.

  In sum, the Chairman Thomas that I have known for 10 years is
absolutely incapable of the abuses described by Professor Hill.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  Ms. Berry-Myers?

                TESTIMONY OF PHYLLIS BERRY-MYERS

  Ms. BERRY. YOU can call me Phyllis Berry, since that was my
name that I used throughout my professional life, and that's prob-
ably what most people are going to refer to me as.

  Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond and members of the commit-
tee, I am Phyllis Berry.

  I know and have worked with both Clarence Thomas and Anita
Hill. I have known Judge Thomas since 1979, and Anita Hill since
1982. Once Clarence Thomas was confirmed as the Chairman of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and had assumed his
duties there, he asked me to come and work with him at the Com-
mission.

  I joined his staff as a special assistant in June of 1982. At the
Commission, Chairman Thomas asked that I assume responsibility
for three areas: I was to, one, assist in assessing and reorganizing
his personal staff, scheduling, speech writing, and those kinds of
things; two, to assist in professionalizing the Office of Congression-
al Affairs, as that office was called then; and, three, assist in reor-
ganizing the Office of Public Affairs, as that office was called then.

  Anita Hill was already a member of Clarence Thomas' staff
when I joined the Commission.

  There are several points to be made:
  One, many of the areas of responsibilities that I had been asked
to oversee were areas that Anita Hill handled, particularly con-
gressional affairs and public relations. We, therefore, had to work
together. Chris Roggerson was the director of congressional affairs
at that time, and Anita Hill worked more under his supervision
than Clarence Thomas'.
  Two, Clarence Thomas' behavior toward Anita Hill was no more,
no less than his behavior toward the rest of his staff. He was re-
                                         345

spectful, demand of excellence in our work, cordial, professional,
interested in our lives and our career ambitions.

  Three, Anita Hill indicated to me that she had been a primary
advisor to Clarence Thomas at the Department of Education. How-
ever, she seemed to be having a difficult time on his EEOC staff, of
being considered as one of many, especially on a staff where others
were as equally or more talented than she.

  Four, Anita Hill often acted as though she had a right to imme-
diate direct access to the Chairman. Such access was not always
immediately available. I felt she was particularly distressed, when
Allyson Duncan became chief of staff and her direct access to the
Chairman was even more limited.

  Five, I cannot remember anyone, except perhaps Diane Holt,
who was regarded as personally close to Anita. She was considered
by most of us as somewhat aloof.

  In addition, I would like to make these comments:
  In her press conference on October 7, 1991, Anita Hill indicated
that she did not know me and I did not know her. However, in her
testimony before this committee, she affirmed that not only did we
know one another, but that we enjoyed a friendly, professional re-
lationship.
  Also, she testified that I had the opportunity to observe and did
observe her interaction with Clarence Thomas at the office.
  Two, I served at the Department of Education at the same time
that Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas were there. One aspect of my
job was to assist with the placement of personnel at the depart-
ment, particularly schedule C and other excepted service appoint-
ments, such as schedule A appointments.
  Excepted Service means those positions in Federal civil service
excepted from the normal, competitive requirements that are au-
thorized by law, Executive order or regulation.
   The schedule C hiring authority is the means by which political
appointees are hired. The schedule A hiring authority is the means
by which attorneys, teachers in overseas dependent school systems,
drug enforcement agents in undercover work, et cetera, are hired.
   The office that I worked in was also responsible for reviewing
any hiring that the department's political appointees made under
the excepted service hiring authority. Therefore, in that capacity, I
was aware of any excepted service hiring decisions made in the
Office of Civil Rights, and that is the office that Clarence Thomas
headed at that time, and Anita Hill was hired in that office as a
schedule A employee.
   Federal personnel processing procedures require a lot of specific
knowledge and a lot of paperwork, and I do not profess to be a Fed-
eral personnel expert. But I can attest to the procedures required
by our office and the Office of Personnel at the Department of Edu-
cation at that time.
   At the end of such procedures, a new employee would have no
doubt whatsoever regarding their status, their grade, their pay,
their benefits, their promotion rights, employment rights and obli-
gation as a Federal employee and as an employee in the depart-
ment.
   A new employee would know whether their employment is classi-
fied as permanent or temporary, protected or nonprotected, and

         56-273 O--93-
                                               346

those kinds of things. Each new employee must sign a form that
contains such information, before employment can begin.

  The Personnel Department at the Department of Education is a
fine one, and it takes pride in thoroughly counseling new employ-
ees.

  Senator HATCH. Let me start with you, Ms. Holt. You were here
in what we would call, in a true trial, in the capacity of really a
personal witness as well as a custodial witness. You can help us, it
seems to me, figure out the significance and relevance of the tele-
phone log records of the messages received by Clarence Thomas.

  Also, since the testimony of Anita Hill on Friday, the issue of
whether Professor Hill's telephone calls to Judge Thomas might in
fact have been telephone calls to you has been interjected, because
she indicated some of them were just calls to you. Is that so?

  Ms. HOLT. She did call me on occasion.
  Senator HATCH. Are they ones you have listed in these logs?
  Ms. HOLT. They are not, no.
  Senator HATCH. They are not?

   Ms. HOLT. NO.

  Senator HATCH. And this is your handwriting on these logs, pri-
marily?

  Ms. HOLT. Primarily.
  Senator HATCH. With regard to these phone calls involving Anita
Hill?
  Ms. HOLT. Right.
  Senator HATCH. Each and every one of them?
  Ms. HOLT. Each and every call? No.
  Senator HATCH. But I am talking about the ones involving Anita
Hill only.
  Ms. HOLT. That is what I am saying. No, there is one call on here
that
  Senator HATCH. Well, we will go through it. Yes, one call, but all
the others are your handwriting.
  Ms. HOLT. Right.
  Senator HATCH. NOW there are 10 messages recorded by you in
the telephone log book which I had entered into the record yester-
day. Now do these represent all of the times that Anita Hill called
or might have called Judge Thomas during the 7 years that you
worked for Judge Thomas?
  Ms. HOLT. There were other times she called and he was avail-
able to take the call, which would mean that there was no indica-
tion in the phone log.
  Senator HATCH. SO there were a number of other times besides
the at least 10 that you wrote down, mentioned in these logs?
  Ms. HOLT. Right
  Senator HATCH. Were they frequent or were they just sporadic?
  Ms. HOLT. They were sporadic.
  Senator HATCH. But they were more than one, two, three? Could
you give us an estimate?
  Ms. HOLT. I would say maybe another five or six.
  Senator HATCH. Another 5 or 6, so at least 15 or 16 calls that you
received over these years, during the 7 years you worked for Judge
Thomas. Is that right?
  Ms. HOLT. Right.
                                                   347

  Senator HATCH. Were these always cordial calls?
  Ms. HOLT. They were always cordial.
  Senator HATCH. Was her voice always basically the same? Was it
friendly?
  Ms. HOLT. It was always friendly.
  Senator HATCH. OK. If she called and Judge Thomas were in and
available to take the call, that would be put through on most occa-
sions, right?
  Ms. HOLT. It would be put through.
  Senator HATCH. That you wouldn't write down?
  Ms. HOLT. I'm sorry?
  Senator HATCH. YOU would not write those calls down?
  Ms. HOLT. I would not write that down, no.
  Senator HATCH. OK. Now as you have said, these 10 calls are in
your handwriting. So is there any other reason to dispute their cor-
rectness?

   Ms. HOLT. NO, sir.

  Senator HATCH. Are you sure of their correctness?

   Ms. HOLT. I am, sir.

  Senator HATCH. AS I mentioned, Professor Hill spoke of you this
last Friday as a friend and, you know, attempts to diminish the sig-
nificance of these messages, it seems to me, were made by her, at
least at the one press conference, by claiming that many were calls
placed to you and not to Judge Thomas, or Clarence Thomas at the
time; that the messages to Judge Thomas were only accidental de-
velopments from her conversations with you. Have you heard that?

  Ms. HOLT. I heard that, yes.
  Senator HATCH. IS that true?
  Ms. HOLT. That is not true. Had Anita Hill called me and even
asked that I pass on a hello to Judge Thomas, I would have done
just that, but it would not have been an official message in his
phone log.
   Senator HATCH. I see. Now I know it is a long time ago, but can
you recall any tension or strain in her voice during any of these
calls that she made to you and through you to Judge Thomas?
   Ms. HOLT. Never.
   Senator HATCH. SO these particular questions that she would
leave with you, or these particular statements that she made with
you, they were basically unremarkable as far as any emotion or
any other
   Ms. HOLT. They were unremarkable to me.
   Senator HATCH. And they were all friendly?
   Ms. HOLT. They were all friendly.
   Senator HATCH. And they were all friendly toward Judge
Thomas?
   Ms. HOLT. They were.
   Senator HATCH. Did you sense any animosity or any hostility or
any aggravation or
   Ms. HOLT. Never.
   Senator HATCH. Never. Is that true during the whole time that
you knew her while she worked there?
   Ms. HOLT. That is true of the entire time.
   Senator HATCH. YOU were the gatekeeper, weren't you?

   Ms. HOLT. I was, yes.
                                                    348

  Senator HATCH. Nobody could get in or out without you?
  Ms. HOLT. If I was there, that is true.
  Senator HATCH. I bet you were a good one. I bet you were a good
one.
  Now I would like you to go back even further, to the time when
all three of you worked at the EEOC. After any meeting or lunch
between Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas, did you ever notice any-
thing about Ms. Hill--or Professor Hill, excuse me--and her behav-
ior, her moods or simply the way she looked, that ever led you to
believe that anything unusual had really taken place between her
and Clarence Thomas?
  Ms. HOLT. NO, never.
  Senator HATCH. Never once?
  Ms. HOLT. I never noticed anything.
  Senator HATCH. IS it fair to say that their relationship was en-
tirely professional?
  Ms. HOLT. I would say that, yes.
  Senator HATCH. HOW about the rest of you? Consider the same
questions. Is there anything that would have indicated to you that
the relationship was anything less than entirely professional? Ms.
Alvarez?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir. They always appeared to be very profes-
sional with one another. That was the way Clarence demanded it.
  Senator HATCH. MS. Fitch?
  Ms. FITCH. Always professional. The times that Anita Hill and I
went out together, and that might be no more than three times in
a little over a year's period, we would leave work and we were talk-
ing about the job, talking about him, felt that he was going places
and wanted to make sure that we, as his personal staff, were in the
position to help him do what he needed to do to get there, so no.

  Senator HATCH. MS. Berry-Myers?
  Ms. BERRY. I don't remember any time them having anything
that was more than professional, cordial, friendly. She always indi-
cated that she admired and respected the man.
  Senator HATCH. Always?
  Ms. BERRY. Always.
  Senator HATCH. Right up to the day that she left to go to Oral
Roberts University?
  Ms. BERRY. TO my knowledge, yes.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, MS. Holt, in your opinion, or any of the
others of you, is there any other person in the EEOC or any other
person in this country who might have been in a better position to
know whether or not Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill had any-
thing other than a strictly professional relationship?
  Ms. HOLT. I don't think anyone could say that they had anything
other than the professional relationship.
  Senator HATCH. NOW, MS. Holt, as I read this log, there are four
messages in 1984, five messages in 1985, and then only one message
in 1986, and then one in 1987, and then there follows a more than
3-year gap without any messages. What is the last message before
that 3-year gap, in fact, the last message in the log book itself?
What is the message of August 4, 1987?
  Ms. HOLT. On August 4?
  Senator HATCH. 1987.
                                         349

  Ms. HOLT. "Anita Hill. In town until 8:15. Wanted to congratu-
late you on marriage."

  Senator HATCH. SO for each of the years there were a number of
calls that you have in the log here, and there were a number of
calls outside of the log

  Ms. HOLT. Right.
  Senator HATCH [continuing]. That were passed through because
he was there, but the log calls stop in August of 1987. Is that cor-
rect?
  Ms. HOLT. AS far as I know.
  Senator HATCH. Were there any other calls made after that,
other than the two for law schools?
  Ms. HOLT. I left the Chairman's office in September, immediately
after that.
  Senator HATCH. OK. Well, as of that date in August of 1987,
what was the message that was in that log?
  Ms. HOLT. I'm sorry, Senator?
  Senator HATCH. AS of the date that I mentioned, on August 4,
1987, in your handwriting, what is the message that was left by
Anita Hill?
  Ms. HOLT. On August 4?
  Senator HATCH. Yes.
  Ms. HOLT. "In town until 8:15. Wanted to congratulate you on
marriage."
   Senator HATCH. And to your knowledge, that was the last one
that you ever took, then?
  Ms. HOLT. TO my knowledge, yes.
   Senator HATCH. NOW you have independent knowledge, do you
not, of Anita Hill's job title while at the Office of Civil Rights. Is
that correct?
   Ms. HOLT. Right. She was attorney-advisor.
   Senator HATCH. She was an attorney-advisor?

   Ms. HOLT. Yes.

   Senator HATCH. NOW do you know how that position is classified
by the government?

   Ms. HOLT. Right. I know it is a schedule A position.
   Senator HATCH. Schedule A. What does that mean?
   Ms. HOLT. It means that it doesn't have to go through the normal
competitive process.
   Senator HATCH. It means that that job is permanent, doesn't it?
   Ms. HOLT. Right.
   Senator HATCH. In other words, even though she may not be able
to keep that first assistant to the
   Ms. HOLT. Assistant Secretary.
   Senator HATCH [continuing]. The Secretary that she had with
Clarence Thomas, she would be able to go in any other area as an
attorney-advisor.
   Ms. HOLT. And even if Clarence Thomas' replacement had not
wanted to keep her as his attorney-advisor, he could have placed
her someplace else within the agency.
   Senator HATCH. NOW she told this committee that she felt like
she had to go along with Chairman Thomas over to the EEOC, if I
recall this correctly--you correct me, if you saw it--but that she
was afraid that she might not have a job. Do you think
                                         350

   Ms. HOLT. TO my knowledge, I mean, she never asked me what
her options were. I didn't think there was any indecision on her
part. We were both enthusiastic about going to EEOC.

   Senator HATCH. She was enthusiastic?

   Ms. HOLT. She was.

  Senator HATCH. Well, wasn't that, though, because she wanted to
serve in this particularly stronger civil rights area?

  Ms. HOLT. We discussed that this man was a rising star and we
wanted to be there with him.

  Senator HATCH. But wasn't that just you feeling that way?
  Ms. HOLT. NO, that was her feeling that way also.
  Senator HATCH. That he was a rising star, and that she wanted
to be part of that rising
  Ms. HOLT. We both wanted to be a part of that?
  Senator HATCH. YOU did, too?

   Ms. HOLT. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. I understand you because you have expressed
your loyalty and your feelings toward Chairman Thomas, Judge
Thomas now, but you are sure that that is the way she felt?

  Ms. HOLT. I am sure.
  Senator HATCH. YOU took her to lunch; you two went to lunch on
a regular basis, didn't you?

   Ms. HOLT. We did.

  Senator HATCH. I mean, you knew each other real well. You
went many times, didn't you?

  Ms. HOLT. We went to lunch often.
  Senator HATCH. Quite often. Well, what did you and Professor
Hill like to talk about? Any particular subject or conversation that
is more prominent in your memory than any other? And if you
could kind of tie it into
  Ms. HOLT. There was never any particular subject. We talked
about men. We didn't talk about sex in any vivid sense, but we
talked about it in a very general sense, as indeed many of my
women friends and I do.
  Senator HATCH. Another other particular
  Ms. HOLT. We talked about work, and we talked about what she
did on the weekend or what I did on the weekend, just general con-
versations.
  Senator HATCH. Well, and you never saw anything that would in-
dicate that she had animosity toward then-Chairman Thomas?
  Ms. HOLT. Never.
  Senator HATCH. Or even at the prior job as Assistant Secretary
of Education?
  Ms. HOLT. None whatsoever.
  Senator HATCH. And you were just about as close to Judge
Thomas as anybody could have been, right?
  Ms. HOLT. We were--we are very close, yes.
  Senator HATCH. YOU have heard--let me just throw this out to
all of you--I am not going to repeat the cumulative charges that
would fill a whole page, of what she said Judge Thomas told her as
he was pursuing her for dates and, as she implied, maybe pursuing
her for something more than dates. Now each of you have heard
those, so there is no reason for me to repeat them, but cumulative-
ly they are pretty awful. Would you all agree?
                                         351

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  Ms. HOLT. They are.
  Senator HATCH. Could that have happened? Let's start with you,
Ms. Alvarez. Could he have used that language with her?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Knowing Clarence Thomas, it is impossible.
  Senator HATCH. It is impossible?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. In the work environment, he was so professional,
he was so--and, you know, I considered myself a friend of his, and
I could never be friendly with him in the office. He drew that line.
We were friends, and he was my boss, and when I was in the office,
he was professional, as well as we knew each other.
  Senator HATCH. All right.
  Ms. Fitch?
  Ms. FITCH. Yes, the probability of that happening, whether in the
workplace or outside of it, in my best knowledge is nil, is zero. The
probability is just not there. When I heard those things, I knew
they didn't come from him.
  Senator HATCH. SO you are saying you know that it is zero, the
chances of him doing that?
  Ms. FITCH. The probability of his doing that is zero, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. SO it really isn't even a probability. It just
means it would not have happened.

   Ms. FITCH. Yes, sir.

  Senator HATCH. HOW about you, Ms. Holt?
  Ms. HOLT. In my opinion, he would never, ever subject any
woman to that kind of language.
  Senator HATCH. MS. Berry-Myers.
  Ms. BERRY. When I first met with Clarence Thomas in 1982,
there was no--we sat in his office. He had a desk, a chair, and the
chair I was sitting in. That was all that the EEOC employees left
in the Chairman's office. That is how much they welcomed him
there.
  And we sat down, and from my political background, usually the
first thing that you ask a candidate is, "OK, if I open up your
closet, what skeletons are going to come falling out? I need to know
right now." So I talked to Clarence Thomas about the need to com-
port himself in a way that there could be absolutely no taint on his
reputation, on his character, on his honor, because we were about
to embark upon an arduous task.
  There wasn't anybody in this town, except perhaps Senator
Hatch, that supported that man in the position that he had as-
sumed, so I knew that everything that we did--public policy, pro-
gram, firing people, anything that we did--he was going to be
under microscopic scrutiny because he was a black Republican con-
servative in an agency that was overwhelmingly neither and in a
town that is tough, and he was about to undertake a tough job.
And with all the other things that we had to do, we didn't have
any time to be dealing with anything that mind besmirch his char-
acter.
   Senator HATCH. Well, do you have any concerns he might do oth-
erwise?
   Senator METZENBAUM [presiding]. Senator Hatch, your time has
expired.
   Senator HATCH. Let me just finish. This line only takes a
                                         352

   Ms. BERRY. None whatsoever, and not only would he not, but he
instructed his personal staff about the need for us to comport our-
selves in such a way as to not disgrace his office.

   Senator HATCH. OK. Thank you. My time is up, but I wanted to
finish that and allow you to at least finish that thought, and we
will come back to you in the next round.

   Ms. BERRY. Thank you.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Senator Heflin.
   Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, would Senator Heflin yield to me
just for one question?
   Ms. Holt, just so we are not confused, could I ask one of the staff,
just would you let me take that just for a moment? We will give it
right back to you. I just want to make sure we are all reading from
the same choir book here, or log book.
  Let me ask you, while he is bringing that up, just these ques-
tions: Each time that the log book shows Anita Hill calling, did she
connect with Clarence Thomas every single time she called, to your
knowledge?

  Ms. HOLT. I don't understand.
  Senator LEAHY. I mean, did she get through to him? A lot of
these are messages. Does the fact that a message we here, does
that mean that she
  Ms. HOLT. The fact that a message was taken meant that she
didn't get to him right away.
   Senator LEAHY. It does not mean she got to him each time?
  Ms. HOLT. It means she didn't get to him at that time.
   Senator LEAHY. OK, and you don't know whether she ever did?
  Ms. HOLT. She did. The check mark beside the call indicates that
the call was successfully returned.
   Senator LEAHY. And how do you know that?
   Ms. HOLT. It was my system. I devised it.
   Senator LEAHY. OK, but do you know it because you placed the
call back?
   Ms. HOLT. I placed the call, got them on the line, and I checked it
off that the call had been successfully returned.
   Senator LEAHY. Senator Hatch asked you if there might have
been a lot of other calls, and you were asked once before by the
Republican and Democratic staff of this committee, "Do you have a
recollection of Ms. Anita Hill calling Clarence Thomas any more
times than may have sporadically shown up on three such pages?"
And your answer was, "I would not even guess about that. I don't
know." Is that correct?
   Ms. HOLT. I was saying that I would not even guess about any
particular dates, any particular times, or any particular year.
   Senator LEAHY. Thank you very much.
   Senator Heflin, thank you for your courtesy.
   Senator HEFLIN. MS. Holt, you knew Anita Hill quite well social-

ly.
   Ms. HOLT. We were professional friends.
   Senator HEFLIN. Professional friends, all right. You went out to

lunch together and things like that. Did you ever go out in the
evening together, for dinner or something?

   Ms. HOLT. Only on one occasion.
                                         353

  Senator HEFLIN. On one occasion. All right. If Anita Hill is tell-
ing a falsehood, do you have any explanation why she would be
telling it?

  Ms. HOLT. I have no idea, sir. She is the only one, I believe, that
can answer that question.

  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, you went from the Department of Educa-
tion to EEOC with Judge Thomas, Clarence Thomas the Director?

  Ms. HOLT. He went over 2 or 3 weeks before I did, yes.
  Senator HEFLIN. And then you followed him?
  Ms. HOLT. Right.
  Senator HEFLIN. And Anita Hill was also one of those that fol-
lowed him from the Department of Education to the EEOC?
  Ms. HOLT. Right.
  Senator HEFLIN. Was there anybody else?
  Ms. HOLT. That is it, as far as I know, at that time.
   Senator HEFLIN. Did he ask you all to come?

   Ms. HOLT. He did.

  Senator HEFLIN. He did. All right. Now, at that particular time
when that move was made was there a good deal of discussion that
the Reagan administration wanted to abolish the Department of
Education?

   Ms. HOLT. I had heard that, Senator.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU had heard it. Was there any discussion at
that particular time that the Reagan administration wanted to
abolish the EEOC?
   Ms. HOLT. I had not heard that.
   Senator HEFLIN. YOU had not heard that.
   Now, did you take dictation from Director Thomas?
   Ms. HOLT. Not in the traditional sense of the word. When Judge
Thomas wanted to dictate, he stood at my desk and I typed.
   Senator HEFLIN. He didn't use a dictaphone?
   Ms. HOLT. He did on occasion.
   Senator HEFLIN. On occasion. And sometimes he would, in effect,
dictate to you letters standing at your desk?

   Ms. HOLT. He did.

   Senator HEFLIN. He would. All right.
   Did you open his mail?
   Ms. HOLT. If his mail was marked "personal," I opened it. We
had an Office of Executive Secretariat that was responsible for
opening all mail addressed to the Chairman.
   Senator HEFLIN. TO the Chairman. But, if it was personal you
would open it?
   Ms. HOLT. I would open it; yes.
   Senator HEFLIN. All right. Do you know whether or not he re-
ceived mail at his home?
   Ms. HOLT. I have no way of knowing that, Senator.
   Senator HEFLIN. YOU don't know about that.
   What was the age of his son at that time in 1982?
   Ms. HOLT. I think 6, 7.
   Senator HEFLIN. In the mail that you might have opened, did you
ever open any mail that contained pornographic materials?

    Ms. HOLT. I did not.

   Senator HEFLIN. YOU did not. All right.
                                                    354

   Now, did you hear of or know of anyone by the name of Earl
Harper at the Washington office?

   Ms. HOLT. I am not familiar with him; no.
   Senator HEFLIN. YOU are not familiar with him. All right.
   Did any of you?
   Ms. FITCH. NO, Senator.
   Senator HEFLIN. Did you, Ms. Berry?

   Ms. BERRY. Yes.

   Senator HEFLIN. We went into this and then it was reopened
later. It is my information that I now believe may have been
incorrect.

  Was he in the Washington office?
  Ms. BERRY. I am sorry. I don't know for sure which office he was
assigned to.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU don't know that. Well, what do you know
about him?
  Ms. BERRY. What I know is, and I don't recall all of the facts of
the case, I just understand that Earl Harper was alleged to have
been a sexual harasser.
  Senator HEFLIN. DO you remember, Ms. Holt, dictating, any dic-
tation by Clarence Thomas to the General Counsel pertaining to
this man Harper?
  Ms. HOLT. I don't remember any specific letters; no.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, MS. Berry, have you made any statements
that suggested that the allegations of Anita Hill were the result of
Ms. Hill's disappointment and frustration that Mr. Thomas didn't
show any sexual interest in her?

  I am talking to Ms. Phyllis Berry Myers.
  Ms. BERRY. That is what I said.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU said that to a newspaper?

   Ms. BERRY. Yes, I did.

  Senator HEFLIN. What were the facts pertaining to that?
  Ms. BERRY. Just my observations of Anita wishing to have great-
er attention from the Chairman. I think she was used to that at
the Department of Education. Wanting to have direct access to his
office, as though she had a right to have access to his office. Speak-
ing in just highly admirable terms for the Chairman, in a way
sometimes that didn't indicate just professional interest.

  Those were my impressions.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, what you are relating to me relates to a
sexual interest.
  Ms. BERRY. Pardon me?
  Senator HEFLIN. What you just related, are you saying that those
set of circumstances made you to believe that she had a sexual in-
terest?
  Ms. BERRY. That she had a crush on the Chairman? Yes.
  Senator HEFLIN. She had a crush on the Chairman?

   Ms. BERRY. Yes.

  Senator HEFLIN. And would you recite those statements and
things that you observed again?

  Ms. BERRY. It is in my written testimony, sir.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I am asking you now, if you would, in
order to recite those again as to that. I didn't understand anything
that you said
                                             355

  Ms. BERRY. Had any effect relative to sexual relations. They ap-
peared to be more professional and an attempt to have greater
access to him from a professional viewpoint.

  Senator HEFLIN. I just would like for you to recite them again, if
there is something

  Ms. BERRY. That is your impression. My impression was that
Anita wished to have a greater relationship with the Chairman
than just a professional one.

  Senator HEFLIN. And so you say that the fact that she didn't
have as much access and other things that they indicate a sexual
interest, as opposed to a professional or a work interest?

  Ms. BERRY. Exactly.
  Senator HEFLIN. And that is what you are saying.
  How would you distinguish between the two?
  Ms. BERRY. HOW would I distinguish between the two?
  Senator HEFLIN. Yes. What you recited to me did not appear to
be anything other than a work interest. But I would just like for
you to go ahead and recite how that is a sexual interest, as opposed
to a work interest.
  Ms. BERRY. TO have in a working environment, in a busy office,
part of my responsibilities coming to the EEOC was to help struc-
ture access to the Chairman. There was a lot of work to do helping
setting up scheduling, helping organize the work flow of a product,
determining staff positions, things of that nature. That was one of
my responsibilities when I first came there.
  To think that you should at any hour of the day, anytime that
you want to be able to walk in, have time with him, indicated to
me more of a proprietary interest than a professional interest.
  Senator HEFLIN. Were you conversant or did you know what the
relationship had been at the Department of Education relative to
access with her boss there?
  Ms. BERRY. Only from her indications. That she was a primary,
and whatever that meant, a primary adviser to the Chairman. And
I would assume a primary adviser, such as myself or J.C. or Diane,
meant someone that had readily--could be readily available to the
Chairman.
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, we went into this somewhat, Senator
Leahy but also Senator Specter in his examination of Ms. Hill went
into this question about whether or not she knew Phyllis Berry,
and I assume--I don't know how--did the paper refer to you as
Phyllis Berry or Phyllis Barry?
  Ms. BERRY. Yes, as far as I know. It wasn't a paper. It was a
press conference.
   Senator HEFLIN. I mean, well whatever it was, was it Barry or
Berry?
  Ms. BERRY. That was my understanding, that they said do you
know Phyllis Berry?
   Senator HEFLIN. IS it Berry or Barry?
  Ms. BERRY. Berry--B-e-r-r-y.
  Senator HEFLIN. All right. Now, Senator Specter asked these
questions, and I will read the questions and the answer:

   Senator SPECTER. There is a question about Phyllis Barry, B-a-r-r-y, who was
quoted in the New York Times on October the 7th, "In an interview Ms. Barry sug-
gested that the allegation [referring to your allegation] was a result of Ms. Hill s
                                             356

disappointment and frustration that Mr. Thomas did not show any sexual interest
in her."

   You were asked about Ms. Barry at the interview on October the 7th and were
reported to have said, "Well, I don t know Phyllis Barry and she doesn't know me."
And there were quite a few people who have come forward to say that they saw you
and Ms. Barry and that you knew each other very well.

  Then Ms. Hill answered.

   I would disagree with that. Ms. Barry worked at EEOC. She did attend some staff
meetings at EEOC. We were not close friends. We did not socialize together and we
had no basis for making a comment about my social interest with regards to Clar-
ence Thomas or anyone else. I might add at the time that I had an active social life
and that I was involved with other people.

  Then later Senator Specter asked her:

  So that when you said Ms. Barry doesn't know me and I don't know her you
weren't referring to just that, but to some intensity of knowledge.

  And Ms. Hill answered:

  Well, this is a specific remark about my sexual interest and I think one has to
know another person very well to make those kind of remarks unless they are very
openly expressed.

  Now, I am asking, you don't have any question in your mind that
Anita Hill knew you. It is a question as to the degree of intensity
she knew you relative to whether or not you could form an opinion
as to whether or not she had a sexual interest with Mr. Thomas?

  Ms. BERRY. Senator, as I indicated in my statement, I worked
very closely with Anita and I think that--I don't have the record
before me, but I do believe that Senator Specter asked her also,
"And she had the opportunity to observe you and Clarence Thomas
at the office?" and she indicated that yes, not only did I have the--
yes, I did have the opportunity to observe them. And I did have
that opportunity.

  And my opinion is that Anita had more than a professional in-
terest in Clarence Thomas.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, did he ever indicate any return of it?
  Ms. BERRY. NO. And, if you continue reading the New York
Times article, that is exactly what I said. And I said that "And be-
cause of that I think her feelings were hurt."
  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, MS. Holt, in regard to telephone calls
other than those that you logged, do you have a recollection as to
whether there were any additional phone calls that came in from
Anita Hill to Mr. Thomas?
  Ms. HOLT. What I recall, Senator, is that there were occasions
when Ms. Hill would call the office and would be put directly
through to Clarence Thomas.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU have taken a deposition in this case where
people asked you questions, and a question was asked you, "Do you
have a recollection"--on page 44--"of Anita Hill calling Clarence
Thomas any more times than may have been sporadically shown
up on these three other pages?" And the answer: "I would not even
guess about that. I don't know."
  Have you had changes in recollection since giving that deposi-
tion?
  Ms. HOLT. AS I just indicated to Senator Leahy, I was saying that
I would not fathom a guess about any particular day or time or
year that she had called him without it being in the log.
                                                   357

  Senator HEFLIN. SO you are saying that he could have called, or
do you know that she called or what?

  Ms. HOLT. I know, Senator, that there were occasions when she
called and was put directly through to Judge Thomas.

  Senator HEFLIN. But those were not recorded and no record is
made, is that what you are saying?

  Ms. HOLT. Exactly.
  Senator HEFLIN. DO you know how often they occurred?
  Ms. HOLT. NO, I don't. But there weren't that many of them.
  Senator HEFLIN. Wasn't that many of them. And over a period of
how many years are these phone--that is from 1984, these logs are
1984, 1985, 1986, 1987. Would there have been as many as two or
three?
  Ms. HOLT. Four or five. Six, maybe.
  Senator HEFLIN. It would have probably been what, in the neigh-
borhood of no more than one a year?
  Ms. HOLT. Possibly, sir.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, my time has run out.
  Senator KENNEDY [presiding]. Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you. Now, let me go back to you, Ms.
Berry. If I can call you Ms. Berry for the purposes of this hearing.
  Ms. BERRY. That is fine.
  Senator HATCH. Did you hear Anita Hill's press conference last
Monday?
  Ms. BERRY. Pardon me?
  Senator HATCH. Did you see Anita Hill's press conference last
Monday, or hear it?
  Ms. BERRY. Last Monday? Was that October--I don't know dates
anymore.
  Senator HATCH. Whenever it was, the first press conference.
  Ms. BERRY. October 7? No, I did not see her press conference. Re-
porters starting calling my home asking me had I seen Anita Hill's
press conference where she indicated that she was responding to
my quotes in the Times article and she indicated that she did not
know me and that I did not know her.
  And so I issued a statement saying that this is in response to
Anita Hill's statement at an October 7 press conference indicating
that she did not know me and I did not know her, that is not true.
And then I went on to explain how it is that I did, in fact, know
Anita Hill.
  Senator HATCH. Well, when you heard Professor Hill claim "I
don't know Phyllis Berry and she doesn't know me," did you think,
as Professor Hill claimed on Friday, that her remark was only
meant to indicate that you were not in a position to speculate
about her private life or did you give those words what I would call
their natural meaning and think that she was not telling the
truth?
   Ms. BERRY. When I heard it I thought she wasn't telling the
truth. Obviously, she knew me. We worked together for many
years, and we worked closely together, particularly in the Office of
Congressional Affairs, particularly on the Chairman's staff, and I
knew of her at the Department of Education. So I had no idea what
she was talking about, except that I took her at face value. She
said she didn't know me.
                                         358

  Senator HATCH. Well, after Professor Hill denied that she knew
you the press conference erupted in applause, which is the largest
ovation of the day. What were you thinking at that moment?

  Ms. BERRY. I didn't see her press conference.
  Senator HATCH. YOU didn't see it?
  Ms. BERRY. I am sorry. I was working on Little League stuff and
I wasn't watching television.

  Senator HATCH. Well, you have indicated that the reason why
Professor Hill has been so reluctant to acknowledge your existence
appears to be the fact that you have advanced a theory for why
Professor Hill is making these allegations, and your theory is, to
say the least, unflattering to her in her position.

  Can you repeat that theory as you gave it to the New York
Times, and tell us if it still seems accurate to you?

  Ms. BERRY. It still seems accurate to me.
  Senator HATCH. And what was your theory?
  Ms. BERRY. Because Clarence Thomas did not respond to her
heightened interest, didn't respond to her in that way. He treated
her just like he treated everybody else on the staff. That her feel-
ings were hurt.

  And I think opportunities that she thought that she ought to
have, access that she ought to have and she didn't receive. I mean
it was competitive. We were a tough, strong group of women
around Clarence Thomas and he based--we had to perform. We
had strict performance agreements, and you had to perform. And,
if you couldn't hang, if you couldn't perform, you got his wrath. If
you performed, you got his praise.

  I think because she was at EEOC not treated special that she
didn't feel comfortable there.

  Senator HATCH. OK. Ms. Fitch, I was impressed by your state-
ment, as I have been of all of your statements. I am impressed with
each and everyone of you, and I think Judge Thomas was very
lucky to have you working with him.

  But I particularly notice you used the term "decent"
  Ms. FITCH. I'm sorry.
  Senator HATCH. I particularly noticed you the used the term
"decent" in describing Clarence Thomas.

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. DO you use that very often?
  Ms. FITCH. Yes. If you talk to the people who talked to me even
before I left the Commission, when I went to Lynchburg, VA, when
I went to Temple, even at the time that he was nominated for the
Supreme Court, I've always used that term about the Judge, and it
kicked out for me some time ago, at least a year or two ago, if not
longer, that I don't use that term for everybody, and it's not that
there aren't other decent people, because there certainly are.
  But what intrigues me about him is that I always paid a great
deal of attention to his character, this man that I felt had a con-
science that operated all the time, that realized the gravity of his
position, and I found that impressive and that has a lot to do with
my use of that term, and I still don't throw it around indiscrimi-
nately and I still call him a decent person.
                                         359

  Senator HATCH. Did you consider yourself a friend of Anita
Hill's, and did you have a relationship with her outside of Wash-
ington?

  Ms. FITCH. Anita Hill and I did not spend a lot of time together.
We did not go to lunch, because I don't go to lunch often. We
maybe went out three times after work for dinner. We were not
prowling Washington or anything. I went to her house on one occa-
sion. When she was in the hospital, I visited her there. At her fare-
well party at the Sheraton, I was in attendance and I believe I was
the only person from the Commission who was there.

  After she left the Commission, I stayed in touch with her. We did
meet once when she came into town. Subsequently, we tried to get
together. I had a house-warming gift for her, but we never caught
up with each other.

  Senator HATCH. I see. Did you ever hear her mention any prob-
lems with Clarence Thomas?

  Ms. FITCH. Never. Never. Never, even after she left the Commis-
sion.

  Senator HATCH. SO, both during the time she was there and after
she left?

  Ms. FITCH. Yes, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. OK. Now, your statement mentions that you
knew both Anita Hill and Phyllis Berry while you were at the
EEOC.

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. IS it possible, in your view, that Anita Hill was
telling the truth at this press conference on Monday, when she
stated, "I don't know Phyllis Berry and she doesn't know me"?

  Ms. FITCH. Senator, when I heard that, I was very surprised. I
don't know what she meant by it. I took it to mean that she was
unaware of Ms. Berry's existence, and I knew that not to be the
case.

  Senator HATCH. Have you ever heard or ever known Anita Hill
to lie on any other occasion?

  Ms. FITCH. NO, I haven't, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. OK.
  Ms. Alvarez, did you know Phyllis Berry and Professor Hill at
the EEOC?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes, sir, I did.

  Senator HATCH. SO, you knew they worked together?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. In your statement, you noted that Professor Hill
was "not a team player," and "appeared to have her own agenda."
Could you elaborate on that?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. Well, there seemed to be all of us in the group
kind of working toward the same goal, and I think we got along
with each other, we would occasionally talk, and Anita mostly kept
to herself. She was very strong-willed, she liked to do things her
way, and that was always the way she--that was the way she gave
the impression, that she kind of had her own agenda, her own way
of doing things. So, no matter what the rest of the team was doing,
she was going to do it Anita's way.

  Senator HATCH. NOW, you say you knew Judge Thomas well.

   Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes.
                                                    360

  Senator HATCH. Did you ever hear him ask Anita Hill for a date,
the whole time you knew both of them?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, never.
  Senator HATCH. And you knew her well.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I knew her at the office.
  Senator HATCH. OK. Did you ever see any indication that either
of them had a romantic interest in the other?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. NO.

  Senator HATCH. Did you ever hear of Judge Thomas discussing
sex with anybody, including Anita Hill?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. At the office, never, sir.
  Senator HATCH. Again, I am going to ask you this question. You
are his close friend and you worked closely with him. Is it conceiva-
ble that Clarence Thomas, the Clarence Thomas you have known
and worked with for the past 13 years, that he could have made
the perverted statements that Professor Hill said he did?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Not a chance, sir.
  Senator HATCH. Did you ever hear Professor Hill express any dis-
satisfaction with then Chairman Thomas or the way he treated
her?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. NO. NO, not at all.

  Senator HATCH. If you had a young daughter in her early twen-
ties, would you want her to work with Judge Thomas?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. Absolutely. Absolutely.
  Senator HATCH. From your experience of working with Professor
Hill and Judge Thomas at the EEOC, did Professor Hill think that
she had some sort of a special relationship with Judge Thomas?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes, she used to give that impression. She used to
like to tout the fact that she had worked with him before. You
know, when we would get into debates on how we were going to
handle an issue, she would say, "Well, I know how he thinks, I
know how he likes his papers written or I know the position he
wants to take," or something like that. That was something she
always sort of held out in front of everyone at the staff, that she
had this sort of inside track to him.
  Senator HATCH. What I would like to ask each and every one of
you is, rack your brains, as people who were around both of them,
who have known both of them during that period of time, who
really have had a close working relationship professionally and
even a friendship relationship with Judge Thomas. How could she
have testified the way she did here?
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, to me it was incredible. I don't know. I can't
answer that. I was dumb-struck. I have no idea.
  Senator HATCH. MS. Fitch?
  Ms. HOLT. I have no idea, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Well, let me ask you this: Do any of you believe
her testimony here?
  Ms. HOLT. I do not believe a word, not one word.
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I don't believe it, either.
  Senator HATCH. I didn't hear you.
  Ms. FITCH. I'm sorry. Senator, I do not believe a word of it,
either.
  Senator HATCH. YOU don't believe a word of it.
  Ms. FITCH. NO, I don't.
                                         361

  Senator HATCH. HOW about you, Ms. Myers?
  Ms. BERRY. When she could stand up in front of the world and
say "I did not know Phyllis Berry and Phyllis Berry does not know
me," I can imagine she probably would say anything. I mean, I
exist and I existed then. I worked very closely with her, and that
wasn't the truth, so it seems to me that if she could not tell the
truth on one thing, she could not tell the truth on another.

  Senator HATCH. MS. Alvarez?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I cannot believe one word of her testimony. That is
not the Clarence Thomas I know. That is not the Clarence Thomas
I worked with.
  Senator HATCH. YOU heard Chairman Thomas' testimony with
regard to the allegations that she made on three successive occa-
sions, once to the FBI, once in her 4-page single-spaced typewritten
statement, and another one when she appeared here before this
committee last Friday, and you heard Judge Thomas' response to
that.

  Ms. FITCH. Yes, Senator, he said he categorically denied her alle-
gations.

  Senator HATCH. He did deny them.

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. Did you hear his response on the negative
stereotypes?

  Ms. FITCH. I heard most of it, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. What do you think of those comments made by
her attributed to him and his comments back about those com-
ments?
  Ms. FITCH. AS a historian, I know those comments to be stereoty-
pical.
  Senator HATCH. Why would you think she would say that?
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I have no idea. I don't know, but they are
certainly kind of pat formulaic statements that people have histori-
cally made about black men in this country.
   Senator HATCH. Don't they play on white prejudices about black
men?
   Ms. FITCH. Of course they do, Senator.
   Senator HATCH. Of course they do, but why would she use that
language, and why would he use it?
   Ms. FITCH. Senator, I think what I am trying to say is that it is
incomprehensible that she would say these things, incomprehensi-
ble that she might believe them. I do not know. I have not talked
to her in three years. I don't know.
   Senator HATCH. Would those kind of statements, had they been--
would those kind of statements, as they are, would they tend to
turn some people in this country against Clarence Thomas?
   Ms. FITCH. Senator, I have been in the street a lot lately listen-
ing to people's conversations, and they have been talking about
this process and about this man, and I am finding that most people
are concerned about the seriousness of the allegations, they take
the issue of sexual harassment seriously. They are not discounting
that. They do not believe the things that are being said about this
man. They are too pat, they don't--even for people who don't know
him--don't think they seem to hang very well together.
                                             362

  Senator HATCH. NOW, have any of you women ever heard of any
male using that type of language, in order to obtain a date with a
woman?

  Ms. FITCH. Senator, this was not to obtain a date with me, but
when I taught at Sangamon State University in Illinois, in a room
with four other people, including an older man who was old enough
to be my father, a Federal contract compliance officer said some
things like that to me, and nobody said anything in response. I was
very hurt by that. I stayed away from him. He had no jurisdiction
or authority over me. It s possible for people to say things like that.
It is improbable that this man said those things.

  Senator HATCH. Well, what do the rest of you feel about that?
  Ms. HOLT. I agree that it's impossible for Clarence Thomas to
have said those things.
  Senator HATCH. MS. Alvarez.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I agree that it is absolutely impossible for Clarence
to have said it.
  Senator HATCH. MS. Berry.
  Ms. BERRY. It's impossible and not a great deductive method in
my way of thinking. [Laughter.]
  Senator HATCH. Well, you know, I hate to tell you this, but I
agree with that. You know, people all over this country are trying
to figure out how somebody could testify in such a believable
manner and say the cumulative total of those awful, ugly, terrible
sexual things and expect a woman to date him or expect some form
of a relationship with a woman.
  It bothers me, because she appears to believe everything that she
said, and I myself don't want to call her a liar. But as an old trial
lawyer, I have seen witnesses just like that who believe every word
they say and every word is absolutely wrong and we have proven it
wrong and they still believe it.
  I am highly offended, having been the coauthor, along with Sena-
tor Kennedy, of the Polygraph Protection Act to protect employees
from being forced to go through polygraphs, that this group of han-
dlers of Professor Hill have had her undergo a polygraph.
  I can tell you right now, you can find a polygraph operator for
anything you want to find them for. There are some very good ones
and there are some lousy ones, and a whole raft in between. And to
do that and interject that in the middle of this is pathetic, as if it
has any relevance whatsoever. It wouldn't even be admissible in a
court of law.
  Now, I just want to ask you this last question. I have known
Judge Thomas for 11 years. I have sat in on all five of his confir-
mation proceedings. I presided over three of them, as chairman of
the Labor Committee. And I have never seen anything to indicate
that he would treat any human being like this woman says he
treated her.
  I am going to ask you to search your minds one last time: Is
there anything that could have been misconstrued or construed, in
your opinion, that could have caused anyone, including Anita Hill,
to say what she did here to the whole world?
  Ms. HOLT. Senator, since these allegations surfaced, that is all
I've really done, is wonder why
  Senator HATCH. Me, too.
                                                   363

  Ms. HOLT [continuing]. Why would she want to tell these lies,
and I haven't come up with an answer yet. But I can certainly say
that I don't believe a word of it.

  Senator HATCH. I think that sums it up pretty well.
  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I have one question I would
like to propound.
  The CHAIRMAN. I could ask a couple, too, but you go right ahead,
Senator. Instead of going back, we will go to you.
  Senator THURMOND. IS it possible that Professor Hill had a crush
on Judge Thomas and felt rejected, because he would not date her?
Any of you care to answer that?
  Ms. BERRY. Since I am the one who said that, you have got to
understand, I guess, what kind of man Clarence Thomas is. In
many ways, I think he is atypical in his treatment of women. He is
respectful of our abilities and our talents and expertise, allowed us
to have opportunities that ordinarily women did not have at the
Commission.
  My own title, as the Director of the Office of Congressional Af-
fairs, is a good example. That is usually the purview of a man. He
allowed us to do things that women ordinarily did not have the op-
portunity to do. He made sure that women were included in almost
every aspect of Commission life as it related to job opportunities.
  He is courteous, he is generous, he is caring, and I can under-
stand any woman responding to a man that has those kinds of at-
tributes.
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, as I said before, on the three occasions--and
I don't think it was more than that--that Anita Hill and I did go
out after work, from work, it was clear to me that she had very
friendly feelings towards now Judge Thomas and that she felt that
they were returned.
  I knew that she had been with him at the Department of Educa-
tion. I knew that they had met through a mutual friend, and I
knew that she had friendly feelings for him. That made it all the
more surprising to me, therefore, that she made these allegations. I
never got any sense from her that she had any romantic interest in
him at all. From my experience with her, that was not what she
was concerned about. As I said before, she saw him as a person
who was going places and was going to make a contribution in this
country, and both of us felt that we wanted to do whatever we
could to help him do that.
  In my case, at last, it was not to follow a rising star, necessarily,
and I can't say that that was her intention, either. I don't know.
We did not talk about him in those terms, but we did talk about
him when we went off together, and we talked about work and how
we could make him almost perfect. I think it was unreasonable, the
things that we wanted him to do, to be completely flawless, to be
100 percent perfect. No human being is that way, and when I was
in my twenties I was very judgmental and wanted people to be per-
fect, too, and I think that was part of the problem. But I don't see
that that would have led to this kind of an allegation.
  Senator THURMOND. Any other comments?
  [No response.]
                                             364

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Just for the record, as the Senator said, I appre-
ciate your direct answer, Ms. Fitch, and yours, Ms. Myers. But I
could ask you, for example, is it possible that there is life in outer
space? Is it possible there is life in outer space?
  Ms. FITCH. Of course, it's possible, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Myers, is it possible there's life in outer
space?
  Ms. BERRY. It's possible.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Now, let me ask you another question, if I may. Before I ask you
the question, let me make it clear that there has been a lot of dis-
cussion about records here and the testimony taken, when you
were giving testimony over the telephone or in person or to the
FBI, and I am not reading from the FBI. There are things that are
said here that seem inconsistent.
  I am not accusing you of inconsistency here, but I just want to
make sure I understand. You said in a question from staff, in the
staff interview--and it is only one thing, so I don't think you have
to have the whole page, but if you need it, I would be happy to give
it to you, page 57--the staff person asked you, "Did you see Anita
Hill's press conference on television?" And your answer was yes.

  Then the next question asked you, "Did you find her credible?"
Your answer was, "She sounded credible."

  Now, that is not necessarily inconsistent with what you said
today, but I want to make sure I understand. Today, you said that
you believed that you don't believe one word of Anita's Hill testi-
mony. Can you make a distinction between your saying "she sound-
ed credible" and what you said here?

  I might point out, before you answer it, I think that other Sena-
tors who question for the record should be able to understand that
there are these kinds of discrepancies that aren't nearly the dis-
crepancies they are made out to be, but go ahead.

  Ms. HOLT. What I meant was, if someone did not know Anita
Hill, she sounded credible. I know Anita Hill and I know Clarence
Thomas, and I know Clarence Thomas is not the kind of person
that would do those things.

  The CHAIRMAN. SO, notwithstanding the fact you said she sound-
ed credible, in response to the staff-

  Ms. HOLT. Right, if I did not know her-
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. You really meant to say, if you did
not know her, you thought she sounded credible?
  Ms. HOLT. She sounded credible. She presents herself well.
  The CHAIRMAN. And you just failed to say the first part, if you
did not know her, she sounded credible, is that correct?
  Ms. HOLT. That's correct.
  The CHAIRMAN. I accept that. I just want to make two points,
one, to clear up the discrepancy, and, two, to point out that wit-
nesses can appear to have discrepancies in these records, and there
would be no discrepancy at all, in fact.
  Now, let me ask you, Ms. Fitch, you have been extremely precise
in your answers. I think you have been extremely precise, you
made it absolutely clear that you think Clarence Thomas is an in-
                                         365

credibly admirable man, an admirable person and one whom you
don't believe said this.

  For example, in response to my good friend from Utah, you
pointed out what I think everyone in America does know, and that
is that there are men who do say things like that alleged to have
been said by the Judge.

  Now, you don't believe that the Judge said that, but you ex-
plained to us that you believe

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. From other men, not from the Judge.
  Ms. FITCH. Not from Judge Thomas, and I do not believe he
would say those things.
  The CHAIRMAN. I understand that, and I want to make it clear.
You do not believe that. You believe he is totally credible.

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU believe everything he is saying, but I want
the record to show what I think every woman in America knows,
that there are men who do say things exactly like what Judge
Thomas is accused of saying, notwithstanding my friend from
Utah's research creating the impression that it is so unusual that
it never happens.

  Senator HATCH. Not as a cumulative whole, though.

   Ms. FITCH. Oh, no.

  Senator HATCH. Well, see, that is what he is trying to get you to
say.

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  Senator HATCH. The fact is, he said one statement, but a cumula-
tive whole, if you hung around that fellow

  Ms. FITCH. Well, there might be two or three statements strung
together, but no, it is not a whole litany like that.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me put it another way, Ms. Fitch. And I was
very fastidious about never interrupting my friend from Utah, and
I assume he won't interrupt me again.

  Now what do you think, let me ask you, that man who said those
things to you, do you think if you had been in his company the
next 7 days, he might not have said similar things to you again and
again?

  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I was very sure he would say those things to
me in private if I was in his orbit, so I stayed away from him.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. That is cumulative.
  Now let me make another point, if I may. I want to make it
clear, because I understand and I believe everything that all of you
are saying. It is clear that you truly believe what you say to be cor-
rect and to be a legitimate and accurate characterization of Clar-
ence Thomas. I don't doubt that for a minute. You are under oath,
and it is clear that you all believe that. I am not suggesting any-
body has been put up to anything by anybody. I believe you believe
it.
  Now one of the things that has been indicated here is this notion
of maybe that the witness, Professor Hill, really was basically the
woman scorned, that she really had this romantic interest in Clar-
ence Thomas and that she was spurned, and after being spurned
she took up the role in the way that Shakespeare used the phrase,
                                                  366

"Hell hath no fury like . . . ," and that is what is being implied
here.

  Now, Ms. Fitch, you said you have no doubt, as I understand it,
that the Professor wanted very much to see the Judge move on and
do great things for America.

  Ms. FITCH. Be successful in his career, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Be successful. But I want the record to note--
and correct me if I am wrong--that in those conversations with the
professor where you drew that conclusion, that she wished to see
him succeed.

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU also went on to say, unless I misunderstood
you, that you did not believe there was any romantic element to
that.

  Ms. FITCH. Oh, no, Senator, and we both said the same things
about him, and for neither one of us was there any romantic talk
about him at all.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Now, Ms. Alvarez, in a statement that you issued after Professor
Hill's allegations became public, you observed, and I quote.

  Ms. Hill was not a team player and appeared to have her own agenda. She always
attempted to be aloof from the staff, constantly giving the impression she was supe-
rior to others on the staff.

  Then your statement goes on to conclude that Professor Hill had
a "penchant for being self-serving and condescending toward
others," and that the allegations she made "are absurd and are
clearly an attempt on her part to gain notoriety." You also said the
charges are "outrageous, ridiculous and totally without merit."

  Now, Ms. Alvarez, my question to you is this: Could there be a
different conclusion drawn from your observation that during her
tenure at EEOC, Professor Hill appeared "aloof from the staff?
You draw the conclusion from that that she was self-serving and
condescending. Could Professor Hill's aloofness have resulted from
feeling uncomfortable around the Chairman of the Commission?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, it was not her aloofness that made me feel like
she was condescending. She was aloof, and she has been described
that way by a number of people. The way she made me feel, she
acted condescending towards others, was that she would say she
had this inside track, she knew the Chairman better than anyone
else, and therefore she had some sort of rights, because she had
worked with him before, because she was close to him, because she
knew how he thought and that sort of thing. So she condescended
to others in that way.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, how about the aloofness part. Could the
aloofness be

  Ms. ALVAREZ. Well, she was not aloof from him. She was aloof
from the rest of the staff.

  The CHAIRMAN. I see. Now how do you know she wasn't aloof
from him?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. Just in the dealings that I saw. She never seemed
to avoid him. She never seemed to try and stay away

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.
                                                   367

  Ms. ALVAREZ [continuing]. Or she didn't respond to him in a staff
meeting or anything like that. I am saying that with the other staff
she was very stand-offish.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Ms. Holt, did you find her condescending and aloof? You dealt
with her probably more than anybody.

  Ms. HOLT. She wasn't condescending to me, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. She was not?

   Ms. HOLT. NO.

  The CHAIRMAN. I can understand why. She wanted to get in that
door, right?

  Ms. HOLT. That could have been it.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Myers--and my apologies, do you wish me to
refer to you as Ms. Berry-Myers or would you prefer
  Ms. BERRY. It doesn't matter, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right.
  Ms. BERRY. I know who you are talking to, either way.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Ms. Myers, did you find her to be aloof
and condescending?
  Ms. BERRY. I found her to be aloof, and a woman scorned can
mean not just in the romantic context, but if your ideas are not
longer, the ones that are considered the ones that the Chairman
adopts, if your point of view is not given more weight than some-
one else's, if your--there are many ways, and not just in the ro-
mantic sense, but in the ways that

  The CHAIRMAN. I'm sorry. How did you mean them, then?
  Ms. BERRY. Pardon me?
  The CHAIRMAN. HOW did you mean?
  Ms. BERRY. I meant it with both of those contexts.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU mean both romantic and in terms of being
rejected professionally, in a sense?
  Ms. BERRY. Yes. Those were my observations of Anita and the
situation.
  The CHAIRMAN. I see. Can you give me an example?
  Ms. BERRY. Of what?
  The CHAIRMAN. Of where she was either rejected and you ob-
served the reaction to her rejection, either in terms of romantic
entre or an intellectual entre?
  Ms. BERRY. Or an intellectual entre? That was my job, as I said,
to be the political eyes and ears, and that sometimes meant that I
had to advise the Chairman to take a position that was in his best
interest and that of the Commission, and not ofttimes a position
that was in the best interests of the bureaucracy or of one side or
the other. We had to do what was best in terms of enforcing the
law, administering and managing the agency, et cetera, et cetera,
and sometimes there were ideological conflicts in that way.
  And I have heard Anita characterized in the press as a conserva-
tive, and I guess I have a different opinion of what that means. At
the Commission I would not have characterized Anita as a conserv-
ative. I would have characterized her more as a moderate person or
a liberal, and there were times when it was necessary that the con-
servative view prevail, in my opinion, on some positions that the
Chairman took that she adamantly disagreed with.
                                                    368

  The CHAIRMAN. HOW would you characterize yourself, Ms.
Myers?

  Ms. BERRY. I would characterize
  The CHAIRMAN. AS conservative or liberal, I mean, or moderate
or whatever.
  Ms. BERRY. NOW that's a good question. On some issues I am very
conservative; on some issues I am not.
  The CHAIRMAN. I see that.
  Senator LEAHY. Aren't we all?
  The CHAIRMAN. IS that not also the case for the Professor?
  Ms. BERRY. Obviously, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. I see, so she is just like you, then?
  Ms. BERRY. NO, she is not. I haven t alleged that Clarence
Thomas
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, no, no. I mean
  Ms. BERRY. SO she is not like me. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, no. I mean in terms of her political ideology.
  Ms. BERRY. On some things, perhaps.
  The CHAIRMAN. Does anybody else want to ask a question?
  Senator LEAHY. This is not a question. I just would like to note
something for the record, if I might, Mr. Chairman. And that is
that Senator Hatch referred in just the last few minutes to Anita
Hill's handlers somehow, Svengali-like--my term, not his--sending
her out to take a polygraph.
  I would just note for the record, according to her sworn testimo-
ny, the first suggestion of a polygraph came when the administra-
tion sent the FBI to talk to her. According to what she stated here,
she told us that the FBI asked her if she would be willing to take a
polygraph and she said--again according to her testimony here--
that indeed she would.
  I have no idea of the qualifications of whomever administered it
or anything else. I have just heard about it. It would not be admis-
sible in a court of law. Nobody is required to take a polygraph, but
I just wanted to note, for the record, that the first suggestion of
that came not from somebody advising Professor Hill but from, ac-
cording to her testimony, the people the administration sent out on
the investigation that was requested by the White House and this
committee.
  Senator HATCH. If the Senator would yield on that point, as the
co-author along with Senator Kennedy of the Polygraph Protection
Act, we did a lot of study of this, and there is no question that poly-
graphs should only be given under certain circumstances, with the
approval of both sides, and not unilaterally by one side that may be
very biased. You can find a polygraph operator to do anything you
want them to do, just like you can find a pollster. Some pollsters in
this country, not many, but some will do anything. They will find
any conclusion you want, just by changing the questions.
  Then again, polygraph operators, there are circumstances where
people really believe what they are doing. They really believe it. It
is totally false, but they believe it. She may very well be in that
category, and might even pass a real polygraph examination.
   So to throw that in the middle of a Supreme Court nomination
as though it is real, legitimate evidence is highly offensive, that is
my only point, and highly political, and again, too pat, too slick,
                                         369

exactly what a two-bit slick lawyer would try to do in the middle of
something as important as this. Now that is the point I was rais-
ing.

  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, the point to be made is that it
was the FBI, sent by the White House, who first suggested the
polygraph.

  Senator HATCH. NO, that is not true. That is not true. It was this
committee, not the White House. It was this committee.

  Senator LEAHY. IS that why the report first goes to the White
House?

  The CHAIRMAN. Will the Senator withhold?
  The FBI was asked by the Majority and the Minority to investi-
gate. The White House, the administration, has to authorize that
when we request it.
  Senator LEAHY. That's right.

   The CHAIRMAN. It was in the FBI

  Senator LEAHY. I am referring to the sworn testimony here.
  Senator HATCH. It's a terrible thing, I'll tell you.
  Senator LEAHY. The sworn testimony
  Senator HATCH. YOU only use it when it benefits her.
  Senator LEAHY. The sworn testimony of Professor Hill was that
she said that she was prepared to take an FBI polygraph.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, might I be heard for one
minute?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes, you may.

  Senator SPECTER. I think on this subject it ought to be said that
lie detector tests are not generally admissible in court

  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. Because they do not have the req-
uisite reliability. I have extensive experience, being the Assistant
Counsel to the Warren Commission, which I was present when
Jack Ruby's lie detector test was taken, and that is a very different
circumstance. But notwithstanding the fact that Jack Ruby passed
it all without any indication of deception, when J. Edgar Hoover
forwarded the report to the Warren Commission, it was his state-
ment that the polygraph ought not to be accepted because it wasn't
sufficiently reliable. And while we talk about it, it is generally ac-
cepted, a general principle of law, that a polygraph lie detector test
is not admissible in court because of the lL*ck of requisite reliabil-
ity.

  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator is correct, and this is one Senator,
and I think most believe that lie detector tests are not--are not--
the appropriate way to get to the truth. That wasn't the issue I
thought that was being raised here. The issue I thought being
raised here was whether or not some slick lawyer cajoled or co-
erced this particular individual into taking a He detector test. Now
let me

   Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman?
   The CHAIRMAN. Yes?
   Senator METZENBAUM. I don't know anything at all about poly-
graphs or lie detectors, but as I understand it there is a reference
paper indicating the credentials of the company or of the man who
took the polygraph test. I think it would be appropriate--I think
the CIA does use polygraph tests, I don't know that for sure, but I
                                             370

think they do--and I would just suggest that whatever the creden-
tials are of the individual or company that took the test, that that
be included in the record at this point.

  The CHAIRMAN. I would object to that. I believe that the admis-
sion in the record of a lie detector test this committee had nothing
to do with ordering, and cannot vouch for the credentials. And
even if they could vouch for the credentials of the person issuing
the lie detector test, if we get to the point in this country where lie
detector tests are the basis upon which we make judgments and
insist upon people having them, and by inference of those who
don't have them that they did something wrong, we have reached a
sad day for the civil liberties of this country.

  That does not go to the issue of whether the individual is entitled
to, on their own, ask for a lie detector test. People can make of it
what they wish.

  Now let me
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I commend you for that
stand.

  Senator HATCH. SO do I, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator LEAHY. I happen to agree with it too, Mr. Chairman,
while we are passing out kudos here.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I am flattered. Let's move on. Thank you
very much. Now let's move on.

  Ms. Fitch, I want to clarify something in the record, again an ap-
parent inconsistency; it may not be.

  I have been in and out of the room trying to accommodate some
administrative requirements, and I apologize for not being here.
Correct me if I am wrong.

  I am under the impression that you told Senator Hatch that you
did not go to lunch with Anita Hill.

  Ms. FITCH. I did. And I said it because I tend not to go to lunch.
Period.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, is the letter that you--I don't want to mis-
state anything. Hang on.

  I would like to ask staff to give you this letter, the original of
this letter. The letter I am referring to is a letter written by you,
allegedly written by you to Ms. Hill. The members of the commit-
tee have a copy of this letter.

  Again, this may not be an inconsistency. I just want to be sure I
understand. This letter, I might add, was submitted to the commit-
tee, to me and to Senator Thurmond, on October 12, from Warren
W. Gardner, counsel for Anita Hill.

  Just so people--while you are reading it, there is nothing sala-
cious in it. There is nothing outrageous. There is nothing, other
than for you to explain to me and for the record.

  Ms. FITCH. I did, this is my handwriting. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, will you read--this sounds like a trial.
Would you explain the first three or four sentences to us?
  Ms. FITCH. Should I read it?
  The CHAIRMAN. If you would like. I just want you to explain
what appears to be an inconsistency.
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, ask anybody, I rarely went to lunch.
                                         371

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I am not suggesting--read the first sentence,
or the first two sentences. Unless you think that it is too private to
read.

  Ms. FITCH. Oh. All right. Read it out loud?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, would you read it out loud, please.
  Ms. FITCH. Life is dull without you. I keep looking for someone to
go to lunch with or sneak out to an early movie with.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is sufficient.
  Ms. FITCH. NOW there is nobody.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is sufficient.
  Now, would you just explain for the record what you mean you
say "I keep looking for someone to go to lunch with," "without
you," and your statement that you didn't go to lunch with Anita
Hill?
  Ms. FITCH. I don't remember ever going to lunch with Anita Hill.
It is probably just hyperbole, Senator. Really.
  The CHAIRMAN. I see. I don't doubt you.
  Ms. FITCH. I may have gone into her office with a sandwich that
I got from the snack bar and sat in her office and eaten it. But I
was not in the office that often.
  The CHAIRMAN. Sufficient. I am not being accusatory. I just
want, because it is in the record and every Senator has this
  Ms. FITCH. I don't see any inconsistency, what I just said and
what is actually the truth. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. I just want to make the point again that honora-
ble, decent people like you can say things that seem inconsistent,
and I hope we understand that other people on the record can say
things in the record that appear to be inconsistent and in fact are
not inconsistent.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I want to call your attention.
  The CHAIRMAN. Sure.
  Senator THURMOND. She says "I keep looking for someone to go
to lunch with." She didn't say she went to lunch with her.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I agree with that. That is why I just asked.
But most people would assume, if I wrote you a letter, Senator,
after I retired, which would be long before you will, and I said,
"Dear Strom, it's really dull not being in the Senate, I keep looking
for someone to go to lunch with," any reasonable person would
assume that you and I went to lunch based on that. I don't say we
went to lunch, but reasonable persons would assume that. And that
is all I wanted to clear up.
  Senator THURMOND. I wouldn't say "would" to him. I would say
"could."
  Ms. FITCH. I think I was writing her a cheery letter. I did miss
her. She was one of the first people that I met when
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me make it clear, Ms. Fitch. I totally believe
you. I think it is a totally clear explanation. I don't doubt it for a
moment, and I don't doubt your credibility.
  But, again, I would point it out for my colleagues on the commit-
tee who are trying to be very precise. If I wanted to make the
case

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. I could have very easily made the
case, and all the press to the best of their ability would write down,
                                             372

I suspect, and say, "Geez. Biden just tripped her up. Biden just
showed that she really did go to lunch with her." And you didn't. I
believe you didn't. I accept it.

  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I said that I may very well have gone to
snack bar and gotten a sandwich and eaten in her office.

  The CHAIRMAN. I understand. I understand.
  Now, let me move on--and I sincerely do not question your credi-
bility.
  Ms. Myers, and I only have a few more questions--well, as a
matter of fact, you have been on a long time. I won't ask any more
questions.
  Anyone else have any more questions? Whomever, Senator Thur-
mond I recognize.
  Senator THURMOND. I recognize Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, thank you very much. You have been
very impressive, and the night wears on and we have got a lot
more to do. But I, since we are putting statements and things in
the record about polygraphs, I want to get in the record a state-
ment by Larry Thompson, Esquire, former U.S. attorney, with
regard to the issue of the total unreliability of a polygraph test,
and thank Senators Kennedy and Hatch for the Polygraph Protec-
tion Act which protects people from this kind of stuff.
  This is a real, you know, bush league kind of a thing in the midst
of these type of activities. And most of us practiced law here or
somewhere, and it really is quite extraordinary. And then, you
know, if the resources of the handlers have been directed to this
letter, which is a simple letter of friendship from Ms. Fitch to
Anita Hill with nothing in it at all, then it does continue to get to
be a longer night.
  Whether you had lunch with anybody or nobody, there is nothing
in this letter. There is nothing even to be gained from that letter.
  The CHAIRMAN. If the Senator would yield?
  Senator SIMPSON. I certainly will, because I am commenting.
  The CHAIRMAN. It was only offered, not to purport that there was
anything in there that was
  Senator SIMPSON. My time is not running. Go ahead. I just want
to be sure about my time.
  The CHAIRMAN. Your time won't run.
  Senator SIMPSON. Okay.
  The CHAIRMAN. It was only offered, not to purport that there was
anything extraordinary in it, as I said even before I showed it to
the witness. It was done, I assume, by not her handlers, by her law-
yers. Now, if we are calling handlers, then I assume everybody has
handlers out there.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, let's be quite honest here as to
what is going on. When Ms. Hill came here to testify the other day,
this whole front row was filled with people. I thought they were
family. They were not. They were attorneys. Some were friends.
Some were paid. And Ms. Hill has a public relations firm which
she has hired, or someone has hired for her, and that is public
record. So let's get that in to the American people, and know that
in these extraordinary activities she does have what anyone would
call, could call handlers. A public relations firm for a witness is un-
heard of during my time here, plus handlers.
                                             373

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, I am not arguing with that. It is no dif-
ferent than Mr. Duberstein, who has a public relations firm, that
has been hired by the White House to "handle the nominee."

  All I am saying is there is nothing wrong with any of that. Noth-
ing about it is pejorative, on either side. I don't think we should
make it that.

  I assume the reason the letter was sent to the Senator and
myself--the ranking member--was because there was concern
about the testimony being given. I guess why we were given the
letter, might come up and be something totally inconsistent with
the relationship.

  It was not inconsistent. But that is the reason I assume the letter
was there.

  Ms. FITCH. And it was as I stated, that we were friendly.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU did. I say for the 400th time.
  Ms. FITCH. NO. I understand, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am not questioning your integrity. I do not
question it. I believe you are telling the truth as you know it, as
you have observed it. I believe you.
  Senator THURMOND. In fact, you would believe all of them,
wouldn't you?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. I don't question any of them. I do not ques-
tion any of them as to the facts. I question their judgment some-
times as to being able to make these leaps of faith.
  Ms. Myers is a wonderful woman. I question her instinct that
says that there was romantic interest. I don't know it to be true or
not true. That is pure speculation on the part of Ms. Myers. I don't
question anything else that Ms. Myers testified to as the facts.
  Senator THURMOND. YOU might ask her why she said that, if you
want to.

   The CHAIRMAN. YOU did. We did. I did.

  Senator THURMOND. That is why I said it.
  The CHAIRMAN. And now let's go back to the Senator from Wyo-
ming, whose time it is.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I do appreciate
your unfailing patience as we grind on. But I did want that state-
ment of Larry Thompson to appear in the record which, of course,
says, as I indicated, that they are not admissible in the workplace.
And thanks to Senators Kennedy and Hatch employers are not al-
lowed to use that as a club over their employees.
   Furthermore, Mr. Thompson goes on to say, "In the context of
these proceedings I understand, based on information from reliable
scientific sources, that if a person suffers from a delusional disor-
der he or she may pass a polygraph test. Therefore, a polygraph
examination in this context has absolutely no bearing on whether
the events at issue are true or untrue."
  That is not my quote. That is his. And now let's go to some ques-
tions. Just a few, please.
  The calls, the logger of the calls. I have heard about you, Ms.
Holt, and I would like to have someone like you as my gatekeeper.
But I do, and they are very good. Let me ask you this.
   The last call from Ms. Hill, after maybe 15 or 16 calls, some
logged, some not logged, some just talking to you as a friend, or if
she would talk to Nancy Fitch as a friend, or Phyllis Berry-Myers
                                               374

as a friend, or J.C. Alvarez, she was someone you knew and I
assume, you know--in all the ways I leave it to you. You have de-
scribed your relationship. I won't embellish that.

  But, in any event, there were no more calls to you after the last
one about the marriage. Isn't that the last one we have recorded
for our records?

  Ms. HOLT. That is right, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. In other words, the calls came from 1984 to
1988, 1987--August of 1987, by a woman who had heaped a garbage
of verbiage upon her in her life. And the calls continued to come,
15 or 16 of them, and then they ended on that August 4 day in the
afternoon when she found--and did you tell her that Clarence had
married?
  Ms. HOLT. I don't recall that, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. YOU remember that conversation?
  Ms. HOLT. Not really. I don't.
  Senator SIMPSON. In any event, she left the message, which is of
the record, congratulations, and that was that.
  Senator THURMOND. On the marriage.
  Senator SIMPSON. On the marriage. And so that is the last call
that Ms. Hill ever made to your knowledge to the agency?
  Ms. HOLT. That is the last one to my knowledge, yes.
  Senator SIMPSON. Let me ask--you made a statement, Ms. Alva-
rez, on page 4. A rather powerful comment about Ms. Hill and your
alarm as to what she had done and said. It was something to the
effect--you have your statement there?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Um-hum.
  Senator SIMPSON. It was page 4. I quote from page 4, at the top:
"I don't know how else to say it, but it blew my mind to see Anita
Hill testifying Friday. Honest to goodness, it was like schizophre-
nia. That was not the Anita Hill I knew and worked with at the
EEOC. On Friday, she played the role of a meek, innocent, shy
Baptist girl from the South who was a victim of this big bad man."
That is quite a powerful statement.
  Why did you say this reference to schizophrenia?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Because there were two different personalities.
  Senator THURMOND. Speak out so we can hear you, please.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. There were two different personalities. When I
worked with Anita Hill and I knew her, as I said, she was not a
victim. She was a very tough woman. She stood her ground. She
didn't take a lot of anything from anyone, and she made sure you
knew it.
  And the person who was here Friday was somebody who played a
totally different role. Who was I am meek, I am shy, I am over-
whelmed, I am victimized. And that was not the Anita Hill I knew.
It was two different personalities.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, based upon the years that you have
known her, all of you, and worked with Anita Hill, have any of you
ever known her to exaggerate small slights that you might have
seen, make a big deal out of something that didn't warrant it?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Well, the exaggeration that I saw in her probably
most often was about her relationship with the Chairman. You
know, that she knew how he thought, she had some sort of special
                                                   375

insight into him, that sort of thing. That was the exaggeration that
I saw.

  Senator SIMPSON. And so, and I am going to conclude. So have
you ever known her to focus on an injustice of some sort that she
felt should be remedied? Have any of you seen that? You do. I just
asked you because you used that phrase. And I wonder if any of
you have ever witnessed in her some exaggeration of a slight or fo-
cusing on an injustice of some sort. Do you recall that?

  Ms. HOLT. I don't recall, Senator.
  Ms. FITCH. There was once an overreaction that stuck out in my
mind. It wasn't important, but I thought it was clearly an overreac-
tion. But it was not about anything terribly important.
  Senator SIMPSON. Did you notice anything like that, Ms. Myers.
  Senator METZENBAUM [presiding]. Senator, your time is up, and I
have tried to be patient. It has gone over for several minutes.
  Senator SIMPSON. I know but I haven't--just the final witness, if
I might. Did you notice anything like that in what I asked?
  Ms. BERRY. Not that I remember. Not that I can remember.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you.
  Ms. Berry or Berry-Myers, you made one statement that I found
quite interesting. You said that, "In that capacity I have been
privy to the most intimate detail of his life," meaning, of course,
Judge Thomas.

  Were you familiar with the details of his family life?
  Ms. BERRY. Somewhat. What I meant by that was having to go
through the confirmation process I am witness to like--FBI docu-
ments, letters for or against, background checks, you know, those
sorts of things. That is what I meant by that.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Those are the professional parts. You
were saying the most intimate details of his life. Did you know, for
example, of his relationship with his son?

  Ms. BERRY. Yes. His son and my son were friends, and are
friends.

  Senator METZENBAUM. And did you know the ladies he dated, if
any? I am not even sure if he was married at the time you made
that statement.

  Ms. BERRY. Yes, I know.
  Senator METZENBAUM. YOU knew the ladies he went out with so-
cially?
  Ms. BERRY. Some, yes. Yes. I know of them. Some I know. And I
knew his wife, yes. His first wife, Kathy.
  Senator METZENBAUM. DO you know about personal problems
that he had, if any?
  Ms. BERRY. I know how, I know the struggle that it was when he
was separating from his wife, what impact that had on his life and
his son's life.
  Senator METZENBAUM. The reason I asked the question is be-
cause Judge Thomas said in his statement, "I do not and will not
commingle my personal life with my work life, nor did I commingle
their personal life with the work life. I can think of nothing that
would lead her to this," was the last sentence. It is not relevant to
this point.
                                             376

  But the point is he says that he kept his personal life extremely
private. You seem to indicate that it was sort of public.

  Let me just ask
  Ms. BERRY. There is not an inconsistency in that or what--what
he has said or what I am saying. In the professional contact that I
had with this man I also got to know of his private life, his private
travails and things. Because that was part of my job in preparing
him for processes like this one.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Let me just ask each of you a question
which can be answered yes or no. Each of you has testified as to
the qualities of Judge Clarence Thomas and with a great deal of
respect, and one of the--a major issue in this matter relates to
Anita Hill's testimony about certain claims of sexual harassment.
  I ask you yes or no. Could Clarence Thomas have made such re-
marks to Anita Hill, whatever those remarks, absent your presence
and you would never have known anything about it?
  Ms. BERRY. Of course, Senator, if we weren't there we wouldn't
know anything about it.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Pardon?
  Ms. BERRY. If we weren't present, we wouldn't know anything
about it.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Correct. Would each of you answer? Isn't
that the fact for each of you? That you actually would--it would be
normal if a man were making such remarks at the workplace or
any other place that other workers would not be familiar with
those remarks?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Senator, I don't think any of us could account for
his time 24 hours a day, even in the office. But we know the man
that he is and we know that he is not capable of making those re-
marks.
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I had said, I think carefully, that I was talk-
ing about probability in terms of the Judge, not possibility. Any-
thing is possible, but the probability for me was nil.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Ms. Fitch.
  Ms. Holt, do you care to comment?
  Ms. HOLT. It is true that those comments could have been made
in private, a private moment between he and Ms. Hill. However, I
do feel that if this were going on I would have discerned something
at some point, and I did not.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Thurmond?
  Senator THURMOND. Senator Grassley will inquire.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Taking off on a point that Senator Metz-
enbaum just raised, and following an axiom of politics--or maybe
it's one that even ought to be practiced in every day life--if you
always tell the truth, then you don't have to worry about what you
told somebody else and you won't be in a mode of lying to cover up
another lie. So always tell the truth and you won't get in trouble.
  As a practical matter, if Mr. Thomas was doing all of the things
that Professor Hill accuses him of, he wouldn't have been doing
them just with her. It would be a weakness that would come out in
conversations and with activities with other people that surely
there is no way that this could have been covered up.
                                             377

  I mean it would have come out some place if a person had a
weakness like this.

  Ms. BERRY. That's my belief.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I primarily ask the question, not based on
your understanding of personal behavior, but rather in your office.
In your office environment could anything like this have been kept
secret?
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, no. My office was not in the suite of the
Chairman. It was on staff floors and I heard all kinds of things
about things that were happening in the Commission, about other
people. There were never any stories floating around about the
chairman in a negative or of this kind of nature is what I am
saying.
  Senator GRASSLEY. And especially in Washington, D.C. If two
people know about something it is no longer a secret in this town.
  Ms. BERRY. And there were no secrets at the EEOC, believe me.
  Senator GRASSLEY. There were no secrets at the EEOC?
  Ms. BERRY. NO secrets.
   Senator GRASSLEY. SO I mean there is no way, given how people
are, especially in this town, that an activity like this could have
been a secret?

   Ms. HOLT. NO.
   Ms. BERRY. NO.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Okay. I have just kind of a comment about
something that Senator Leahy asked you folks. He asked if you had
any information about why Anita Hill would jeopardize her career
by coming forward with public allegations about Judge Thomas.

   Now, I am not sure that this is a relevant question. Professor
Hill admits that she never expected her allegations to be made
public, so the possibility of public disclosure must not have been a
factor in her decision to accuse Judge Thomas. And by making
secret allegations behind closed doors she would not have to worry
about jeopardizing her career or reputation.

   Does that sound reasonable to you?
   Ms. FITCH. I have said previously that I have no idea of motiva-
tion. I can't ascribe motivation to other people, only to myself.
   Ms. BERRY. And I am not a mind reader, Senator, so I have no
idea what was going through her mind.
   Ms. HOLT. I have no ideas.
   Ms. ALVAREZ. I have no explanation.
   Senator GRASSLEY. There has been some suggestion by Ms. Alva-
rez that there may be two Anita Hills, because you never knew the
one that you saw on television. I want to ask the other three of
you, while you were working with Anita Hill, did you see that she
could have been two different people? You saw her as an aggressive
lawyer arguing for her position very vocally, fighting for her posi-
tion, etc.
   Did you ever see another side to her, so that there could be some
reason to believe that she was other than just this aggressive
person? Any hint of that in any way?
   Ms. HOLT. I never saw another side.
   Ms. FITCH. I saw her as a smart person and also as a reserved
one and that is pretty much what I saw the other day, except the

        56-273 O--93 13
                                               378

story was something I had never heard before. No, so the answer
is, no.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Okay. Ms. Berry?

   Ms. BERRY. NO.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me also ask you about Professor Hill: you
know the old saying that a certain individual would even walk on
their grandmother to get ahead. Is she the sort of a person? Did
you ever see her as being that sort of a person that would do any-
thing just to get ahead?

  Ms. FITCH. NO, Senator.

   Ms. HOLT. NO, I did not.

  Senator GRASSLEY. MS. Berry.
  Ms. BERRY. TO have ambition, to be ambitious, yes, but to do any-
thing? I don't know.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I also saw her as quite ambitious and I have said
so. To take it to the extent that she has, I think it kind of got out
of hand, maybe before she even realized it.
  Senator GRASSLEY. My time is up.
  The CHAIRMAN. If you need more time, Senator, go ahead, take a
few more minutes. You have been very patient, extremely patient.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Given your expertise as a historian, Professor
Fitch, I wondered if I might ask you to draw on that background
for a moment. You heard Judge Thomas testify Friday comparing
his treatment here to a lynching. I would like to have you explain
or elaborate on that comparison for us.
  Why is this ordeal, defending against a charge of sex harass-
ment, similar to a lynching, as he put it?
  Ms. FITCH. I haven't talked to the Judge since he made those
comments, but when he made those comments I felt that I under-
stood them. I have a student who is working on lynching right now,
so I have been thinking about this. Lynching was something that
was done to intimidate people, that was done to control them, as
well as kill them. And I think, if I understand what the Judge was
saying, was that this was an attempt to do that to him; that the
process, the subsequent confirmation hearings process, this process
was patently unfair, that it was a way to neutralize and control
and intimidate not just him, but possibly through him, any person
that was considered, as he put it, uppity.
  When black soldiers came back from World War I, they felt that
they had proved themselves to the country and to their fellow citi-
zens; and wore their uniforms down south and that was a sure way
to get yourself lynched, because they were wrapped, so to speak, in
the American flag. That was to tell these people that they were not
Americans. I see a connection and understood what he meant by
that. He said electronic lynching, I believe.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, do you sense then that there has to be a
larger group of people that see him or people who think like him
as a threat that must be put down right now or worry about what
will happen if they are not put down right now?
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I have talked to a colleague who worked with
us on personal staff who you may have a statement from, I am not
sure, and we talked about this on the phone and his words, subse-
quently, I think used in the press were character assassination. For
me the operative word there is assassination. And the other word
                                      379

is neutralization and I felt and some of us do feel that any person
of color in this country who goes against the stream of what people
think black people in this country should be thinking and feeling
and doing by so distinguishing themselves, put themselves at great
risk.

  This is not something that my colleague and I felt only because
of the last few weeks. This is something we talked about years ago
and tried to talk to the Judge about, and in a comment to a friend
last evening, I said, if he didn't understand what we were trying to
say then--and obviously we were not beating him over the head
with it, because it is a very uncomfortable thing to say to some-
one--I was assured that after his testimony of the last 2 days he
understood it now.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes. I had a black leader in my State advise
me to be against him, saying. "He doesn't even speak our lan-
guage."

  What is meant by that? I honestly don't know.
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I don't know what the person who said that
meant, but I think it means that that person is somehow perceived
to be outside the group, is not in some perceived lock-step. And I
think if you look at the history of black people in this country you
see that people have always had diverse views. We are not a mono-
lithic community in thought. And I think that is a huge mistake
for the dominant society to think and for us to buy into.
  And I suppose that--I don't know the situation you are talking
about--but that is probably what that meant.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, have you ever heard other black Ameri-
can leaders use the expression, he doesn't even speak our lan-
guage?
  Ms. FITCH. I don't know if I have heard the exact words, but I
have gotten the distinct impression from working and watching
Judge Thomas and how he seems to be perceived by black leaders,
some of them, that that is something that they are saying, in
effect, if they are not using those exact words. So I understand
what that means.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, it is almost like denouncing the individ-
uality that we worship in America.
  Ms. FITCH. I think, Senator, the problem is that when you are a
community under siege it is very difficult for people to want to
allow diversity of opinion. It is understandable. I don't like it but it
is understandable and I don't think in any situation where you
have communities that are considered minority and where there
are a majority community around them that you are going to find
this kind of attitude.
  Senator GRASSLEY. In other words, we are all going to hang to-
gether or hang separately?
  Ms. FITCH. That, I think that is one way of explaining it, yes,
Senator. That may be a simplistic way of doing it. I am sure there
are other things involved, but, certainly that is one way of putting
it. And I don't think it is just true in this country, it's probably
true in South Africa, and in other places where there are commu-
nities under seige within the countries that they live in, and the
societies that they live in.
                                             380

  Senator GRASSLEY. SO you intellectually lynch the people who do
want to

  Ms. FITCH. That's one way of doing it, Senator. That is probably
the lesser of many evils.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Okay, I am done.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much.
  Let me clear up two facts and you have been here a long time.
We are not going to hold you much longer. But Ms. Holt, on the
last page of the transcript that you have in front of you of your
logs, there is an insertion or an addition, an addendum, that has
one message on it, the very last page. And it is in a different form
than the others are and it says, "Judge, 11-1-90, 1:40", etc.
  And the handwriting seems to be different from all the other
handwriting.
  Ms. HOLT. It is different.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS it yours?
  Ms. HOLT. NO, it isn't. This was probably taken at the court.
  The CHAIRMAN. I want the record to show that this is not admis-
sible as part of your telephone logs and it is not admissible in the
record. Ms. Holt cannot testify as to whether or not this is true, is
that correct, Ms. Holt?
  Ms. HOLT. That is correct, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, therefore, it is not admissible as a part of the
record.
  Now, let me ask one other thing. Do any of you know Sacari
Hardnet?
  Ms. HOLT. I knew her, Senator.
  Ms. FITCH. Yes, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you, Ms. Alvarez?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. NO.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Fitch, you know her?

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Holt you know her?

   Ms. HOLT. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Myers, do you know her?
  Ms. BERRY. NO, I don't know her.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, can Ms. Fitch and Ms. Holt tell me who
she is? Ms. Holt?
  Ms. HOLT. She was a legal intern in the Office of the Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. At EEOC?
  Ms. HOLT. At EEOC. What happens is that we hire legal interns
while they are still in law school. When they graduate law school
they have a certain period, and I don't know what that is, to pass
the bar. Their titles are then changed to attorney.
  Ms. Hardnet completed law school but she failed the bar so she
had to be dismissed from her position.
  The CHAIRMAN. I see. Do you know who she is?

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. What do you know of her?
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, the same thing.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you work with her at all?
  Ms. FITCH. I vaguely remember that I might have been involved
in some project or she might have been involved in some project I
was working on. I remember her but I can't tell you what that
                                      381

project might have been about and I don't recall that she was there
more than maybe 9 months.

  The CHAIRMAN. More than maybe
  Ms. FITCH. I don't think she was there more than 9 months, if
possibly that long. That's my recollection.
  The CHAIRMAN. What is your recollection, Ms. Holt?
  Ms. HOLT. NO more than a year, at any rate.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you hear the Chairman's testimony last
night?

   Ms. HOLT. I did.

  The CHAIRMAN. The Judge's testimony and the Judge will have
an opportunity to come back and he can clarify this, but maybe
you can help me. Remember when I was asking him about legal
assistants, you may remember I asked him who his legal assistants
were and he corrected the record and he said I had more than one
legal assistant?

  Ms. HOLT. I think he was referring to the Department of Educa-
tion.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. That was my question.
  I also want the record to show that my friend from Wyoming, in
an attempt to save me from myself, has suggested to me that it was
not William Shakespeare who said, "Hell hath no fury." I still
thought Shakespeare may have said it as well, but he says William
Congrave said it, and the phrase was, "Heaven hath no rage like
love to hatred turned, nor hell fury like a woman scorned."
  I want the record to show that and thank him for that. [Laugh-
ter.]
  I also must tell you that I have my staff researching Shakespeare
to see if he said it, not that I think Mr. Congrave would ever pla-
giarize Shakespeare. [Laughter.]
  Does anybody have any further questions?
  Senator SPECTER. Could I inquire, Mr. Chairman?
  Senator THURMOND. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I welcome the chance to talk to you ladies because you are an
unusual panel here which is testifying on behalf of Judge Thomas,
but knows Professor Hill very well. What we have been searching
for in this long proceeding is some way to understand the issue of
motivation and each of you has testified very forcefully that you
think Judge Thomas is correct that the charges are false.
  Let me start with you, Ms. Holt, because you seem to know Pro-
fessor Hill very well. Were you surprised when these charges were
leveled?
  Ms. HOLT. I was absolutely surprised, I was in shock.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, knowing--I expected that to be your
answer--knowing Professor Hill as you do and being confident that
Judge Thomas is in the clear, do you have any insight to shed on
what Professor Hill may be doing, what her motivation is, if you
think she is not telling the truth?
  Ms. HOLT. I know, I mean the allegations she has made are not
even in character with Clarence Thomas.
  Senator SPECTER. But is it in character with Professor Hill to
make such charges?
  Ms. HOLT. I never thought so, sir.
                                             382

  Senator SPECTER. SO you have it out of character for Judge
Thomas to do this and you have it out of character for Professor
Hill to make the charges.

  Ms. HOLT. Right.
  Senator SPECTER. Then why is she making the charges?
  Ms. HOLT. I have no idea, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. NO speculation?
  Ms. HOLT. None whatsoever, but I hope they find out.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I think that with you four women we
have as good a chance to find out as any way.
  Ms. Fitch, you were very friendly. You didn't go to lunch with
her, but you knew her very well.
  Ms. FITCH. We might have had lunch, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. I am sorry, I can't hear you.
  Ms. FITCH. We might have had lunch together, Senator, I am
not
  Senator SPECTER. But at any rate, you were close to her, you
were friendly with her?
  Ms. FITCH. Yes, exactly.
  Senator SPECTER. And when you first heard of these charges
against Judge Thomas what was your reaction?
  Ms. FITCH. I was stunned. I was absolutely stunned.
  Senator SPECTER. Stunned?
  Ms. FITCH. Yes, and I still am.
  Senator SPECTER. Still stunned?

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. Was it in character for Professor Hill to make
false charges like this?

  Ms. FITCH. I have never known Professor Hill to make false
charges. And as I said

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you knew her very well for how long?
  Ms. FITCH. We were together from July 1982 to whenever she left
in 1983, and I stayed in touch with her for possibly 2 years and I
called maybe once every other month.
  Senator SPECTER. Lots of contacts?
  Ms. FITCH. Excuse me?
  Well, when I was in the office and she was in the office we saw
each other.
  Senator SPECTER. Talked to her a great deal?
  Ms. FITCH. Yes, I did because
  Senator SPECTER. Got to know her pretty well?
  Ms. FITCH [continuing]. I felt she was kind of the person I could
of relate to since I was new on the staff and she had been with the
Chairman for some time, and I just felt that she was somebody I
kind of gravitated to, to kind of get
  Senator SPECTER. But no idea, not any speculation?
  Ms. FITCH. NO speculation because there was no basis in the con-
versations that we have had and we had many at work.
  Senator SPECTER. MS. Berry, you have testified that your rela-
tionship was barely speaking professionally and we have already
had extensive----
  Ms. BERRY. With Angela Wright, but not with Anita Hill.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. No, no, I am coming with Profes-
sor Hill. Oh, your relationship with Professor Hill was
                                             383

  Ms. BERRY. She has described it, and it was so, that it was a cor-
dial, friendly, professional relationship.

  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. So, were you surprised when you
read her statement in the news conference on October 7 that refer-
ring to you, that she doesn't know me and I don't know her?

   Ms. BERRY. Yes.

  Senator SPECTER. When you first heard of the charges by Profes-
sor Hill against Judge Thomas, what was your reaction?

  Ms. BERRY. I was devastated and I was angry. I couldn't under-
stand how someone--for a man who helped nurture her career, on
the word of a good friend of his and hers, gave her a job at the
Department of Education, subsequently asked her to join him at
the EEOC, come to the EEOC, gave her responsibilities there, sup-
ported her, acted as her mentor, gave her recommendations to go
to Oral Roberts, helped her to secure that job

  Senator SPECTER. But is she the kind of a person to make false
charges, prior to the time that these were made?

  Ms. BERRY [continuing]. I hadn't known her to be such.
  Senator SPECTER. HOW well did you know her?
  Ms. BERRY. I knew her professional. I'm not much of a socializer,
but I didn't socialize.
  Senator SPECTOR. But over how long a period did you know her
professionally?
  Ms. BERRY. I knew her from 1982 until the time that she left the
Commission.
  Senator SPECTOR. Did you talk to her fairly often?
  Ms. BERRY. Yes, it was part of my responsibility.
  Senator SPECTER. But no idea at all why she would be motivated
to make false charges?
  Ms. BERRY. NO idea whatsoever.
   Senator SPECTER. HOW about you, Ms. Alvarez, how well did you
know her?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, I knew her professionally. I did not know her
as well as some of these others did.
   Senator SPECTER. HOW long did you know her?
   Ms. ALVAREZ. From the first time, my first day at the Commis-
sion until she left.
  Senator SPECTER. What was your reaction, when you heard these
charges by Professor Hill against Judge Thomas?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I was shocked. I was absolutely shocked, and I was
sickened by it, because, likewise, I knew that he had helped her on
lots of occasions, and I just felt like it was a betrayal.
   Senator SPECTER. MS. Holt, this committee has to make a judg-
ment. We have heard people of the panel before you four women
came on, who said that they had total confidence in Professor Hill.
You women have said you have total confidence in Judge Thomas.
Can you give any clue, any clue at all as to how this committee can
break that deadlock?
   Ms. HOLT. Senator, I guess for all of us--again, we were talking
about probability, we are talking about patterns of behavior that
we have not witnessed--we are talking about the fact that up to
the time of these allegations, we never heard anyone else make
such allegations in our presence, talk about such things. We never
heard rumors flying about this Chairman, Clarence Thomas
                                               384

  Senator SPECTER. But how about the behavior or patterns of be-
havior of Professor Hill?

  Ms. HOLT. Senator
  Senator SPECTER. YOU never heard her make a false charge, did
you?
  Ms. HOLT. NO, I haven't, but I guess my focusing on constructive
looking at people--my focus has been on Judge Thomas. I
cannot
  Senator SPECTER. Why not put a focus on Professor Hill?
  Ms. BERRY. On October 7,1 made----
  Senator SPECTER. YOU first, Ms. Fitch, and then you, Ms. Berry.
  Ms. HOLT. Well, I have been out of touch with Professor Hill for
3 years, so I may have written her lately about my last position,
but I have not heard back from her. I can't say what she may be
doing or thinking since the last 3 years that I last spoke to her. I
have periodically run into the Judge and talked to him, stayed in
touch with his mother whom I met when I was in Savannah, so it
is not the same thing.
  Senator SPECTER. What did you want to add, Ms. Berry?
  Ms. BERRY. Well, on October 7, I heard a false charge, "I do not
know Phyllis Berry and she does not know me."
  Senator SPECTER. Let me ask one other question for response by
all of you, and it is this: Is it possible that Professor Hill could
think this happened and it did not? We have explored that possibil-
ity, and you are not professionals and I don't know how much in-
sight the professionals can provide, but each of you women knew
her rather well, especially Ms. Holt and Ms. Fitch.
  One of the questions that has been going through my mind that I
started out with was some effort to reconcile the testimony of these
two people who appear to be so credible. I had thought that it
might be possible to reconcile them, frankly, until I heard Profes-
sor Hill's testimony and the expanded nature of the charges which
were made at that time--very different from what she put in her
statement and very different from what she had told the FBI, and
when I saw those expanded charges, it didn't seem possible to rec-
oncile them.
  But we have a situation here where you have a pattern of con-
duct toward Judge Thomas, which is admitted to by Professor Hill,
where she has a very cordial relationship, no indication of anger,
moves with him from one job to another, she does tell one friend
and tells that friend that she has only told her, and then three
more people come up today, which I hadn't heard about until yes-
terday, and the charges are expanded and Ms. Berry has speculat-
ed about the spurned woman approach.
  But can you women shed any light on the possibility that Profes-
sor Hill might have had an attachment or a feeling which would
have led her to think about these things?
  Senator Hatch yesterday put into the record some speculation,
and that is what we are doing here, pure and simple. But you
women know her well enough, so that I think you might have some
insight into it, in terms of the case, which had the reference to
"Silver" and reference to some other facts which came from an-
other case. And without impugning any impropriety or wrong-
doing, what do you think, Ms. Holt? I think you know her the best
                                               385

of anybody on the panel. Do you think it is conceivable that Profes-
sor Hill might really think this happened, when it didn't?

  Ms. HOLT. I think that's the only conceivable answer, Senator,
because I do not believe it happened.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you don't believe it happened and you
can't find any motivation for her.

  Ms. HOLT. I can't find any motivation for her saying that it did
happen.

  Senator SPECTER. DO you think she is the kind of a person who
would come here under oath and say that it happened, if she didn't
think it did happen?

  Ms. HOLT. I don't know. She didn't appear to be that type of
person when I knew her.

  Senator SPECTER. YOU knew her second best, Ms. Fitch. Do you
think it is possible that she really believes in her mind today that
it never really happened?

  Ms. FITCH. I think it's possible. I may be on shaky ground here. I
have read a little bit in psychiatry, but there is something called
transference. I'm not talking now about Professor Hill, but just in
general terms.

  My understanding of what transference means is that you may
have strong feelings about someone and you're able to focus on
someone who is either a therapist or someone who has been kind to
you, and things get kind of muddled and they carry the burden of
whatever someone else may or may not have done or what is some-
thing that you think actually happened.

  So, there are any number of explanations, I would suspect, that
would say that she is not a liar, but that this did not happen, but
that, yes, she could probably pass a polygraph test, because she
does sincerely believe that this happened with this person. And I
say again that I do not believe in the allegations.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, have you seen anything in her personali-
ty or had any experience with her, because you knew her very
well, which would give you some factual basis or some feeling that
she might think that it happened, when, in fact, it didn't?

  Ms. FITCH. Senator, that's why I said I am not talking about Pro-
fessor Hill, but just in general terms about this idea of transfer-
ence. No, I can't say that I have.

  Senator SPECTER. MS. Alvarez, what do you think about that pos-
sibility?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. I didn't know her well enough personally to be
able to say that she was--that this would be something she would
do. I didn't see her professionally as somebody who would do that. I
do recall her being very ambitious, and

  Senator SPECTER. IS this going to help her ambition?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Well, she i s - --
  Senator SPECTER. Her life is not going to be any easier now.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Well, I think she has now become, as I think some-
body on this committee put it, the Rosa Parks of sexual harass-
ment. You know, the speaking engagements will come, the book,
the movie. I mean I don t know.
  Senator SPECTER. DO you think that's her motivation?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I don't--I'm speculating. I have had to try and sort
out what I think, why I think she might have done it. I think that
                                               386

it might have started off as a political, she was a political pawn,
and the situation got out of control and she took it

  Senator SPECTER. SO, you think she is deliberately not telling the
truth, as opposed to saying something that she thinks might have
happened, when, in fact, it didn't?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes, because I did not know her personally well
enough to make a judgment on her personality and whether she
was capable of that fantasy. My only way of looking at it is that it
is a professional, I mean it is a personal move on her part, to ad-
vance her.

  Senator SPECTER. MS. Berry, you have the final comment. You
had started off with a quotation of the New York Times, which I
asked Professor Hill about, saying that you thought there might
have been a romantic interest that was denied. Do you think
that--well, you've already said you don't think she's the kind of
person that makes something up, but you disbelieve what she said.
Do you think that, based on your knowledge of her, that there
could be a situation where she thinks it happened, but, in fact, it
did not?

  Ms. BERRY. A point I would like to make, I was listening some to
Mr. Carr's testimony this morning or today, and he had indicated
that Anita said to him that "I was harassed by my supervisor."
Clarence Thomas was not the only supervisor that Anita had, and
Mr. Carr seemed to make this gigantic leap, because he knew that
she was on Clarence Thomas' personal staff, that the supervisor
that she must have been referring to was Clarence Thomas.

  Senator SPECTER. Who were others who could be classified as a
supervisor?

  Ms. BERRY. Mr. Roggerson was her supervisor in Congressional
Affairs, and when I succeeded him to Congressional Affairs, he
became the Executive Assistant, and so he was also her supervisor.
How can I say this? Mr. Roggerson doesn't have such an impecca-
ble reputation.

  Senator SPECTER. SO, you think, in the case of one of the wit-
nesses this morning, Professor Paul might just have the wrong
man?

  Ms. BERRY. I am saying that's possible. He seemed to make
that--he didn't identify. He said, "Anita Hill said to me that she
was being harassed by her supervisor," and he said, "I dominated
the conversation and, because she worked for Clarence Thomas, it
must have been Clarence Thomas."

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, it is time to switch.
  Senator SPECTER. If I may make just one more comment, Mr.
Chairman. I had not heard what Senator Kennedy said this morn-
ing, and I waited until I got a transcript of the record, because I
didn't want to make a comment, without being precise as to what
Senator Kennedy had said.
  When I got a transcript of the record about 15 minutes ago, I
told Senator Kennedy that I was going to raise this point, because I
strongly disagree with what he said, but I wanted to be sure, before
I took issue with it.
  When Senator Kennedy had a turn earlier today, he said, "But I
hope, Mr. Chairman, that after this panel, we are not going to hear
any more comments unworthy, unsubstantiated comments, unjusti-
                                               387

fled comments about Professor Hill and perjury, as we heard in
this room yesterday."

  I want to say that the comments I made yesterday were not un-
worthy, were not unsubstantiated or unjustified. On the contrary,
they were well-based and well-founded in the record. It is a little
late to debate it now, but I am prepared to do so, at your pleasure,
Senator Kennedy.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, Mr. Chairman, it is nonsense to suggest
that Professor Hill committed perjury or anything remotely ap-
proaching it. It was very clear what she was saying to Senator
Specter.

  Initially, she said no one on the committee staff had suggested to
her that Judge Thomas might withdraw quickly and quietly,
simply because she made an allegation to the committee. Later, she
said the possibility of withdrawal had come up, but in the context
of a very different kind of conversation about the various things
that might happen down the road as one of a broad range of possi-
ble outcomes, if Professor Hill reported what had happened. That's
an obvious distinction between the two statements, and it is prepos-
terous to call it perjury.

  The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, before you
  Senator SPECTER. Just one reply, Mr. Chairman.
  I regard that comment and characterization as preposterous. I
did not start this argument, but I am not going to back away from
it. To be in this committee room and to say that they are unsub-
stantiated is just patently wrong. I asked the question repeatedly,
and there was no doubt about it. The witness was very evasive, and
then the witness was really decisive in saying that no staffer had
approached her with a suggestion that Judge Thomas might with-
draw. Then, in the afternoon, in an unresponsive way and a way
which really showed calculation, she slipped in a comment to the
contrary. I think, haying had some experience in the field, that
what she said was just flatly untrue in the morning and she
changed it in the afternoon. I think she did so, knowing that it was
a recantation and avoided a problem.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, if I could be recognized 30 seconds.
  The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, I will recognize the Senator from
Massachusetts for 30 seconds, and then I respectfully suggest that
this debate is likely to go on on the floor anyway, and I would ask
that we end it. In the meantime, shortly after, I am going to ask
the women on the panel whether they need a break. They have
been sitting there a long time. I don't know how much people have
to go.
  I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.
  Senator KENNEDY. Senator Specter has repeatedly effectively
what he said in the transcript, when he said "I went through that
in some detail, because it is my legal judgment, having some expe-
rience in perjury prosecution, the testimony of Professor Hill in the
morning was flat-out perjury. She specifically changed it in the
afternoon, when confronted with the possibility of being contradict-
ed, and if you recant during the course of proceeding, it is not per-
jury, so I state very carefully as to what she had said in the morn-
ing."
                                               388

  But in the context of those continual denials, consulting the at-
torney, repeatedly asking the question, I believe this was at a time
when I did interrupt. I know that the Senator from Pennsylvania
didn't think it appropriate, but some of us thought he was attempt-
ing to put words into the mouth of Professor Hill. He went on and
simply stated "was false and perjurious, in my legal opinion, and
the change in the afternoon was a concession fatally to that effect."

  Mr. Chairman, rather than going through the reference parts
now and taking the time, I would like to ask that those parts of the
record that refer to those exchanges be included now in the record,
and the members can make up their own mind. The members can
make up their own mind as to what conclusion they would draw.

  Senator SPECTER. That is satisfactory to me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, so ordered.
  [The information referred to follows:]
                                        389

                                    POLYGRAPHS
       It has been mentioned already in the course of this hearing
that Professor Hill, on her own and not in response to any request
from this Committee, took a polygraph examination - a lie detector
test - which she passed. She was asked about her allegations
regarding Judge Thomas, and the test concluded that she was not
lying.
       It has been suggested that this polygraph test somehow
violated the 1988 polygraph law. That is nonsense. The 1988 law
simply banned certain employers from requiring employees to take
polygraph tests in certain circumstances. It did not prohibit
employees from voluntarily taking the tests in any circumstances.
       The bill even allowed employers to require employees to take
polygraph tests when the employer was investigating certain
specific crimes and had reason to suspect a particular employee.
And firms such as security firms are allowed to use polygraphs in
any circumstances. And the bill did not ban polygraph
examinations by federal, state or local governments.
       Anita Hill volunteered to take the test; it is nonsense suggest
that federal law undercuts the results of that test in any way.

    continually pressure me to go out with him, continually, and

    he would not accept my explanation as being valid.

    Senator Specter. So that when you said you took it to

    mean, "We ought to have sex," that that was an inference that

    you drew?

6   Ms. Hill. Yes, yes.

7   Senator Specter. Professor Hill, the USA Today reported

    on October 9th, "Anita Hill was told by Senate staffers her

    signed affidavit alleging sexual harassment by Clarence

10 Thomas would be the instrument that 'quietly and behind the

11 scenes' would force him to withdraw his name." Was USA Today

12 correct on that, attributing it to a man named Mr. Keith

13 Henderson, a 10-year friend of Hill and former Senate

14 Judiciary Committee staffer?

15  Ms. Hill. I do not recall. I guess--did I say that? I

16 don't understand who said what in that quotation.

17  Senator Specter. Well, Let me go on. He said, "Keith

18 Henderson, a 10-year friend of Hill and former Senate

19 Judiciary Committee staffer, says Hill was advised by Senate

20 staffers that her charge would be kept secret and her name

21 kept from public scrutiny."

22  "They would," apparently referring again to Mr.

23 Henderson's statement, "they would approach Judge Thomas with

24 the information and he would withdraw and not turn this into

25 a big story, Henderson says."
                             391

                                                             80

     Did anybody ever tell you that, by providing the

     statement, that there would be a move to request Judge Thomas

     to withdraw his nomination?

     Ms. Hill. I don't recall any story about pressing,

     using this to press anyone.

     Senator Specter. Well, do you recall anything at all

     about anything related to that?

     Ms. Hill. I think that I was told that my statement

     would be shown to Judge Thomas, and I agreed to that.

10   Senator Specter. But was there any suggestion, however

11 slight, that the statement with these serious charges would

12 result in a withdrawal so that it wouldn't have to be

13 necessary for your identity to be known or for you to come

14 forward under circumstances like these?

     Ms. Hill. There w a s -- n o , not that I recall. I don't

     recall anything being said about him being pressed to resign.

17j  Senator Specter. Well, this would only have happened in

18 the course of the past month or so, because all this started

19 just in early September.

20   Ms. Hill. I understand.

21   Senator Specter. So that when you say you don't recall,

22 I would ask you to search your memory on this point, and

2 3 perhaps we might begin--and this is an important subject--

24 about the initiation of this entire matter with respect to

·25! the Senate staffers who talked to you. But that is going to
                                392

                                                                81

1 be too long for the few minutes that I have left, so I would

2 just ask you once again, and you say you don't recollect,

3 whether there was anything at all said to you by anyone that,

4 as USA Today reports, that just by having the allegations of

5 sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas, that it would be the

6 instrument that "quietly and behind the scenes" would force

7 him to withdraw his name. Anything related to that in any

8 way whatsoever?

9    Ms. Hill. The only thing that I can think of, and if

10 you will check, there were a lot of phone conversations. We

11 were discussing this matter very carefully, and at some point

12 there might have been a conversation about what might happen.

13   Senator Specter. Might have been?

14   Ms. Hill. There might have been, but that wasn't--I

15 don't remember this specific kind of comment about "quietly

16 and behind the scenes" pressing him to withdraw.

17   Senator Specter. Well, aside from "quietly and behind

18 the scenes" pressing him to withdraw, any suggestion that

19 just the charges themselves, in writing, would result in

20 Judge Thomas withdrawing, going away?

21   Ms. Hill. No, no. I don't recall that at all, no.

22   Senator Specter. Well, you started to say that there

2 3 might have been some conversation, and it seemed to m e --

24:  Ms. Hill. There might have been some conversation about

·25 what could possibly occur.
                    393

                                                             82

1   Senator Specter. Well, tell me about that conversation.

2   Ms. Hill. Well, I can't really tell you any more than

3 what I have said. I discussed what the alternatives were,

4 what might happen with this affidavit that I submitted. We

5 talked about the possibility of the Senate committee coming

6 back for more information. We talked about the possibility

7 of the FBI, asking, going to the FBI and getting more

8 information; some questions from individual Senators. I

9 just, the statement that you are referring to, I really can't

10 verify.

11  Senator Specter. Well, when you talk about the Senate

12 coming back for more information or the FBI coming back for

13 more information or Senators coming back for more information

14 that has nothing to do at all with Judge Thomas withdrawing,

15 so that when you testified a few moments ago that there might

16 possibly have been a conversation, in response to my question

17 about a possible withdrawal, J would press you on that,

18 Professor Hill, in this context: You have testified with

19 some specificity about what happened 10 years ago. I would

20 ask you to press your recollection as to what happened within

21 the last month.

22  Ms. Hill. And I have done that, Senator, and I don't

-23 recall that comment. I do recall that there might have been

24 some suggestion that if the FBI did the investigation, that

25 the Senate might get involved, that there may be--that a
                     394

                                                             83

1 number of things might occur, but I really, I have to be

2 honest with you, I cannot verify the statement that you are

3 asking me to verify. There is not really more that I can

4 tell you on that.

5   Senator Specter. Well, when you say a number of things

6 might occur, what sort of things?

7   Ms. Hill. May I just add this one thing?

8   Senator Specter. Sure.

9   Ms. Hill. The nature of that kind of conversation that

10 you are talking about is very different from the nature of

11 the conversation that I recall. The conversations that I

12 recall were much more vivid. They were more explicit. The

13 conversations that I have had with the staff over the last

14 few days in particular have become much more blurry, but

15 these are vivid events that I recall from even eight years

16 ago when they happened, and they are going to stand out much

17 more in my mind than a telephone conversation. They were

18 one-on-one, personal conversations, as a matter of fact, and

19 that adds to why they are much more easily recalled. I am

20 sure that there are some comments that I do not recall the

21 exact nature of from that period, as well, but these that are

22 here are the ones that I do recall.

23  Senator Specter. Well, Professor Hill, I can understand

24 why you say that these comments, alleged comments, would

·25 stand out in your mind, and we have gone over those. I don't
                     395

                                                                  84

1 want to go over them again. But when you talk about the

2 withdrawal of a Supreme Court nominee, you are talking about

3 something that is very, very vivid, stark, and you are

4 talking about something that occurred within the past four or

5 five weeks, and my question goes to a very dramatic and

6 important event. If a mere allegation would pressure a

7 nominee to withdraw from the Supreme Court, I would suggest

8 to you that that is not something that wouldn't stick in a

9 mind for four or five weeks, if it happened.

10  Ms. Hill. Well, Senator, I would suggest to you that

11 for me these are more than mere allegations, so that if that

12 comment were made--these are the truth to me, these comments

13 are the truth to m e -- a n d if it were made, then I may not

14 respond to it in the same way that you do.

15  Senator Specter. Well, I am not questioning your

16 statement when I use the word "allegation" to refer to 10

17 years ago. I just don't want t o talk about it as a fact

18 because so far that is something we have to decide, so I am

19 not stressing that aspect of the question. I do with respect

20 to the time period, but the point that I would come back to

21 for just one more minute would b e -- w e l l , let me ask it to you

22 this way.

23  Ms. Hill. Okay.

24  Senator Specter. Would you not consider it a matter of

"25 real importance if someone said to you, "Professor, you won't
                            396

                                                              85

    have to go public. Your name won't have to be disclosed.

    You won't have to do anything. Just sign the affidavit and

    this," as the USA Today report, would be the instrument that

    "quietly and behind the scenes" would force him to withdraw

    his name. Now I am not asking you whether it happened. I am

    asking you now only, if it did happen, whether that would be

    the kind of a statement to you which would be important and

    impressed upon you, that you would remember in the course of

    four or five weeks.

10  Ms. Hill. I don't recall a specific statement, and I

11 cannot say whether that comment would have stuck in my mind.

 12 I really cannot say that.
1--

13  Senator Specter. The sequence with the staffers is very

14 involved, so I am going to move to another subject now, but I

15 want to come back to this. Over the luncheon break, I would

16 ask you to think about it further, if there is any way you

17 can shed any further light on.that question, because I think

18 it is an important one.

19  Ms. Hill. Okay. Thank you.

20  Senator Specter. Professor Hill, the next subject I

21 want to take up with you involves the kind of strong language

22 which you say Judge Thomas used in a very unique setting,

23 where there you have the Chairman of the EEOC, the Nation's

24 chief law enforcement officer on sexual harassment, and here

25 you have a lawyer who is an expert in this field, later goes
                                  397

                                                                                                   86

       on to teach civil rights and has a dedication to making sure
       that women are not discriminated against. And if you take
       the single issue of discrimination against women, the
       Chairman of the EEOC has a more important role on that
       question even than a Supreme Court justice--a Supreme Court
       justice is a more important position overall, but if you
       focus just on sexual harassment.

                The testimony that you described here today depicts a
       circumstance where the Chairman of the EEOC is blatant, as
10 you describe it, and my question is: Understanding the fact
11 that you are 25 and that you are shortly out of law school
12 and the pressures that exist in this world--and I know about
13 it to a fair extent, I used to be a district attorney and I
14 know about sexual harassment and discrimination against women
15 and I think I have some sensitivity on it--but even
16 considering all of that, given your own expert standing and
17 the fact that here you have the chief law enforcement officer
18 of the country on this subject and the whole purpose of the
19 civil right law is being perverted right in the office of the
20 Chairman with one of his own female subordinates, what went
21 through your mind, if anything, on whether you ought to come
       forward at that stage, because if you had, you would have
23 stopped this man from being head of the EEOC perhaps for
24 another decade? What went on through your mind? I know you
25i decided not to make a complaint, but did you give that any
                          398

                                                               87

    consideration, and, if so, how could you allow this kind of

    reprehensible conduct to go on right in the headquarters,

    without doing something about it?

    Ms. Hill. Well, it was a very trying and difficult

    decision for me not to say anything further. I can only say

    that when I made the decision to just withdraw from the

    situation and not press as claim or charge against him, that

    I may have shirked a duty, a responsibility that I had, and

    to that extent I confess that I am very sorry that I did not

10 do something or say something, but at the time that was my

11 best judgment. Maybe it was as poor judgment, but it wasn't

12 a dishonest and it wasn't a completely unreasonable choice

13 that I made, given the circumstances.

14  Senator Specter. My right light is on. Thank you very

15 much, Professor Hill.

16  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

17  The Chairman. Thank you,- Senator.

18  Thank you, Professor Hill.

19  We will adjourn until 2:15. We will reconvene at 2:15.

20  [Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m., the committee was recessed, to

21 reconvene at 2:15 p.m., the same day.]
                  399

                                                               203

   1   Mr. Chairman, that is all I have.

   2   The Chairman. Thank you.

   3   Senator Thurmond. Senator Specter, do you want to

   4 proceed?

       Senator Specter. Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

   6   When my time expired we were up to the contact you had

   \1 with Mr. Brudney on September 9th. If you could proceed from

       there to recount who called you and what those conversations

       consisted of as it led to your coming forward to the

   10 committee?

   Ll  Ms. Hill. Well, we discussed a number of different

   12 issues. We discussed one, what he knew about the law on

©  13 sexual harassment. We discussed what he knew about the

   14 process for bringing information forward to the committee

   15 And in the course of our conversations Mr. Brudney asked me

   16 what were specifics about what it was that I had experienced.

   17  In addition, we talked about the process for going

       forward. What might happen if I did bring information to the

   19 committee. That included that an investigation might take

   20 place, that I might be questioned by the committee in closed

   21 session. It even included something to the effect that the

   ^22 information might be presented to the candidate or to the

   23 White House. There was some indication that the candidate

   24 or, excuse me, the nominee might not wish to continue the

   25 process
                                 400

                                                                                                                204

                 Senator Specter. Mr. Brudney said to you that the
       nominee, Judge Thomas, might not wish to continue the process
       if you came forward with a statement on the factors which you
       have testified about?

                Ms. Hill. Well, 1 am not sure that that is exactly what
       he said. I think what he said was, depending on an
       investigation, a Senate, whether the Senate went into closed
       session and so forth, it might be that he might not wish to
       continue the process.

                Senator Specter. So Mr. Brudney did tell you that Judge
       Thomas might not wish to continue to go forward with his
       nomination, if you came forward?

                Ms. Hill. Yes.
                Senator Specter. Isn't that somewhat different from
       your testimony this morning?
                Ms. Hill. My testimony this morning involved my
1"; response to this USA newspaper"report and the newspaper
18| report suggested that by making the allegations that that
19 would be enough that the candidate would quietly and somehow
20 withdraw from the process. So, no, I do not believe that it
21 is at variance. We talked about a number of different
22 options. But it was never suggested that just by alleging
23 incidents that that might, that that would cause the nominee
24 to withdraw.
                Senator Specter. Well, what more could you do than make
                           401

                                                             205

    allegations as to what you said occurred?

2   Ms. Hill. I could not do any more but this body could.

3   Senator Specter. Well, but I am now looking at your

    distinguishing what you have just testified to from what you

    testified to this morning. And this morning I had asked you

    about just one sentence from the USA Today news, "Anita Hill

    was told by Senate Staffers that her signed affidavit

    alleging sexual harassment by Clarence Thomas would be the

    instrument that quietly and behind the scenes would force him

10 to withdraw his name."

11  And now you are testifying that Mr. Brudney said that if

12 you came forward and made representations as to what you said

13 happened between you and Judge Thomas, that Judge Thomas

14 might withdraw his nomination?

15  Ms. Hill. I guess, Senator, the difference in what you

16 are saying and what I am saying is that that quote seems to

17 indicate that there would be no intermediate steps in the

18 process. What we were talking about was process. What could

19 happen along the way. What were the possibilities? Would

20 there be a full hearing? Would there be questioning from the

21 FBI? Would there be questioning by some individual members

22 of the Senate?

23  We were not talking about or even speculating that

24 simply alleging this would cause someone to withdraw.

25  Senator Specter. Well, if your answer now turns on
                  402

                                                             206

    process, all I can say is that it would have been much

    shorter had you said, at the outset, that Mr. Brudney told

    you that if you came forward Judge Thomas might withdraw.

    That is the essence as to what occurred.

    Ms. Hill. No, it is not. I think we differ on our

    interpretation of what I said.

    Senator Specter. Well, what am I missing here?

    Senator Kennedy. Mr. Chairman, can we let the witness

    speak in her own words, rather than having words put in her

    mouth?

    Senator Specter. Mr. Chairman, I object to that. I

12 object to that vociferously. I am asking questions here. If

13 Senator Kennedy has anything to say let him participate in

14 this hearing.

15  The Chairman. Now, let everybody calm down. Professor

16 Hill, give your interpretation to what was asked by Senator

17 Specter. And then he can ask you further questions.

18  Ms. Hill. My interpretation--

19  Senator Thurmond. Speak into the microphone, so we can

20 hear you.

21  Ms. Hill. I understood Mr. Specter's question to be

22 what kinds of conversation did I have regarding this

23 information. I was attempting, in talking to the staff, to

24 understand how the information would be used, what I would

·25 have to do, what might be the outcome of such a use. We
                403

                                                              207

    talked about a number of possibilities, but there was never

    any indication that, by simply making these allegations, the

    nominee would withdraw from the process. No one ever said

    that and I did not say that anyone ever said that.

    We talked about the form that the statement would come

    in, we talked about the process that might be undertaken

    post-statement, and we talked about the possibilities of

    outcomes, and included in that possibility of outcome was tha

    the committee could decide to review the point and that the

10 nomination, the vote could continue, as it did.

11  Senator Specter. So that, at some point in the process,

12 Judge Thomas might withdraw?

13  Ms. Hill. Again, I would have to respectfully say that

14 is not what I said. That was one of the possibilities, but

15 it would not come from a simple, my simply making an

16 allegation.

17  Senator Specter. Professor Hill, is that what you meant

18 when you said earlier, as best I could write it down, that

19 you would control it, so it would not get to this point?

20  Ms. Hill. Pardon me?

21  Senator Specter. Is that what you meant, when you

22 responded earlier to Senator Biden, that the situation would

23 be controlled "so that it would not get to this point in the

24 hearings"?

25  Ms. Hill. Of the public hearing. In entering into
                      404

                                                            208

1 these conversations with the staff members, what I was trying

2 to do was control this information, yes, so that it would not

3 get to this point.

4   Senator Specter. Thank you very much.

5   The Chairman. Thank you, Senator.

6   Now, Professor Hill, with your continued indulgence,

7 what we will do is, I will yield to my colleagues,

8 alternating, and limit their questions to 5 minutes, if I

9 may, and I would begin with my friend from Massachusetts,

10 Senator Kennedy.

11  Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will just

12 take a moment.

13  I know this has been an extraordinary long day for you,

14 Professor Hill, and it obviously has been for Judge Thomas,

15 as well, and I know for your family. I just want to pay

16 tribute to both your courage in this whole procedure and for

17 your eloquence and for the dignity with which you have

18 conducted yourself, and, as is quite clear, from observing

19 your comments, for the anguish and pain which you have had to

20 experience today in sharing with millions of Americans. This

21 has been a service and we clearly have to make a judgment.

22 It certainly I think has been a very important service.

23  Let me just say, as far as I am concerned, I think it

24 has been enormously important to millions of Americans. I do

·25 not think that this country is ever going to look at sexual
                                         405

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, let me canvas here for a minute, because
you have been a long time sitting there.

  Does anyone else have a question for this panel? Senator DeCon-
cini, roughly how long do you wish?

  Senator DECONCINI. Five minutes or less.
  The CHAIRMAN. I will go down the line here.
  Senator SIMON. Five minutes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Five minutes.
  Senator HATCH. Five minutes.
  The CHAIRMAN. Five minutes, one minute.
  We will give you a recess.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I think that the last questioner was Senator
Specter. Senator Specter was the last one to question, correct?
  Senator THURMOND. SO who is next?
  The CHAIRMAN. I think it is Senator DeConcini, and then Sena-
tor Hatch.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't have too
many questions.
  Let me ask the panel, if I can, particularly Ms. Fitch and I guess
Ms. Holt, it sounds like, from what you tell us today, that you were
pretty good friends with Professor Hill. Is that a fair assumption?
  Ms. FITCH. We were good work friends. I was a good work friend
with Anita Hill, yes.
  Ms. HOLT. We were professional friends.
  Senator DECONCINI. Professional friends.
  Ms. HOLT. And I use the word "professional" because we did not
socialize on weekends or after work.
  Senator DECONCINI. In the course of that friendship, did she ever
mention to you a friendship she had with Susan Hoerchner?

   Ms. HOLT. NO, she did not.

  Senator DECONCINI. She did not? Or to Ellen Wells?
  Ms. HOLT. She had mentioned Ellen Wells.
  Senator DECONCINI. She had mentioned Ellen Wells? Can you
recall?
  How about you, Ms. Fitch? Did she ever mention either one?
  Ms. FITCH. I don't recall those names, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. MS. Holt, what about Ellen Wells? Do you
remember in what context that was mentioned?
  Ms. HOLT. I don't remember with any specificity, just that she
knew Ellen Wells, and I recall having heard the name mentioned
by Professor
  Senator DECONCINI. Did she by any chance tell you, "This is one
of my best, closest friends?"

   Ms. HOLT. NO, she did not.

  Senator DECONCINI. Would you really have remembered that,
you think, if she had said that?

  Ms. HOLT. Right.
  Senator DECONCINI. And John Carr, was that name ever
  Ms. HOLT. I remembered her referring to a "John".
  Senator DECONCINI. TO a "John," and not in any context of a
close friend or some relationship?
  Ms. HOLT. I remember her referring to a "John" that she was
dating.
                                             406

  Senator DECONCINI. That she was dating.
  Ms. Fitch, how about you?
  Ms. FITCH. NOW, I don't recall that, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. Just not to leave anybody out, Ms. Berry,
did
  Ms. BERRY. I don't recall any such conversation.
  Senator DECONCINI. NO such conversation.
  Now I guess, Ms. Alvarez, this question is more to you. You
know, listening to Judge Thomas here and his high regard and re-
spect for then Ms. Hill, now Professor Hill, you know, he doesn't
have anything derogatory to say about her. He is just absolutely
aghast and awash that this would happen, where your testimony is
very critical of her. How do you equate that? Is that if he had a
relationship with her in the professional field that was more com-
patible than the relationship that you had with Ms. Hill in the pro-
fessional field?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. Why do you say I was critical of her? I don't think
I was critical by saying--let me think how I described her

  Senator DECONCINI. Let me just read it to you. It says, "She was
opinionated, arrogant, and a relentless debater. She was the kind
of woman who always made you feel like she was not going to be
messed with, like she was not going to take anything from anyone.
She was aloof. She always acted as if she was superior to everyone
else, holier-than-thou." I think that is critical, but maybe

  Ms. ALVAREZ. I don't know. Some people would call me arrogant,
and some people would call me opinionated and a relentless debat-
er.

  Senator DECONCINI. Nobody would call you arrogant. You are
such a very nice lady.

  Ms. ALVAREZ. I don't think those are necessarily negative charac-
teristics.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU don't? Oh, OK.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO. In some people's mind, they would think to say
a woman was tough, a woman was arrogant, that would mean
that
  Senator DECONCINI. Opinionated
  Ms. ALVAREZ [continuing]. Opinionated? No, I don't think that is
necessarily
  Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. Arrogant, and a relentless de-
bater, are not critical?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. If someone called me those things
  Senator DECONCINI. Even two of those are not critical in your
mind? OK.
  So my point is, did you hold her in high regard? Now I realize a
lot has happened since then, and it is hard to look back on the nice
side of somebody who
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I did not have a problem with her professionally.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU did not what?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I did not have a problem with her professionally. I
thought that I didn't like her superior attitude. I didn't like the
way she kind of projected that onto the rest of the staff.
  Senator DECONCINI. MS. Holt, you were asked a question about
the Department of Education being suggested to be abolished by
the Reagan administration, and you said you were aware of that?
                                                   407

  Ms. HOLT. I had heard that, yes.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU had heard that. You were also aware, or
were you aware that there was ever a vote or even a debate on the
Senate floor or House floor?
  Ms. HOLT. NO, I wasn't aware of that.
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes. There wasn't.
  Ms. HOLT. There was a rumor.
  Senator DECONCINI. It was a rumor only, wasn't it, because there
has never been a vote up here on Capitol Hill, on either the floor of
the Senate or the House, to abolish, and there wasn't during those
years. I just want the record to show that.
  Now, Ms. Fitch, when you were answering Senator Grassley's
question about the problem of speaking somebody's language, and
that Clarence Thomas was going upstream or talked about the
uppity blacks being different or something, do you have a feeling
that there is some agenda here that is moving this or motivating
this?
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, as a historian who has tried to look at the
totality of the African-American experience in this country, my
proclivity is to look at conspiracy theories, and I don't want to too
closely associate that with this particular case. However, it would
not surprise me that anyone, regardless of race, who hears a differ-
ent drummer is at potential risk.
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, potential risk.
  Ms. FITCH. And I am more comfortable thinking of it in those
terms.
  Senator DECONCINI. SO if you were extremely conservative, per-
haps the liberal side wouldn't want you there, and might be in-
volved in such a thing?
  Ms. FITCH. Well, Senator, that is a possibility, and it is also possi-
ble that conservatives might want to make it look like the
  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, on the other side, from the other side,
and if you were very strong on some ideological issue
  Ms. FITCH. It is possible, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI [continuing]. Such as abortion or Roe v.
Wade, there could be some effort by those who opposed it or who
opposed the right-to-life position.
  Ms. FITCH. I should probably say, though, Senator, one of the rea-
sons I liked then Chairman Thomas was that I am not a conserva-
tive Republican. I am a New York Rockefeller Republican, so we
did not always agree. I consider myself a moderate, and he knew
that.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, thank you.
  My last question is, just do you believe, each one of you, would
you just state here for me, do you believe that Professor Hill was
telling the truth when she testified here for some six hours. Ms.
Alvarez?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir.

  Senator DECONCINI. MS. Fitch.

   Ms. FITCH. NO, sir.

  Senator DECONCINI. MS. Holt.

   Ms. HOLT. NO, sir.

  Senator DECONCINI. MS. Berry.
  Ms. BERRY. NO, sir, absolutely not.
                                               408

  Senator DECONCINI. Absolutely not. Thank you very much. I
have no further questions.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Let me just ask a few more questions, just to
finish off what I had in mind.
  In the Washington Post of September 9, 1991, the day before our
hearings began, Anita Hill was quoted as follows, referring to a 10-
year-old article in which Judge Thomas made comments relative to
his sister. Now here is what Professor Hill said before she made--
this statement was made before she made any public charges of
harassment: "It takes a lot of detachment to publicize a person's
experience in that way."
  She was also quoted as observing that Judge Thomas exhibited
"a certain kind of self-centeredness, not to recognize some of the
programs that benefited you." And she also was quoted as saying,
"I think he doesn't understand people. He doesn't relate to people
who don't make it on their own."
  Now I would like to ask all of you, and we could start from you,
Ms. Alvarez, across, did Anita Hill ever mention to any of you, at
the time that you knew her, that she believed Clarence Thomas to
be "detached" and that she thought he was "self-centered," that
she believed that he failed to recognize the programs that benefited
minorities and, most importantly, that she thought he did not
"relate to people" and "didn't understand people"? Did you ever
hear any comments like these from her? Ms. Alvarez.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir, I never did. I heard nothing but positive
things about him, and everything he did in terms of helping her
was an example of just the same thing.
  Senator HATCH. MS. Fitch.
  Ms. FITCH. NO, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. MS. Holt.
  Ms. HOLT. NO, Senator, and in fact her statement to the effect
that he was unfriendly and couldn't relate to people could not be
further from the truth. Even the members of the domestic staff
talked to Chairman Thomas about their problems.
  Senator HATCH. And he talked to them?
  Ms. HOLT. And he talked to them.
  Senator HATCH. And he treated them equally?
  Ms. HOLT. He treated them equally.
  Senator HATCH. NOW let me just ask this last question. There has
been some indication that part of the problem here was that she
was ambitious and desired a promotion in the department, and if I
have it correctly, Allyson Duncan was promoted above her. Am I
correct? She got the job? Ms. Holt, go ahead.
  Ms. HOLT. It wasn't actually a promotion. It was more recogniz-
ing Allyson as the chief of staff, as having supervisory responsibil-
ity in terms of assignments.
  Senator HATCH. But is it true that Anita Hill wanted that posi-
tion or that recognition, to use your term?
  Ms. HOLT. She never indicated directly to me that she wanted it,
no.
  Senator HATCH. HOW about the rest of you? Ms. Alvarez.
                                         409

  Ms. ALVAREZ. It was common knowledge. I can't recall exactly
who said what, but there were several times that people made ref-
erence to that.

  Senator HATCH. MS. Fitch.
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, again, my experience is different because I
was away, so any office-type politics I might not be aware of, so I
am unaware of
  Senator HATCH. But you were aware of her ambition and that
she desired
  Ms. FITCH. Oh, yes, she was ambitious.
  Senator HATCH. Nothing wrong with that. I am not implying
anything wrong.
  Ms. FITCH. But I don't know about this specific position. I can't
speak to that at all.
  Senator HATCH. Sure. And Ms. Berry?
  Ms. BERRY. She didn't indicate to me specifically, but I heard
from other members from the Commission, throughout the Com-
mission, that, yes, she desired that position.
  Senator HATCH. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Can you tell us for the record, Ms. Myers, who
you heard it from, what other members, by name, you heard it
from?
  Ms. BERRY. I could, but I won't. They haven't volunteered to
come forward.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Leahy.
   Senator LEAHY. MS. Holt, I was just confused by one thing. You
may have already said this, but when did you leave the EEOC?
   Ms. HOLT. I am still at the EEOC.
   Senator LEAHY. When did you leave the employ of Clarence
Thomas? I'm sorry.
   Ms. HOLT. In September of 1987.
   Senator LEAHY. In September of 1987, and the last call from
Anita Hill, according to your log, was August of 1987. Is that cor-
rect?
   Ms. HOLT. Correct.
   Senator LEAHY. And then after that, you were no longer there,
keeping the log. About a month later, you were no longer keeping
the log. Is that correct?
   Ms. HOLT. That is correct.
   Senator LEAHY. And by the number of calls we have in here, she
called an average of about once every 7 or 8 months, so the fact
that there wasn t another call a month later, there is nothing un-
usual in that, is there?

   Ms. HOLT. NO, sir.

   Senator LEAHY. But there seemed to be some inference by some
here that she made that call and then suddenly cut off because she
had been told that Judge Thomas was on his honeymoon or some-
thing. The fact is, a month later you were gone, and she didn't call
that often anyway. We have six or seven calls logged in here, a
handful of calls over several years. It averages about one and a
half or so a year. I just didn't want the wrong inference to be left
here.

   Ms. Alvarez, you opined that possibly Anita Hill could have been
doing this so she could make a movie. Let me tell you, after spend-

        56-273 O--93 14
                                      410

ing 30, 40 hours, whatever it is we have been here, I can't imagine
anybody would want to spend 30 or 40 minutes in this movie, and I
don't really see that as a motivation.

  But you did say one thing, and you were very emphatic on this
answer, and I want to make sure I understood you right. You said
that Judge Thomas never talked about sex matters at work. You
were very emphatic about that. Is that right?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. That is right.
  Senator LEAHY. Including pornography or anything else?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Right.
  Senator LEAHY. What about outside of work?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Clarence and I were friends. We had been friends
for many, many years, personal friends. Our kids went to the same
school together. I knew his wife. We were going through a divorce
at the same time and everything else. We had the kind of confi-
dences, personal conversations, that friends have, that close friends
have, and any more than that really is not relevant. I mean, at the
office we were colleagues and the friendship part of it never
  Senator LEAHY. Did you talk about pornography outside the
office?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir, we never did.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, I am not sure I understand your answer. I
am not really trying to trick you or anything here, but you said
you didn't talk about pornography, didn't talk about sex matters at
work. I asked you about outside of work, and
  Ms. ALVAREZ. And I am trying to explain to you that Clarence
and I knew each other very well, and that we had a personal
friendship.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU didn't date?

   Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir.

  Senator LEAHY. DO you want to add to that? I am not sure I un-
derstand. Do you know of him talking to anybody outside of work?

  Ms. ALVAREZ. I am sorry. Say this again.
  Senator LEAHY. Other than yourself, do you know of Clarence
Thomas talking to people outside of work about either sex or por-
nography? Outside of yourself?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, sir. I just know that with me we, we had a
friendship and that was it. I mean, we shared conversations that
close friends share when you are going through divorce, when you
are going through raising kids, all those sorts of things. The typical
things that close friends talk about.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you. OK. I just wanted to clear that up.
  And, Ms. Holt, you have certainly cleared up a question that was
left hanging out here and I appreciate that.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY, [presiding.] Senator Thurmond.
  Senator THURMOND. I have one question I would like to ask Dr.
Fitch.
  Dr. Fitch, I believe you said that you visited Professor Hill in the
hospital.

   Ms. FITCH. Yes, I did.

  Senator THURMOND. DO you know roughly when that was and
why Professor Hill was there?
                                         411

  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I know, I believe it was in 1983. I believe it
was in summer, sometime between spring and summer. I don't, I
can't give you an exact date. I did go to see her. I think she was in
the hospital for a week and I do not recall that the nature--I don't
recall what she was suffering from. It rang a bell that it might
have had something to do with a stomach ailment, but I don't re-
member what the diagnosis was. I don't know that I ever knew.

  Senator THURMOND. What hospital was she in?
  Ms. FITCH. I believe, Senator, it was Capitol Hill Hospital. It is a
hospital on the Hill and I think that is the name of it.
   Senator THURMOND. Thank you. Senator Brown.
   Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Ms. Holt, occasionally, at least in our office, when people call in
they will sometimes be given a home phone number. Occasionally,
when we call back to other people we will have on file their home
phone number as well as their office number.
  I recognize it has been some time, but do you have any recollec-
tion as to whether or not Professor Hill had Clarence Thomas's
home phone number or whether or not he had her home phone
number?
   Ms. HOLT. I have no way of knowing that. I can only say that I
did not give Professor Hill Clarence Thomas's home phone number.
   Senator BROWN. And you never referred her to his--to call him
at home?

   Ms. HOLT. I did not.

   Senator BROWN. And you never got a feel for whether they chat-
ted outside of office hours?

   Ms. HOLT. NO.

   Senator BROWN. Thank you. A question to all of you. It may not
be anything that we can add here, but I suspect most members are
like I. You find the current divergence, or dramatic divergence in
their testimony somewhat hard to explain.

   In thinking about Clarence Thomas, was he the kind of person
who would be different in the way he treated people, react to
people, talk to people in private than he would be, let's say, when
other people were present? Is there a significant difference in the
way he behaved or talked or acted when you would be in an office
setting along with him versus where others could see or hear?

   Ms. HOLT. He always treated me with respect. He was a profes-
sional, and I had no problems whether there were 20 people around
or whether we were alone.

   Senator BROWN. NO significant difference in the way
   Ms. HOLT. NO difference at all.
   Senator BROWN. What about the rest of you? Any observations in
that area?
   Ms. FITCH. I agree with what Ms. Holt just said. There was no
difference.
   Ms. BERRY. I agree.
   Ms. ALVAREZ. I agree to a point. Because Clarence and I were
friends outside of the office. I probably saw, I mean I would call
him Clarence, you know. We talked about the kids and personal
things that friends talk about that he would not have shared with
people at the office.
                                      412

  Senator BROWN. I was trying to go through and outline some of
the traits that we have come to learn about him. I think all of us
have come to learn about him. We have really listened to him for 7
days. I don't know how close a friendship it has engendered, but I
think this committee has come to know him pretty well as well.

  But at least as I go through it, I find things like he is a serious
person, and here is someone who after they were separated from
their wife, a bachelor, in effect, again, sells his only car to pay for
his son's tuition to school, and that is an unusually serious--I don't
know many bachelors who sell their only means of transportation
for their son's tuition. A very unusually serious person.

  From the depositions I have read, this is someone who didn't tell
dirty stories either in public or private, or even on camping trips.
That he appears formal, intense, extremely hardworking, strict,
and demanding are a couple of terms I have heard applied both to
others around him and himself. I don't suppose there is anybody on
this committee that doesn't think that what they need to do is
work out every noon instead of eat or at least--I should speak for
myself. I feel that need. And yet not many do it, or at least I don't.

  I mean this is an extremely disciplined serious individual. Is that
a proper impression? Are there other descriptions you could give
me of Clarence Thomas?

  Ms. FITCH. That is my description of him and one of the things
that impressed me the most about him. And I think that those
combinations of terms is what I meant when I thought of the word
"decent" to apply to him in all ways.

  Ms. BERRY. But he is also generous, and supportive, and willing
to promote people who work for him, kind. He is a good human
being. Intelligent.

  Senator BROWN. The remarks he is alleged to have made and the
conduct he is supposed to have done; that is, to ask someone out
repeatedly and to pressure them to go out with you is an aggres-
sive, is an aggressive personal act when someone says no to pres-
sure them again. And it is almost confrontational in a personal
way. To say those kinds of remarks is a very confrontational, hos-
tile thing to do.

  Were those traits present in Clarence Thomas?
  Ms. FITCH. NO, Senator.
  Ms. HOLT. NO, Senator.

   Ms. ALVAREZ. Not at all.

  Ms. BERRY. In fact, the Clarence Thomas that I first met was
really kind of--I know it is going to be hard for you all to believe
this, but he was really kind of socially shy. It took me maybe 6
months to get the man out of his office and to circulate among the
employees, and at the Commission, you know, to greet them in the
hall and to have lunch in their cafeteria, those sorts of things, be-
cause he is a relatively disciplined, serious individual. And the
kinds of public relations things that I felt he needed to do, such as
give public speeches and to greet the employees, and all of those
kinds of things, it was like pulling hen's teeth to get the man to do
that.

  And then after he started doing that and saw the public recep-
tion to the real Clarence Thomas, that he was funny and smart
                                         413

and an articulate speaker, then it was hard for me to get him back
in the office. But.

  Senator BROWN. Help me with one last question, if you would. If
someone said to you to be personally very aggressive, as someone
would be if they pushed someone to go out with them that wouldn't
take no for an answer and said very, very gross things to them,
someone said that was totally out of character, would that be an
accurate statement? Would it be a gray area? How would you com-
pare the contact that is described to Clarence Thomas?

  Ms. HOLT. Uncharacteristic, in a word.
  Ms. BERRY. Not Clarence Thomas at all.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. There is no way he is the man she alleges.
  Senator BROWN. Well, thank you.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. Just before yielding to
Senator Simon, I just want to make a comment about the panel.
They are very strong supporters of Clarence Thomas. Understand-
able. They owe Clarence their jobs and they have great respect for
him, and they are certainly qualified to speak on that.
  But what they are not qualified is to psychoanalyze Professor
Hill. And we have heard many reasons during the course of these
hearings about concocted stories, about being pressured by various
groups, and tonight we are hearing about schizophrenia, we are
hearing about delusions, we are hearing about mental disturb-
ances, and one has to just ask oneself how far will the proponents
for this nomination go in trying to attack Professor Hill?
  Senator Simon.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, did I hear you say "How far
will the opponents go"? Was that what I heard?
  Senator KENNEDY. Yes. That is right.
  Senator SIMPSON. I think I am about to faint.
  Senator KENNEDY. That is fine. You can do it on Paul Simon's
time.
  Senator SIMPSON. It will take a bigger room. I think I am about
to go down.
  Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, first I want to thank the wit-
nesses, and particularly Ms. Alvarez, who has been here twice in a
very short period of time. And good to welcome Dr. Fitch, who is a
former faculty member at Sangamon State University.
  Ms. FITCH. It's nice to see you.
  Senator SIMON. MS. Holt, in your deposition--and you probably
heard me read this earlier, you perhaps did--you say, on page 32,
"Do you recall any other times Anita Hill called and you did not
note that on the telephone log?" And your answer, "I don't." You
repeat that later in this same log.
  Ms. HOLT. And I will state
  Senator SIMON. Here this evening, you have added--and I know
that sometimes people can refresh your memory, as you go on--you
have said there were five or six times additionally where she
called.
  Ms. HOLT. I said maybe five or six times. Like I think I men-
tioned before, when I responded to that question, I meant that I
could not relate dates, times or years of when those calls came in.
  Senator SIMON. Well, that's not the question. If I can go over to
page 44, also, "Do you have a recollection of Ms. Anita Hill calling
                                      414
Clarence Thomas any more times?" It doesn't say when, it says
"any more times than may have sporadically shown up on these
three pages?"

  Did anyone consult with you or advise you?
  Ms. HOLT. Absolutely not.
  Senator SIMON. SO, between the time of your deposition and right
now, the additional five or six times, you didn't talk to anybody
about that?
  Ms. HOLT. YOU continue to say five or six times. It could have
been two times, it could have been three times. You can't hold me
to the five or six times. I'm not sure of that. I know for a fact that
she called on instances when she was put directly through to Clar-
ence Thomas.
  Senator SIMON. But earlier this evening, Senator Specter said,
when I read the deposition, said Ms. Holt will testify that she
called an additional five or six times. Do you know where he got
that information?
  Ms. HOLT. I have no idea.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, I did not say five or six times. I
said I was told that she would testify that there were calls made
which were not on the logs, because the calls were received, but I
did not say five or six times.
  Senator SIMON. Well, my recollection is you did say that, but we
will let the record show, we will print the record and we will find
out. Senator Specter at least admits that he said that you were
going to testify about
  Senator SPECTER. NO, I don't admit anything, Mr. Chairman. I
state a fact. I don't make admissions here.
  Senator SIMON. Well, he said
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you.
  Senator SIMON [continuing]. That you were going to testify to ad-
ditional calls beyond the deposition.
  Ms. HOLT. I did not tell him that.
  Senator SIMON. YOU don't know where Senator Specter got that
information?
  Ms. HOLT. I have no idea.
  Senator SIMON. I have no further questions, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN [presiding]. Senator Thurmond.
  Senator KENNEDY. I think our time is up on this.
  Senator THURMOND. I just have a question I would like to pro-
pound.
  All of you ladies have a close relationship with Judge Thomas.
Did you consider him to be a clean, decent, thoughtful, caring man,
who treated his women and co-workers, as well as women in gener-
al, with courtesy and respect? I would like for each one of you to
answer that.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes, sir, absolutely.
  Senator THURMOND. Dr. Fitch.
  Ms. FITCH. Most definitely, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. MS. Holt.
  Ms. HOLT. Absolutely.
  Senator THURMOND. MS. Myers.
  Ms. BERRY. Absolutely.
  Senator THURMOND. All of you answered yes, is that correct?
                                     415

   Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes.
   Ms. FITCH. Yes.
   Ms. HOLT. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you.
  Is there anybody else on this side who has any questions?
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I just have--I understand what
Senator Kennedy is saying, but the word "schizophrenic" did not
appear from anyone on this side of the aisle. The word "delusion"
did not appear from anyone on this side of the aisle. That was in
the testimony or the statement of the U.S. attorney who said that
was an impossible thing, to use a lie detector. Those names, those
hot buttons, those phrases did not come from us, and it is curious
to me how anyone could say that, when Judge Thomas was asked
questions about what Professor Hill's motivation was, that all of
that entered the record, and that is all we are doing here.
  So, I think just for the purposes of the record--and when you get
to thinking about it, and all of us, as lawyers, have you ever seen a
hearing in your life like this, where the opponents of the nominee
and, in particular, a single witness, almost on a par in status with
the nominee, is all out of balance--and that's fine, I have no prob-
lem with that, but let us all realize what is happening here. This is
about Clarence Thomas, nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, not
Anita Hill, and it seems to have tilted off in that extraordinary
way.
  One of the things that is in the public domain--and we have a
rule, we have to see it for 2 days--I want to enter into the record
this letter from Andrew S. Fishel, Managing Director of the Feder-
al Communications Commission, where he said that he had lis-
tened to Ms. Hill testify, and he said, "At no time were any of the
employes of OCR at risk of losing their jobs during this period"--
this is the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education.
They had a separate budget earmarked which was more sufficient
to avoid any staff cutbacks. He was involved in the office, I under-
stand.
  "Additionally, no employees were made to feel that their jobs
were in jeopardy"--I keep hearing this come up all the time. Quite
the opposite was true, he said:

  After Mr. Thomas announced his departure from OCR to go to EEOC, Mr.
Thomas made a special point of walking the halls of OCR to introduce Mr. Harry
Singleton, his successor, to OCR staff in order to facilitate the continuity of leader-
ship. Any explanation of Ms. Hill's rationale for leaving OCR to go to EEOC that is
founded on her allegation that she would have lost her job at OCR is without basis.

  I include that in the record, and I thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Dear Senator Biden:

I have been the Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission for
the past two years. I had been Management Director of the Office for Civil
Rights in the Department of Education with direct responsibility for personnel
and EEO during the time Mr. Clarence Thomas was Assistant Secretary. I was
also Financial and Resource Management Director of EEOC while Mr. Thomas was
Chairman. In these capacities, I also knew and worked with Ms. Anita Hill.

I differ with Ms. Hill's statement that she followed Mr. Thomas to EEOC because"
she would have lost her Job at OCR. At no time were any of the employees of
OCR at risk of losing their Jobs during this per!6d. OCR had a separate budget
earmark which was more than sufficient to avoid any staff
Additionally, no employees were made to feel that their Jobs were

by Mr. Thomas' departure from OCR. Quite the opposite was true^"*aTi.up

                 Indeed, Ms. Hill told me at the time that she was flattered To~

^expressed her admiration for Mr. Thomas.

/After I moved to EEOC to be Financial and Resource Management Director,

(Ms. Hill again praised Mr. Thomas to me. In several conversations that were

neld, she expressed both her respect for him as a man and as a leader of the

EEOC.  '

In fact, Ms. Hill and I also talked after she announced her own departure from
EEOC to become a law professor. She told me that she was indebted to
Clarence Thomas for the opportunities he had given her and that he had always
been supportive and encouraging of her career goals.

 sexual harassment--would not be tolerated. At no time during the nearly nine

 of a moral and upright man by the staff h ^ supervised.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Ladies, it has been a long evening, but
before you go out of here, there were some other witnesses and one
of those witnesses pointed out a letter that at that point had been
signed by 50 Yale graduates who had graduated with Anita Hill
and the number is now up to 66. And there is such an inconsisten-
cy between--and it is so difficult to reconcile what you are saying
and what they said.
  I would like to share with you their letter.

  Dear Mr. Chairman, Senator Biden. It has been our privilege to know Anita Hill
professionally and personally since the late 1970's when we were in law school to-
gether. The Anita Hill we have known is a person of great integrity and decency. As
colleagues we wish to affirm publicly our admiration and respect for her. She is em-
broiled now in a most serious and difficult controversy which we know is causing
her great pain.

  We make no attempt to analyze the issues involved, or to prejudge the outcome.
We do, however, wish to state emphatically our complete confidence in her sincerity
and good faith and our absolute belief in her decency and integrity.

  In our eyes it is impossible to imagine any circumstances in which her character
could be called into question. We are dismayed that it has been. We know that it
could not be by anyone who knows her. Anita has imperiled her career and her
peace of mind to do what she felt was right.

  We know we are powerless to shield her from those who will seek to hurt her out
of ignorance, frustration, or expediency in the days ahead. But we will have failed
ourselves if we do not at least raise our voices in her behalf. She has our unhesitat-
ing, non-wavering support.

  Now, the amazing thing about this letter is not only the strength
of the support for this lady but the fact that it came from all over
the world. There were 66 names on it. One of the names is signed
by somebody in Paris, France. One of them is signed by somebody
in London, Ontario. One of the names is signed by somebody in Sao
Paulo, Brazil. One of the names is signed by somebody in Perugia,
Italy, and from New York, and California, and Arizona, and San
Francisco, and all over the country.

  How do you reconcile the fact that these 66 people, who also
knew her as you knew her, although at an earlier point, but they
say that "we have known her as a person of great integrity and
decency and that we have known her professionally since the late
1970's when we were in law school together"? How do you reconcile
the fact? How do you explain it to us, sitting on this committee,
that here are 66 people, who are obviously people of good repute
ostensibly--Yale Law School graduates--and here are four people
who worked with her, also people of good repute and good standing
saying one thing totally different than these 66 Yale graduates are
&aying?

  Ms. FITCH. Senator, my response to that is that I am sure there
are as many people and more who would say that say the same
thing about Judge Thomas. That's the only response I can have to
the question you are asking. I don't know what to say.

  Ms. HOLT. Additionally a question comes to my mind about how
long it has been since those 66 people have seen Professor Hill or
have had any kind of

  Senator METZENBAUM. I am sorry, I didn't hear that.
  Ms. HOLT. HOW long it has been since those people have had any
interaction with Professor Hill.
                                         419

  Senator METZENBAUM. NO, they say specifically and I am not
sure about the facts, that "we are privileged to know her profes-
sionally and personally since the late 1970's when we were in law
school together."

  Now, how much of that time they have seen her, I don't know. I
have to assume that some of them have seen her more than others.
I think 15 of the names are from people here, in Washington.

  Ms. BERRY. Well, I am sure that we had at least 66 women that
were ready to come before this committee to tell them that Judge
Thomas is a man of great decency and integrity if we are going to
play the numbers game.

  Ms. ALVAREZ. YOU will have six times 66 and you had a group of
people out there who will tell you exactly the same thing. It is just
that you limited the time. We only have until Tuesday. We could
go on with people who could come here and testify on Clarence's
behalf and people who have worked with him and people who have
known him.

  Ms. BERRY. And we are not intimidated by 66 names there and
there are just four of us here.

  Ms. ALVAREZ. Even if they went to Yale Law School.
  Ms. BERRY. Exactly. [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. If everyone in the Nation, everyone who went to
law school who is not intimidated by someone who went to Yale
Law School were here we would not have enough room if we piled
them on top of one another. I just want the record to show that
Yale Law School is a fine law school. I don't think it is any finer
law school than a lot of law schools I can think of.
  But having said that, a mild note of levity, I think your time is
up, Senator.
  Senator METZENBAUM. It is in the record?
  The CHAIRMAN. It is in the record. I believe it is already in the
record.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, does anybody on--Senator Kohl?
  Senator KOHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Some of you suggested possible motives for Ms. Hill to have done
what she did. And I can understand that. But what I cannot under-
stand and perhaps you can explain it to me, is what the motives
would be of those four people who came here today, each one who
had heard from Professor Hill over the past 10 years, about these
sexual harassment charges. Reputable people, people who had not
talked to her over the past 2 years, had not talked to her over the
past several months, but clearly reputable people who didn't know
each other, came here from all walks of life.
  And they testified that in 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1987, Professor
Hill told them about what was happening.
  Ms. BERRY. I have already challenged Mr. Carr's statement. He
said that Anita Hill told him that she was harassed by her supervi-
sor. And he made the great leap that the supervisor that she was
referring to was Clarence Thomas. And that, right there, is suspect
to me when I know, for a fact, that Anita Hill had more than one
supervisor.
  Senator KOHL. Okay. So in your case, you are saying her com-
ments might have been about somebody else at EEOC? Her com-
ments might not have referred specifically to him. All right, I
think that is possible.
  Diane.
  Ms. HOLT. Senator, I think I would question the fact that none of
those people who Professor Hill told that she had been sexually
harassed did not provide any advice. These were professional
people. They knew what the recourse was. Nobody told her to go
forward with her story.
  Senator KOHL. But the assumption there is that all four of them
are lying.
  Ms. HOLT. That's not my assumption.
  Senator KOHL. But that is what you are saying.
  Ms. HOLT. NO, I said I questioned that fact.
  Senator KOHL. I know but let's just move on to real talk. If you
question that fact, you question the veracity of what they are
saying.

   Ms. HOLT. I do, yes.

  Senator KOHL. All right, that is another way of saying in your
opinion

  Ms. HOLT. I question it, but I am not calling them liars.
  Senator KOHL. Well, we are just trying to use nice words, but I
want to understand. You can say that, there is nothing wrong with
it, but your explanation is that they are not telling the truth?
   Ms. HOLT. That's right, I don't believe it.
   Senator KOHL. I appreciate that.
  And Ms. Fitch.
  Ms. FITCH. Senator, in discussing motivation I have said that I
only understand my own. I cannot, I cannot try to discuss their mo-
tivation. I am sure they had the best intentions and wanted to be
helpful to the person that they believe in. I don't know what else to
say about that question. It is a question that I can't answer.
   Senator KOHL. MS. Alvarez?
                                                    424

  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, likewise, I couldn't begin to put motivation or
words into somebody's mouth or in their heads. I think that there
was possibly some, like Phyllis talked about, there may have been,
it may not have been who they all assumed it was. I can't really, I
can't offer any more explanation than that. There may have just
been a misunderstanding of what she had to say.

  Senator KOHL. All right. Just one other quick question.
  Clarence Thomas has spoken here of a conspiracy, a lynching on
the part of some white people that has a lot to do with what is hap-
pening. In fact, in his opinion, that is the major reason why we are
here today and you, yourself, Ms. Alvarez, said "That we are beat-
ing up on the Judge, and that this is a trumped up deal" and so on.
  But isn't it a fact that what we are dealing with here is a charge
of sexual harassment by an African-American against an African-
American? Isn't that why we are here today? Isn't that the fact of
what brings us here today, an African-American woman who is
charging an African-American man with sexual harassment? Is
there something else that brings us here today?
  I mean aren't we all here and hasn't a Senate committee con-
vened to hold this hearing, because of a charge leveled at an Afri-
can-American man by an African-American woman?
  Ms. BERRY. That's an old tactic in this country, Senator, that we
use and I am sickened by that. That's the thing, I guess, that em-
barrasses me most about this situation is that a black woman
would allow herself to be a pawn to destroy a black man. Have we
reached the point in our civilization or in this country where
people can't legitimately have points of disagreement without
trying to destroy the person because you don't agree with what
that person stands for?
  And the Chairman said, you might kill him but you are not
going to kill his ideas.
  Senator KOHL. NO, we are not suggesting
  Ms. BERRY. There are a lot of other people out there who believe
what Clarence Thomas says and his ideas are beginning to take
root in the black community.
  Senator KOHL. That may well be so but what we are discussing
here is a charge against an African-American man by an African-
American woman. How do we wind up saying this is a racist con-
spiracy?
  Ms. BERRY. I haven't heard him use those terms. I heard him say
a lynching.
  Senator KOHL. MS. Alvarez?
  Ms. ALVAREZ. YOU are not investigating a sexual harassment
charge.
  Senator KOHL. Of course we are. That's what the hearing is
about.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. The statute of limitations ran out.
  Senator KOHL. An allegation of sexual harassment, that's what
the hearing is all about.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Well, no, an allegation of improper conduct.
  Senator KOHL. Again, an allegation made by an African-Ameri-
can woman against an African-American man.
  Ms. BERRY. Lynching doesn't necessarily have to refer to race.
  Senator KOHL. Well
                                                   425

  Ms. BERRY. I mean what is happening to Clarence Thomas is, in
my estimation, a

  Senator KOHL. MS. Alvarez, then I will be finished.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. NO, I guess I am not sure quite the point you are
trying to make.
  Senator KOHL. Well, I am trying to understand why you
  Ms. ALVAREZ. YOU are trying to say this isn't a lynching?
  Senator KOHL [continuing]. I can't understand why you are
saying and that Thomas is saying that this is a racist conspiracy
against
  Ms. ALVAREZ. I did not say that.
  Senator KOHL. Well, you are saying, we, meaning the committee,
are beating up on the Judge.

   Ms. ALVAREZ. Yes.

  Senator KOHL. He is calling it a lynching and you are saying we
are beating up on a Judge, but what we are doing here is trying to
understand whether there is any truth in the allegation made by
an African-American woman against an African-American man.

  Ms. ALVAREZ. I think there is a much better way that it could
have been done, not in this kind of forum

  Senator KOHL. Well, that's true.
  Ms. ALVAREZ [continuing]. And not in broad daylight and not on
television and
  Senator KOHL. Well, that's true, but the allegation, itself, is an
allegation made by an African-American woman against an Afri-
can-American man. That is just a fact.
   Ms. ALVAREZ. But what does that have to do? I mean that means
it is okay to beat him up? I am not sure what you are saying. I am
saying when I made that statement I think there was a better way
for this whole thing to have been investigated and to have been
handled. I think we did both of them a disservice by handling it
the way we did, because you just beat him up in broad daylight and
you took his name, his reputation, and his character and you can't
give it back to him. That was my point.

   The CHAIRMAN. Senator, do you have more? Is that it?
   Senator KOHL. Yes. Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   If there are not any more questions I do have two very, very
short questions. And Ms. Fitch, if I ever need an advocate you are
the one I want to hire. You are all very good, but let me ask you
this. I think that one of the points has confused me in this process
not merely who is telling the truth because that perplexes me as
much as it perplexes the American public apparently. I don't know
what the American public thinks. I take that back. It perplexes me.
   Now, you were asked a question by Senator Hatch a while ago, if
I recall, that was an echo of an assertion that Judge Thomas made
yesterday in a very articulate fashion and it was this:
   That isn't this a stereotypical attack on a black man? Judge
Thomas--and I am not criticizing his statement, I just want to un-
derstand it, and as a black historian maybe you can help me--he
indicated that he believed this was--I won't use exactly his words,
because they are not appropriate coming from my mouth--but
something to the effect that if an uppity black person is being put
                                                    426

down by other people, that's what this is about, putting down any
black person who goes against the grain.

   Now, I can understand that. What I can't understand though is
how can one say that and not say the counter charges against Pro-
fessor Hill are not equally, if not more stereotypical, of not taking
seriously a black woman?

   How can one charge about stereotypical behavior apply to the
Judge and not equally apply to Professor Hill. This is not who is
telling the truth--I am talking about this notion of stereotypical
behavior we keep hearing hurled back and forth, across in front of
me and this way as well, not by you but by others.

   Can you shed some light on that point for me?
   Ms. FITCH. I am not sure I really understand the question.
   The CHAIRMAN. Well, the statement was made that the attack on
Judge Thomas, along the lines relating to harassment, were stereo-
typical attacks on black men, they stereotyped black men.

   Ms. FITCH. OK.

   The CHAIRMAN. And what I am saying is if that is true, and I am
not arguing whether it is or isn't, is it not equally true to immedi-
ately question the veracity of a black woman who comes forward to
make an allegation against a black man as preposterous? Doesn't
that just as neatly fit into a stereotypical treatment of black
women who dare speak up? That's my question.

   Ms. FITCH. I think I see where you are going to with this and in
terms of both black men and white men, of course, that is a prob-
lem historically.

   Yes, it is a no-win-no-win.
  The CHAIRMAN. That doesn't go to the veracity of anything. I am
just trying to understand because I heard for the first time the
other day the phrase stereotypical treatment of black men who
dare run against the stream.
   Ms. FITCH. Yes, but in terms of the stereotypical response to
black women it comes first from their experience with white men
in this country. And I
   The CHAIRMAN. I agree with that

   Ms. FITCH. Yes.

   The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. I agree with that, with white men.
   Ms. FITCH [continuing]. Yes, and of course, it can be extended to
any other men.
   The CHAIRMAN. I understand, okay, thank you for clarifying
that. Now, the absolutely last question I have is this: There was
reference made earlier that there was a need to be able to establish
a pattern of behavior. I don't know which of you said it.
   Ms. FITCH. I think I might have talked about patterns and in
trying to explain why I take the Judge's position in this and I am
saying there was not any behavior that was ever evidenced by me
over 7 years by myself, hearing from anyone else and that estab-
lished a portfolio for him for me.
   The CHAIRMAN. Okay, for you?

    Ms. FITCH. Yes.

   The CHAIRMAN. But you were not speaking as an expert in the
field?

   Ms. FITCH. Oh, heaven's no. I think
                                             427

  The CHAIRMAN. Because experts tell me that it is equally plausi-
ble and it happens as often that you have a sexual harassment inci-
dent, as well as you have sexual harassment incidents coming from
a single person. So there is not a need to be able to establish a pat-
tern of behavior in order to establish that there is sexual harass-
ment.

  Ms. FITCH. Senator, I was very careful in the beginning to talk
about possibility and probability.

   The CHAIRMAN. I see.

  Ms. FITCH. And I was addressing myself to probability.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are a good lawyer and witness.
  Ms. FITCH. Oh, God, I am not a lawyer.
  The CHAIRMAN. On behalf of the Senate, it is presumptuous of
me to say that but you are extremely clear and precise and it is
impressive. You all are impressive and I thank you all for being
here. It has been very, very late. You have spent a lot of time and
Clarence Thomas is, indeed, fortunate to have four such loyal sup-
porters who obviously believe every word they said and their expe-
riences are as they have cited and I appreciate it.
  Senator THURMOND. On behalf of this side of the aisle I wish to
express appreciation to all of you and your splendid testimony.
  Ms. ALVAREZ. Thank you.
  Ms. BERRY. Thank you.
  Ms. FITCH. Thank you.
  Ms. HOLT. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you all very much. It has been a long
evening for you. It has been a longer evening, I might add, for the
next panel who has been waiting.
  Now, ordinarily what we had agreed to do was the next panel of
witnesses was going to be a panel of several people testifying on
behalf of Professor Hill. Professor Hill has contacted us and indi-
cated that in the interest of time she is fully prepared to forego
having that panel testify. So we will move that as her decision, not
the committee's decision.
  We will now move to the panel to follow that one. They will be
testifying on behalf of and in support of the position of Judge
Thomas, and that is our first is Stanley Grayson, vice president
with the firm of Goldman Sachs in New York; the second is Carl-
ton Stewart with the Stewart firm in Atlanta, Georgia; the third
witness is John M. Doggett III, a management consultant in
Austin, Texas; and the fourth is Charles Kothe, former Dean of
Oral Roberts University Law Center.
  If you will all please come forward and before you sit we will
swear you in if you will be prepared to stand and be sworn.
   Do you all swear that your testimony will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

   Mr. GRAYSON. I do.

   Mr. STEWART. I do.

   Mr. DOGGETT. I do.

   Mr. KOTHE. I do.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, and welcome. Thank you for your pa-
tience in waiting so long. Now let me ask the panel, is there any
particular way in which you would like to proceed? Have you
talked among yourselves how you would like to proceed?
                                             428

  Mr. GRAYSON. We have not talked, but Dean Kothe has asked if
he could go first.

  The CHAIRMAN. All right.
  Dean, welcome. I know you have waited a long time. Your name
has been spoken of often here, always positively, and so please
begin your testimony, if you would.
  Now again, gentlemen, I am going to ask you to keep your testi-
mony relatively short, if we can, because you notice you will get a
lot of chances to speak, because this panel has no reluctance to ask
you questions.
  Dean, please proceed.

TESTIMONY OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF STANLEY GRAYSON,
  VICE PRESIDENT, GOLDMAN SACHS LAW FIRM, NEW YORK, NY;
  CARLTON STEWART, STEWART LAW FIRM, ATLANTA, GA; JOHN
  N. DOGGETT III, MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT, AUSTIN, TX; AND
  CHARLES KOTHE, FORMER DEAN, ORAL ROBERTS UNIVERSITY
  LAW SCHOOL

  Mr. KOTHE. Mr. Chairman and Senators, my name is Charles A.
Kothe. I am of counsel to the firm of Clay, Walker

  Senator THURMOND. If you don't mind, I would get close to the
microphone so we can hear you all over the room.

  Mr. KOTHE. I am presently of counsel to the firm of Clay,
Walker, Jackman, Dempson and Moller in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

  During March of 1983 I was acting as the founding dean of the
O.W. Coburn School of Law at Oral Roberts University (ORU).
Being interested in our public relations and in our identity with
the American Bar Association Accrediting Committee, I decided to
have a program on civil rights. I had conducted many of them over
the years.

  I contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and
talked to Clarence Thomas. I did not know him before that. He said
he would come out to a seminar, and asked if he could bring a
member of his staff, and I said of course. And so in April of 1983
we had a seminar on civil rights on our campus, and that is where
I first met Anita Hill. In fact, the first time I talked with her, I
recall, was at a luncheon at which Mr. Thomas was to be the fea-
tured speaker.

  I learned at that time that she was from Oklahoma, and just out
of the blue I said, "How would you like to come home and teach?"
And she said, "I would like it."

  And after the press conference that followed the luncheon, I told
Chairman Thomas about my conversation and asked what he
thought of it. He said, "Well, if that is what she would like to do, I
would be all for it." And I said, "Well, do you think she would
make a good teacher?" And I believe he said, "I think she would
make a great teacher."

  Following that, I arranged for her to be put in the process of
filing applications which would go through our assistant dean. I
wouldn't be involved in the paperwork until all of the recommen-
dations were in. And sometime late in May I received her applica-
tion, I believe, and all of the recommendations, and one from
Chairman Thomas that was one of the most impressive, strongest
                                      429

statements in support of a candidate for our faculty that we had
ever received.

  Based upon that and, I believe, a conversation also with Chair-
man Thomas, I recommended to our provo that we engage her as a
member of our faculty. That doesn't just happen perfunctorily at
ORU, to get on the faculty because the dean says so. No one gets
on the faculty at that school unless Oral Roberts approves, and
after Oral Roberts, the chairman of the Board of Regents. And that
happened in her case, and sometime in June she was offered a posi-
tion on our faculty to take effect in August of 1983.

  In 1984 I resigned as dean, to become effective in June, and
during that time as she and I became better acquainted and I
learned of her working on special projects, I spoke to her about my
interest in civil rights, which had started with the act of 1964, and
indicated I would be interested in some special assignments. And
through her I was put in touch with Chairman Thomas, and led
ultimately to my appointment in April of 1984, or maybe it was
April of 1985, to a special assistant to Clarence Thomas at the
EEOC.

  During that time I had a number of assignments, one among
which was, I wrote the 33-page report on the success story of Clar-
ence Thomas, which was basically the improvements that he made
and the progress he had made at EEO, and she conferred with me
about that.

  The CHAIRMAN. I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. You were assigned
to do what?

  Mr. KOTHE. I was assigned to work with the various persons in
the EEO on the progress that was made from previous administra-
tions. Anita had been working on a history of the EEO, and I put
together a 33-page report which I labeled "The Success Story of
Clarence Thomas", outlining the progress that had been made over
previous years.

  In 1986 ORU law school was closed, and Anita went to OU. I
didn't keep in as close a touch with her at that time.

  In April of 1987 a speech was made by Clarence Thomas in Tulsa
before a personnel group, that I believe was arranged by Anita.
She and I and my wife sat at the table together, and Clarence
Thomas was there at that dinner.

  After he spoke, he stayed at my home, which he has on several
other occasions. The next morning we had breakfast together, and
she attended the breakfast, and it was one of joviality and just one
of joy. After that, as I recall it, she volunteered to take him to the
airport in her sports car, of which she was quite proud.

  During that period we were in touch only by telephone, and in
April or May of 1987 she sent me a white paper on a project that
had been under discussion for a seminar which she described as de-
veloping an EEO program that really works. The featured subject
of that was to be sexual harassment, and I was to, as she outlined
in the program, to open the program on that subject.

  We had talked about it, and all the time we ever talked about it,
never once did she tell me or hint to me that she had had any per-
sonal experience of sexual harassment; never once in any of that
time that that was under preparation, or in any other of the discus-
sions we ever had when she was on our faculty, when she was in
                                               430

my home, whenever we were together at any time, that Clarence
Thomas was anything less than a genuinely fine person. In fact,
she was very complimentary about him in every time we have ever
talked together.

  The last time she and I were together was in late 1987 or 1988,
when we were both on the program for some personnel group in
Tulsa. In discussing the preparation for that with her, I took what
was generally my role of outlining the success story of Clarence
Thomas. She took the technical part, and I think it had to do at
that time with a case that involved pensions and civil rights.

  And at that time, I believe Clarence Thomas had been married
by that time, but in our discussions about him she was always very
complimentary and I felt that she was fascinated by him. She
spoke of him almost as a hero. She talked of him as a devoted
father. She talked to me about his untiring energy. She never,
ever, in all of our discourse, in all of those situations, ever said
anything negative about him; and when we discussed the possibili-
ty of preparation for a seminar on sexual harassment, never said a
word about her personal experience, or even her insights to any
great degree.

  In my experience with Clarence Thomas as a special assistant, I
didn't have an office assigned, and frequently I would make my
work station at the large conference table that he had in his office.
Sitting there, I was able to observe him as he had discussions with
some of the staff. Some of the employees would come, and other
guests.

  I traveled with this man for hours on end in automobiles, when
we went through the swamps of Georgia together where he showed
me where he was reared, and I have traveled with him by plane. I
have been with him in business meetings, at banquets, at dinners
in my home at least four times. We talked on to the end of the
night in discussions of things that were of interest to both of us.

  Never, ever in all of that time did I ever hear that man utter a
profane word, never engage in any coarse conduct or loose talk.
Always it was sincere, many times religious. We were both reading
together, you might say at the same time together, the books by
Rabbi Kushner, the one, "Why Bad Things Happen to Good
People", and I suppose that is almost prophetic, and the other,
"Who Needs God?" In fact, as we last talked about the one, "Who
Needs God?" he built a sermon on that that he later gave in the
pulpit at the church where he was married.

  The last time I was with Clarence Thomas, he was our speaker
at the Oklahoma Bar Association prayer breakfast, and on that oc-
casion he told the story of his life and his spiritual experience, at
the close of which he gave a prayer that brought tears to my eyes
and many others there. That day we heard a man of God talk.

  I have been with this man. He is a man of strength. He is a man
of character. He is a man of high moral standing, and I tell you
that it is not possible that he could be linked with the kinds of
things that have alleged against him here. If it were true, it is the
greatest Jekyll and Hyde story in the history of mankind. This is a
good man, a man I have known, and a man I respect, and a man I
think is worthy of a position on the U.S. Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
                                      431

  Now, since you have waited so long, we are going to continue
that but, Mr. Doggett, if you could make your statement a little
briefer, and the rest of you, so we get a chance to ask questions,
since we are getting into past 11. Mr. Doggett?

  Mr. DOGGETT. I appreciate that, Senator. About 6:30 this morning
in Austin, Texas, I got a telephone call saying, "We would like you
to get to Washington as soon as possible." Any of you who know
about Austin, Texas know that that is not all that easy to do.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I am glad we waited this long so you could
make it.

  Mr. DOGGETT. Well, I have been here for quite a few hours. I got
here about 2:30 actually.

  The CHAIRMAN. I know it has been a long day. I appreciate that.

                 TESTIMONY OF JOHN N. DOGGETT III
  Mr. DOGGETT. I appreciate what you are trying to do, because
this is a very difficult process. The charges that Anita Hill has
made against Clarence Thomas, if true, would justify all of you and
all of us saying that he would not be fit to serve on any court, not
just the Supreme Court. In fact, those charges, if true and if filed
formally, would raise serious questions about legal liability on his
part and possibly criminal liability on his part.
  I am also saddened by the process of having some of the best and
brightest people in our country coming before the world, throwing
mud. Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, as I knew them back then,
were good, decent, bright, committed people, and it is hard for me
to be here knowing that one of them has to be destroyed if our
Nation is to be saved.
  I appreciate how difficult what you are doing is. I don't think
you have had a choice. Once those serious charges were made, you
had no choice but to do what you could to find out whether or not
there is any truth to them.
  I have been impressed at the amount of work you and your staff
have been able to do in such a short period of time. As a former
litigator, I know I never would have tried to do what you have
done in 2 or 3 days.
  A week ago--well, let me tell you a little about who I am. I will
try to be as short as I can, but I think this is very important.
  I was born in a housing project in San Francisco, because my
father left the east coast to be a minister to black workers who
were coming from the South to work in the Navy Yard in San
Francisco as part of the war effort. My family has had a commit-
ment from the beginning to civil rights. My father was an associate
of Martin Luther King. My father was the president of the
NAACP, St. Louis branch, for 10 years. My mother was a teacher
who served inner city students for all of her life.
  At every step of my education in the public schools of Los Ange-
les, I was told by white teachers that I was not going to be able to
excel because I was black. And my parents told me, "Whatever
they say is irrelevant. You are going to do the best you can."
  To give you an example, when I was in high school I asked for
the catalogs for MIT and Cal Tech, and the college counselor gave
me the catalogs for Illinois Institute of Technology. When I was in
                                             432

high school, a good friend of mine who is now a tenured professor
at Pomona College asked for an SAT application and she said,
"You have to have your parents come here to get a SAT applica-
tion." That is the world I grew up in.

  I went to Claremont Men's College in 1965, and if you remember
1965, there was something called the Watts riots. That is what hap-
pened between my senior year of high school and my first year as a
freshman. At Claremont Men's College, I was one of eight black
students. All but two of us were freshmen. And when we would
walk the streets of Claremont, people would stop and look at us.
That is how strange we were.

  And I can go on and I can go on and I can go on. I was the found-
ing chairman of the Black Student Union of Claremont College, at
the same time receiving an award from the ROTC as the most out-
standing cadet in ROTC, in the midst of the Vietnam war, a war I
opposed.

  It was difficult for me to make a decision to come here, but I felt
I had no choice. When I graduated from Claremont Men's College,
I went to Yale Law School, and in my third year at Yale Law
School, Clarence Thomas came as a first year student. My class at
Yale Law School was the largest number of black students ever to
be admitted at Yale Law School, and half of those who came, never
graduated.

  My first year at Yale Law School also was the time that there
was the Black Panther trial, that the hippies and the yippies came
to New Haven. It was a tumultuous time, and my experience at
Yale Law School was a time where we said, as black students, "We
are going to be the best possible people we can, and we are going to
work on admission standards that guarantee that we get the best
people we can possibly get." Clarence Thomas was one of those
people.

  In my senior year, in my third year at Yale Law School, one of
the things we all did, we black law students, was to put together a
seminar, a pre-entrance program, a week or so, in conjunction with
the administration, to make sure that we could tell our colleagues
about the ropes, so that they could maximize their performance.
And I remember some of the students who had come before me
saying, "It is impossible for black students to score the same on the
law school admissions test as whites. It is impossible for black stu-
dents to have the same GPAs."

  And there were a handful of us who said that was--well, this is
the Senate, and there are people who don't like obscenity--but
there were a handful of people who had a very strong and negative
reaction to that. And I remember with pride when the dean of Yale
Law School was able to come up to some of those people and say, "I
have in my hand a list of 15 applicants who are black, who have
qualifications that meet the standards of anybody who is going to
come to this law school."

  I want to say that because that is my background.
  When I graduated from Yale Law School, I took a job as a Regi-
nald Hebrew Smith Community Lawyer Fellow, which is a special
program the Government set up to make sure that legal service
programs would have access to the best and brightest law students
in the United States.
                                                  433

  In the summer after I graduated, I took the bar exam at Con-
necticut while I was working full time as an attorney for New
Haven Legal Assistance in New Haven. I studied for the bar exami-
nation in California, took that bar in February and passed it. In 9
months I took two different bar examinations and passed them,
and worked as a legal services attorney and then eventually as the
director of the Office of Legal Services of the State Bar of Califor-
nia.

  There is a lot more I could say. I am not going to say it right
now, but I just wanted to let you know that I have worked all my
life to fight for a very simple idea: That is that we people who
happen to be black are as capable as anybody else.

  I now am a management consultant. I have refused, even though
I have been asked by clients, to apply for the 8(a) program, and to
this year I have not participated in any so-called set-aside, affirma-
tive action programs. And the only one I ever participated in was
this summer, where all you had to say was that you were 100 per-
cent owned by blacks or by some other so-called minority group, be-
cause I wanted to prove that the reason people hired me was be-
cause I was the best there was.

  I eventually went to Harvard Business School, where amazingly
enough one of my friends was John Carr, the same John Carr who
was here testifying on behalf of Anita Hill. And in fact, of Anita
Hill, Clarence Thomas, and John Carr, John Carr is the person I
am closest to because he is the person I knew the best. We were
classmates at Harvard Business School.

  I worked for Salomon Brothers during the summer. They offered
me a full-time job. I turned them down. I joined McKenzie and
Company here.

  I met Anita Hill at a party in 1982, as far as I can remember,
and I say as far as I can remember because, gentlemen, I had not
thought about Anita Hill for 8 or 9 years, until I heard--until I
read in the New York Times last Monday that she had made these
charges against Clarence Thomas.

  I was introduced to Anita Hill by a man named Gil Hardy, a
Yale Law School graduate who eventually was a partner in the law
firm that Anita Hill worked for initially. It is unfortunate that Gil
Hardy is not here, and the only reason he is not here is that he is
dead. He died in a scuba-diving accident off the coast of Morocco.

  Gil Hardy knew Clarence and knew Anita more than anybody I
know, and if he was here, we probably would not be here now.

  I talked to Clarence on a number of occasions, and one of the
reasons I came forward is that I remember those conversations,
and Clarence told me--and let me tell you, at this time I was a
Democrat, at this time I really had some reservations about wheth-
er or not the Reagan revolution was good for this country, at this
time I was being hammered by Reagonites, because of my atti-
tudes, and when I found out that somebody who had been a class-
mate of mine who I had assisted at Yale Law School was now in
the position of being one of the top-breaking blacks in the Reagan
administration, I wanted to go talk to this man and find out what
was going on, because I knew he would tell me the truth.

   One of the things that Clarence Thomas told me that really
stuck in my mind, and one of the reason I said I've got to get this
                                             434

information to this committee and let them decide whether or not
it is valuable, is that he said, "John, they call me an Uncle Tom.
They are at my back. They are looking for anything they can use
to take me out." He was quite aware of the scrutiny that he was
under and the fact that his positions were very unpopular.

   I also remember him talking about Bradford Reynolds, who at
that time was the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, and
many of us, including myself, complained that this man was not
qualified to lead the civil rights effort of the Justice Department.
He said, "John, the Reagan administration went to every black Re-
publican lawyer it knew, and they all turned the job down, and so
nobody can complain about Brad Reynolds being there. But I will
tell you, one of my jobs is to make sure that I can try to keep this
guy honest."

  John Carr and I went to business school together. He was in the
joint program. I had practiced 7 years after Yale Law School and
had decided that the only way to help poor people and people who
were opposed, was to learn more about how the economic system
worked, to learn more about how businesses worked.

   Since John was in the joint degree program, after I graduated
from Harvard and came down to Washington, DC, he remained at
Harvard for another year and then went to New York.

  In all the years that I have known John Carr, he has never men-
tioned knowing Anita Hill, and yet she stated that she dated that
man and he said here that he would not call it dating.

   In all the years that I have known Clarence Thomas, except for
knowing that Anita Hill worked for him, he never mentioned her
name. We never had any conversations about her. He mentioned
the names of a number of friends. At times, it was clear he was
very interested in trying to get me to know more black Republican
conservatives, hoping to be able to convert me to the cause. He was
not successful. But he never mentioned her.

  And all the times that I had conversations with Anita Hill on
the telephone and in person, that I observed her at parties of black
Yale Law School graduates, she never ever talked about Clarence
Thomas or talked about any problems or anything about that man.

  I did have an experience with Ms. Hill just before she left to go
to Oral Roberts University. And but for that experience, I would
not be here, because other than that, my experience and relation-
ships with Anita Hill was what I would consider very normal, cor-
dial, and I thought of her as a decent person.

   As you know, I submitted an affidavit to you. Ever since this
committee released that affidavit to the press, the press has come
to me saying would you talk about that affidavit. I said no, I am an
attorney, I do not feel that is appropriate for me to discuss any-
thing that is going to be discussed by this committee, before the
committee has an opportunity to discuss it with me.

  Ted Koppel's office called and said would you be on Nightline?
Tom Brokaw's office called. Garick Utley's office called. I even got
a call a couple of days ago, saying, well, if you won't talk to us
before you testify, will you show up on a Good Morning or Today
Show after you testify? I am not going to do that. I am sickened by
the fact that the best people, some of the best black people in this
country, some of the best people in this country are participating
                                         435

in such a destructive process. But I respect the fact, Senators, that,
given the severity of the charges, you had no choice.

  There are many things that I could say. There are many things
that I will say. I stand behind the affidavit that I submitted to you,
and I look forward to the time when this body and your colleagues
vote on the nomination of Clarence Thomas, and I very much hope
that you confirm Clarence Thomas.

  But there is one other thing that I want to say, before I wait to
respond to your questions. My wife and I--my wife is here behind
me--were at a Thai restaurant last night with a friend of ours who
had flown in from Africa to do some business with us, and this all
blew up in all of our faces. Another one of our friends came up to
us and said, "John, I just want to look at somebody who is stupid
enough to stand up to the world and say here I am, throw stones at
me, throw knives at me, throw rocks at me."

  Since you released my affidavit that I submitted to you, the
press--I received a number of telephone calls, 40 in 2 hours, imme-
diately after. Most of them have been positive, but some of them
have been negative and some of them have been threatening. One
of them was a man who left a message that was very simple,
"Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom," click, and he was not imitating
the Eveready Rabbits.

  I am from Texas, now, and those are supposed to be gunshots.
  Last night, at that same Thai restaurant, a woman came out, as
we were leaving, and said, "Shame, shame, shame, shame." I said,
"Excuse me, do you know any of the people involved? Do you know
Anita Hill? Do you know Clarence Thomas? Do you know me?" She
kept saying, "Shame, shame, shame, shame." I said, "Do you know
any of the facts?" And she said, "You know nothing about PMS,
and I can't stand any man who says a woman is unstable." I said,
"But do you know anything about the facts?" And she said--and
I'm sorry I have to say this--she said, "Put your penis back in your
pants." [Laughter.]
  This is somebody I had never seen before, somebody I do not
know, somebody I hope I will never see again.
  But I will tell you, Senators, I am not here for any dther reason
than to say I had information that I thought would be of use to
you. You have decided this information is useful, and when this
process is over, except possibly talking to people as I leave this
building, I hope to never have to talk about this again.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Stewart?

                   TESTIMONY OF CARLTON STEWART

   Mr. STEWART. Good evening, Senators, Senator Thurmond--I see
that Senator Biden's seat is empty--and other distinguished mem-
bers of the committee.

  My name is Carleton Stewart. I am a graduate of Holy Cross Col-
lege and the University of Georgia Law School. I was formerly
house counsel to Shell Oil Company, in Houston, TX, and Delta
Airlines, in Atlanta, GA, respectively.

  Additionally, I was a senior trial attorney with the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission, in Atlanta, GA, and later a
special assistant to Judge Clarence Thomas, in Washington. Subse-
                                                    436

quently, I was as partner in the law firm of Arrington & Hallowell,
in Atlanta, GA, and I am currently a principal in the Stewart firm
in Atlanta, GA.

  As aforestated, I was a special assistant to Judge Clarence
Thomas at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during
much of the time that Anita Hill was employed there. At no time
did I hear any complaints from Ms. Hill concerning sexual harass-
ment. At no time during my tenure at EEOC, did I observe or hear
anything relative to sexual harassment by Judge Clarence Thomas.

  In August of 1991, I ran into Ms. Anita Hill at the American Bar
Association Convention, in Atlanta, GA, whereupon she stated, in
the presence of Stanley Grayson, how great Clarence's nomination
was and how much he deserved it. We went on to discuss Judge
Clarence Thomas at our tenure at EEOC for an additional 30 or so
minutes. There was no mention of sexual harassment nor anything
negative about Judge Thomas stated during that time.

  Senator THURMOND. Would you pull the microphone closer to
you, so that people in the back can hear you?

  Mr. STEWART. Okay. I will boom for you.
  I have known Judge Clarence Thomas for more than 30 years,
and I find the allegations by Ms. Hill not only ludicrous, but totally
inconsistent and inapposite to his principles and his personality.
  I will shorten this, so that we can get on with this. Thank you.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Grayson?

                   TESTIMONY OF STANLEY GRAYSON

  Mr. GRAYSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Thurmond,
members of this Judiciary Committee.

  My name is Stanley E. Grayson. I reside in the city and State of
New York. I am a vice president at the investment banking firm of
Goldman Sachs & Company. Immediately prior to joining Goldman
Sachs, approximately 20 months ago, I served as the deputy mayor
for finance and economic development for the city of New York.

  I am a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School and
the College of the Holy Cross.

  During the weekend of August 10, 1991, while at the hotel and
conference headquarters for the American Bar Association's con-
vention, in Atlanta, GA, I was introduced to Prof. Anita Hill by
Mr. Carleton Stewart.

  At this meeting, Ms. Hill, Mr. Stewart and I sat and conversed
for at least 30 minutes. During the course of our conversation, in
the presence of Mr. Stewart, Ms. Hill expressed her pleasure with
Judge Thomas' nomination, and stated that he deserved it.

  During this time, Ms. Hill made no mention of any sexual har-
assment by Judge Thomas, nor did she in any way indicate any-
thing that might call into question the character or fitness of
Judge Thomas for the U.S. Supreme Court. To the contrary, she
seemed to take great pride in the fact that she had been a member
of Judge Thomas' staff at the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you.
  Dean Kothe, let me just ask you a question here. References are
made here in different statements about a period of time when
                                               437

Judge Thomas was visiting you and apparently staying at your
home. There was a dinner, where Professor Hill was invited and a
breakfast the next morning where Professor Hill was invited, as
was Judge Thomas, then Chairman Thomas, and that she drove
Judge Thomas to the airport.

  My recollection is that Professor Hill said that you asked her to
do that. Do you recall those incidents, and did you ask her to do it?
And if you did ask her to do it, did she leave any impressions,
verbal or physical, that she didn't want to be with Judge Thomas
or had any problem doing what you asked her to do, if you did ask
her to take him to the airport? Do you remember the incident, first
of all?

  Mr. KOTHE. Oh, yes, but you would have to describe the setting,
to fully understand even the importance of your question.

  You know, the part that offends me so much here is that Clar-
ence Thomas has never been described. You say who is the real
Clarence Thomas? Well, the real Clarence Thomas is a warm, won-
derful human being.

  Senator DECONCINI. Yes, I understand that.
  Mr. KOTHE. Let me finish.
  Senator DECONCINI. Just address the area, if you will, please.
  Mr. KOTHE. Yes, I will. At that breakfast, if you ever heard him
laugh, it would vibrate this room. Anita doesn't have just a modest
little laugh, either, and the two of them were just laughing, and it
was laughing at laughing, incidents they would bring up about
things that they were privy to that I was not, but my wife and I
would sit there and just watch these two people just enjoy one an-
other, as you do when you are in his presence.
  When it ended, time to go to the airport, whether I asked her to
take him to the airport, I don't think it was that way. It was a
question of his going to the airport and she just said, "Well, I'll
take him," and that's the way I recall it. But it was in a setting of
conviviality or joy.
  Senator DECONCINI. Of close friendship and respect in the
  Mr. KOTHE. Oh, my, you would have had to have been there to
understand it.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, dean, very much.
  Mr. Doggett, your affidavit is of interest, of course, because if you
want to draw something from it, you can, and if you don't want to,
you don't have to. One thing you can draw from it is that perhaps
Ms. Hill--when you knew her then, she was not Professor Hill, I
don't believe--would somewhat fantasize as to a relationship that
she thought she was going to have with you. Is that a fair observa-
tion or your interpretation?
  Mr. DOGGETT. That was the conclusion I came to, in response to
what I felt was an absolutely bizarre statement she made to me at
her going-away party.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. I have no further questions.
  The CHAIRMAN [presiding]. Senator Thurmond?
  Senator THURMOND. I have asked Senator Specter to propound to
these witnesses.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                               438

  We have heard many impressive witnesses during the course of
these proceedings, but I do not believe that we have heard any
more impressive than this panel.

  I want to divide the first portion of the 15 minutes into two seg-
ments. Professor Kothe and Mr. Doggett have both submitted affi-
davits, which develop the statement of a fantasy on the part of Pro-
fessor Hill, and I will examine both of them to see if there was any
connection or any suggestion as to their use of the word "fantasy,'
and I can see Professor Kothe moving forward to suggest to the
contrary, but I will come to that.

  I first want to take up the testimony of Mr. Stewart and Mr.
Grayson, because their testimony is much briefer, although by the
time you finish your questioning tonight, you won't think so.

  Going to a very important conversation which was held very re-
cently, according to the statements of Mr. Stewart and Mr. Gray-
son, in August of this year, and a subject that I questioned Profes-
sor Hill about in detail, Mr. Stewart, you have already testified,
and the critical part of your statement or your affidavit is, as fol-
lows:

  "In August of 1991, I ran into Ms. Hill at the American Bar As-
sociation Convention, in Atlanta, Georgia, whereupon she stated to
me in the presence of Stanley Grayson, 'How great Clarence's nom-
ination was and how much he deserved it.' "

  Mr. Stewart, are you sure that's the essence of what Professor
Hill told you?

  Mr. STEWART. Absolutely.
  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Grayson's statement refers to the weekend
of August 10, 1991, at the American Bar Association Convention, in
Atlanta, Georgia, where he says he was introduced to Professor
Hill by Mr. Stewart, and this is his statement: "During the course
of our conversation, in the presence of Mr. Stewart, Ms. Hill ex-
pressed her pleasure with Judge Thomas' nomination and stated
that 'he deserved it.'"
  Mr. Grayson, are you certain that Professor Hill said that?
  Mr. GRAYSON. Yes, I am, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Later I'm going to come back to what Ms. Hill
said by way of denial. But for the point of the first 15 minutes, I
want to move at this point to what Mr. Doggett and Mr. Kothe
have had to say.
  And, Professor, I want to start because of limitation of time, and
you will be expanding in great detail on your statement, and I
want to turn to the statement which you submitted on October 7th
and ask you if you have a copy of that with you?
  Mr. KOTHE. I have the statement I submitted on October 10.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator? Senator, I am not interrupting this. On
an administrative matter.
  Senator SPECTER. Yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. In light of the hour, do you mind if I make an
announcement about the remainder of the witnesses that people
may be interested in knowing.
  Senator SPECTER. I would be glad to yield to you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. And I apologize, but this has just been decided.
  We have now only one more panel of witnesses and it will be
limited to an hour. Because I would like to read to the Committee
                                      439
a letter that I sent after a number of conversations with my col-
leagues, Democrats and Republicans, to Ms. Wright, who was going
to testify, or potentially going to testify, had been subpoenaed, and
to Ms. Jourdain, who was going to corroborate the testimony of Ms.
Wright.

  This is the letter that I telefaxed to her lawyer in the office in
downtown Washington a few minutes ago after extensive negotia-
tions and discussions with Democrats and Republicans and Ms.
Wright's lawyer.

  Dear Ms. Wright: It is my preference that you testify before the
Judiciary Committee in connection with the nomination of Judge
Clarence Thomas. But, in light of the time constraints under which
the Committee is operating and the willingness of all the members
of the Committee to have placed in the record of the hearing the
transcripts of the interviews of you and your corroborating witness,
Ms. Rose Jourdain, J-o-u-r-d-a-i-n, conducted by the majority and
minority staff, I am prepared to accede to the mutual agreement of
you and the members of the Committee, both Republican and Dem-
ocrat, that the subpoena be vitiated. Thus the transcribed inter-
views of you and Ms. Rose Jourdain will be placed in the record
without rebuttal at the hearing.

  I wish to make clear, however, that if you want to testify at the
hearing in person I will honor that request.

  Signed: Sincerely, Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
  Postscript on the bottom I attached from Angela Wright: "I
agree the admission of the transcript of my interview and that of
Ms. Jourdain's in the record without rebuttal at the hearing repre-
sents my position and is completely satisfactory to me."

1                      PROCEEDINGS

2   MS. HOGAN: Hi, Angela. This is Cynthia Hogan,

    from the Senate Judiciary Committee, in Washington.

    I am sorry we are calling you a little bit later

    than we had anticipated, but it took us a little bit of. time

    to get ourselves together this morning.

    I wanted to let you know that, in addition to the

    people I told you would be here, there are several others. I

    told you last night that someone from Senator Thurmond's staf

10 would be here and that I would be here. Of course, I work

11 for Senator Biden.

12  There are actually two people here from Senator ~

13j Biden's office, myself and Harriet Grant, and two people here

14 from Senator Thurmond's office. As well, there are four othei

15 lawyers here who work for different Senators. I wanted to

16 let you know that, before I put you on the speaker phone, so

17 that you were aware that we were here. We also do have a

18 court reporter, as I told you.

19  I am with Senator Biden. Now, if I put you on the

20 speaker phone, I want each of them to identify themselves and

21 to tell you who they work for. I want to reassure you that

22 it still remains that only two people are going to ask you

23 questions, and that is me and Terry Wooten, who works for

24 Senator Thurmond.

25  I just wanted you to be aware that these other
                              445

people are here, since I did not tell you that last night,

and to make sure it was okay with you, before I put you on th«

speaker phone. If it is okay, I will ask each person to

identify themselves for you, so that you are clear about who

is here.

          Is that all right? All right. Hang on.

          MS. HOGAN: Ms. Wright?

          MS. WRIGHT: Yes.

          MS. HOGAN: All right. Why don't we just go around

the room here. I want everyone to identify themselves for

you, and I want to make sure we are on the record, so that

you are aware of who is here.

          MS. GRANT: Hi, Ms. Wright. I am Harriet Grant. I

am with Senator Biden.

          MS. WRIGHT: Okay.

          MR. LETT: Ms. Wright, my name is Winston Lett, and

I am with Senator Heflin.               N

          MS. WRIGHT: Winston, what was his last name?

          MR. LETT: Lett, L-e-t-t.

          MS. WRIGHT: And with Heflin?

          MR. LETT: Yes, ma'am.

          MS. WRIGHT: Okay.

          MS. HARKINS: Ms. Wright, my name is Ann Harkins,

and I am with Senator Leahy.

          MS. WRIGHT: Leahy?
                            446

         MS. HARKINS: Leahy, L-e-a-h-y.

         MS. WRIGHT: Okay.

         MR. BAKER: Ms. Wright, my name is Miller Baker. I

work for Senator Orrin Hatch.

         MS. WRIGHT: Miller Baker, with Orrin Hatch? .

         MR. BAKER: Yes, ma'am.

         MS. RILEY: Ms. Wright, I am Melissa Riley, and I an

with Senator Thurmond's office.

         MS. WRIGHT: Okay.

         MR. WOOTEN: And I am Terry Wooten, with Senator

Thurmond's office.

         Ms. WRIGHT: Okay.                              ' ~

         MR. HERTLING: Ms. Wright, my name is Richard

Hertling, H-e-r-t-1-i-n-g, and I am from Senator Specter's

office.

         MS. WRIGHT: Okay.

Whereupon,

                    ANGELA DENISE WRIGHT

was called for examination and testified, as follows:

         BY MS. HOGAN:

Q Ms. Wright, I am going to ask you again, mostly for

the benefit of the court reporter who is here, just to state

your name, your address, spell your name for us, so we make

sure she gets that down.

A Okay. I will state my name and address and I will
               447

    spell my name. I also would like to just preface whatever we
    are about to say. Okay?

             Q Okay. That's fine.
            A My name is Angela, A-n-g-e-1-a, Denise, D-e-n-i-s-
    e, Wright, W-r-i-g-h-t. What else did you want, my age. or my
    address?
             Q Both would be fine.
            A Okay. I am 37 years old. My address is

               I would also like to ask you to state where you are

121 currently employed, but let me tell you that if you want to

13 make your statement first, go ahead.

14  A Okay. Well, I will do both. I am currently

15 employed as an assistant metro editor at the Charlotte

16 Observer.

17             I want to preface what we are about to say by sayinc

18 that I want to make it clear and I want it on the record that

19 the information that I am about to give is not information

20 that I approached anyone on Capitol Hill or on the Senate

21 Judiciary staff with, but it is something that I have

22 struggled with since I have seen Anita Hill on television on

23 Monday night, and once I got a call from the Senate Judiciary

24 Committee, that decision became quite obvious as to what I

25 should do.
                                 448

                  Now, I will take whatever questions you want.
         Q Okay. I would like you just very briefly, if you
could give us -- and I mean very briefly -- some background
about yourself, say, your education and your job history,
sort of, you know, one sentence.
         A I have a degree in journalism from the University
of North Carolina, at Chapel Hill. Prior to working at the
Charlotte Observer, I worked as the managing editor of the
Winston-Salem Chronicle, prior to that, I worked for the
National Business League in Washington. Prior to ^ " t , I was
back in school in Chapel Hill. Prior to that, I was at the
EEOC. Prior to EEOC, I was at the United States Agency for"
International Development. Prior to that, I was at the
Republican National Committee, and before that I was at the
Republican Congressional Committee, and before that I was at
the office of Senator -- excuse me, Congressman Charlie Rose.
         Q Ms. Wright, as I understand it, you know Clarence
Thomas, is that correct?
         A That is correct.
         Q Can you tell us when you first met him?
         A I first met Clarence Thomas in the late seventies,
probably around 1978-79, when several black staff members of
Republican congressional offices decided to form an
organization called the Black Republican Congressional Staff
Association. It was pretty much an informal organization
                         449

     that disbanded eventually on its own, but our purpose was to

     try and form some type of support group and some type of

     group that could convince other black political-type people

     that the Republican Party was a viable alternative to the

     Democratic Party.

     Q I'm sorry, did you meet Clarence Thomas in the

     course of meetings of this association?

8|   A Yes, that is correct.

9,   Q And how often did you see him in this context? You

10 know, give me a rough estimate.

11   A Probably only three or four times. The organizatioi

12' didn't last very long and I didn't go to every meeting that"

     i

13! was held.

14   Q Okay. Did you consider yourself a friend of his at

15| this time?

16>  A No, an acquaintance.

17|  Q Now, it is also my understanding that you worked

18 with Clarence Thomas at the EEOC, is that correct?

19   A That is correct.

20   Q And can you tell us when you were hired at the EEOC

21 and by whom?

22   A I was hired in March of 1984 by Clarence Thomas.

23   Q Can you tell me a little bit more about how you

24 found out about a job, or did you approach him about a job?

25 Can you give me a little bit of background about that?
                                450

               A I was working as the Director of Media Relations
       for the United States Agency for International Development,
       when a friend of mine -- well, I guess I should really say an
       acquaintance of mine -- Phyllis Barry Meyers, who was at the
       time Clarence Thomas' Director of Congressional Affairs,
       approached me at a reception on Capitol Hill and said that
       Clarence Thomas was in dire need of a Director of Public
      Affairs and would I be willing to talk to him about it, would
 9|j I be willing to consider that position, and I said yes. She
       subsequently went to Clarence Thomas and told him that I
      would consider it, and sometime later I went over and talked
12 to him about the position and he offered it to me and I left

    AID and went to EEOC>

14  Q And you joined EEOC, this was in March of 1984?

    A Yes.

    Q And your title was what?

    A Director of Public Affairs.

    Q And can you describe a little bit for me what your

    job responsibilities were?

    A We had an office that had several public informatioi

    specialists, a video department, and my job was to coordinate

    that staff -- I think at the time there were 27 maybe staff

    members there -- and to produce in-house publications, to be

    the Chairman's publicist, so to speak, his connection with th«

    media, to answer media questions, to advise him on public
                               451

1 appearances, his best contact with the media. He and

2 actually other office directors, I was responsible for

3 advising them on their contact with the media. We also

4 produced seminars on the equal employment laws and things of

5 that nature.  :

6   Q And did you report to Clarence Thomas?

7   A Yes, I did.

8   Q But you did at the same time work for others or

9: handle publicity for other people, is that correct? I just

10 want to make sure I understand --

11  A Publicity, if there was an office at EEOC that was

12| involved in some issue and the media was interested in

13 talking to that office director, generally the media came

14| through me, asked me about setting up interviews with that

15 particular person. It was not something that was required.

16| There, of course, were some office directors who picked off

17 | directly from the media.

18  Q So, although you worked on publicity with other

19 people, you reported directly to Clarence Thomas, is that

20 correct?

21  A That is correct.

22  ' Q And can you give me a rough estimate of how much

23 contact you had with him in the course of your employment?

24  A The contact with Clarence Thomas was pretty much a

"C5 daily contact, in person or at least buzzing him on the phone
                                  452

                                                                                                     10

from my phone to discuss questions from the media or some
other course of business. You know, those were pretty
turbulent times for the EEOC, and we had lots of questions
from the press.

         Q Sure. Did you consider your relationship with
Clarence Thomas at this time to be strictly professional?

         A I considered Clarence Thomas at the time to be --
well, it was -- I guess you could say it was strictly
professional, in that there was no other contact between me
and Clarence Thomas outside of professional activities.

         Q Okay. Now, my understanding is that there are some
statements or some comments that he made to you that you
waned to -- I don't want to characterize them for you, but
that you are willing to tell us about. Can you tell me were
there comments that he made to you that maybe you considered
inappropriate?

        A Yes, I can tell you that during the course of the
year that I worked for Clarence Thomas, there were several
comments that he made. Clarence Thomas did consistently
pressure me to date him. At one point, Clarence Thomas made
comments about my anatomy. Clarence Thomas made comments
about women's anatomy quite often. At one point, Clarence
Thomas came by my apartment at night, unannounced and
uninvited, and talked in general terms, but also conversation
he would try to move the conversation over to the prospect of
                               453

                                                                                 11

      my dating him.

      Q I think if it is all right with you, we need to try

      and go through some of these comments very specifically. You

      have mentioned now that he came to your apartment one evening

      and I believe you said he came over uninvited, is that.

      correct?

      A Yes, that is correct.

                MR. WOOTEN: Can we go back to maybe when it

      started, rather than -- if that is the first contact, fine,

10 but --

li              BY MS. HOGAN:

12    Q I guess maybe I misunderstood. Was this the first

13 time that you felt there was something inappropriate done by
14 Judge Thomas?

15:,  A No, it was not.

I16   Q Okay. Perhaps it would be easier if we could go

17 back to the beginning. You became employed at the EEOC in

18 March of 1984. Do you remember when the first comment or

19 conduct that Clarence Thomas engaged in that you considered

20 inappropriate?

21    A No, I do not.

22j   Q Okay.

23|   A Let me clarify one thing. The night he came by my

24 j apartment was the first and the only time he came to my

25! apartment.
                  454

                                                                     12

        Q Okay.

        A But, no, I cannot sit here and tell you I remember

        dates. What I can tell you is that this is a general course

        of action, this is an attitude and these are comments that

        Clarence Thomas has generally tended to make.

        Q Okay. You mentioned just a moment ago that,

        generally, he pressured you to date him.

8       A Yes.

9       Q Was there anything that occurred along those lines

    i
10 prior to the time he came to your apartment, that you recall?

11;     A Yes.

    I"

12      Q Okay. Could you tell us about that?

13      A Well, I will tell you about one -- let me be

14| specific here. We are talking about a thing that, you know,

15!, p r e t t y m u c h p o p s o u t of C l a r e n c e T h o m a s ' m o u t h w h e n he feels
16 like saying this. We are not talking about, you know,

17 traumatic single events here.

18      Q Right.

19      A We are talking about a general mode of operating.

20 j I can remember specifically one evening when the comment of

21 dating came up, it was when we were having -- the EEOC was

22 having a retirement party for my predecessor, Alf Sweeney,

23 which I had organized for Mr. Sweeney at Mr. Thomas' request,

24 ' and we were sitting at the banquet table while the speakers

25 and things were going through their speeches, and Clarence
                                 455

                                                                                                     13

Thomas was sitting right next to me and he at one point
turned around and said this is really a great job, blah-blah-
blah, and he said and you look good and you are going to be
dating me, too. That was not like the only time he said
something of that nature.

         Q Okay. Do you recall at all approximately when this
banquet occurred?

         A Approximately, it was early summer or late spring
1984. It was held at some type of officers club in Virginia.
I can't remember what the officers club was, but at the time
one of my staff members, John Hawkins, was a member of that
club, and so he was able to procure it for us to have, you
know, we would actually have, you know, a very elaborate
retirement party for Mr. Sweeney.

         Q And this was an evening event?
         A It was, yes.
         Q Was it like a dinner banquet?
         A it was a dinner banquet.
         Q Okay. And you said that you were sitting at the
banquet table with Clarence Thomas?
         A Yes.
         Q Next to you?
         A Yes.
         Q And when he made this remark to you about you would
be dating him, was anyone else sitting there with you?
                                 456

                                                                                                     14

        A Well, there were several people there at the
banquet table, yes.

        Q Do you know whether any of them heard this comment
that Clarence Thomas made to you?

        A I seriously doubt that any of them heard it. He
was sitting right next to me and this wasn't something he was
shouting. He was talking, practically whispering, because
there was actually a program going on.

        Q Okay. Was this a well-attended event? Can you
give me an idea of how many people may have been there?

        A Yes, there were lots of people there, lots of
influential people there, including Congressmen, former
Congressman and Mayor Carl Stokes, Congressman Lewis Stokes.

        Q So, this was not simply EEOC employees?
        A It was not simply EEOC employees. What we had done
was to actually surprise Mr. Sweeney with a lot of old
friends. In fact, his entire family was there. He did not
know this banquet was happening, he did not know that these
people would be there, and a lot of them were old journalists
like -- I cannot remember the lady's name, a black journalist
well known in EEOC, and she just died last year -- anyway,
there were also lots of people from the EEOC there. It was
actually crowded.
         Q Now, after Clarence Thomas made this statement to
you about you dating him --
                          457

                                                                           15

      A Excuse me, I just remembered, Ethel Payne is the

      name of this journalist I tried to remember.

3     Q I'm sorry, what was the last name?

4     A Ethel Payne, P-a-y-n-e.

      Q After Clarence Thomas made this one comment to you,

      was there any further discussion of what he said?

7     A No.

8 j   Q Did you respond in any way to his comment?

9     A No, I never did.

10    Q And he did not follow up his comment with any

11, additional discussion at that time?

12    A No, he did not.

13    Q Okay. Do you remember any other occasions on which

14 he pressured you to date him?
   i

15!|  A No, I do not. I can't give you dates and times and

16 tell you that it was a general course of conversation.

17,   MR. WOOTEN: Was the banquet the first time that

18 Thomas had said something to you?

19    MS. HOGAN: This is Terry Wooten speaking, for your

20 information.

21    MS. WRIGHT: Okay. No, Terry, it was not.

22    ' MR. WOOTEN: If we need to talk more about the

23 banquet, go ahead.

24    BY MS. WRIGHT:

25    Q Was there anything else that occurred at the
                   458

                                                                     16

       banquet that you recall, along these lines?

2      A No.

3      Q Do you remember specifically -- now, I understand

       that you told us that there was this general environment of

       this, but do you remember any specific comments that Clarence

       Thomas made to you along these lines prior to this banquet?

7      A Prior to this banquet?

8      Q Correct.

9      A No, I cannot, any specific comments.

10     Q And what about after this banquet, do you remember

11 any specific comments where he talked to you about dating him?

12;    A No, I can only remember them in general.

13     Q Okay. Why don't you tell us what you remember, in

14| general.

15     A In general, given the opportunity, Clarence Thomas

    !

16 is the type of person -- well, let me back up a minute. In

17j general, given the opportunity, Clarence Thomas would say to

18 me, you know, "You need to be dating me, I think I'm going to

19 date you, you're one of the finest women I have on my staff,"

20 you know, "we're going to be going out eventually."

21     Q And what do you mean by "given the opportunity"?

22     A Given the opportunity, you know, if there was no

23 one else around or we were close enough that he could turn

24 around and whisper something of that nature.

25     A Do you ever recall him saying anything of this
                                  459

                                                                                                     17

nature to you when other people overheard it?
        A No.
        Q If it is all right with you, you mentioned that

this occurred once at your apartment.
        A Yes.
        Q Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
        A He came to my apartment, I opened the door, I

offered him a beer, we talked, he sat at what was actually a
counter separating the kitchen from the living room area, we
sat on bar stools and talked in general about general things
and, you know, the conversation would turn to his desire to
date me, and I would adeptly turn it to some other topic.

         Q And this was the first and only time he was at your
apartment?

        A Yes, that is correct.
         Q And he arrived uninvited?
         A Yes, that is correct.
         Q Did he say why he had come to your apartment?
         A Not that I can recall. My recollection is that he
was in the neighborhood or something, but I can't actually
recall what he said when he came to the door or actually any
specific things about the conversation, except for the nature
of it.
         Q So, you don't remember specific things he stated?
         A No, I don't. You know, I wish I could apologize to
                         460

                                                                           18

      you for that, but it is not the kind of thing I was taking

      notes about or I wasn't keeping a journal.

          Q No, I certainly understand that it is a number of

      years ago, and we just appreciate your sharing with us what

      you remember. The only reason I am trying to ask, you know,

      for specific recollections is in case you have them, I want

      to make sure that we give you an opportunity to tell you.

          A I specifically recall being at a seminar, I can't

      even tell you which seminar, because we had many of them, whei

10 I Clarence Thomas commented on the dress I was wearing and

11' asked me what size my boobs were.

12        Q This was an EEOC conference?

13,      A This was an EEDC seminar.

14:       Q A seminar. I'm sorry, you said it was out of town?

15       A Yes.

16        MR. WOOTEN: Can we go back to the time frame when

17 '. you say Judge Thomas came to your apartment? I don't know

18: that we got the time frame. Can you give us an approximate

19 date?

20        MS. WRIGHT: Well, it was not in the summer, it was

21 like it was cold, it was the end of fall or early winter.

22        BY MS. HOGAN:

23        Q And do you know how he knew where your apartment

24 was?

ifi5      A Well, I lived in that same apartment for about 5
                                  461

                                                                                           19

     years on Capitol Hill, three blocks from the white House --

     excuse m e , from the office building. Most of the people who

     knew me knew where I lived.

               M S . HOGAK: I think it would be easier for her, if

     I continue.

               MR. WOOTEN: If we could --

               MS. WRIGHT: It doesn't matter to me how you want

     to --

               MR. WOOTEN: I don't want to create confusion, but

10 this is done in the time when you say Judge Thomas came to
li your apartment when you worked at the EEOC, is that correct oi

12. not? I don't want to put words in your mouth, but --

13i            M S . WRIGHT: That is correct.

14             MR. WOOTEN: I am just trying to get a general time
               BY MS. HOGAN:
    I'
15! frame.

  I

16

            Q  This was during the year that you worked with Judge

     Thomas at the EEOC?

            A  That is correct.

            Q  In the fall or possibly the winter?

            A Yes.

            Q  The next thing you mentioned was this EEOC seminar,

     do you have any recollection of when this occurred,

     approximately?

     A         No. We went to several seminars. In fact, my only
                           462

                                                                             20

    recollection of it is that we were walking towards a meeting

    room and I was briefing him, giving him information on what

    this particular seminar was about; you know, the general run

    of the mill things that public relations folks do and there

    were other people walking just ahead of us, people in his

    legal staff. But I can't remember which seminar that was, or

    which hotel that was. We held seminars in Denver, in Miami,

    I think, in Texas.

    Q Do you remember what the subject of the seminar was!

10  A Well, the subjects of the seminar generally were

li about the laws under which EEOC operated and the laws that

12 EEOC was charged with enforcing. We held community seminars

13, to simply go to the communities and tell people, you know,

14! this is what is qualified as age discrimination, this is what

1 5 I qualifies as sexual harassment, this is what qualifies as

      i

16' race discrimination and this is what the law says, and we had

17| other, you know, experts from around the agency -- lawyers a m

18 those type of people -- to pretty much sit on panels and

23 discuss all aspects of discrimination law.

20  Q So these were seminars that the EEOC gave on some

21 type of regular basis?

22  A That's true, yes.

23  Q And they were given across the country?

24  A Yes.

«5  Q And they were given to who? Was the public invited
                              463

                                                                                21

       to these conferences?

2      A Yes, they were.

3      Q Okay, and can you give me an average of how many of

       these conferences you would attend with Clarence Thomas a

       year or in the year- that you worked for him?

       A I think during that year we had four or five. I

       can't say for sure, it is like four or five. But I want to

       make it clear that I did not attend them with him. I

       generally advanced him. My staff and I went out, prior to

10 Clarence Thomas, or any of the legal people getting there.

11     Q Did he attend all EEOC seminars of this type that

12 j were given across the country?

13;    A As far as I can remember, yes.

14     Q And you would do the advance work for all of these?

15'    A Yes.

16     Q Okay, do you know whether anyone overheard the

    i

17 comment to him, the comment that he made to you in this hotel'

18     A No, I don't. If they did, they did not react to it

19     Q Okay, did you tell anyone about it?

20     A No, I did not.

21     Not, let me put it, not, I did not walk away from

22 that situation and go say, you know, guess what Clarence

23 Thomas just said.

24     Q Okay.

25     A But in the course of other conversations that I had
                    464

                                                                     22

    with other people, particulary women, about Clarence Thomas,

    yes, I have made relayed that situation along with all others

    Q Do you recall any particular women that you spoke

    to about this?

    A Yes.

    Q Okay, could you tell me who they were?

    A Well, I would be willing to name one of them.

    Q Okay.

    A Because it is interesting to me that that person is

10 -- this is sort of in a denial -- but Phyllis Barry Meyers was

li one of them.

12           And this is the same woman who initially contacted

13 you about working for Clarence Thomas?

14  A Yes.

15  Q And what was her position? She worked at the EEOC,

16 correct?

17  A She did, as Director of Congressional Affairs.

18  Q And you told her or discussed with her --

19  A She and I discussed Clarence Thomas on many

20 occasions and the conversations were, of course, always

21 varied depending on what the topic of the day was, but the

22 conversations also generally ended up talking about Clarence

23 and his approach to women, too.

24  Q Do you know whether you mentioned to her or to

25 anyone else the comments, the comment that was made to you at
                                465

                                                                                  23

    Mr. Sweeny's retirement party?

    A I can't sit down and remember specifically having

    that conversation with anyone, no.

    Q Okay, and what about the fact that Judge Thomas

    came to your apartment. Do you remember if you ever mentionec

    that to anyone?

    A Yes, I did.

    Q And who did you mention that to?

    A I would rather not say because I don't know if she

10 would like to get involved.

li  Q Okay. Do you remember any other conversations with

12 anyone else -- men, women, anyone -- where you discussed the

13 comments made to you by Judge Thomas?

14  A No, I can't say -- no, I don't remember any other

15'| specific conversations about Judge Thomas where I made

16 references to those specific comments.

17  Q Okay, did you have any other conversations with

18 people generally about Judge Thomas' conduct toward women in

19 the office?

20  A Yes.

21  Q And can you tell us anything about those

22 conversations? Who they were with or what the conversations

23 consisted of?

24  A No, I can't. I mean when you work for somebody you

    generally talk about work and those people. I talked with
                                  466

                                                                                                     24

Clarence Thomas about other, I talked with other people at
EEOC about Clarence Thomas when I worked there, when I felt
that perhaps some things he did were not, some positions he
took were not the best ones to take, or some things he did
were not the best things to do.

         Q So these were -- you just generally, you had
conversations on various occasions with other employees at
the EEOC that may have included some of these comments, or
other comments about Judge Thomas' conduct towards women?

         A Yes.
         Q Okay.
         A Well, let me say this, too. There were select
people at EEOC that I would have had those conversations
with. I would not talk in general to people at EEOC about
that because Clarence Thomas and I were both political people
and I was very conscious of what to say to non-political type
people.
         Q Okay, you mentioned that you did discuss generally
with Phyllis Barry Meyers?
         A That's correct.
         Q Do you recall what her reaction was when you
discussed this with her?
         A Yes, I do.
         Q And what was her reaction?
         A Well, I, I can almost quote her as a matter of
                                  467

                                                                                    25

       fact, "Well, he's a man, you know, he's always hitting on

       everybody."

       Q I'm sorry, I didn't catch the last.

       A "He's always hitting on everybody."

       Q Okay, do you remember any other specific comments

       that you might have made?

       A No, I can remember one conversation with her that,

       I can remember that that particular conversation with her

       went on for a while, but I can't tell you what else was said,

10 you know, it was in general, the same kinds of comments.

li              Did you work closely with her in your capacity at

12;' the EEOC?

13     A Yes, pretty much, but, you know, her office, her

    I
14 I responsibilities were very different. She worked as a

       liaison to Capitol Hill and I was a liaison to the media,

    i         Q Okay, are there any other occasions on which you

       remember specific comments that Clarence Thomas made to you

       that you considered inappropriate?

       A None that I can give you dates for, no.

              Q Okay. Can you tell me how long you worked at the

       EEOC?

       A For one year.

              Q And can you tell me what the circumstances were of

       your leaving the EEOC?

       A Yes. Clarence Thomas fired me.
                                  468

                                                                                                     26

         Q And can you just describe for me the circumstances
surrounding that?

         A Sure. I came into my office one day and there was
a letter in my chair and I opened that letter and it said,
your services here are no longer needed as of -- whatever two
weeks from the date was -- you know, you will no longer be
employed by the EEOC.

                 And I read the letter. It was quite a surprise to
me. I took the letter and I went upstairs to Clarence Thomas
office, whose secretary, Diane Holt, motioned me in without
even, without any question". When I walked into his office,
he was in the bathroom inside his office, and I sat down in
the chair beside his desk and waited for him to come out.
And when he walked out, I handed, I held the letter up and I
said, "What is this? What does mean? Why are you firing me?
And he says, "Well, well, --

                  [Pause.]
         Q Ms. Wright, can you hear me?
         A Yes, I can hear you.
         Q Terrific, you were telling us about --
        A I walked into his office.
         Q Okay.
        A Well, I said to him, you know, "What is this? Why
are you firing me?" And he says, "Well, Angela, I've never
been satisfied with your work."
                                  469

                                                                                                    27

                  I said, "Why have you not been satisfied with my
work, and why have you not told me this up to this point?" H«
said, "Well, I told you to fire those folks down there, and
you haven't fired a soul down there." And I said, "Well,
Clarence, these people are career employees, not like I can
just go in there and say you are fired. It takes almost an
act of Congress to get them removed."

                  He said, "Well, I just in general am not satisfied
with your work."

                  The day prior to that I had held a press conference
on some issue that was real hot at the time, I don't remember
what that issue was, but it was a very successful press
conference. All the major media were there, the Wall Street
Journal, the Washington Post, there were 13 representatives
there in all. And that morning, that I was sitting there
talking to him, he had a press kit in front of him with
almost an inch of press clippings. So I picked that up and I
said to him, I said, "How can you say that especially today
of all days, you sitting right here, with a press packet from
a press conference that I just held for you yesterday that
was very successful, when you guys were on the hot seat?"

                  And he said to me, you know, "I never needed you to
get me any publicity. I could always call my buddy Juan
Williams over at the Washington Post if I needed publicity."

                  And I said, "Okay, fine. Well, look if you -- we
                                 470

                                                                                                     28

are both political so that is your prerogative. You could
tell me to go because you don't like the color of my shoes or
something like that", I said, "But the point here is,
Clarence, we are political and I don't believe this stuff you
are telling me about why you're firing me, but I do have this
question. Why did you decide to do this? If you wanted me
to leave this position, all you had to do was say, go to your
friends at the White House and call and see if you can get
another appointment", I said, "but your intent was to make me
unemployed. And why is that? I have been, I tried to be
loyal employee. I have tried to be your friend."

                 And he said, "Well, I never cared anything about
loyalty and I don't care a whole lot about friendship." And
I said, "Well", I just pushed the chair away from the table,
and I said, "Well, then, I hope you will be a very happy,
successful man, but I doubt it."

                 And I walked out of his office and I went down to my
office and I left EEOC. And that is the last conversation I
ever had with Clarence Thomas.

         Q If I could just go back a little bit. You said
that the first notice that you received of this was in a
letter that was left in your office?

         A It was a letter, it was a letter that was left in
my chair in my office.

         Q And who was the letter signed by?
                                 471

                                                                                                    29

        A By Clarence Thomas.
        Q Okay, and at that time, you went up to his office?
        A I did.
        Q And do you remember anything else that was said
between the two of you in the meeting in his office?
        A I, I, I think I just said it just about verbatim.
        Q Okay. Do you recall when this was?
        A It was, as far as I can recollect, in April.
        Q And that is April of 1985?
        A Yes.
        Q Was anyone else present during this conversation?
        A No.
        Q Do you think that your failure to respond to any of
Judge Thomas' comments to you had anything to do with him
firing you?
        A You are not the first person who has asked me that
question. Several people at EEOC asked me that question.
         Q Do you remember who at EEOC asked you that question
         A Well, actually the man who was my predecessor who
you can't confirm, because he is now dead, Al Sweeney, that
was the first question that came out of his mouth. And there
were other people there but I, I really hesitate to drag
other people's names into this conversation who are not now
at all affiliated with this issue. I don't mind discussing
people who are, you know, who have already made a public
                    472

                                                                     30

    comment on this, but I don't want to volunteer anybody else's

    participation.

          Q Okay. Are there any other specific comments that

    Judge Thomas told you at any time that you want to tell us

    about?

    A About the only thing I can tell you is that he did

    tell me at one point during that conversation when I asked

    him about why he was firing me that he was real bothered by

    the fact that I did not wait for him outside his office after

10 work. It was a statement that I dismissed as one of his

li statements.

12        Q So you didn't follow up on that or respond to that?

13  A Well, I don't remember responding. You know, I

14 ; wasn't a very happy person at that point. I was really

15 ; trying to get to the truth of what was really going on and

16 nothing he had said to me at that point sounded like the real

17 deal.

18            Well, did that comment make you think that perhaps

19 the firing had to do with your failure to respond to his

20 comments?

21            It did not make me think that at that moment. What

22 I was thinking at that moment was he was grasping for all

23 kinds of reasons. In retrospect I guess that is a possibility

24 but that is not the first thought that came to my mind when

25 he said it.
                                 473

                                                                                         31

         Q Okay. After you left the EEOC, what did you do
next for employment?

        A I did not -- when I left the EEOC I went back to th<
University of North Carolina because I had not completed the
work on my degree. I went back to finish school.

         Q Okay, and you finished school when?
         A In December of 1985.
         Q And this was your bachelor's degree in journalism?
         A Yes.
         Q And following your graduation from the University
of North Carolina, what did you do?
         A I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina and I worked
for a' while as a substitute school teacher, actually I worked
three jobs -- as a substitute school teacher, as a radio news
announcer, and as a freelance public relations.

                  I stayed in Charlotte for about, I guess that would
have been, gosh, I would have come to Charlotte maybe in May
of '86, and stayed in Charlotte until maybe September. And I
went and just a month in Atlanta with some friends of mine
there, just looking for work in Atlanta. And then went back
to Washington, after someone that I knew called me up and
asked me to take a position at the National Business League.

         Q Okay, and following the National Business League,
was when you went to the Winston-Salem --

         A Chronicle, yes.

66-273 O -- 9 3 16
                               474

                                                                                          32

         Q -- Chronicle, okay. And following that, you went
back to Charlotte and took your present job, is that correct?

         A That's correct.
         Q Now, on any of these occasions when you took
employment after the EEOC, did you ask anyone at the EEOC for
a recommendation?
        A No, I did not.
         Q Okay, did you give anyone's name at the EEOC as a
reference to a potential employer?
        A No, I did not, but on my resume the EEOC, of
course, is listed as a fortner place of employment.
         Q Okay, did you have any, have you had any contact
with Judge Thomas since you -left the EEOC?
        A No, I have not.
         Q Have you ever called his office or spoken to him by
telephone?
        A I have called his office on one occasion but I
never got to speak to him.
         Q And can you tell us about that one occasion?
        A Tes. Z had a friend who owns a telecommunications
firm. He installed telephone systems in businesses. He had
done lots of work on Federal military bases. And he had
contacted me about trying to talk to anyone Z knew who worked
in the Government to perhaps see if they would be willing to
talk to him about using his phone system.
                                 475

                                                                                          33

                 And I placed a call to Clarence Thomas on his
behalf. My call was never returned and X never tried again.

         Q Who did you speak with? Did you call Judge Thomas
at his office?

        A Yes, I called and I talked with Diane, his
secretary.

         Q Okay, do you recall approximately when this call
might have occurred?

         A In the summer of 1987.
         Q And you left a message with Clarence Thomas'
secretary Diane?
         A Yes.
       ' Q And he never returned the call?
         A That's correct.
         Q Okay. Did you have any other occasions where you
called him or his office?
         A No, I did not.
         Q Have you had any contacts since you left the EEOC
with other employees of the EEOC who were there while you
were employed there?
         A Yes, I have.
         Q And can you tell us whether in any of those
conversations you discussed Clarence Thomas and any of the
facts we have discussed today?
         A Generally, when I talk with people who work at the
                                476

                                                                                          34

EEOC, the conversation turns to Clarence Thomas, but no, not
specifically about the things we are talking about right now.

         Q Okay. Just one point of clarification on your
degree from the University of North Carolina. You said you
graduated in December of '85 or in May of '86?

         A I completed the requirements in December of '85.
         Q Okay.
        A They mailed the degree to me, because I stay in
Chapel Hill.
         Q Okay. Ms. Wright, do you know Anita Hill?
        A Do I know Anita Hill? I have never met Anita Hill,
and I have never heard of Anita Hill before this week.
         Q You are, I take it, aware of Professor Hills'
allegations about Clarence Thomas?
        A Yes, I am.
         Q Do you feel that these allegations are in or out of
character for Clarence Thomas, as you know him?
        A I feel that the Clarence Thomas that I know is
quite capable of doing just what Anita Hill alleges.
         Q Do you have anything else you want to tell us today?
        A No, I've told you all that I know.

                 MS. HOGAN: If you can bear with us just for one
minute.

                 MR. WOOTEN: If you all have something, go ahead.
                 MS. HOGAN: If you will bear with us just for one

                                                                                 35

1 minute, please.

2           MS. WRIGHT: Sure.

3           BY MS WRIGHT:

4     Q To go back briefly and follow up, you told us that

5 in the conversation you had with Clarence Thomas when he fired

6 you --

7     A Yes.

8     Q -- he made a comment about you didn't was it

9 j outside his door for him at the end of the day. is that

10 accurate? I don't want to --

11    A That is correct.

12 I  Q Okay. Did you have any sense of what he meant by

13 j that comment?

14    A Not at the time, no, and I don't remember if I

15 pursued it with him or not.

16 i  Q Okay. And did that lead you to -- when he said that

17 | to you, was that in the context of explaining to you why he

18 was firing you?

19    A Yes, it was. It was -- excuse me just a minute,

20 please.

21    Q Sure.

22    A [Pause.] He was -- you know, I can't remember that

23 specific part of the conversation. In general, he was

24 talking about the kinds of things he felt that I should do,

25 how I should report to him.
                               478

                                                                           36

1     Q Okay.

2     A You know, I can't go back and say what exact words

      or which of his words preceded that or cane out from that

      particular statement, but that statement was made.

      Q Okay. In the conversations you had with other

      women at the EEOC about Clarence Thomas' conduct towards them,

      did any other women tell you that he had made specific

      references that they considered inappropriate?

      A There were women who told me about specific

10 references that he had made, but I don't remember them

11 | specifically saying that they considered it inappropriate.

12i It was not --

13 |  Q Did they tell you that -- did anyone else tell you

14 ' that he had made comments to them about their anatomy?

15    A No, I don't remember that.

16    Q Did any of them tell you that he had made comments

17 I about wanting them to date him?

18    A Yes.

19    Q And do you remember any specifics with regard to

20 what these women told you?

21    A Yes, but one woman that I can think of right now,

22 particularly, was a married woman and I certainly would not

23 like to discuss that.

24    Q Okay. Are you still there, Ms. Wright?

<B5   A I'm still there. We can finish. I am not trying

                                                                                                     37

to --
        Q Okay. Sorry.
        A Can I get you to hold on just a minute, so that I

can get another call in?
         Q Certainly.
        A [Pause.]
         Q When you say that he made comments to you and to

other women about their anatomy, the only thing I believe you
have mentioned to us specifically is that he made a comment
about your boobs.

         A Yes.
         Q Were there any other specific comments about
women's anatomy that you know of?
         A Yes, Clarence Thomas talked about women's anatomy
when he talked about the kind of women on his staff, he often
said I've got some fine women on my staff, and he would say
things about individual people's anatomy.
         Q And can you be any more specific than that, in
terms of the type of comments he would make?
         A I remember specifically him saying that one woman
had a big ass.
         Q And this was a comment that he made to you about
another woman?
         A I was not the only person in that room, come to
think of it, but I can't remember exactly who was there.

                                                                                          38

         Q But this was a comment that he made in your
presence?

         A Yes.
         Q And do you remember any other specific comments?
         A No, I don't.

                 MS. HOGAN: Okay. I think those are all the
questions I have for you right now. Terry Wooten, who works
for Senator Thurmond, is going to ask you some questions.

                  Terry, are you ready to go, or do you want to take
a few minutes' break?

                 MR. NOOTEN: Do you want to talk to me for a minute
on the side, or are you ready to go? I've got some things
that I can ask and then you can come back.

                  MS. HOGAN: Ms. Wright, do you want to take a break
for a few minutes, or are you content to go forward now?

                 MS. WRIGHT: I'm fine. Go ahead.
                  BY MS. HOGAN:
         Q I do have just one other question that I want to
get on the record. Do you have anyone representing you, for
instance, a lawyer?
         A I have talked with friends who are lawyers, but I
have not obtained legal counsel, no.
                  MS. HOGAN: Okay. Thank you.
                  BY MR. WOOTEN:
         Q Is anybody there with you now, or are you alone?
                               481

                                                                                         39

        A I am alone, me and my dog.
        Q Are you at work or are you home?
        A I am at home.
        Q You said that the first that Judge Thomas made a
comment to you was at a retirement party.
        A No, I did not say that was the first time. That
was one time, the time I remember.
         Q Right. Could you go back and maybe tell us roughly
when the first time it was that Judge Thomas had made some
comment to you?
        A No, I can't.
         Q Is there any reason -- you can't give us the context
of maybe what he said the first time?
        A Mo, I can't remember the first time, because it was
one of a general pattern with Clarence Thomas to pop these
things out of his mouth whenever he felt like it.
         Q When can you say, roughly, when was the first time
he made comment to you -- and I don't know if you can or not,
but it is obviously a very serious allegation that he made
other kinds of comments, and you are somewhat vague about
what those comments were or when they took place.
        A Okay.
         Q I would just like to see if you can't think back
and maybe tell us when was the first time or how long had it
been when you were employed at the EEOC before he made the
                               482

                                                                                          40

first comment.
         A Oh, there is no doubt in my mind, it hadn't been

very long, but I can't go back and tell you just what day or
how many weeks. You know, Clarence Thomas I think felt very
comfortable around me, and I want you to understand that I am
not sitting here saying to you that I was sexually harassed
by Clarence Thomas. I am a very strong-willed person and at
no point did I feel intimidated by him. Some other woman
might have, but these were not situations that I ran home and
ruminated on and wrote down in my diary.

         Q When he made these comments, how did you feel about
it?

        A I felt that he was annoying and obnoxious pretty
much, but, you know --

         Q Did you take them as a joke, or did you take them
as something that maybe, you know, you had been harassed?
You said you had not been harassed. I mean did you take them
as a --

        A Hot sexually harassment, no.
         Q I mean did --
        A Harassment to me dictates some -- I mean indicates
some.feeling that there is some threat. No, I never did feel
threatened or intimidated.

                 BY MS. HOGAN:
        Q When you. use the word "harassment" -- this is
                                483

                                                                             41

    Cynthia Hogan again -- do you mean sexually harassed in a

    legal sense?

    A I think that, yes, under the legal definition of

    sexual harassment, what Clarence Thoaias did fit the legal

    definition, yes. I am not a lawyer, but as I understand it,

    that --

    Q I'm sorry, it did fit the definition, as you

    understand it?

9   A As I understand it, yes.

10           BY MR. HOOTEN:

11  Q Let me go back. You had said before you just made

12 this statement that you didn't feel like you were sexually

13 harassed, that you felt like you were more annoyed by it.

14  A Yes, I certainly did make that statement. But what

15 I am saying to you is I am aware that, under the legal

16 definition of sexual harassment, his actions fit the criteria.

17 But was 1 intimidated to the point where I felt like filing a

18 sexual harassment suit? No, I didn't consider filing then

19 and I wouldn't file one now.

20  Q All right. The first specific time you remember

21 that Judge Thomas said something to you was at the retirement

22 party, that was the first tine that you can say specifically

23 this is what he said to me?

24  A Well, I think the use of the word "first" is what

«5 is bothering me. That is the one time when I can specifically
                                 484

                                                                                          42

remember the comment in the context of other circumstances.
         Q Now, after that happened, were you annoyed or did

you feel like you had been harassed, sexually harassed?
        A Well, I think annoyed was as better term. I simply

turned to Lewis Stokes, who was on my right-hand side and
carried on a conversation with him.

         Q All right. Did you ever tell anybody about that
incident at all, the fact that Judge Thomas had made a
comment to you at the retirement party?

        A Well, I can't sit here and tell you that I had one
conversation about that particular incident, no, but I can
say that in the course of other general conversations, it is
likely that I did, but I can't say that someone, that that
was the focus of any other conversation I had, no.

         Q Can you give us the name of any individual or
individuals that you may have mentioned this to, the fact that
something had been said to you at the retirement party?

         A I could, but I am not willing to do that unless I
would first check with them to see if they, felt comfortable
with me using their name in these proceedings.

         Q Would you be willing to do that?
         A I would be willing to check with them, yes.
         Q Now, the second incident that you talked about to
us is when Judge Thomas came to your apartment. Can you give
us any indication as to how Judge Thomas knew where you lived?
                                 485

                                                                                         43

        A I had lived in the sane apartment for five years on
Capitol Hill, three blocks from the Capitol, on C Street.
Duddington's Restaurant was literally by backdoor. Anyone who
knew me on Capitol Hill knew where I lived.

         Q Nell, let me ask you again: Was there any way -- do
you know how or have any indication as to how Judge Thomas
would have known where you lived?

        A No, I didn't ask him.
         Q All right. Did you ever give him your address?
Did you ever tell him where you lived?
        A I think I probably wrote that down on the employment
application.
         Q All right. Other than putting that on the
employment application, did you ever tell Judge Thomas where
you lived?
         A Not that I can recall. I mean that may have been
part of our conversation at some point, but nothing
significant enough for me to remember.
         Q Well, if it was part of a conversation, I guess the
question would be why would that come up in a conversation
that you would have with Judge Thomas?
         A I can't answer that, because I can't recall a
conversation I had with him where that did come up. I am
simply allowing for the possibility.
         Q So, as best you can remember, you never told Judge
                                 486

                                                                                          44

Thomas where you lived or --
        A No, I an not going to say I never told Judge Thomas

where I lived. That is probably unlikely. I tell most people
who you have any type of relationship with, when you talk
with them at some point you get to the topic of where you
live.

         Q But you don't have any memory that he asked you
about where you lived?

        A No, I don't have any memory of that.
         Q Now, you said that he came over in the winter --
        A What I remember Is that it was not hot, it was cold
or cool.
         Q Hell, could you go back and recount maybe what you
were doing at the time, did you have a doorbell, did he knock
at the door? When you realized that Judge Thomas was there,
can you just pick up from there and tell us what you thought
first, and then what you did?
         A Well, I went to the door and he was standing at the
door, I opened the door and I said probably hello, how are
you, come in. My guess is the conversation probably had
something to do with what are you doing in this part of this
neighborhood. I offered him a beer. We talked. He actually
stayed for some time and talked.
         Q Can you tell us approximately what time it was that
he came over?
                                 487

                                                                                         45

        A No. I can remember about what time it was when he
left, because it was after midnight and I was getting quite
tired of the company.

         Q Well, did you tell him that he needed to leave?
You said he stayed there for some long period of time. -

        A I did not tell him he needed to leave. I probably
made quite a few outward suggestions, like yawning and
becoming distracted.

         Q Were you drinking, as well, at the time?
        A Yes.
         Q Now, I am sure that if the person who was your boss
came over, I assume there would be some conversation. Can
you give us maybe a little more general information about
what you discussed while he was there? Was this the first
time he had ever been to your apartment?
        A It was.
         Q So, is it accurate to say that you were probably
surprised when he came there?
        A Yes, it is.
         Q WelJ, can you just give us some indication of what
maybe you generally talked about?
        A I think, in general, we talked about the EEOC or
changes he wanted to make there, most of them personnel
changes. He talked often about wanting to clean out the
public affairs department and fire all those folks down
                                  488

                                                                                          46

there, because they were just a bunch of incompetents. I an
sure that was the thrust of it. He discussed that generally
whenever we talked, but then he would also, of course, discuss
his desire to date me, and I am very adept at turning the
conversation towards some other topic.

         Q All right. Can you be just -- you said, I believe,
my notes show that you said that you can't remember specific
things. Let me ask you, if I could, Ms. Wright, to try to
remember specific things. What did he say to you specifically
about wanting to date you? Can you just be more specific
about it? Because it is as very serious matter, in my
judgment, to say that he came to your house. I mean if he
came over to talk about work, that is one thing. If he came
over to talk about other things, you know, that is another
thing. We just need some information from you about what he
talked about, if you could be a little more specific.

        A I understand that this is as very serious matter.
         Q I am not trying to --
        A But I want you to understand that I am telling you,
a best as I can, what I know and what I have experienced with
the man named Clarence Thomas whom you are about to name to
the Court, and in this situation, if it were not for the
situation at hand, you probably would not be talking to me.
I know that you understand that.
         I did not keep a journal, I did not write down his
                             489

                                                                         47

    comments. I can only tell you in very general terms what my

    experience with Clarence Thomas has been.

    Q Well, at the time that he came to your house, were

    you ever afraid of him?

    A I was never afraid of Clarence Thomas.

6   Q Now, let's go back to this seminar that you said

    took place. I was just trying to get a rough time as to when

    you were at this seminar where you say Judge Thomas made some

    comment about your anatomy. Can you give us a rough time as

10 to when that was?

11  A We had several seminars that year. The most I

12 could tell you is that I can remember being at one of those

13 seminars when Clarence Thomas made that comment. How can I

14 tell you which seminar it was? Unfortunately, I know it

15 would be most helpful for you, but I cannot tell you. I

16 cannot remember that. Perhaps senility has set in at a young

17 age here, but I can't remember that. We are talking of six

18 or seven years ago.

19  Q Now, the term "boobs" came up. Is that a term that

20 he used when he spoke to you?

21  A No, actually that is a term that I am using.

22 Actually, what he said was what size are your breasts.

23  Q And at the time that statement was made, what was

- 24 your reaction to it?

    A I said something like I think you best concentrate
                                  490

                                                                                                     48

on remembering the names of people you are going to be
sharing the panel with.

         Q All right. Let me ask you, on either one of these
two specific occasions when Judge Thomas came to your house
or to your apartment or that he made the comments about your
anatomy, did you tell anybody at all about that, anybody that
you could remember who could corroborate that you, in fact,
told them about it?

        A You know, I really don't mind cooperating with you,
but at this point I truly feel like I have answered these
questions that you are asking me already. Now, if you have
something new you want to ask me, I don't mind answering
them, but I am not going to go over this over and over and
over again.

         Q My question to you is: If Clarence Thomas would
come to your apartment, just as though Senator Thurmond would
come to my apartment, I think that would be a pretty big deal
and I would probably tell somebody. My question to you is:
Did you ever tell anybody that Judge Thomas came to your
apartment?

         A At one point today I already said yes, I did
specifically discuss the fact that Judge Thomas came to my
apartment with someone else whose name I don't care to use,
unless I call her, call that person and she says I don't mind
if you use my name. I am not going to volunteer the
                           491

                                                                        49

    participation of somebody who at this point is not a part of

    this proceeding.

3   Q Let me ask you, would you be willing to do that?

4   A I would be willing to call this person; Lyons is

    her name, if you -- I guess that this person would mind

    because this person is still in a fairly political position.

    Q Now, let's go to the time when you say that Judge

    Thomas had fired you.

           You mentioned something about a press conference

10 that you had held the day before.

11  A That's correct.

12  Q Was Judge Thomas agitated about that particular

13 press conference?

14  A He did express some agitation at that press

15 conference over the fact that Commissioner Gallegos was not

16 there.

17         I see, and you said that he had said generally that

18 he was never really satisfied with your performance?

19  A Yes, he did say that.

20  Q Do you, did Judge Thomas ever get more specific

21 than that, that you can remember?

22  A No, the only thing he said was that I didn't fire

23 the people in my office that he wanted me to fire.

24  Q And can you, did you have the authority to fire

25 people in your office?
                                  492

                                                                                          50

         A Political appointees, yes. I'a sure you understand
about the authority to fire career employees, don't you?

         Q Frankly, I don't, but I presume it is not easy to
fire them.

         A Career employees, let me just say career employees,
you don't just walk in and fire a career Federal employee.

         Q I would assume it would be difficult. But I guess
my question is, and you may have answered it, is whether or
not Judge Thomas was more specific with you about why you
were being fired?

         A No, he was not. 'But I think on that issue it might
be, it might be important to point out, that you know, Judge
Thomas gave me a wonderful recommendation when I took my
current job. It's my understanding that he said to the
person who called my references that firing me was the
biggest mistake he'd ever made in his life. You can call
that person, however, and ask her specifically what her words
are. You can call my office and perhaps it is written in my
files what he said, but I think that that, in itself,
indicates, you know, or should be some indication of what I'm
trying to tell you about that particular day. He was not
specific. I never did believe whatever reasons that were
that he gave roe. My guess was that it was simply political,
that there was someone more powerful than I who wanted a
position as director of Public Affairs.
                         493

                                                                           51

      Q Right. Obviously you don't think you should have

been fired?

      A      No, I do not. I don't think I should have been

fired, but I'm really happy that he did.

      Q Okay.

      A And let me point out, obviously he didn't think so

either.

      Q But because you say that he said that he made, that

that was the biggest mistake that he'd ever made?

         Or a mistake that he had made to fire you?

      A Yes. You know, I'm quoting someone on my staff,

Mary Newsome, I mean someone at the newspaper who did the

actual calls on my references so I don't want to put words in

his mouth, that weren't there. I'm sure she wrote those

comments down for the file, but you know, he said that I was

a great employee and would be an asset to everybody's staff,

etc.

         MR. WOOTEN: If you will excuse me for just a

minute.

         [Pause. ]

         BY MR. WOOTEN:

      Q But you, since you were fired, you never -- and this

is a little bit unclear and somebody has asked me to clarify

this -- did you ever give Judge Thomas' name as a reference?

      A I never gave his name as a reference.
                                  494

                                                                                         52

                 MR. WOOTEN: Will you excuse us just a second.
                  [Pause.]
                 MS. HOGAN: Ms. Wright, would you like to take a
break for a few Minutes?
                 MS. WRIGHT: Yes, I would like to get a glass of
water.
                 MS. HOGAN: Okay, that's fine.
                [Pause.]
                 BY MR. WOOTEN:
        Q Ms. Wright, if we could just continue?
        A Okay.
         Q It is my understanding -- and this is a question
that someone else has asked me to ask -- that Judge Thomas
gave you a recommendation at some point, some kind of glowing
recommendation. Is it from your current employer?
        A Yes.
         Q And the question would be, how did your current
employer, if you know, how did your current employer have the
opportunity or the ability to contact Judge Thomas if you had
never used his name as a reference?
         A When I apply for work, I generally, for ny resume,
every place that I have ever worked before. People that were
interested in hiring me at the Charlotte Observer did a
thorough check and they called every place that I had ever
worked before.
                                 495

                                                                                         53

                 I mean you asked me if I have ever used Clarence
Thomas as a reference. I take that to me, do I list him as a
personal reference of someone that I want to be called? The
answer is, no, but I mean, you know, when I, my resume has
every place that I have ever worked at it, and I have no
problem with people checking every place I have ever worked
before.

        Q Okay. Were you aware, obviously you were aware
that Judge Thomas was nominated to the Supreme Court?

        A Yes.
         Q I presume that you are aware of that very early on
in the process. I think he was nominated or the President
announced his intent to nominate, it may have been July the
1st.
        A I am aware of that.
         Q Can you tell us just what your feelings were at the
time that you heard he had been nominated to the Supreme
Court?
         A I never wavered in my feelings about that. I don't
think, Z don't think that Clarence Thomas is a good nan and I
did not think that he should be on the Supreme Court.
         Q And that's based on what?
         A It's based on several conversations that I've had
with him and, and my opinion of him that he's really a kind
of, you know, not such a good person.
                                 496

                                                                                          54

         Q Well, is it based on the comments that annoyed you
or is it based on something else?

        A Well, I mean, I can, I can give you several
comments that I've.heard Clarence Thomas make that I think,
you know, are unbecoming of any individual, period, but
certainly unbecoming of someone who is going to spend the
rest of his life on the Supreme Court.

         Q Well, can you just -- you said that you didn't think
that he should be on the Supreme Court, could you just tell
us why? So you say it's because of comments. Is it the
comments that we've discussed this morning, or something else?

        A No, they are comments other than what we discussed
this morning.' Let me name, I would say three. My
predecessor, Al Sweeney, who was an older man and quite
sickly. I, you know, Clarence Thomas in my opinion pretty
much wanted to force him to retire. Obviously I benefited
from that; once the position was open I was named'. Director of
Public Affairs.

                 But I remember Clarence Thomas saying to me, "Al
Sweeney is old, he's no good. He has one foot in the grave,
and the other one on a banana peel."

                 A second situation here. I remember sitting in a
staff meeting with Clarence Thomas and the majority white
staff there, and Clarence and several of the legal staffers
had gone to Mississippi for some type of meeting there. And
                                 497

                                                                                         55

one of the staff members were saying they felt pretty
intimidated in Mississippi because they were with an
interracial group, and I remember Clarence sitting there and
rearing back in his chair with a cigar in his mouth and
saying, "I have no problem with Mississippi. You know why I
like Mississippi, because they still -sell those little
Pickaninnies dolls down there. And I bought me a few of them,
too."

                 Okay? There was another occasion that I remember
when Clarence was talking to Jeff -- his last name was Funder
or something, Funderburk or something like that and he was
general counsel at the time. And Jeff was complaining about
not being able to get money for something. I don't remember
what that something was, mortgage or whatever. And I
remember Clarence saying to Jeff, "Well, you know, why you
can't get any money, because you're not black enough. Now,
if you grew a Dashiki, and if you grew an Afro and put on a
Dashiki, you would get all the Government money you want."

                  I remember Clarence telling me that one of the
people that Clarence wanted me to fire he wanted me to fire
him because he said this man was "a sycophant". He wanted me
to fire this other person because he said, "This man was a
dufus."

                  You know, I am of the opinion that Clarence is, you
know, not a very nice person. I was of that opinion before I
                                 498

                                                                                                     56

left EEOC and even, I can assure you that even if I had left
there under better circumstances, if he had thrown me the
biggest party in the world, I would' still be of the opinion
that Clarence Thomas should not sit on the Supreme Court.

         Q So what about his political philosophy? Does that
weigh into your decision that you don't think he should be on
the Court?

        A Because of his political philosophies?
         Q Right.
        A No, his political philosophies are his own. He has
a right to whatever opinions he wants, I mean, he holds on
various issues. I am talking about character, pure and
simple.
         Q Well, let me ask you -- I assume you are aware that
the committee had a lot of hearings. We heard from a lot of
witnesses.
         A Yes.
         Q I think we went for about eight days and most of
them were covered on TV. Can you tell us why you chose to
wait until now to come forward?
         A Well, I think a more appropriate explanation of
what is going on here is I'm answering questions that are
just now being asked. But I must say that I was perfectly
willing to keep my opinions to myself, except, of course,
when asked about the Clarence nomination. I did not feel
                                  499

                                                                                          57

that it was a good thing, until I saw Anita Hill on television
Monday night and my conscience started bothering me because I
knew I felt from my experience with Clarence Thomas that he
was quite capable of doing what she said. And it became a
very moral struggle.- with me at that point.

                  I was struggling with trying to determine, trying
to decide whether to say something, when I got a call from
the Senate Judiciary Committee and that question became no
longer a question.

         Q All right, now you say that you got a call from the
committee, when you decided you were going to come forward,
did you call somebody or did somebody first call you?

         A Somebody first called me.
         Q Can you tell us who that was?
         A It was Dugas Mark Schwartz.
         Q And so he first called you?
         A Yes.
         Q Do you have any idea as to how he got your name?
         A He said that he had gotten information that I
worked for Clarence Thomas. He knew of a column that I had
written that was not going to be published detailing my
opinion of this, of Hill's allegations.
         Q I am sorry, your opinion of what?
         A Oh Hill's allegations.
         Q I see, could you make that available to us?
                                  500

                                                                                          58

        A No.
        Q Can you give us some general description of what
you said?
        A Mo, I'd rather not.

                 Because the column was not written in, with the
intent of publishing it. It was written in the context of a
discussion that I was having with my, with my supervising
editor about becoming a columnist.

        Q Okay, so the first contact you had was when
somebody from the committee called you as opposed to you
calling the committee?

        A That's correct.
         Q Has anybody from the committee -- and I am not
talking about just from Senator Biden's staff -- but has any
staff member, from any member in Washington, have they called
you about this?
        A No, they have not.
         Q Can you just give us some indication as to how many
conversations, how many times you have talked to congressional
staff? And I presume you have just talked to Mr. Schwartz,
you said?
         A Two or three times.
         Q Okay.

                  MS. HOGAN: I might state, for the record, that
after -- Ms. Wright, correct me if I misstate anything --
                                 501

                                                                                         59

after you spoke to Mark Schwartz, I and Mark Schwartz called
you back to set up today's telephone call. So I did speak
with you last night about the procedures for today.

                 MS. WRIGHT: The answer may be yes, there was
another woman involved and I am sorry to get into that issue,
but I remember only Mark Schwartz name.

                 MS. HOGAN: I can state that it was me, but I just
wanted to be clear that another conversation occurred at
which I was a part.

                 MS. WRIGHT: Okay, thank you, yes.
                  BY MR. WOOTEN:
         Q Okay, when did you have the first contact with the
committee, with Mr. Schwartz?
         A Yesterday.
         Q Okay.
         A At probably about maybe 5 o'clock or something like
that, I guess, I'm not really sure.
         Q Okay, has anybody else -- and obviously it wouldn't
be any staff people -- has anybody else called and urged you
to come forward, or is this something did of your own
volition?
         A People who know me who know that I know Clarence
Thomas have suggested and urged me to make a statement since
the day that Clarence Thomas was nominated, or at least since
the day the nomination became public.
                                  502

                                                                                          60

                 MR. WOOTEN: Give me just one second, I think we
are pretty close to wrapping up here.

                  [Pause.]
                  BY MR. WOOTEN:
         Q When you decided to cone forward and people had
talked to you about coming forward, did you choose to come
forward because of the statements that Judge Thomas made to
you about dates, and the fact that he came to your house, or
did you come forward because of his character, that you just
didn't think he was somebody who should be on the Court?
                 MS. HOGAN: Excuse me, I just want to clarify that
I am not misunderstanding something. My understanding, Ms.
Wright, is that you did not come forward, that you were
contacted by Mark Schwartz of the committee?
                 MS. WRIGHT: Actually I was just about to correct
that, myself. I am sorry, Terry, but I cannot answer, I
cannot answer the questions if you are going to insist that I
decided to come forward. Obviously I did not come forward
with anything. I am just answering questions that are just
being asked of me.
                  BY MR. WOOTEN:
         Q Let me see maybe I can rephrase. You said that
other people had suggested that you come forward. I guess my
question is, is the thrust of your concerns about Judge
Thomas, is it the comments that he made to you, or is it just
                              503

                                                                                         61

your general belief that he should not be on the Court?
        A The thrust of my concerns at this point was to not

watch a woman, who I believed in my gut to be telling the
truth about a man who I believe to be totally capable of
doing what she said he did, the thrust of my concern was not
to watch her become victimized, when -I knew of similar
situations that I had had with Mr. Thomas.

         Q I think we are very close, just maybe one or two
questions, but we are very close to being finished.

        A Let me just go on and clarify one other point I
think you are getting to here, as far as whether I, at any
point, felt the need to rush out and try and stop Clarence
Thomas' nomination to the Supreme·Court. The obvious answer
to that is, no.

         Q All right.
                  Others have given me some questions, and I want to

give everybody their chance to have their say through me, I
suppose.

                  Let me ask you, do you need a break?
         A Mo, I am fine, go ahead.
         Q Let me ask you one other question, did you and
Judge Thomas, I presume you all never had dated, or never did
date, or never go to dinner or anything like that?
         A That is correct.
         Q Okay. Mow, can you tell us maybe who was your
                                 504

                                                                                          62

closest friend at the EEOC during the year or so that you
were there?

        A I could but I would rather not Mention that
person's name without checking with that person to see how
they felt about their name being mentioned.

         Q Well, let me ask you this, would you consider one
particular person your closest friend there?

        A Yes.
         Q And did you ever discuss the concerns you had, the
annoyances you had with Judge Thomas with that friend?
        A Yes.
         Q You did? All right. Well, if you would, I think
it may be helpful if you would check with that friend to see
if he or she is willing to come forward.
        A Okay, I will be glad to do that.
         Q Okay.
         A But you keep using the term, come forward. I can
pretty much assure you that this person is not going to come
forward or want to be very involved in this at all.
         Q I understand that. Well, I think ~ and this is not
to encourage you to do one thing or another, you are certainly
free to do anything you want -- but that is something that, of
course, we are asking, because it would substantiate and
support what you have said, you see?
         A I understand. I really do, and I understand your
                                 505

responsibility to substantiate what I have said. And all I
can do is tell you what I know and what my experience has
been and you have to nake your own judgments as to the
voracity of those statements. You know, I have no problem
talking to other people who could corroborate what I am
saying but, surely you understand that this is not at all a
pleasant situation to be in, and it is not something that
even I take lightly, even though I think I have got the guts
of a bull. But I don't necessarily relish the kind of fall
out that comes from speaking up in this type of a situation.

                 And I am not going to encourage anybody to do what
I have done.

         Q It is just a question of if they would mind
committee staff contacting them to discuss what they may or
may not know, but let me ask you just a couple of other
questions.

                  Did you ever have evaluations at the EEOC prior to
that time that you were fired by Judge Thomas?

         A You say up to the time?
         Q Or prior to the time.
         A Yes, yes, I did.
         Q And who evaluated you at that time?
         A Clarence Thomas did.
         Q And can you just tell us the gist of those evalua-
tions, if you feel comfortable with that?

66-273 O--98 17
                             506

                                                                          64

1     A I only -- I remember only one evaluation and it was

2 sort of a middle-line kind of evaluation. I wasn't satisfied

3 with it. Obviously, I thought I was doing a pretty good job

4 and I deserved a better evaluation, but it was one of those,

5 you know -- I don't even remember what the evaluation form was

6 like. I just remember it was sort of, you know -- if i£ was

7 a scale of, you know, maybe a scale of A to F, it was a C.

8     Q All right, and you only have one evaluation that

9 you can recall at this time? That's not a trick question;

10 I'm just asking you, recalling the year that you were there.

11    A That's the only one that I remember, yes.

12    Q Okay.

13    A There could have been one that was great, but I

14 don't remember that one.

15-1  Q Okay. All right, if you just give us one or two

16 minutes, maybe we're closing to wrapping up. I don't know,

17 but other people are -- I want to be sure that everybody has

16 a chance.

19            MS. HOGAN: I have just three or four questions to

20 follow up with. Terry, do you want me to go ahead?

21            MR. WOOTBNt Yes, why don't you go ahead.

22            BY MS. HOGANt

23    Q Very quickly, Ms. Wright, because I know we've kept

24 you a long time, and X appreciate your speaking with us, you

15 were discussing before the fact that Clarence Thomas had
                           507

                                                                       65

    asked you to fire some of the career federal employees on

    your staff.

    It's my understanding that you, even with, you

    know, authority over your staff, would have needed cause to

    fire a career employee, is that your understanding?

6   A Oh, yes, that's definitely ay understanding.

    Q And that's not the case with a political appointee,

    is that correct?

    A No, that is not the case at all. I mean, surely,

10 you guys know that that body is exempt from fair labor

11 standards.

12  Q And you were a political appointee at the EEOC, is

13 that correct?

14  A That is correct.

15  Q Okay, just a couple of more questions. You've

16 stated that the type of comments that Clarence Thomas made to

17 you that we've been discussing today were made on numerous

18 occasions. Can you give us any sense of what the rate of

19 these type of comments were? Did they occur once a month,

20 did they occur once a week? You know, can you give us any

21 general sense of that?

22  A Nell, let's see, if I had to put it in a context of

23 how many times I would see him and he may make a comment, I'd

- 24 say probably it would be one out of four or one of out five

    encounters with him, you know, he may make some statement.
                               508

                                                                                          66

         Q Okay, and these were statements specifically about
you?

         A Hell, specifically about me and, like, you know,
when are you going to date me, that kind of a thing.

         Q Exactly, okay. Did he also make, then, statements
about other women to you with any kind of regularity?

        A Ho, not of that nature, if that's what you're
asking. I mean, we may have discussed other women in the
context of the way they were performing their jobs or
something.

         Q Well, I guess what I'm asking is, earlier you had
told us that he did, on occasion, make statements about other
women's anatomy in front of you, and I guess I'm asking was
that an isolated incident that you described for us or did
that also occur with some frequency.

         A Oh, that's not something that I would say was
frequent. Those are just what I remember as a couple of
situations when that happened.

         Q Okay, thanks. Also, just briefly, we discussed the
comment that Judge Thomas made to you when you were at the
EEOC seminar out of town when he asked about your breast size
and complimented your dress, and I'm just wondering if you
recall at all even generally what you were wearing at the
time.

         A Ho, I do not.

                 MS. HOGAN: Okay. That's all I have.
                 BY MR. WOOTEN:
        Q Did Judge Thomas -- this is Terry again -- did Judge
Thomas ever say that he could ask you out of the EEOC because
of the professional relationship he intended to have with his
employees there?
        A Did ever say that he couldn't ask me out?
        Q Tes.
        A No, he never said anything like that.
        Q Let me ask you, do you know a Kate Simperand?
        A Kate Simerade?
        Q Simperade, Simperande?
        A Yes, I do.
        Q And have you ever charged her with any kind of
racism before or --
        A Yes, I did. When I left the AID, I wrote her a
letter of recommendation saying that I felt she -- I'm para-
phrasing it, but I felt that she was quite unfair and racist
and insecure and lots of other things.
         Q Can you tell us what led to you writing that letter?
        A I really don't think that's relevant. I mean, can
you tell me why you want me to discuss my relationship with
Kate Simerade?
         Q Well, we would be interested if you had made
allegations against other people.

                                                                           68

1           MS. HOGAN: Is this -- excuse me for a minute. Why

2 don't we go off the record for a minute, if you can just hold

3 on, Ms. Wright.

4           MS. WRIGHT: Okay.

5             [Discussion off the record.]

6           BY MR. WOOTEN:

7   Q Let me ask you one more question. Again, I said

8 earlier I thought we were close to the end; I think we are

9 this time.

10  A Okay.

11  Q There's been a request to ask you a question, and

12 obviously this may be something that you don't want to

13 answer, but it's up to you. It's a question of who you voted

14 for in the '80, '84 and '88 --

15          MS. HOGAN: No, no, no.

16          BY MR. WOOTEN:

17  Q Well, let me ask you, do you consider yourself a

18 Republican? You don't have to say who you voted for.

19          MS. HOGAN: You don't have to answer that question

20 either.

21          MS. WRIGHT: I am a registered Republican.

22          MS. HOGAN: I'm not your counsel, but --

23          MR. WOOTEN: Okay, all right.

24          MS. HOGAN: I'm sorry to do this to you, Ms.

fi5 Wright. Can you hang o n for one more minute?
                                  511

                 MS. WRIGHT: Sure.
                  [Discussion off the record.]
                 MS. HOGAN: Ms. Wright, this is Cynthia Hogan
again. Let me put you on the speaker phone. I believe we
have no further questions, but I just want to make sure that
that's the case by putting you on the record.
                 Ms. Wright?
                 MS. WRIGHT: Yes?
                 MS. HOGAN: Terry, I'm aware you have no further
questions?
                 MR. WOOTEN: We have no further questions, and
thanks.
                 MS. WRIGHT: Okay, thank you.
                 MS. HOGAN: Ms. Wright, we appreciate it very much.
We're sorry for taking up so much of your time.
                 MS. WRIGHT: All right.
                 MS. HOGAN: We appreciate your willingness to talk
with us today. Thank you.
                 MS. WRIGHT: Bye-bye.
                 MS. HOGAN: Bye-bye.

the Judiciary in the above-entitled natter, pursuant to ______
notice, in the offices of the Senate Committee on the

Washington, D . C , convened at 2:150 p.m., when were present oi
behalf of the parties:
                  MARY DeOREO, Investigator, Staff of Senate Biden
                 MARK SCHWARTZ, Staff of Senator Biden
                  TRIS COFFIN, Staff of Senator Leahy

                                    PROCEEDINGS
                  MS. JOURDAIN: Hello?
                  MS. DeOREO: HI, Rose. This Is Mary DeOreo, from
the Senate Judiciary Committee.
                  MS. JOURDAIN: Yes.
                  MS. DeOREO: Rose, I want to tell you, before we go
on the record, that there are sitting In the room with me
representatives from the majority side, Senator Biden's
staff, Senator Heflln's staff, and Senator Leahy's staff, and
there are also representatives from the minority side.
                  I will have them each introduce themselves to you,
but first I want to introduce Mark Schwartz, who wants to
make a few things clear with you, so you understand how it is
we are proceeding. Mark is an attorney on Senator's Biden's
Judiciary Committee.
                  MR. SCHWARTZt Rose, hi.
                  MS. JOURDAIN: Hi.
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: I just wanted to make sure you
understood one point, which was that if this is going to be
sworn testimony, which is the preference, that we have sworn
testimony, you have the absolute right to have an attorney
present, and we could not conduct such sworn testimony
without either your having an attorney present or your saying
it's okay for us to take your sworn testimony without an
attorney present.
                              515

                  How, before you answer that, the alternative for
you is to say you do not want to have this be a sworn
statement, in which case we will just take your statement on
the record and not be sworn. That is your choice. I don't
know if you have an attorney present with you.

                  MS. JOURDAIN: No, I don't. Hold on one Minute.
                  [Pause.]
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Are we on the record currently?
                  MS. DeORBO: Right now we are.
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay. We are now on the record, so
we will start the interview when the court reporter, at the
appropriate tine, can swear you in.
         Whereupon,

                                        ROSE L. JOURDAIN
was called for examination and was examined and testified, as
follows:

                  BY MS. DeOREO:
         Q Ms. Jordan, this is Mary DeOreo.
         A Ms. Jourdain.
         Q Thank you. In fact, the first question is, would
you please give us the proper pronunciation and spelling of
your full name?
         A Rose L. Jourdain, J-o-r-d-a-i-n.
                               516

                  MS. DeOREO: Thank you. Ms. Jourdain, we are going
to go off the record for a moment. I am going to put you on
hold.

                  [Discussion off the record.]
                  MS. DeOREO: Back on the record.
                  BY MS. DeOREO:
         Q Ms. Jourdain?
         A Yes.
         Q It's Mary again. I just want to clarify one point.
Do you understand that you are sworn in?
         A Yes.
         Q And are you comfortable giving us your testimony,
having been sworn in?
         A I am quite comfortable. The only thing I want to
ask you is that my address and phone number will not be made
public, will they?
         Q None of this will be made public, Ms. Jourdain.
        A Okay.
         Q Thank you. All right. Because I understand that
this interview is taking place while you are at the Washingtoi
Hospital Center--
        A Yes.
        Q --so I am wondering--we are gpJkng,_£p try__to stay t o
                               517

the point and not take too long. I understand that you are
not physically all that comfortable.

         A That's true.
         Q Thank you. Could you please give me some general
background information about yourself, just education and
some of the jobs that you have had, bringing us up to EEOC?
         A All right. I am a graduate of Lake Forest College,
I did graduate work at Northwestern University, I have taught
school, I have had many, many different jobs, largely writing
jobs. I have written a novel, I have written a television
play, you know, produced a novel, produced a television play,
I have written a textbook, and that's about it in a capsule"!
         Q And let me ask you, during all of this experience,
can you give me some of your more recent employers that you
had prior to coming to the EEOC?
         A I was teaching school and then I came to Washington
and--
         Q Was that a public.
         A -- I worked for the Agency for International
Development, but I went to the EEOC and then I went to the
NEA--
         Q Thank you. I would like to now ask y o u --
        A -- t h e National Education Association, not the
National Endowment for the Arts..
         Q Thank you, and I appreciate the clarification.
                               518

Also, I can hear that you are speaking to someone in the
room. Who is in the room with you?

         A My daughter.
         Q And what is her name, please?
         A Jackie.
         Q And her last name?
         A Hayes.
         Q Thank you. When were you employed at the EEOC?
         A Now, I think, I believe it was 1980 -- I believe it
was from November '83 to March '85, although -- I think those
are the correct dates.
         Q · That's fine, and I understand, with the interview"
coming at short notice, you haven't had a lot of time to go
back and think about it.
         A I have not.
         Q What was your position at the EEOC?
         A I was hired as a speech-writer for the Chairman
Clarence Thomas.
         Q And at that time, did you know Anita Hill?
         A No, I never met her.
         Q Did you know Judge Thomas professionally?
         A I had never met the man until I walked into his
office for the job interview.
         Q During the course of your working as a speech-
writer for Judge Thomas, did you meet with him personally?
                              519

         A Yes.
         Q On a daily basis?
         A Sometimes on a daily basis, sometimes on--it was an
as-need-to-meet basis, really.
         Q But you did have contact with him personally?
         A Yes, and frequently.
         Q Did you experience any sort of harassment from
Judge Thomas?
         A I personally, none.
         Q Did you observe this behavior, alleged behavior
from Judge Thomas towards anyone else?
         A - Well, he and I were generally in meetings discusslnc
speeches or in full staff meetings, so there would have been
little opportunity for that.
         Q Thank you. Do you know Angela Wright?
         A Yes, I do.
         Q In what capacity?
         A Angela Wright was head of the public relations
department at the EEOC. I met her first at AID, and then she
was also at EEOC. We became friends as a result of our
working together.
         Q As you were working together at both places?
         A Yes.
         Q Were you friends at AID?
         A I did not know her until I became, you know, we
                                 520

became co-workers.
         Q At AID?
         A Yes.
         Q All right. So, did you leave AID at about the same

time and go over to EEOC?
         A I went first.
         Q Okay. Just for our own background information,

were you fired from your job at AID?
         A No, I left.
         Q On your own volition?
         A Yes.
         Q ^ Did Ms. Wright ever discuss with you any concerns"

or problems she was having in her encounters with Judge
Thomas?

         A Yes, she did.
         Q Can you give me some specific details as to what
Ms. Wright told you?
         A When Ms. Wright first came in, she was very
enthusiastic about her job. She was very happy to be there.
As time went on, she became increasingly -- she confided to
me increasingly that she was as little uneasy and the grew
more uneasy with the Chairman, because of comments she told
me that he was making concerning her figure, her body, her
breasts, her legs, how she looked in certain suits and
dresses.
                                 521

         Q Did she recount any specific experience?
         A Well, for example, she told me he had come to her
home one night unannounced, and she told everyone--for
example, one time she came into my office in tears, said she
had bought a new suit that I thought was quite attractive, it
was just a regular suit for a person to wear to work, a woman
to wear to work, and he had had evidently quite a bit of
comment to make about it and how sexy she looked in it and
that kind of thing, and it unnerved her a great deal.
         She beeame increasingly nervous about being in his
presence along. As time went on, he asked her to have a
meeting with him that was going to be a one-on-one meeting^
which would not be unusual, you know, with the head of the
public relations department, and these were scheduled in the
evening, at the end of the workday, and she was increasingly
uneasy about being there, and would say, why don't you wait
for me and, you now, I really don't want to be there that
long or alone with him, you know, not inviting me into the
meeting, but just asking me to remain in the building until
it was time for her--until she would be able to leave.
         Q Were these conversations, Ms. Jourdain, between you
and Ms. Wright, were there only the two of you, or were there
occasions when someone else would be part of this specific
type of conversation?
         A I think most of the time that she spoke to me, I
                          522

                                                                        10

know most of the time she spoke to me alone. I really don't

know that there weren't times that there were other people in

the room, but there was probably only one, because she was

not going to--she was not trying to bad-mouth the Chairman.

Q Who would that other person--if there was someone

else--

A Hold on a minute.

[Pause.]

My daughter said she was in the room once when we were

discussing it.

Q And your daughter, again, for the record, is

Jackelyn Hayes--                  -  ·                      ~~

A Right.

Q -- a n d she knows Ms. Wright?

A Yes, she does.

Q But not because she is an employee of EEOC?

A But not because she is an employee, because she is

my daughter.

Q Thank you. Who did you talk to about Angela

Wright's concerns concerning the Chairman's behavior?

A I don't remember speaking to anyone about it. I

may have spoken--I probably did speak to my daughter. I may

have spoken t o -- I don't know that I spoke to anybody--I don't

know that I ever spoke to anybody specifically about his

behavior concerning her.
                              523

                                                                                           li

         Q It would be pretty good gossip, there would be no
one else in t h e --

         A It would be gossip, but I have never been a person
who was much into gossip.

         Q All right. So, there was no occasion when someone
was talking about the Chairman, that you can recall saying,
"Oh, by the way"--

         A I wasn't very--I mean I was not interested in
denigrating the Chairman.

         Q All right.
         A I was not out to say, oh, he's a dog or this kind
of thing. I was not interested in denigrating him at all. "~

                  MS. DEOREO: I am going to go off the record and
put you on hold for a moment.

                  [Discussion off the record.]
                  MS. DeOREO: Back on the record.
                  Ms. Jourdain?
                  MS. JOURDAIN: Yes?
                  MS. DeOREO: Mark Schwartz, who is on Senator
Biden's staff, has got some questions he would like to ask
you.
                  Ms. JOURDAIN: Yes.
                  BY MR. SCHWARTZ:
         Q Ms. Jourdain, do you know the dates that Angela
Wright worked or was employed by the EEOC?
                               524

                                                                                           12

         A I would n o t -- I would believe it was shortly before
December or end of November of--if I went there in November,
I believe she came there in December. If I went there in
October, she came there in December. I went very shortly
before she did.

         Q Could you give us an approximation as far as the
year?

         A [No response.]
         Q Let me go back to my notes and repeat--
         A I have a feeling it was '83 to '85. I am pretty
sure of that. I'm pretty sure it w a s --
         Q Just so that you understand, I don't want to be ~
confusing, I understand you have already said that you were
there approximately from November of 1983 to March of 1985.
I just wanted to know what part of your tenure at the EEOC
that Angela Wright was there, also.
         A I'm not absolutely certain of these dates, but I
think I'm correct, but I must say that I am not positive I'm
correct on this issue. She would have been there from the
November following my coming until the time I left.
         Q So, approximately the later part of 1984 through
March of '85?
        A No, '83, I said '83.
         Q Did you stay at the EEOC after Angela Wright left?
         A I did not. We left at the same time.
                              525

                                                                                           13

         Q Okay. Are you aware of the circumstances under
which Angela Wright left the EEOC?

         A No, I'm not, actually. She told me she got a
letter from the Chairman saying that her services were no
longer required. I don't know that he gave her any reason.
I believe that she told me--and here again, I have not
committed it to memory, but it was a very curt, you know, a
two-paragraph or a three-paragraph letter. I don't remember
it. I had no reason to want to remember it.

         Q You stated a little bit earlier that you were also
fired from the EEOC.

         A I was dismissed the same day as Angela, and Angela
was like

         Q Ms. Jourdain--
         Q --when he wrote a letter of recommendation,
withdrawing that letter of recommendation for me for another
job, I had no problems with that, because I knew I had done a
decent job for him, but I did ask him and he wrote a very
strong letter, in fact, that the reasons for letting me go
was that he had chosen to write his own speeches and, to the
best of my knowledge, he never replaced me and did from then
on write his own speeches, probably--I don't know this for
sure--using somebody in part-time work, but I don't believe
he ever fired another full-time--

                  MR. SCHWARTZ: I just want to put you on hold for

                  [Discussion off the record. ]
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Back on the record.
                  BY MR. SCHWARTZt

         Q Ms. Jourdain?
         A Tes.
         Q We are back on the record. I just wanted to
clarify one thing and Mary DeOreo is going to help me clarify
it. I asked you a question, my last question, where I used
the word, fired, and I just wanted to back-track for a second
because you had earlier stated that the circumstances under
which you left the AID were what?
         A That I quit.
         Q Okay, that you had quit. And the circumstances
under which you left the EEOC were?
         A I was dismissed.
         Q Okay. I just wanted to be clear that my question
went to the circumstances under which you left the EEOC?
         A Mm-hmm.
         Q Okay, fine, just so there is no confusion on the
record.
        A Now, the point that I am trying to make in my
statement is that as time went on Angela Wright became
increasingly upset and increasingly unnerved by what appeared
                               527

                                                                                           15

to be more aggressive behavior on the Chairman's part. She
came to m e -- I am older than she--and she came to me often
times to ask advice what should she do? I mean we are
talking about a time when sexual harassment was not a thing
that women were talking about, and how to handle this. You
know, what do you say? You know, I know that she had made it
quite clear to him that she was not interested in developing
a relationship with him outside of the work place.

                  BY MR. PAPPAS:
         Q Ms. Jourdain, I am Matt Pappas and I work with
Senator Heflin. I was just wondering about Angela Wright
being dismissed from the EEOC. Did she ever give you any ~
indication that she was bitter toward the agency or toward
Clarence Thomas?
        A No. I think that, I know that I was, I am certain
that both of us were dismissed for a very similar reason and
that was that we were increasingly ideologically opposed to
the Chairman's position. I know I was and I believe that
that had a great deal to do with Angela's dismissal.
        Q But she never indicated to you that she w a s --
        A No. She never said anything about being bitter.
In fact, I think she rather welcomed it because she was
thinking about going back to school and doing some other
things with her life anyway.
        Q Okay.
                               528

                                                                                           16

         A She was saving her money very carefully for a
return to school so I don't think it was a major interruption
of a career plan.

         Q And she never said anything to you that would
insinuate that she might have been let go because she would
not enter into a relationship with Clarence Thomas?

         A No. She never said that that was the reason. I
know that she was upset and more and more upset, as I said by
what she told me on--you know, she kept me pretty much
informed on this because it was making her very nervous, on a
more aggressive--not, you know, I am not speaking of a week-
to-week more aggressive--but a seemingly more aggressive ~
posture that--I mean her comments on her body and things. I
am not saying that each week it got worse, but they were
coming more frequently because she was telling me this more
frequently.

                  And her thing was, gee, I want to go back to
school. I want to get out of this, you know, I want to do
something else with my life.

         Q So at the time she was dismissed from EEOC, would
you say that that was when it was at its worst? And what I
mean by that, the advances that she alleged that Clarence
Thomas made toward her?

        A I can't say that for a -- I can say that you are
talking about a cumulative effect, you know. I am not saying
                              529

                                                                                           17

that it was worse that week than it had been two months
before, but the cumulative effect, I think was there.

                  MR. PAPPAS: All right, thank you.
                  BY MR. COFFIN:
         Q Hello, Rose, this Tris Coffin from Senator Leahy's
office.
         A Yes?
         Q I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit
more about the circumstances of Angela Wright's dismissal
from EEOC. You said it had something to do with an
increasingly--
         A No. I am saying I don't know that that was it. ~I
am saying I know that these were circumstances that were also
happening at the same time. I don't know that these were the
circumstances of the dismissal.
         Q Did you ever hear a comment that Ms. Wright made
that might have had something to do with her dismissal?
        A Comment?
         Q A particular comment?
        A No. No, I don't know that.
         Q Did you ever of Ms. Wright said of another EEOC
employee or called another EEOC employee a faggot?
        A No, I did not hear that. I heard a lot, but I
didn't hear that one.
         Q Okay.
                              530

                                                                                           18

         A But nor do I want to give you the impression, under
any circumstances, that I felt that, as I said before, that
we have two situations here. We have a woman who is being
increasingly, made increasingly, who is being increasingly
unnerved, but I am not saying that her lack of responsiveness
is the reason for her dismissal. I don't want that to be
read into the record. I think there are two separate things
going on there.

         Q I understand you.
                  Can you give us a little more detail about these

conversations between you and Ms. Wright where you discussed,
where she would tell you about the increasingly aggressive
behavior?

         A Well, you know, for example, I was in my office,
and she would come in and she would close the door. And you
know, once she was, you know, once she was crying, and you
know--

         Q Okay, slow down.
         A She is a very strong woman. She is not the kind of
female that cries, you know what I mean?
         Q Yes. I see, if you could just recall the first
time she came into your office or the first time she told you
these things. Tell us about that conversation.
         A I don't remember the first--you know, we are
talking about events that happened a long time ago. I can
                              531

                                                                                           19

give you snapshot impressions but I can't tell you which
snapshot came first.

         Q Okay. So do you have a conversation in your mind,
you are sitting in one chair and she is sitting in the other?

        A I am sitting in the office, she walks in, slams the
door and says, do you know what he said to me, do you know
what he said to me? And I said, "No, what did he say to you?
you know, because it has gone on before. And I think at this
point it had something to do with her legs, you know.

         Q And what would he say?
        A I think it had something to do with, ooh, you have
very sexy legs, or something like you have hair on your legs
and it turns me on, or something like that. I thought, it
was nutty, you know what I mean? It was that, but it was
very unnerving to a young woman who is sitting there hearing
this, you know.

                  Then there was a conversation about her bra size,
and there was a conversation about a dress that she wore, I
don't know why that was a dress that was to be commented on.
It wasn't a skin-tight knit-type dress. There was another--
you know, it was the constant kind of do you know what he did'

                  Sometimes she laughed about it, you know. Sometime!
it got on her last nerve. You know, sometimes it had
happened so much that it was like you won't believe what
this, what he said now, you know?
                    532

                                                                   20

Q Yes, did you travel with Angela t o --

A No, I never did.

Q You never did.

A Yes, I did once.

Q Where?

A We went to, we went to New York, the Chairman,

Angela and I went to New York to set up something. I don't

even remember what it was. It was the only time we all went

anywhere.

Q Okay. You mentioned earlier on that Ms. Wright

said something to you about the Chairman coming by her house.

Could you tell me about that, please.                    ~

A Well, she called me up and she told me that he had

had the nerve to show up in her house and come in and--

Q Was this--

A -- s a t down and made himself at home, and you know,

what do you do about this kind of thing, you know?

Q Was this the next day?

A No, when that she told me?

Q Yes.

A I don't know whether she told me the next day or

she called me up that evening, that same evening, and said,

you won't believe what just happened.

Q Can you tell me step-by-step?

A No, I cannot tell you step-by-step on anything that
                           533

                                                                          21

happened six years ago.

           I mean I cannot swear to any step-by-step, anything

           MR. COFFIN: Thanks.

           BY MS. DEOREO:

Q I want to ask before go further, Ms. Jourdain, all

of us are sensitive to the fact that these are uncomfortable

days for you, physically uncomfortable days. How are you

doing?

A It's, it's hard sitting here talking.

Q Can I ask, can you give us a few more moments? I

very much would like representatives on the minority staff to

have an opportunity to ask you some questions.            ~

A All right.

Q Would you like us to take a little break and call

you back?

A I would rather get through it.

Q Thank you. They are going to introduce themselves

to you.

A All right.

           MR. CALDWELL Ms. Jourdain, my name is Barry

Caldwell and I am counsel to Senator Specter.

           MS. JOURDAIN: All right.

                              534

                                                                                           22

         Q Can you go back to when you worked with Ms. Wright,
at AID?

         A Mm-hram.
         Q Can you tell us, do you know the reason why Ms.
Wright left AID?
         A Tes. She was offered a mich better position.

                  I know that she was not happy there and she was
offered a better position and she left. I believe that is
the reason.

                  She was not happy and she had an opportunity to
advance herself. She thought she did.

         Q Okay. Could you tell us when was the last tine you
spoke with Ms. Wright?

         A You mean, today?
         Q Yes, Ma'am, the last tine you had a conversation
with her?
         A I think it's been about--I can't really. I mean
it's been gee, I haven't spoken with her in several days, I
can tell you that. She knew that I was ill. And so she
called me, she has called me since I have been in the
hospital to see how I was doing.
         Q Okay. Could you give me your best guess?
         A Un-unh. In the hospital days start to run together
         Q I am sorry, I did n o t --
         A I think it has been a week. Maybe, maybe 10, 11
                              535

                                                                                           23

days, something.
         Q Okay. Going back to the episode that you mentioned

that Clarence Thomas came to Angela Wright's house, can you
give us, at all any kind of time frame during the period
that you specified that you worked at EEOC with her, during
the year, do you remember any season?

         A I have a feeling that my recollection of her
telling me this is that it was very cold out, and that, you
know, it was not the type or time of year when people are out
for a walk, you know, and just drop by somebody's house.

                  So I think it was cold, it was kind of in winter.
It might have been late fall.

         Q Okay, and back to the last time that you spoke to
her in a week or maybe 10 or 11 days ago, did you talk about
these episodes with Ms. Wright?

         A About which episodes?
         Q The episode of the house--
         A No, I was talking about my illness.
         Q Okay. So you never spoke to Ms. Wright about the
episode with Clarence Thomas dropping by her house
unannounced?
        A I haven't spoken to her about that in a long tine.
In fact, that is why it is not really clear to me.
         Q Okay.
        A I mean the details of it are not clear.
                                 536

                                                                                           24

         Q But the episode, you didn't speak to her about the
episode?

         A I spoke many, a long time ago, but not, not not, we
were talking about my, my being in the hospital.

         Q That's fine.
                  Did you know Ms. Wright before you worked at AID?

         A No.
         Q Okay. How close a friend were you with Ms. Wright,
would you socialize with her outside of work?
         A Yes, we did. As tine went on we became close
friends. Not at first we weren't close friends, but we becaim
closer because we worked together and we had projects that~~
overlapped and we became friends. In other words, the public
affairs office and the speech-writer's office, you know1, has
things that they had to discuss. I mean, you know, those two
offices or those two people needed to confer and we found
that we had a lot of things we enjoyed in common, our
opinions in common and became friends.
         Q And your friendship continued after Ms. Wright went
to EEOC and you joined her there or d i d --
        A No, I was there first.
         Q Okay, I am sorry.
        A And she came over.
         Q And your friendship continued at EEOC?
        A Yes, it did.
                                 537

                                                                                                       25

          Q Okay.
         A In fact, it grew mainly because since that is when
 that relationship was there, because that was when she headed
 the public affairs office, and I was the Chairman's speech
writer.
          Q And since you have, since you left EEOC and Ms.
Wright left the EEOC, how much contact have you had with her
 over these years? Could you just take a guess?
         A We have kept in contact with each other. You know,
we were, you know, it's like anybody else that you know and
you like and you hope to remain friends through life or at
 least keep up with them and see how they are doing and corning
 along. We have certainly kept up with each other. I think
 she is a friend of mine, yes.
          Q Would you, say, call her on holidays or her
birthday or would you just--
         A I don't call anybody except my family on holidays
 and my birthday.
          Q Okay. So what would you say, would it be infrequen
contact since you left the EEOC?
         A I think we talked, there were times that I called
her about things that I was doing that I thought she might be
 interested in knowing about or give me some clues about how I
might, you know, make some improvements and she did the same
with me. She might be working on a story and call me up and

56-273 O--93 18
                    538

                                                                         26

say, I'm working on this, do you think, you know, where else

do you think I might find some additional research material?

I was working on several projects and I said, hey, take a

look at this and what do you think of it? And she responded

to that.

Q Has Ms. Wright--

A These are episodic things, do you know what I am

saying?

Q Yes, Ma'am. Has Ms. Wright called you recently

working on a story about Clarence Thomas?

A No, un-unh. I didn't know she was.

Q I was just curious when you mentioned that.              ~

A No, un-unh.

Q And you mentioned earlier that your daughter

acknowledged that she had some knowledge of the conversations

that you had with Ms. Wright about Clarence Thomas'

inappropriate comments to Ms. Wright, can you give us a time

frame about when your daughter would have known about these

comments?

A No, she heard about them about the same time they

were being made.

Q And how did she hear about them?

A She may have heard, she probably heard about them,

she did hear about them when Angela was at my house and she

may have been discussing it or was discussing it, you know,
                                 539

                                                                                           27

trying to figure out what should I do about this, you know?
And it made a big impression on my daughter because she was
young.

         Q After Ms. Wright became upset about Clarence
Thomas' advances towards her or his comments, I should say,
did you try to, what advice did you give her?

         A As I remember the situation, I said to her, you
know, why don't you sit down and just discuss it with--I know
that she had said to him, she had made it clear to him that
she did not welcome these advances, and I said, just stay
firm with it, you know, just don't let him think you are
giving into it. You know, that you are becoming more, you
are, that there isn't any kind of possibility of any kind of
relationship here.

         Q Did you, after Ms. Wright, conveyed these comments
to you, attempt to confirm his actions or did you try to
investigate these comments or go to any other women and say,
has he made these type of comments to you?

         A I did not do that. I did not feel that I should
discuss her business or his business with other staff
members. I would never have said to anybody else on the
staff that the Chairman was saying these things, you know.

         Q Did you consider them inappropriate?
         A I--yes, I did consider them inappropriate and I did
not feel that that would help him at all in the delegation of
                                540

                                                                                                      28

his duties to have women knowing that he was saying these
kinds of things, but I didn't say anything.

                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Melissa, may we go off the record?
                  MS. RILEY: We are going to put you on hold for
just a moment. Thank you.

         Q Ms. Jourdain?
         A Yes.
         Q Sorry about that. We have a couple more questions.
                  I was just curious, have you ever contacted
Clarence Thomas for job references?
         A Yes, I have.
         Q And did he respond favorably?
         A Extremely so.
         Q And do you know if Ms. Wright ever contacted him?
         A Yes, and he -- and I know that she was delighted
with the recommendation he gave her.
         Q So she did attempt to contact him for a
recommendation?
         A Yes, and he gave both of us very good
recommendations. In fact, you know, that being our -- we
needed them, you know.
         Q A couple more questions, and then I believe one
more person, a couple more people, have more.

                  Did you happen to attend a retirement party for Al
Sweeney?

         A Do you know, it seems to me that I did, but didn't
he die?

         Q I am not sure and I would hate to say anything
about that. I just was curious if you attended the retiremeni
party.

         A I can't remember whether I attended his retirement
party or his funeral. That sounds weird, but I think I did
attend a retirement party for him, yes.

         Q It may have been at perhaps some club in Virginia?
         A No, I have never been to a club in Virginia. ~~~
         Q Or a hotel, maybe, in Virginia?
         A I don't recall.
         Q That's fine.

                  Did Ms. Wright ever talk to you about comments that
Clarence Thomas made to you at a retirement party?

         A Made to me.
         Q No, no, no, no. I'm sorry. Let me clarify that.

                  Did Ms. Wright ever speak to you about comments
which Clarence Thomas made to her at a retirement party?

         A No, I don't remember her ever saying anything like
that.

         Q Thank you.
         A Any kind of comment about a retirement party.

         Q No, let me clarify: Comments that Clarence Thomas
made, inappropriate comments that Clarence Thomas made to Ms.
Wright while attending a retirement party.

         A No, I don't differentiate them as anything special.
You know what I mean?

                  MS. RILEY: Thank you, and I believe Mr. Caldwell
has a couple of questions for you.

                  BY MR. CALDWELL:
         Q Hi, Ms. Jourdain. Just a couple of more questions
and perhaps a couple of follow-up.

                  You said you went to the EEOC just before Ms.
Wright.

         A Yes.
         Q Do you have a sense of how she found out about the
EEOC job?
         A I think she told me about the job. I think she
knew the Chairman. I mean, I think that -- you know, they
were both Republicans and they had met at some Republican
functions. I think it was that kind of thing. You know,
there are not many black Republicans, and so they all knew
each other.
         Q Right. You don't know if someone in particular
introduced her to the Chairman?
         A I have no idea. It was not important, you know
what I mean? It was just something that she^to^jne about.
                                 543

                                                                                                      31

I don't think that -- he was somebody, it was a contact that
she had. It was not anybody, you know.

         Q I'm sorry. I missed that last part.
         A He was a contact that she had. You know, in this
city, who are your contacts?
         Q Right. Okay. I guess, lastly, do you have a sense
of why -- and I hope I don't misstate this -- why Ms. Wright
is coming forward? Motive is the question. Do you have a
sense of why she is coming forward now?
         A Yes. Based on what I know about her, I would tend
to believe -- no, I don't tend to believe, I absolutely
believe that she heard this young black woman on the
television being raked over the coals, as though this
experience that she was having was completely impossible, and
you know, that a person in Clarence Thomas' position, black
or white, would not have done this, and this woman was
somehow coming from left field with some malicious agenda.
         And having had a similar experience, I believe that
Angela would have felt it her bounden duty to go on record
saying that, and she is a very religious, very morally strong
person. You know, she is a person who believes very much in
right and wrong.
         Q You said that you guys talked about these instances
of the Chairman's behavior while at the EEOC, and that you
remained in contact as friends. Did she discuss her --
                                 544

                                                                                                       32

         A Wait a minute. I don't understand your question.
         Q Well, here is my question: Did Ms. Wright discuss
with you her coining forward?
         A No. When she called me, the last time I talked to
Angela Wright, she called me to see how I was doing. She
knew that I was sick. And if she mentioned it, it was in
passing and it was not something that I was particularly
involved in at that moment. Do you know what I mean? I was
in a lot of pain, and my concentration unfortunately was on
myself.
         Q Okay. One last question. I understand that you
are friends, but if you had to step back and look at Ms.
Wright objectively, could you say there are any negative
qualities about her that stick out in your mind? For
instance, is she vindictive? Is she vengeful? Is she
something along those lines?
         A No, I cannot say that, nothing like that. No, no.
No, no, no.
         Q What about flirtatious?
         A No, I don't think she is flirtatious. She is a
very life-affirming human being. She believes in -- she is
serious. She can have a lot of fun, but she believes that
life is a serious venture, that we are charged with certain
responsibilities, those of us who have had advantages, to
help other people.
                                545

                                                                                                      33

         Now if you are talking -- the only thing I can think of
that really, and that is not a negative, she tends to spend
an awful lot of time with her dog and treat it more as a
human being. That is the only thing that I can think of. I
have said to her, you know, like this dog gets as much care
as a lot of human beings, but that is the only thing I could
ever think of that I would say was negative.

                  MR. CALDWELL: Okay. Thank you. I think Ms. Riley
just has one or two other questions for you. Thank you very
much.

                  BY MS. RILEY:
         Q Ms. Jourdain, I just wanted to go back and once ~
again ask you a couple of questions regarding the time that
Ms. Wright told you that Clarence Thomas came to her house
unannounced. Could you tell me, did she happen to say how
long he stayed at her house?
         A No, I don't remember, but I think it was -- she was
-- no, she did not. I don't remember if she did tell me
that. I don't know that she told me that. I don't know that
she told me that, but I do know that he arrived, he made
himself at home, and all of this was rather presumptuous.
         Q So you don't have a time frame as far as, did she
say he just stayed for 20 minutes, or did he stay for an hour
or two hours or --
        A No, I don't believe she ever said that. I don't
                            546

                                                                          34

believe she put it within a time frame. I think she was

appalled at the presumptuousness of it.

Q And did she ever tell you what time of the evening

he left, or the day or the morning or --

A It was not morning, and it certainly was not late

at night. I mean, it wasn't that he stayed there until

really late. I just don't remember. I don't know. I don't

know, but given my feeling of the affair or the incident, it

was probably something that he arrived around 8:30 or 9:00

and left around 10:30 or 11:00. I don't know.

        MS. RILEY: Okay. I think that is all that I have.

            BY MS. DeOREO:                                 ~~~

Q Ms. Jourdain, this is Mary DeOreo again.

A Yes.

Q On the same point Melissa was asking about, that

same evening visit, did you have any understanding of how

Chairman Thomas got to Angela Wright's house? Did they live

within walking distance?

A I have no -- to the best of my knowledge, I know

she lived on Capitol Hill.

Q Fine.

A And to the best of my knowledge, he lived in

Southwest.

Q I am not asking you to guess. I am asking do

you --
                                547

                                                                                                      35

        A I don't know.
                  MS. DeOREO: Okay. That's fine.
                  I believe that the interview now is over, and Mr.

Schwartz has some things he wants to talk to you about, on
the record.

                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Ms. Jourdain, we are still on the
record. I wanted to go back to the original point we had
made at the beginning of the interview. Everyone here in the
room when we went off the record before has come to an
understanding, at least on our end, and just want to make
sure it squares with yours: that since you have given a swori
statement, though none of us in the room would give a legal
opinion as to the effect of that sworn statement, you should
realize that the possibility would occur that if there were
later found to be a contradiction in some sort of legal form,
that could have legal consequences against you similar to
perjury, in some sort of untoward consequences.

         I am not saying that would happen, but because of that I
wanted you to understand the implications of having sworn
yourself in, and if you now feel uncomfortable with that and
would like to take back your sworn part of it, we will just
treat the testimony as we have all other interviews we have
conducted during this proceeding, which is, it is out there
for the informational purposes of the members of the
committee. Now you should discuss that with your daughter.
                              548

                                                                                                       36

                  MS. JOURDAIN: Hold on. Can you explain this to
her, because I have to move.

                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay.
                  Hi. I'm sorry, what was your name again?
                  MS. HAYES: Jacqueline Hayes.
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Jacqueline, I'm sorry. My name is
Mark Schwartz, and we have in the room, I don't know if your
mother has told you, we have attorneys representing both
Senator Leahy, Senator Heflin, Senator Biden's staff, and
Senator Thurmond and Senator Specter's staff, along with
another member of Senator Biden's staff.
                  I just wanted your mother to understand that since
she has agreed to give sworn testimony, that if at some point
later there was found to be -- and I am not saying there
would be -- some contradiction, that the ramifications of
that, I could not swear to her that it might not be a
potential problem with perjury. And I just wanted her to
understand that, since she did not have an attorney present
with her.
                  And if she feels uncomfortable about that, we have
all agreed to treat this as we have all other statements, as
unsworn and just for informational purposes. Do you
understand?
                  MS. HAYES: Yes. Let me just explain that to her.
Hold on.
                                549

                                                                                                      37

                  [Pause.]
                  MS. JOURDAIN: Hi. She explained this to me. You
said that many of the people you interviewed did not make it
a sworn statement?
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: To the best of my understanding --
and you can correct me if I am wrong, Melissa or Barry -- no
one else has given a sworn statement to us.
                  MS. JOURDAIN: If no one else has given it, then I
won't give one either. This is a statement but not a sworn
statement.
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay. The reason why we had
requested that it be sworn is because of your current status
in the hospital room and the unlikelihood that you would be
able to testify before the committee. I just wanted you to
understand that.
                  MS. JOURDAIN: Yes.
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay. Is there anybody on the
record who would like to make any more comments about this
subject?
                  [No response.]
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay.
                  MS. JOURDAIN: So now we are clear, this is no
longer a sworn statement?
                  MR. SCHWARTZ: None of the parties involved in this
on the majority or the minority staff or the Senate will
                            550

                                                                                 38

treat this as a sworn statement taken under oath, so you can

feel comfortable with that. It will be stricken from the

record. Okay?

           MS. JOURDAIN: Yes.

           MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay, and before we go off the

record, anybody else? Any comments? Any questions?

           MS. DeOREO: I want to thank you very much. We are

off the record now.

           [Discussion off the record.]

           MS. DeOREO: Back on the record.

           Ms. Riley has one more question.

           BY MS. RILEY:                                  ~

Q Ms. Jourdain, I apologize. I have one more

question.

A Okay.

Q Could you tell us if the incident when Clarence

Thomas went to Angela Wright's house occurred while she

worked at AID with you, or

A No, at EEOC. I believe it was -- oh, God. I'm

sure it was EEOC.

           MS. RILEY: Okay. Thank you.

           MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay. That's fine.

           Since we are still on the record, I will just state

what your daughter said to us off the record, which was that

if it could be arranged at a future time,
                                 551

                                                                                     39

    prepared to give a sworn statement.

    MS. JOURDAIN: Yes. In other words, since nobody

    else is giving a sworn statement, I would just as soon let it

    go as what I have done. If it becomes extremely,

    excruciatingly necessary and I can get it together, then I

    will do it.

    MR. SCHWARTZ: Okay. Thank you very much, and we

    wish you a speedy recovery.

9   MS. JOURDAIN: Okay. Thank you.

10  MS. RILEY: We will be back in touch. Bye-bye.

11  MS. DeOREO: Bye-bye.

                                         552

  The CHAIRMAN. And that will, at least as far as this Committee's
investigation at this moment of those two witnesses, end the
matter. Now--and not in the matter in terms of judgment, in the
matter in terms of witnesses.

  So we are taking extensive testimony placed in the record by
both majority and minority at the request of Republicans and
Democrats as well as the potential witness. That is why I vitiated
the subpoena, in spite of the fact I would have preferred her to be
here. But, in light of the time constraints, I did not insist that that
be done.

  Now that means for the remainder of the night, I hope this
doesn't encourage people to go longer than they otherwise would.
For the remainder of the night, the only witnesses remaining are
the four distinguished gentlemen before us and a panel of nine wit-
nesses that are being produced by Judge Thomas, all women who
worked in some capacity with him at, I believe EEOC. Don't hold
me to that. It could be at Education as well.

  Each will be by previous unanimous consent agreement limited
precisely to three minutes. No more time will be allowed. And
there will be 16 minutes a side to cross-examine if anybody wishes
to do that.

  I say that to the press and others who have been here so long
trying to determine what the remainder of the witness list is.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. I yield to my friend from Ohio.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, I certainly think we
should conclude the hearing with respect to these witnesses. But I
wonder whether, in view of the fact that it is now 11:30 at night,
and the next nine witnesses, of those nine I think seven of them
are employed by the Administration either at the EEOC or at the
Labor Department or the Department of Education, and two of
them, one is a former secretary to Senator Danforth and one is a
former chief of staff to Clarence Thomas--I wonder, Mr. Chairman,
if we couldn't stipulate that all of that testimony will be very sup-
portive of Clarence Thomas? I don't think there is any argument
about that. I don't know why there is any reason to have to hear it.
And, frankly, I think in fairness to this Committee and in fairness
to the candidate that it would serve just the same purpose. We
know what the testimony will be.

  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate the Senator's request. And, as I hear
from one of my friends from the far West and my right, not far
right, a deal is a deal. They will be heard unless they choose to
decide as two panels have on behalf of the witness, Ms. Hill, unless
they so choose they will be heard because we have a unanimous
consent agreement to do just that.

  Now, with that, I apologize to my friend from Pennsylvania. I
hope someone has kept some notion as to how much time--how
much time does the Senator have left? He has nine minutes left.
Six minutes had expired when I interrupted. And you will have
time to come back, if you wish.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I apologize to the gentleman for the interruption.
                                             553

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Stewart, after Professor Hill said to you
"how great Clarence's nomination was and how much he deserved
it," did you continue to have a discussion with Professor Hill?

  Mr. STEWART. Correct.
  Senator SPECTER. Was there any mention at all of any sexual
harassment by Judge Thomas of Professor Hill?
  Mr. STEWART. NO mention at all, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Or any other unfavorable conduct of Judge
Thomas?
  Mr. STEWART. NO, none at all, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. And, Mr. Grayson, after, as you have testified,
Professor Hill said about Judge Thomas that he deserved it, refer-
ring to the Supreme Court nomination, was there any discussion by
Ms. Hill of anything derogatory about Judge Thomas?

  Mr. GRAYSON. NO, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. IS it Professor Kothe?
  Mr. KOTHE. Well, you use the Pennsylvania Dutch pronunciation.
Actually it is "Kothe."
  Senator SPECTER. Professor Kothe?
  Mr. KOTHE. Kothe.
  Senator SPECTER. Professor Kothe
  Mr. KOTHE. Right.
   Senator SPECTER. I would like you just to start, because time is
limited and I can assure you there will be many questions on the
body of your statement later, but because I want to move to Mr.
Doggett in just a moment I would like you to just read the final
paragraph of your statement of October 7, if you would, please?

   Mr. KOTHE. I read it.
   Senator SPECTER. Would you read it, please?
   Mr. KOTHE. "I find the references to the alleged sexual harass-
ment not only unbelievable but preposterous. I'm convinced that
such is a product of fantasy."
   Senator SPECTER. Professor Kothe, did anybody suggest to you
that you use the word "fantasy" in describing Professor Hill's con-
duct?
   Mr. KOTHE. NO. In the second statement that I made on October
10 I left that off. That wasn't intended as words of art or scientific
expression. It was just the instant reaction I had to this awful
event. When I heard what the allegations were, my instant reac-
tion was that it is just unbelievable, preposterous, and then I said
that it must be a product of fantasy. Because if you just knew these
people and knew Clarence Thomas, you would know that that
couldn't possibly have been true.

   Senator SPECTER. Well, Professor Kothe, was there anything that
you could point to in Professor Hill's conduct which would lead you
in either an evidentiary or a feeling way to that conclusion of fan-
tasy?

   Mr. KOTHE. NO. I think perhaps my selection of words there was
probably unfortunate. I have never seen Anita Hill in a situation
where she wasn't a decent person, a dignified person, a jovial
person. I have never seen her in a situation where actually you
would say she is fantasizing in that sense. I almost regret that I
used that in my first testimony.
                                                  554

  Senator SPECTER. Well, then how would you explain Professor
Hill's charges against Judge Thomas in the context of your very
forceful testimony in support of Judge Thomas?

  Mr. KOTHE. There is just no way of explaining it. How she ever
was inclined to make such an observation is something that is to-
tally beyond my comprehension. If you knew these two people as
we all have known them, and evaluate that or equate that in the
context of what has been alleged here, it just, it just couldn't be the
same person, you wouldn't think.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Doggett, turning to your affidavit, and I
am going to ask you for the conclusions first before you comment
on the substance of your statement. And permit me to comment, I
found your testimony of your professional background extremely,
enormously impressive.

  And let me now move to the last line in the third full paragraph
where you--well, why don't you read the last sentence in the third
full paragraph on page 2, if you would, please?

  Mr. DOGGETT. "I came away from her "going away" party feeling
that she was somewhat unstable and that in my case she had fan-
tasized about my being interested in her romantically.

  Senator SPECTER. And, if you would now, Mr. Doggett, read the
paragraph on page 3?

   Mr. DOGGETT.

  It was my opinion at that time, and is my opinion now, that Ms. Hill's fantasies
about my sexual interest in her were an indication of the fact that she was having a
problem with being rejected by men she was attracted to. Her statements and ac-
tions in my presence during the time when she alleges that Clarence Thomas har-
assed her were totally inconsistent with her current descriptions and are, in my
opinion, yet another example of her ability to fabricate the idea that someone was
interested in her when in fact no such interest existed.

  Senator SPECTER. NOW, Mr. Doggett, while your testimony has al-
ready, in effect, answered this question, I want to ask you explicitly
did anyone suggest to you that you use the word "fantasy" in de-
scribing your conclusion about Professor Hill?

  Mr. DOGGETT. I talked to no one about my affidavit and the con-
tents of my affidavit. I was quite frankly amazed when I heard the
Professor had used the same term. In fact, just to make it very
clear, I have not talked to the Judge, have not talked to any of
these witnesses, I have not talked to the women that preceded us.

  Senator SPECTER. NOW, Mr. Doggett, what happened between you
and Professor Hill which led you to conclude that she was fantasiz-
ing?

  Mr. DOGGETT. At a going away party for Anita Hill before she
went to Oral Roberts University Law School, soon after I arrived
and relatively early in that going away party she asked me if we
could talk in private, and I agreed, having no reason to see that
that was inappropriate.

  And she talked to me like you would talk to a friend who you are
going to give some advice to help them "clean up their act." She
said, "Something I want to tell you"--and this is what I have
quoted in my affidavit, and it is the only part of my affidavit that
talks about her statements that is in quotes because it was embla-
zoned in my brain because it was such a bizarre statement for me.
                                      555

  She said, "I'm very disappointed in you. You really shouldn't
lead women on, or lead on women, and then let them down."

  I came to a woman's "going away" party who I really didn't
know very well. She says, "Hey, let's talk in the corner," and she
said, 'You led me on. You've disappointed me." And it is like,
What? Where is this coming from?

  I don't know about you, gentlemen. Washington, DC, is a very
rough town if you are single and you are professional, for men and
for women. Most people come here to be a part of the political proc-
ess. They have legitimate, real ambitions. And it is a lonely town, a
difficult town to get to know people because people are constantly
coming in and coming out.

  I came to Washington, DC, to be part of the business process. I
was not interested in politics. I wanted to be an international man-
agement consultant. And the first time I met Anita Hill I sensed
that she was interested in getting to know me better and I was not
interested in getting to know Anita Hill. And, based on my experi-
ence as a black male in this town, I did everything I could to try
not to give her any indication that I was interested in her, and my
affidavit talks about that in some detail.

  Even when I was jogging by her house and she said, "Hi, John,"
and we had a conversation, and she raised the issue of, well, since
we are neighbors why don't we have dinner, I tried to make it very
clear that although I respected her as a person and as a fellow
alumnus of Yale Law School, and as somebody I thought was very
decent, the only relationship I was interested in was a professional
relationship.

  And, as I stated in my affidavit, she said, "Well, what would be a
good time?" and I was in my jogging clothes and so obviously I
don't have a calendar with me. I said, "Well, I will check my calen-
dar and I will get back to you." And I checked my calendar and I
said, "Looks like Tuesday will work. You get back to me if that will
work and let's talk about a place."

  Later on with that dinner agreement, arrangements fell through,
she gave me a call and said, "What happened?" I said, "What do
you mean what happened? I never heard from you." She
said,"Well, I never heard from you." And apparently, we both had
expected the other person to call to confirm.

  At the end of that I never heard from you, I never heard from
you, if I was interested in her the logical response would have
been, "Well, since we didn't get together this time, let's do it
again." There was no response, and there was a very awkward,
pregnant pause and the conversation ended.

  And I never saw Anita Hill again until that "going away" party
where she dropped at bombshell on me.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, your time is up.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I will
come back the next round.
  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Doggett, I don't doubt what you said, but I
kind of find it equally bizarre that you would be so shocked. Maybe
it has never happened to you.
  I know a lot of men who call a woman and ask her out or ask to
meet. Let me finish my comments here. Ask to have--decide to
have dinner. Say let's get together for dinner, but afraid to say
                                      556

fully let's go out together for dinner. Let's get together. We live in
the neighborhood, let's go to dinner. And then that person call
back or you call again and speak to her again and the date is set.
And then for whatever reason she doesn't show up.

  You are still interested. You call back. You say, "How come you
weren't there?" You say, "Well, I thought that you were going to
call." And you thought I was going to call, et cetera. And that goes
back and forth. Then there is a pregnant pause and you hang up.

  Maybe I am just accustomed to being, turned down more than
you were, when I was younger. But some men sit and say, "Geez. I
wonder whether she's just bashful, that was the reason for the
pregnant pause, or I wonder if she really wants me to call her
back. She didn't say don't call me again. She didn't say I don't
want to hear from you again. Maybe."

  And then you see her a little while later a party and she is leav-
ing town. And you walk up to her and you say, you know, "Can I
talk to you?" And she says, "Yes." And you walk over to the corner
of the party and say, "You know, you really shouldn't let guys
down like that. You led me to believe that you wanted to go out
with me. You shouldn't do that to women--or to men."

  And, if she turned around and said, "You're fantasizing. How
could you ever think that? You must be demented? You must be
crazy."

  I don't think that is how normal people function. I mean, I don't
doubt a word you said. But you go on and say you said, "I'll check
my calendar and get back to you." You checked calendars, you got
back to each other, the date fell--the date? We don't use dates
these days, I know. The dinner fell through. You talk again and
say, "What happened?" and she is silent. And she says, "What hap-
pened?" and you are silent.

  You did not say to her, did you, don't call me again? Don't pay
attention to me? I may be a virile person but don't pay any atten-
tion, just stay away from me? You didn't say anything like that did
you?

  Mr. DOGGETT. I sure wish I had, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I wish you had to because maybe there
wouldn't be this confusion. She may not be telling the truth, but
how one can draw the conclusion from that kind of exchange that
this is a woman who is fantasizing, this is a woman who must have
a problem because she has turned--are you a psychiatrist?
  Mr. DOGGETT. Senator, I am trying to follow your question, but I
may have to ask you to restate it.
  The CHAIRMAN. My question is are you a psychiatrist?
  Mr. DOGGETT. Absolutely not.
  The CHAIRMAN. Are you a psychologist?
  Mr. DOGGETT. Absolutely not.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, how from that kind of an exchange can
you draw the conclusion that she obviously has a serious problem?
Where is the section? I want to find it here in your statement. You
were stunned by her statement. You told her her comments were
totally uncalled for and completely unfounded. Balderdash!

  I reiterated I had never expressed a romantic interest in her, had done nothing to
give her any indication he might romantically be interested in the future. And I
                                                557

also stated the fact that I lived three blocks away from her, but never came over
should have led her to believe something.

  Mr. DOGGETT. Pardon?
  I didn't hear what you just said, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. The implication is that should have led her to
understand that you weren't interested in her. Did she come up to
you say in mildly hysterical terms, why have you not called me or
did she just make the statement straight, monotone, you shouldn't
lead somebody on like that, or whatever the precise statement was?
Can you characterize the way she said it? Did she sound very dis-
appointed in you, you really shouldn't lead women on like that and
then let them down? Or did she say, why did you do this? I am
very disappointed in you?
  I mean can you characterize what it was like?
  Mr. DOGGETT. She was very, very intense, Senator. This was
not
  The CHAIRMAN. Describe for me how intense she was? Was her
voice at a higher octave than normal?
  Mr. DOGGETT. She seemed very upset to me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Was her voice at a higher octave than normal,
do you recall?
  Mr. DOGGETT. She seemed very upset, Senator.
  Senator my statement, my conclusion is based on a year and a
half of experience, not just one afternoon jog on a Saturday in
1983.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, tell me what else she ever said to you?
  Mr. DOGGETT. OK. Examples, that is a very fair question, Sena-
tor.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Mr. DOGGETT. The first time I went over to Clarence Thomas'
office, okay, the question is what else did she say to me?
  The CHAIRMAN. What did she ever say to you, yes.
  Mr. DOGGETT. A, she called me after the dinner fell through. I
didn't call her. B, there were a number of months that
  The CHAIRMAN. Let's stop there a minute. Wouldn't that lead
you to believe that maybe she thought you might be interested or
she wouldn't put her ego on the line to call a man?
  Mr. DOGGETT. Absolutely, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right.
  Mr. DOGGETT. What I have tried to say and what I am trying to
say right now is that I did everything in my power with Professor
Hill over the time I knew her to make it absolutely, positively
clear that I was not interested in that woman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you say that to her? Did you say, Professor
Hill, look, I mean, Anita, I just want to be clear before we get
things out of hand here. I want to make it clear to you, I think you
are a wonderful person, but I have absolutely no interest in you in
anything other than professional terms. Did you ever say that to
her?
  Mr. DOGGETT. There was never a need to do that because we
never got to the level where I had given her enough encourage-
ment where she felt that it was appropriate to
                                               558

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, give me more instances where she said
things to you that this just wasn't the one instance where she said,
you know, you led me on or you led women on.

  Tell me another instance.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Well, I think a perfect example of the conclusion
that I came to when I was sitting at my computer in Austin, TX
was the statement that she gave under oath, before you 2 days ago,
that she had dated John Carr. And the statement that John Carr
gave under oath today that he would not characterize their rela-
tionship as a dating relationship.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, wait a minute. John Carr said he went out
with her.
  Mr. DOGGETT. That's right, and I believe, as I understand it
  The CHAIRMAN. He said dating.
  Senator THURMOND. Let him get through.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Pardon?
  The CHAIRMAN. I am worried about your instances. What did she
ever say to you, you that led you to believe that she, in fact, had a
clear understanding that you had no interest? You said that there
were other instances, other than this occasion, where she said to
you, I am very disappointed in you, you really shouldn't lead on
women and then let them down.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Right.
  The CHAIRMAN. What else did she ever do or say?
  Mr. DOGGETT. Nothing else, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. That's it?
  Mr. DOGGETT. Absolutely, Senator, and if she hadn't said it and
hadn't been upset to some degree with
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, how was she upset again?
  Senator THURMOND. Well, let him get through, let him get
through, let him answer.

   The CHAIRMAN. OK.

  Mr. DOGGETT. It was her, she was intense. I do not believe she
raised her voice, but this was not just, hey, guy, you know, be care-
ful as you characterized it, this clearly bothered her. And I hear
what you are saying, Senator, and I respect your opinion and I am
not trying to argue with you but for me, in that time, in that room,
that shocked me and maybe it would have not shocked you, it
shocked me.

  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate that. I do appreciate that. I sincere-
ly do. Let me tell you what I thought when I first was told about
this.

   Mr. DOGGETT. OK.

  The CHAIRMAN. I thought it was the case of a woman walking up
to someone she never had spoken to other than in passing business,
watched him jog, said hello to them and then all of a sudden at a
going away party walked up and called him aside and said, I don't
know why you led me on like this.

  That to me, if a woman did that to me, I may either think she is
nuts or be flattered but I would wonder, at a minimum. I would
walk away going "where did that come from?" Whether she called
me or I called her, if I had agreed on one occasion to go to dinner
with her, and if I had known that she had, if I felt that she had an
                                      559

interest in me, if the dinner date was broken, if she called me to
ask me why.

  If I said nothing and remained silent, and did not say, look, I just
don't want to go out to dinner with you, I was just polite and said
nothing. And then she came up to me and said that one sentence, I
don't know how, quite frankly, a reasonable man could conclude
from that to be stunned and shocked that this woman is fantasiz-
ing because she has a male complex--what was your phrase about
complex? Come on, earn your salary. There is some place in there
where you say, this must mean that she is used to be, this is a com-
plex from being rejected by men.

  Mr. DOGGETT. It is on page 3.
  The CHAIRMAN. The fact, you believe Ms. Hill's fantasies about
my sexual interest in here were an indication of the fact she was
having a problem with being rejected by men she was attracted to.
It seems to me that is a true leap in faith or ego, one of the two.
[Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. Are we playing to the audience now?

   The CHAIRMAN. NO, I am not.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, then let's stop the crowd from respond-
ing. You have done that before and they have responded about six
times now.

  The CHAIRMAN. If anyone else responds they are out and the
reason I probably didn't is I am so intensely involved in this, I did
not do that. Please, if anyone else responds I ask the police officers
to move them out, I mean that sincerely.

  Mr. DOGGETT. Would you like for me to respond to your question?
  The CHAIRMAN. I would like you to say anything you want. I
mean I truly would because I am having trouble understanding
this one and I won't say anything more.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, take your time and say what you
please.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS long as you want.
  Mr. DOGGETT. I appreciate your concern.
  The CHAIRMAN. My confusion, not concern.
  Mr. DOGGETT. I assumed you were concerned also.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I am not concerned.
  Mr. DOGGETT. I appreciate your confusion and I will do what I
can to try to clarify it. A, I clearly reacted to this event differently
than you would and I respect our differences of opinion.
  B, there were a number of occasions when Gil Hardy and others
who were black Yale Law School graduates made an attempt to
bring together those of us who were in town, including people like
me who were not practicing law and who were not involved in the
political process, so that we could have social fellowship. We had
parties, and other get-togethers.
  I observed from a distance--and I am not a psychiatrist, I am not
an expert, just a man--Anita Hill attempting to be friendly with
men, engage them in conversation, initiate conversation, elongate
conversations, and people talking with her and eventually going
away.
  The CHAIRMAN. Can you name any of those men for us, for the
record?
                                               560

  Mr. DOGGETT. Sir, 8 almost 9 years have gone by. If she had filed
a sexual harassment charge

  The CHAIRMAN. That's not the issue
  Mr. DOGGETT [continuing]. I would be able to do that because we
would be in 1983 or 1984 given the statute of limitations. Which is
why you have created a statute of limitations. It is too long, I
cannot, sir.
  I also remember, sir, the first time I went to Clarence Thomas'
office, I was going to talk to somebody who was a classmate of
mine about why he had become a black Republican Reaganite, be-
cause I had some real concerns. And as I went into his outer office,
Anita Hill happened to walk by and she tried to stop me and
engage me in conversation and acted as though she thought that
since we were all black Yale Law School graduates, I should say,
well, let's go in and talk with Clarence, which I did not.
  Clearly, people can disagree as to whether or not my observa-
tions and conclusions are ones that they would make. But I assure
you that based on my experiences and my observations of Anita
Hill, both in terms of how she related to me--and let's talk about
the jogging incident, Senator. When I was running by I was timing
myself with my watch and my interest was to run in place for
maybe 30 seconds, be polite and keep going. The reason we contin-
ued to talk was because she wanted me to continue to talk. That is
action on her part, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Can I ask you a question, why didn't you keep
running?
  Mr. DOGGETT. Because the group of black Yale Law School gradu-
ates is a very small, a very close, and a very special group and it is
like a family. Gil Hardy, the man who introduced Anita to Clar-
ence Thomas was one of the leaders of that group. We did what we
could to be as supportive as possible.
  Senator I graduated in 1972. She graduated in 1980. She was sig-
nificantly younger than me, she seemed to be lonely in this town. I
was not going to try to make this woman feel that I was not going
to be straightforward with her as a professional. There have been
other women who have made it very clear that to me that they
have been interested in me and I have said, I am not interested.
Anita Hill did nothing to deserve me to slam the door in her face.
She was one of the Yale Law School black fraternity and there are
very few of them, Senator.
  Now, I agree that others may interpret my conclusions different-
ly but that's how I saw it and that's why I said what I said.
  The CHAIRMAN. I appreciate that and I thank you very much.
  Dean, did you work for Clarence--this is the first time I knew
this, I should have read the record more closely--did you work for
Clarence Thomas when you spent most time with Anita Hill, Pro-
fessor Hill?
  Mr. KOTHE. I would have to say it this way. I worked for Clar-
ence Thomas after I worked with Anita Hill. She was a professor
on our faculty. When I retired as Dean, I became special assistant
to Clarence Thomas. I think in large part through what she did in
initiating our arrangement.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
                                         561

  Now, from your testimony I got the impression though that the
time that you spent the most time with Anita Hill was in setting
up that conference you referred to on harassment.

  Well, let me not say most time. You said there was a conference
that you were setting up on harassment and Anita Hill was partici-
pating in that. And you were surprised that if she had been har-
assed she would have said something to you at that time. Were you
working for the man that she alleges harassed her when you were
surprised that she did not say something about harassment?

  Mr. KOTHE. Yes, sir, it was in 1987 and I had already been work-
ing with Thomas then

  Senator THURMOND. Talk into the machine so that everybody can
hear you.

  Mr. KOTHE. Yes, I had been working with Chairman Thomas at
that time for probably two years.

  The CHAIRMAN. SO I want to just make sure I understand. You
made a statement which I thought was fairly powerful and obvious-
ly accurate. You said that one of the things you pointed to as evi-
dence of the fact that Anita Hill's assertions are probably not true
is with regard to a conference on harassment she worked with you
in setting up. And you said, and I am paraphrasing, that if she had
been harassed why would she not say to me that she had been har-
assed when the purpose we were getting together for was to discuss
harassment?

  And I ask you, in light of the fact that you worked for the man
who allegedly harassed her, would it surprise you that she would
not confide in you? Sir, I mean that sincerely?

  Mr. KOTHE. Well, precisely and that is what I said in my opening
statement.

  The CHAIRMAN. That's what I did not understand. Thank you.
   Mr. KOTHE. HOW could it possibly be that a person was talking to
me about being a featured speaker on the subject of sexual harass-
ment and never, ever have said, I have been harassed, I have been
exposed to this, I know if from personal experience, never ever?
   The CHAIRMAN. NOW, what I am saying Dean, as a trained
lawyer, does it surprise you that a person who says they were har-
assed now, would not say to you she was harassed when she would
then have to tell you that the man who harassed her was your
boss?
   Mr. KOTHE. It not only surprises me, it completely confounds me.
How could it possibly be that a person as intelligent, as decent, as
dignified as this young woman was could talk to me about having a
program of sexual harassment and never say, I personally have ex-
perienced it?
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, very much. My time is up and I yield
to Senator Thurmond.
   Senator THURMOND. Senator Specter.
   Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Mr. Doggett, we have been searching in the past week, and you
are right when you talk as an experienced litigator, the speed with
which this matter has been put together. I have never seen any-
thing like it. I doubt that there has ever been as complex a matter
as this put together in this kind of a hearing sequence, calling of
                                               562

witnesses and examination as we have proceeded with overnight
transcripts in trying to move through in an orderly process.

  And we are doing it at the mandate of the Senate and those of us
who are doing it, at least, this Senator has some concern about
doing it at this speed. We are doing it the best we can. And we
have been trying to figure this matter out.

  And we have been going on the proposition most of the time, and
it hasn't been very long, that either he is lying or she is lying. I
have been trying to figure it out myself on the credibility issue or
the perjury issue. And as the matter has evolved I have started to
explore a third alternative. And that alternative was suggested to
me when I read on the same day, which was last Thursday, the af-
fidavits of Professor Kothe and the affidavit of Mr. Doggett.

  And I had not seen, I still have not seen Professor Kothe's affida-
vit of the 10th. I have your affidavit of the 7th, where you had the
word fantasy in, but as you say, you have changed it.

  But I am fascinated, Mr. Doggett, by your pinpointing the John
Carr issue. And I think that could bear some additional clarifica-
tion because, as you testify about it, as I understand your testimo-
ny

  Senator THURMOND. Senator, you had better wait a few minutes,
somebody is talking to your witness. And let him get through.

  Senator SPECTER. Will somebody stop the clock.
  The CHAIRMAN. I apologize. I asked that they speak up. I just
wanted to give the Dean an opportunity, if he wanted to, to take a
break at this moment if you want to and come back. I want the
witnesses to know if they have to get up and leave and come back
they can.
  Mr. KOTHE. Mr. Chairman, I have a requirement at this time. I
would have to have something, protein or something.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, that's why I asked the staff to talk to you
and, Dean, you are free to come and go. Or go. You don't have to
come back. I sincerely mean it. The hour is late and you have a
medical requirement and I understand that.
  Mr. KOTHE. I don't want to miss this.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter, understandably, says he needs
the dean here to ask him questions.
  Senator SPECTER. I need the dean here, because I am going to
talk about the dean's statement
  The CHAIRMAN. Fair enough. Why don't we yield to some on the
other side who can question, who does not have questions for the
dean, but wishes to ask someone else questions, and then come
back to you.
  Senator SPECTER. What do I have left, 14 minutes?
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, you can have as much time as you want.
  Senator SPECTER. OK. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I yield to the Senator from Ohio.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Doggett, I haven't had a chance to
read the full transcript of your testimony that was given in the
telephone interview with several staff members representing Sena-
tor Biden, Senator Heflin, Senator Thurmond, Senator Leahy and
Senator Specter.
                                                   563

  But let me read you some portions of it, because I think we are
talking about Anita Hill, and I think we need to also talk a little
bit about Mr. Doggett, and this is a question to you:

  Now, since we have received your affidavit and since your statement has gone
public, the majority staff has received word from an individual who said she worked
with you at McKenzie. Answer: Yes.

  And she has made some allegations concerning yourself. Answer: All right. And
did she give you a name? Answer: She did. And we will move to that. I wanted to let
you know where this line of questioning was going, to turn at this time. Answer: All
right. I am not surprised. Question: This morning, we spoke with a woman named
Amy Graham, who said she worked with you

  Senator SPECTER. Excuse me, Senator Metzenbaum. Would you
tell us where you are reading from?

  Senator METZENBAUM. Yes, page 64.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you.
  Senator METZENBAUM [reading:].

  Who said she worked with you at McKenzie & Company, and I believe you started
down there in August of 1981. Answer: That is correct. Let me tell you generally
what her allegations were, and then I will ask you some questions, and then I will
turn back to Ms. DeOreo, to follow up with some questions. Answer: All right.

   Question: Ms. Graham indicated that, on her first day of work, when she met you,
along with other people in that office; first of all, very succinctly, do you remember
Ms. Amy Graham? Answer: I do not. Question: You do not? Answer: I do not. Ques-
tion: She claims that, on her first day at work, at some point in the day, I believe
she said--I don't have the transcript available yet, but at some point during the day
you confronted her in the hall, in front of an elevator, and kissed her on the mouth
and told her that she would enjoy working with you very well. She also--Answer:
You know, I also got--I deny that. I didn't remember the woman, and that is outra-
geous. I also got a message on my answering machine after you guys went public
with my affidavit, saying "This is your Texas whore from five years ago." Some-
body, I don't know, never met, who decided that she was going to claim to be my
whore. Question: Mr. Doggett, let me just tell you generally her allegation, and then
I will give you adequate opportunity to respond. I think that, in all fairness, that
you need to know what she said, and then you can respond overall. She also claimed
that, during the time that she worked there--she was 19 years old when she began
work, she is 29 years old now--she also claimed that at times, in front of the copy-
ing machine--and again, I am just going from my recollection, I don't have the
transcript--that you would rub her shoulders at the copying machine. At the time,
you suggested to her, "Oh, you are making copies, that is sort of like reproduction,
isn't it?" She also said that some of your conversation dealt with sexual innuendo,
there was sexual overtone in your talk. But what struck me, though, is she also said
that you weren't in the office very much. So, first, if you could respond to Ms. Gra-
ham's allegations, and then I have some questions I want to discuss with you.

   I am still reading:

   Answer: I do not remember Amy Graham. If she was there, she was not there as
an associate or as a researcher or as a consultant, but was there as a part of the
secretarial staff. I never made any comments or statements to anybody like that. I
never did anything like that, so I categorically deny it. I am, quite frankly, not sur-
prised that somebody has come out of the woodwork to make a claim like this.
That's the nature of this business.

   That is on page 76.
   We now turn over to page 77, again the question--I was not
present at this and I am only reading from the transcript: "Ques-
tion: Okay. Fine. So, I understand that you didn't have much con-
versation with Mr. Chisholm. Let me ask you, do you recall the
name Joane Checci? Answer: Joane Checci, yes, I do remember
that name. She designed business cards for me and stationery for
me, when I was getting ready to leave the firm and become an in-
dependent consultant. Question: Do you recall ever touching Joane
                                             564

Checci? Answer: I never recall doing anything other than standing
next to her. I may have brushed her when I was standing next to
her, as she was designing business stationery, but I never remem-
ber. Question: Do you remember giving any neck massages?
Answer: I don't remember, but if she had asked for one, I would
have."

  Then we go over to page 84:

  Question: Mr. Doggett, so I don't leave one more thing hanging out there that has
been alleged against you, I want you to have an opportunity to clear your name. I
recall one other thing Ms. Graham said. She said that, subsequent to your leaving
McKenzie, she bumped into you on the street one afternoon or one day, and that
she was still at McKenzie. She told you she had since that time received a promo-
tion and that you responded, 'Well, whom did you sleep with to get the promotion?'
Answer: All right. Question: Did that occur? Answer: I absolutely categorically com-
pletely deny that.

  Mr. Doggett, you have an interesting series of questions and an-
swers in this transcript. I wonder if you would care to tell us what
are the facts with respect to these several ladies who have raised
questions concerning your own conduct?

  Mr. DOGGETT. Senator, your comments about this document are
one of the reasons that our process of government is falling apart.

  First of all, Senator, I have a copy of the statement that this
person met--it is called a transcript of proceedings. But, Senator, if
you read this, it is as telephone conversation that she has with
some staff members pro and against Mr. Thomas, and she is not
under oath. I did not do any of the things that she alleged. In fact,
the first time any of these issues were raised was the day before I
was supposed to come here, 8V2 years later.

  I knew when I put my information into the ring, that I was
saying I am open season. For anybody to believe that, on the first
day of work, for a woman working in the xerox room, who is 19
years old, a 33-year-old black man would walk up to a 19-year-old
white girl and kiss her on the mouth as the first thing that they
did, whoever believes that really needs psychiatric care.

  But let me talk about the facts, since you brought up this state-
ment, which was not made under oath, which was not made con-
sistent with any of the rules that you Senators are supposed to be
responsible for, since this is the Judiciary Committee, let me talk
about that, since you asked the question and went on and on and
on.

  During that time that she--I have read this statement. If she
had made it under oath, Senator, I would go to court, but

  Senator METZENBAUM. This isn't her statement. I am reading
from your statement, Mr. Doggett.

  Mr. DOGGETT. The statement that you read from was a discussion
with me, and consistently your staff people said, "I don't have the
transcript, I don't remember the exact facts." Well, I have the
transcript and the exact facts show this woman to be a profound
liar who does not even remember the facts accurately.

  She said--Senator, I would suggest we all turn to "Transcript of
Proceedings of Ms. Amy Graham," the woman who has accused
me, the liar, page 6: "I met John Doggett the first day I started
there, which I remember correctly was probably Monday, March
20, 1982."
                                      565

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Doggett, what page are you on, please?
  Senator METZENBAUM. I don't have that.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Page 6 of the unsworn telephone conversation that
Ms. Graham had with some staffers.
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me, let me interrupt for a minute.
  Mr. DOGGETT. I'm pissed off, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is totally out of line with what the committee
had agreed to
  Mr. DOGGETT. I'm sorry.
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. For there to be entered into this
record any unsworn statement by any witness who cannot be called
before this committee, and I rule any such statement out of order.
  Now, I apologize for being out of the room. Was there any
  Senator METZENBAUM. I was only reading from Mr. Doggett's
own statement.
  Mr. DOGGETT. My statement was not under oath, sir. That was a
telephone conversation and they said we staffers would like to talk
with you, we have a court reporter there. I'm a lawyer, sir, it was
no deposition, it was not under oath, as Ms. Graham's comments
were not under oath. And since you have brought this up, I
demand the right to clear my name, sir.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I was only reading from his statement,
not from
  Mr. DOGGETT. I demand the right to clear my name, sir. I have
been trashed for no reason by somebody who does not even have
the basic facts right. This is what is going on with Clarence
Thomas, and now I, another person coming up, has had a "witness"
fabricated at the last moment to try to keep me from testifying.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, Mr. Doggett----
  Mr. DOGGETT. I am here, I don't care, she is wrong, and I would
like to be able to clear my name, sir.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Please do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Sir, you will be permitted to say whatever you
would like to with regard to, as you say, clearing your name. If
there was no introduction of the transcript of Amy Louise Graham
in the record, then that is a different story. I was under the im-
pression that had been read from. That has not been read from.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I did not read from that at all.
  The CHAIRMAN. It has not been read from, and I don't know
what else took place, but
  Senator METZENBAUM. I read from Mr. Doggett's questions asked
of him
  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Doggett, please, as much time as you want
to make
  Senator METZENBAUM [continuing]. By the staff of Senator Biden,
Senators Heflin, Thurmond, Leahy and Specter. My staff was not
even present. I am just asking you if you would please go ahead
and respond in any manner that you want to clear your name.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Yes, sir.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, you were not here, but what
happened is that Senator Metzenbaum was reading to Mr. Doggett
from Mr. Doggett's unsworn statement of the telephone inter-
view

  Senator METZENBAUM. That's correct.
                                             566

  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. And that statement involved ques-
tions from Ms. Graham, who was questioned similarly in an uns-
worn statement over the telephone, and for Mr. Doggett to reply to
what Senator Metzenbaum had asked him, since Senator Metz-
enbaum was basing his questions on what Ms. Graham had said, it
is indispensable that Mr. Doggett be able to refer to what Ms.
Graham said

  The CHAIRMAN. It is appropriate for Mr. Doggett to refer to
whatever he wishes to refer to at this point, in light of where we
are at the moment.

  Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. SO, Mr. Doggett, proceed.
  Mr. DOGGETT. I will tell you, Senators, before I talk about the
specifics, I debated, myself and with my wife, whether or not to
start the process that resulted in me being here, because this is vi-
cious, and I knew, since anything I said was going to raise the
question about the credibility of Professor Anita Hill, as a lawyer,
that meant my character was open season.
  I have never been involved as a candidate, although I have
always said you can't complain about the process, if you're not will-
ing to put your ass on the line--pardon me, I am sorry. I am sorry
about that.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman
  Mr. DOGGETT. But I have said if you don't like the way the politi-
cal process is, then you have to get into it and you have to get into
the fray.
  So, I said, okay, if I submit this information to this committee,
then I am open season and people are going to shoot at me, and I
do not care. I have information I think the committee needs to
hear. If they feel it is relevant enough for me to be here, I will be
here and I will take whatever occurs.
  But I will tell you, sir, I have had lawyers and professional
people in Texas and around the country say that I was insane to
subject myself to the opportunity to have something like this crawl
out from under a rock. They have said I should have just stood on
the sidelines and let it go by.
  I am an attorney, sir
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Doggett
  Mr. DOGGETT [continuing]. I am a businessman and I cannot
allow this process of innuendo, unsworn statements and attacks on
characters to continue, without saying it is unacceptable.
  Now, specifically, page 6 of her unsworn telephone conversation
with Senate staff, dated the 12th of October, 2 days ago, says, "I
met John Doggett the first day I started there, which, if I remem-
ber correctly, was probably Monday, March 20, 1972. At that"
  The CHAIRMAN. I will let you continue, but you ought to seek
your own counsel for a minute here. No one has read anything into
the record, as I understand

   Mr. DOGGETT. NOW

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, wait, let me finish.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Yes, sir.

  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. That you may be about to read into
the record. Let me say that anyone who asks you--that I think it is
unfair--that you were in a telephonic interview, whether it is
                                      567

sworn or unsworn, are asked about an uncorroborated accusation
that is not sworn to, and then in open session you are asked from
your statement about that same statement, that's no different than
as if it was introduced without--if the original statement were in-
troduced, which is inappropriate.

  Now, all I am saying to you is this: I believe you are entitled to
say whatever you wish to say here, and I believe we are beyond the
bounds here.

  Mr. DOGGETT. I understand.
  The CHAIRMAN. The question I want you to think about is wheth-
er you want to further give credence to an unsubstantiated, uns-
worn to statement of someone that may be completely lying. It is
up to you to make that judgment. That is your call, but I would
think about it.
  Mr. DOGGETT. I appreciate your comments and I apologize for
getting angry.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, you have no reason to apologize.
  Mr. DOGGETT. NO, I am going to apologize, sir. This is a difficult
process. I have only been up here for a short period of time and
you have been here, as I understand it, for a very long period of
time.
  Let me say, without reading the statement or putting in that
"evidence," since I am under oath, comments made by this person,
that they are wrong, that at the time the allegations, the unsworn
allegations were made, I was in the midst of a major project with
McKenzie & Company regarding the Comptroller of the Currency,
where we had just found, from a computer analysis, that bank de-
regulation would result in bank failures and savings and loan fail-
ures that exceeded the historical limits of bank failures over the
past ten years.
  We were in the midst of that analysis, we were frightened by the
information that we had found, and we were doing everything we
could do to prove ourselves wrong, and it is in the context of that
time that this person, whom I do not remember, claims that I
would walk up to her and do that.
  At the same time, Senator, I had just started a relationship with
an attorney, a very intense relationship. The facts are wrong.
  Second, that person, as read by Senator Metzenbaum, alleges
that I was getting ready to leave the firm at that time. Senator,
after I finished that Comptroller of the Currency study, in approxi-
mately April of 1982, in May of 1982, McKenzie & Co. sent me to
Copenhagen, Denmark, to spend the summer working for our
Danish office. That is not exactly an exit strategy, sir. That was
one of the most prized assignments that the firm had.
  The facts in this uncorroborated, unsworn to statement are not
even consistent with the facts of my life. So, without trying to put
this thing into the record, all I can say is that I expected somebody
to do something like this, because that is what this process has
become, and one of the reasons I am here is to work with you gen-
tlemen to try to take the public process back into the pale of pro-
priety.
  Now, second, when I was the director of the State Bar of Califor-
nia's Office of Legal Services, I had the opportunity to hire two
deputies. Both of those people were women. In fact, when I knew
                                      568

that I was going to leave the state bar to go to Harvard Business
School, the person I hired to replace me was a woman.

  I have a very clear long record of commitment, sensitivity and
support for women having the greatest role possible, but I am
afraid that the outlandish allegations of Anita Hill are going to
result in us feeling that it is inappropriate for us to be human
beings with people if they happen to be women. Nobody would ever
question me if I put my hand around this man, who I have never
met.

  The CHAIRMAN. He might.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Well, maybe he would. [Laughter.]
  But I hope we don't get to the point where if anybody by any
way, accidentally or purposely, innocently touches somebody of the
opposite sex, that becomes sexual harassment.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would really like this to end. Let the record
show, and I am stating it, there is absolutely no evidence, none, no
evidence in this record, no evidence before this committee, that you
did anything wrong with regard to anything, none. I say that as
the chairman of this committee. I think your judgment about
women is not so hot, whether or not people fantasize or don't. You
and I disagree in that.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Yes, sir.

  The CHAIRMAN. But you did nothing. There is no evidence, the
record should show, the press should show, there is absolutely no
evidence that you did anything improper, period.

  Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, would it be proper to ex-
punge from the record, then, that information that came out?
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, fine, but Senator, I would hope you would
read from his statement of questions asked of him. It is a little bit
like if someone asked me over the telephone, "Are you still beating
your wife?" and I answer yes or no, it doesn't matter. I am still in
trouble. And then someone says, "I am reading only from your
statement, Mr. Biden. You are the one that mentioned your wife."
I never did.
  And I know that is not what the Senator intended, but that is
the effect. It is no different than just putting this unsubstantiated
material in, and I want the record to show I don't think anything
that is unsworn and I don't think anything in an FBI record is any-
thing--up until the time it is sworn or the person is here to be
cross-examined--is anything but garbage.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, I apologize for the interruption
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes?
  Senator THURMOND. Would it be proper for you to explain for the
record those parts that you feel were improper?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, and I will.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, Senator, please continue, not along the
lines of what someone said he said, and he had to respond to what
they said.
                                         569

  Senator METZENBAUM. I am not saying what somebody said he
said. I am asking him what he said. He said that he did not re-
member Ms. Amy Graham, that he did not know Amy Graham.

  You also indicated that she was white and 19. How did you know
that?

  Mr. DOGGETT. Senator, when your staff or the staff of the com-
mittee

  Senator METZENBAUM. My staff has not been in touch
  Mr. DOGGETT. Excuse me. When the staff of the committee--I
corrected myself--made these allegations to me, one of the things I
said, and if you read my complete statement, you will realize it is
there, is that although I do not remember this person, that does
not mean this person was not there; that it is possible that she did
work at McKenzie and Company. I just do not remember her. I said
that. OK?
  The second thing I did after the staffers of committee hung up
was to call an associate of mine who started at McKenzie in the
company with me, at the same time, a man named Carroll War-
field, and I asked him if he remembered this woman because I did
not remember her name at all. I did not remember her face. Noth-
ing about her came into my mind, but I knew it was possible she
could have been there. Senator, it has been eight or nine years and
I, even I can forget people.
  He said, "Oh, yes, I remember her," and he was the one who in-
dicated to me that she was white. That, as far as the age 19, I be-
lieve you read that when you read statements that I responded to
from the Senate Judiciary Committee staff, and that is how we got
the age 19, sir.
   Senator METZENBAUM. NO, I think it was your statement, but we
will just drop it, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Thank you. Now let me make one
other thing clear. The exception to unsworn statements being
placed in the record is when the witnesses stipulate that they are
admissible, when the parties mentioned in the statements stipulate
they are admissible, and when the committee stipulates they are
admissible, which is the case of the Angela Wright stipulation.
That is different, so no one is confused later, that there is a funda-
mental distinction.
   Now, Senator, who had the
   Senator THURMOND. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylva-
nia.
   Senator SPECTER. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was in the
midst of questioning Mr. Doggett and Professor Kothe when we
had to take a brief recess for Professor Kothe, so I shall resume at
this point.
   I think it is worth noting, Mr. Chairman, to amplify what Mr.
Doggett has said--if I could have the attention of the chairman for
just a moment
   The CHAIRMAN. Yes. I'm sorry.
   Senator SPECTER. Late yesterday evening when we caucused and
the chairman stated his intention to try to finish the hearings
today

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes.

         56-273 O--93-
                                               570

  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. I then reviewed what had to be
done, and at about 6:45 this morning called Duke Short and said
we ought to have Mr. Doggett here, and that is why he was called
this morning at about 7 o'clock, he said

   Mr. DOGGETT. 6:30, sir.

  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. 6:30 central time, so he has been
on that track to accommodate our schedule so we could finish
today.

  Mr. DOGGETT. I don't mind staying here as long as you need, sir.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, that is probably going to happen. [Laugh-
ter.]
  Mr. DOGGETT. I sense that.
  Senator SPECTER. I want to explore with you what conceivably--I
don't want to overstate it--could be the key to the extremely diffi-
cult matter we are looking into. And I had said, shortly before my
line of questioning was interrupted, that we have been working on
the proposition that either Anita Hill is lying or Judge Thomas is
lying.
  And we have explored earlier today, with a panel of four women
who favor Judge Thomas but who knew Professor Hill very well,
the possibility that there could be in her mind that these things
happened when they really didn't. And I developed that question
after talking to a number of my colleagues, because we have been
discussing this matter all day, and it originated with the two affi-
davits or statements, your affidavit, Mr. Doggett, and Professor
Kothe's statement that was not sworn to, where the word "fanta-
sy" was used.
  And it may be that we are not limited to the two alternatives,
one, that he is lying; two, that she is lying. Perhaps they both
think they are telling the truth, but in Professor Hill's case she
thinks it is true but in fact it is not. And you testified to a very
interesting approach when you referred to the testimony of Mr.
John Carr, whom you said you went to graduate school at Harvard
with, where you made a key distinction between the way Professor
Hill viewed the relationship and the way John Carr viewed the re-
lationship. And I think it would be worthwhile if you would ampli-
fy that, as you had started to articulate it earlier.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Senators, at every step--in fact I remember when I
was at Yale Law School seeing Senator Kennedy give a speech to
people at Yale, back in the early seventies--at every step of my
education, at Claremont Men's College, at Yale Law School, at Har-
vard Business School, one of the things I tried to do was to provide
assistance to make sure that black law students and Hispanic law
students would have the best possible opportunity to do as well as
possible, because I had something to prove, Senators. I had had
people tell me that I could not be good because I was black, and I
was out to prove them wrong.
  Because of that, I was asked by my colleagues at Harvard Busi-
ness School, in part because I was an older student and in part be-
cause of my commitment to excellence, to be the Education Com-
mittee chairperson for the African-American Student Union, and
to organize tutorial study groups and other support activities to
make sure that every one of our people had the best possible
                                      571

chance to do as well as possible, to excel. That is how I met John
Carr.

  I know John Carr, and I think I know him well. I definitely
know him better than I know the judge and I know the professor. I
saw John Carr this May at Harvard Business School for our 10th
Harvard Business School Alumni reception, reunion, and we
talked.

  In those 10, 12 years, John Carr has never mentioned Anita Hill
to me. We have talked about women John Carr has had relation-
ships with. I have called him up at times and said, "Hey, man,
haven't you gotten married yet? because we were that close, and
he would say, "Well, you know, there really hasn't been anybody
special." We have talked about the issue of John Carr's personal
life, and her name never came up in the way that she described
herself.

  I, as the Senator asked me, am not a psychiatrist, I am not a psy-
chologist, and so maybe I am not qualified to use the term "fanta-
sy" from a professional standpoint, but as a lay person and an indi-
vidual, that is what I felt. And given what John Carr has said and
has not said, given what the Professor has said, given that she has
described a series of activities where Clarence Thomas was ob-
sessed with her--every time she said no, he would try to get her to
relent and go out with him, over a period of years, obsessed with
her--I have to deal with the realities that if he was so obsessed
with her, why did he never talk to me about her or anybody else
about her?

  One of the things, Senator, that stunned--I won't use that word
again--that amazed me about the testimony of the women who
worked with Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas, is that they came up
with conclusions very similar to what I put in my affidavit, and
these are women I have never met. These are women who knew
both of the people involved in this hearing at this stage far better
than I did.

  I was going to a gut sense, on male intuition. They were saying
the same thing, without any communication between the four of
them and myself, based on years of observation. I find that amaz-
ing.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Doggett, you heard the testimony of the
panel with Ms. Berry on it? You were in the hearing room at that
time today?

  Mr. DOGGETT. Hearing room at the end, and I was at the hotel
looking at it on TV, sir.

  Senator SPECTER. SO you saw the panel with Ms. Alvarez, Ms.
Fitch, Ms. Holt

  Mr. DOGGETT. I saw most of what they said, although I missed
part of it as I was coming here to appear before you gentlemen.

  Senator SPECTER. Did you hear the part where Ms. Berry testi-
fied to amplify an interview which she had given to the New York
Times, that Professor Hill was rebuffed by Judge Thomas?

  Mr. DOGGETT. I do not remember the exact facts, but I heard
most of her response to the New York Times

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I think it would be worthwhile for you to
refer to whatever you heard of their testimony, in terms of their
statements as to the relationship between Judge Thomas and Pro-
                                             572

fessor Hill, because their testimony was extensive as it relates to
the approach you are articulating.

  Mr. DOGGETT. Right. My experience with Clarence Thomas and
Anita Hill was inconsistent, as I said, with what she was alleging,
and based on my experiences over a period of a year and a half
with Anita Hill and over a period of 7 or 8 years with Clarence
Thomas, I came to some conclusions as a lay person, as an individ-
ual, as an untrained non-professional, where I used the words "fan-
tasies" and I talked about her possibly reacting to being rejected. I
did that sitting in Austin, Texas, Thursday afternoon, on my com-
puter with my word processing software.

  Today, gentlemen, as you know, four women I have never met
and have never talked with came to the same conclusion based on
extensive experience and observations with Anita, with Professor
Hill and Judge Thomas. Mine was just intuition, gentlemen. Theirs
was based on experience, and we both came, all five of us came to
essentially the same conclusion. That surprised me, but now I am
not surprised.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Doggett, what similarities, if any, do you
see between the description you have made of your own relation-
ship with Professor Hill, where you categorized in your affidavit
her response to being rejected, and the relationship which Profes-
sor Hill had with John Carr, where she had exaggerated the rela-
tionship as you have testified from your personal knowledge of the
two of them, and the relationship with Judge Thomas, where she
has represented the kind of a relationship which Judge Thomas
has flatly denied and others who know the two of them think total-
ly implausible?

  Mr. DOGGETT. In my case, Senator, which I obviously can talk
about the clearest, she came up to me before we left--before she
left for Oral Roberts University, and basically chastised me for
leading her on, and gave me in effect advice that I should not in
the future lead women on. I felt at the time, and the good chair-
man of this committee notwithstanding, I still feel at this point and
I will always feel that that was totally inappropriate, given every-
thing I tried to do to be a supportive, older upper-classman, part of
the Yale Law School group.

  Regarding Mr. Carr, John Carr, Attorney Carr, my friend, I have
had a series of conversations with this man over the past decade.
He has never, ever said that he was dating Anita Hill. When he
was here under oath he said, to paraphrase him, "I would not
define our relationship as a dating relationship."

  Regarding Judge Clarence Thomas I have the least information,
because he never, ever at any time mentioned this woman to me.
And at the time, the one time that I have concrete observation
about her perception of how she thought she should be treated by
me vis-a-vis Judge Thomas, she wanted to go into Judge Thomas'
inner office at EEOC because she felt that was appropriate, and for
me it didn't make any sense at all.

  So in those three instances--my own personal experience, a
statement by a business school colleague and friend of mine, and
my one observation about Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas back, I
believe, in 1982, there is a consistency in a perception of something
that did not exist.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Doggett, do you think it a possibility that
Professor Hill imagined or fantasized Judge Thomas saying the
things she has charged him with?

  Mr. DOGGETT. YOU know, part of what makes this so unpleasant
for all of us is that her charges are so clear, explicit, and extreme. I
know how difficult it has been for me to even remember what hap-
pened back in 1982, so one of the things I did was take some time
off from work to look at Anita Hill when she was testifying before
this committee, and I will tell you gentlemen, she looked believable
to me, even though the words she was saying made absolutely no
sense.

  I believe that Anita Hill believes what she has said. I believe,
and I am saying this under oath, that there is absolutely no truth
to what she has said. But I believe that she believes it.

  I was impressed with her confidence, her calm, even though the
things she was saying in my mind were absolutely, totally beyond
the pale of reality.

  Clarence Thomas told me in his office that "These people are
going to shoot at me. I have a target on my back. It is one of my
jobs to make sure that I am not going to be the black in the
Reagan Administration that gets tarred and feathers."

  Doing what she alleges that he did with her was a prescription
for instant death. Clarence is not a fool. And quite frankly, Anita
Hill is not worth that type of risk.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Doggett. Very pow-
erful.

  Professor Kothe, just a question or two, and this is following up
on what Senator Biden had asked you, and it relates to the testimo-
ny which you had given that Professor Hill was very complimenta-
ry about Judge Thomas. There has been considerable testimony
given by people who have tried to explain Professor Hill's activities
in the sense that she was controlled by Judge Thomas when she
worked for him, and that even after she left him she needed him
for a variety of assistance.

  But my question to you is did there come a point where she had
sufficient independence from Judge Thomas so that a continuation
of laudatory, complimentary comments which you have testified
about would tend to undercut her credibility that he had said these
dastardly things to her early on?

  Mr. KOTHE. I am not so sure that I grasped the essence of your
question. I don't know that she was ever dependent upon him for
adulation. She had a continuing relationship, I think of a profes-
sional nature, with the EEOC. She was doing some studies and get-
ting materials from them, and the things that we were working on
together, we both derived information from the EEO office.

  Just how extensive was her continued interaction with Chairman
Thomas, I really don't know.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, let me break it down for you, Professor
Kothe, to this extent. You have testified that you thought her
charges were inconceivable, as I think you have earlier said. Is that
correct?

  Mr. KOTHE. Yes. Absolutely.
                                              574

   Senator SPECTER. And you have based that on your testimony
that when you would talk to her about Judge Thomas she would
consistently compliment Judge Thomas. Correct?

   Mr. KOTHE. Correct.
   Senator SPECTER. SO, is it your conclusion that if she consistently
said complimentary things about him that it could not be true that
he had done these dastardly deeds?
   Mr. KOTHE. Yes, that would be my conclusion. It is just so utterly
incongruent and inconsistent that a person that would speak of
him almost reverently as a hero, as a person--a remarkable
person, she would say, as a person of untiring energy, she spoke of
him, as I said earlier, as a devoted father.
  I have never heard her speak of him but in pretty much relative-
ly glowing terms. Never have I heard her say anything critical
about him, even when we were discussing the subject of sexual har-
assment.
  So, in that situation with a person that I respected and a person
that I admired, I just cannot in my mentations equate how utterly
impossible, grotesque statements could be made about this person
that she spoke of to me with such high admiration.
  Senator SPECTER. The follow-up question to that is some have
sought to explain her continuing association with Judge Thomas on
the basis that she needed him, that he was her benefactor. And my
question to you is would it be necessary for her to go as far as she
did in the kind of complimentary statements she made to you on a
personal basis to maintain that kind of an association where she
could go back to him, for example, for letters of recommendation?
  Mr. KOTHE. Well, certainly she needed no further letters of rec-
ommendation after she established herself as a teacher. She was a
good teacher.
  This is not a young woman that is obsequious and fawning and
retiring. She was a very positive person. In our faculty meetings
she was forthright. She was always a strong person. She didn't
need Clarence Thomas to continue in her career of teaching, which
she has done and become tenured at the University of Oklahoma.
  Senator SPECTER. SO your conclusion was when she complimented
Judge Thomas she meant it?
  Mr. KOTHE. I had no reason to believe she didn't.
  Senator SPECTER. And, if she complimented Judge Thomas, it
would be totally inconsistent with his having said these terrible
things to her?
  Mr. KOTHE. Utterly inconsistent.
  Senator SPECTER. And the final point is the one where Senator
Biden asked you would she have been reluctant to talk to you in
truthful derogatory terms considering the fact that you were in a
sense an employee of Chairman Thomas?
  Mr. KOTHE. I wouldn't think there was any basis for her having
a reluctance to disclose to me anything that was of that nature if,
indeed, it were a fact. I think that our relationship was such that
she could have confidence in me.
  I didn't need the position with Clarence Thomas. She didn't need
Clarence Thomas to keep the position she had. We were both ad
hoc in that sense, working on something that was avocational with
us, from the point of view of our then situation.
                                         575

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. The Senator from Massa-
chusetts indicates he would like to question.

  Senator KENNEDY. Just for a moment, Mr. Doggett. When you
were at Harvard, did you say you headed the Afro students' organi-
zation for student assistance?

  Mr. DOGGETT. Senator, what I said was that in the second year I
was asked by my co-students to be the chairman of the Education
Committee, of what at that time was called the Afro-American
Student Union.

  Senator KENNEDY. And that was a tutorial program for kids in
Cambridge, or what was that?

  Mr. DOGGETT. NO. Harvard Business School has a program to
weed out people that it does not feel deserve an Harvard MBA. It
is called hitting the screen. It is one of the most intense academic
experiences that they have.

  The Afro-American Student Union is a membership organization
of black American students at Harvard Business School, and those
of us who are second-years organized programs to do what we can,
not only to prevent first-years from hitting the screen, but to do
everything possible to make it possible for them to excel.

  My fellow students asked me to be the chairperson of this com-
mittee and to organize programs for Harvard Business School MBA
students in their first year.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, that is fine. I was just interested in
whether you were working through the Phyllis Brooks House or
community programs. Because the Business School, I believe, has a
program. I just wanted to see whether you were associated with it.

   Mr. DOGGETT. NO, sir.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Brown?
  Senator THURMOND. Senator Brown?
  Senator BROWN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sorry. I am sorry.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, we go 20 some odd minutes on
that side, 38--I am sorry, 48 seconds on this side. Just a couple of
questions.
  Senator THURMOND. Are we next over here?
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, apparently Senator Kennedy yielded the
remainder of his five minutes.
  Senator THURMOND. Hold off for just a minute then.
  Senator BROWN. OK.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Doggett, you said that in the years that you
have known John Carr, he never mentioned knowing Anita Hill.
You are not suggesting that John Carr didn't know Anita Hill, are
you?
  Mr. DOGGETT. Absolutely not, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. OK.
  Mr. DOGGETT. It is clear that he did.
  Senator LEAHY. The fact that he didn't mention her to you is one
thing.
  Mr. DOGGETT. Senator, I asked John Carr specifically about who
he was going out with and whether or not he was getting married.
                                             576

  Senator LEAHY. I understand. I think, though, that we should
perhaps go by Mr. Carr's sworn statement here this afternoon. It
might be the best testimony, rather than whether he thought it
necessary to discuss it with you whether he knew her or not.

  Now, in your statement you talked about how much you have
known Professor Hill. You met her at a social function in 1982.
You had two or three phone conversations in which you were pri-
marily interested in having her get you in touch with Harry Sin-
gleton. You met outside, I think, Clarence Thomas's office. You
bumped into each other jogging, and you explained how you jog in
place, so you couldn't talk to her there. Somehow, other plans to go
out fell through. Then you saw each other at a party and, accord-
ing to you, Professor Hill said, "I'm very disappointed in you. You
really shouldn't lead on women and let them down."

  Now, you have described these contacts with her as minimal.
Professor Hill, incidentally, testified she has little or no recollec-
tion of you. When I pressed her--and I asked her specifically--she
said she thinks she recalls that you were tall.

  Now, based on such minimal contacts with Professor Hill, how
could you conclude that she had fantasies about your sexual inter-
est in her, or do you just feel that you have some kind of a natural
irresistibility?

  Mr. DOGGETT. My wife says I do.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, Anita Hill apparently doesn't say you do,
Mr. Doggett.

   Mr. DOGGETT. Sir

  Senator LEAHY. She doesn't even remember you.
  Mr. DOGGETT. NO, she didn't say that, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. She said she barely remembers you. When I
asked her to describe you she had some difficulty and thought that
you were tall.
  Mr. DOGGETT. I looked at Anita Hill's face when you folks men-
tioned my name. She remembers me, Senator, I assure you of that.
  Now, to answer your question, the reason I thought her state-
ments were so bizarre was because our contact was so limited. If
we had had much more contact with each other, and as the good
Senator Chairman had said, she had come up to me at the end and
said, "John, you know we've been seeing, running into each other
time and time again," then her comment would have been much
more understandable. Since we had had so little contact, I found it
to be a bizarre comment.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU have remarkable insight into her: You are
able to watch her face and know when we mentioned your name,
"By golly! John Doggett's name gets mentioned, this woman is,
Wow!"
  It really triggered a bell; is that what you are saying? I don't un-
derstand. Mr. Doggett, I know this has been an interesting experi-
ence for you. You have talked about how Tom Brokaw's office is
looking forward
  Mr. DOGGETT. Sir, it has not been interesting. It has been very
painful, been very difficult. It has interfered with my life. It has
resulted in me getting threats and obscene phone calls on my tele-
phone, people approaching me and accosting me in public. This is
not fun, sir.
                                         577

  Senator LEAHY. But, Mr. Doggett, what I am saying is you had
these very minimal contacts. Yet you have been able to analyze
Anita Hill from just jogging in place and talking to her, and from
talking to her on the phone a couple of times when you asked her
to set up a meeting with somebody else, you are able to figure out
that she has a problem with being rejected by men, and that she
has fantasies about sexual interest in her.

  Are you able to make such thorough judgments about everybody
you meet for such a short period of time? And I mean that serious-
ly.

  Mr. DOGGETT. I understand, Senator. I appreciate your question
and I think it is a very fair question. Let me do what I can to try to
assist you in understanding how I could say what I said.

  The jogging incidence, I wanted to jog in place for a few seconds
and then move on. She made it very clear that she would like the
conversation to be more involved by her body language, by her
questions: Well, where do you live? Why are you jogging in this
neighborhood? I stopped jogging and we had a conversation that
lasted between 5 or 10 minutes. I don't remember exactly how long
it was. It is a long time ago.

   As I remember it, she was the one who initiated the suggestion
that we have dinner. I also observed her from time to time at the
Black Yale Law parties that we had. As she had conversations with
me, my sense, unprofessional, limited as it was, was that she was
trying to engage people in conversations and to prolong conversa-
tions. Based on my experience, it suggested an interest. I never saw
any of those conversations result in people continuing to talk with
her.

   Now that is totally unscientific and it is just a point of view.
   Senator LEAHY. YOU don't have an aversion to long conversa-
tions, do you, Mr. Doggett?
   Mr. DOGGETT. When somebody is trying to, to use the terminolo-
gy "hit on somebody," and the result is people walk away, and you
see that happen more than one time, it leads you to believe, Sena-
tor, that maybe something is not working.
   Senator LEAHY. YOU said in your sworn affidavit that Anita Hill
was frustrated not being a part of Clarence Thomas's inner circle.
   Mr. DOGGETT. That is correct, Senator.
   Senator LEAHY. From these minimal contacts, you were able to
deduce that?
   Mr. DOGGETT. The look on Anita's face when we were in the
outer office of Clarence Thomas's office at EEOC when I did not
say, "I'm getting ready to talk with Clarence, why don't you come
on in with me," the look on her face is the basis for that decision.
   Now, you and anybody else may feel that I did not have suffi-
cient information to justify making that opinion, but that is what I
said and that is what I felt.
   Senator LEAHY. Let me make sure I understand this. By her body
language, you knew that she was concerned about not being part of
Thomas's inner circle? From the look on her face outside of Thom-
as's office when you spoke to her, you are able to discern what was
in her mind? And then watching her on television, by the look on
her face when I mentioned your name, you are able to draw other
conclusions about her remembrance of you?
                                      578

  Mr. DOGGETT. That is my sense, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. That is all right. I just want to make sure I un-
derstand your ability of perception.
  And, Dean, you have testified that the Clarence Thomas you
knew could not possibly have made the statements Anita Hill
claims he made, and I understand that. You stated that very force-
fully, sir.
  Do you believe that the Clarence Thomas you knew could enjoy
talking about pornographic movies? I mean, that is one of the
things that was alleged. Anita Hill alleged that he talked to her
about pornographic movies. Are you saying that the Clarence
Thomas you knew wouldn't even enjoy talking about pornographic
movies?
  Mr. KOTHE. I can't believe it. I can't just believe that this man
would even think in terms of pornographic movies. All of my rela-
tionship with him was at such a high level, talking about books of
religion and philosophy and the things that he was reading. I can't
imagine this man would have any diversion in the area that you
describe. I just can't.
  Senator LEAHY. I understand. I understand, Dean.
  You are aware, however, that a supporter, a Ms. Coleman, has
been quoted in the New York Times as saying that at law school he
didn't talk about religion or philosophy, that he talked about por-
nographic movies?
  Mr. KOTHE. I didn't get that. Will you please say it again?
  Senator LEAHY. I said you said that the man you know would
talk probably about books and religion, but you could not conceive
of him talking about pornographic movies. You knew that one of
his supporters, strong supporters--she has written a letter to me,
in fact, in support of him--a Ms. Coleman, has been quoted in the
New York Times as saying that Judge Thomas used to talk about
pornographic films at law school?
  Does that surprise you at all?
  Mr. KOTHE. It does.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you. And you have--just very quickly,
you have no way of knowing from your own personal knowledge
whether Anita Hill is telling the truth about what Clarence
Thomas said to her?

   Mr. KOTHE. NO.

  Senator LEAHY. And, Mr. Doggett, would your answer be the
same? You know of nothing from your personal knowledge whether
fhe is telling the truth or not? I know your opinion which you have
expressed here. But of your personal knowledge, do you know?

  Mr. DOGGETT. I have absolutely no information.
  Senator LEAHY. And, Mr. Stewart, of your own personal knowl-
edge?
  Mr. STEWART. My personal knowledge of Clarence Thomas would
lead me to conclude that she was, in fact, lying.
  Senator LEAHY. But, of your own personal knowledge, you don't
know whether Clarence Thomas sexually harassed Anita Hill?
  Mr. STEWART. NO. I don't know that we, the term sexual harass
or said the things she said. I think we are confused about all of
that.
                                         579

  I will restate my statement and say that my personal knowledge
of Clarence Thomas would make it incredible for me to believe the
things she has alleged.

  Senator LEAHY. DO you know that Judge Thomas said that if
somebody did the things that Anita Hill claims that he did, if
somebody did that, Judge Thomas freely admits that that would be
sexual harassment. But you don't know of your own personal
knowledge whether that happened or not, is that correct?

  Mr. STEWART. I don't know that it happened. I conclude that
Clarence Thomas did not do it.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Now, Mr. Grayson, of your personal knowledge, you don't know
whether Clarence Thomas sexually harassed Anita Hill?
  Mr. GRAYSON. I have no personal knowledge.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Senator HEFLIN. I will just ask 1 minute and that will do it.
Dean, Clarence Thomas wrote a letter of recommendation for
Anita Hill to you and she became a member of the law school at
the Oral Roberts University.

  And is it correct that you wrote a letter of recommendation to
the Dean of the University of Oklahoma Law School when she
went there to teach at the University of Oklahoma?

  Mr. KOTHE. I think I talked to Dean Swank, I don't remember
writing the letter.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, he wrote, Clarence Thomas wrote you?

   Mr. KOTHE. Yes.

   Senator HEFLIN. Did you, in talking to the Dean of the Universi-
ty of Oklahoma Law School, did you give her a good recommenda-
tion?

   Mr. KOTHE. Oh, yes.

   Senator HEFLIN. A great recommendation?

   Mr. KOTHE. Yes.

   Senator HEFLIN. All right, thank you.
   Senator SIMON. Mr. Chairman, just one 30-second comment to
Mr. Doggett. When your counselor suggested the Illinois Institute
of Technology rather than MIT or Cal Tech let me tell you, that
counselor was recommending an excellent, superb school in Illinois.
It was not a put down.

   Mr. DOGGETT. All right.
   Senator LEAHY. The only trouble with that, Senator Simon, is
that there is probably no one up at this hour of the night to see
you say that plug, but we will make sure that you have a certified
copy of the record in the morning.
   Senator THURMOND. Professor Kothe, I have two very brief ques-
tions. Knowing Clarence Thomas as you do, and knowing Anita
Hill as you do, do you give any credibility to her charges against
Clarence Thomas?
   Mr. KOTHE. The last part?
   Would I what?
   Senator THURMOND. DO you give any credibility to her charges
against Clarence Thomas?
   Mr. KOTHE. NO, the answer is I do not.
                                             580

   I can't believe that she would even say that. I can't believe that
she would put that kind of words in her mouth and I can't believe
that she would ever say that about Clarence Thomas.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, do you give credibility to the charges
or not?

   Mr. KOTHE. I do not.

  Senator THURMOND. What?

   Mr. KOTHE. I do not.

  Senator THURMOND. YOU do not.
  The next question. You have had a close relationship with Clar-
ence Thomas and Anita Hill. Do you believe the serious charges
made against Judge Thomas by Professor Hill are true?
  Mr. KOTHE. I do not believe they are true.
  Senator THURMOND. YOU do not, that's all. I will yield to the Sen-
ator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. It's been a long night and thank you so much
Professor, and Mr. Doggett, and Mr. Stewart and Mr. Grayson. I
bet you two gentlemen wish you hadn't gone to the ABA conven-
tion in Atlanta if it was going to cost you this kind of a night, did
you?
  Mr. STEWART. It's well worth it, Your Honor, to clear the name
of Clarence Thomas.
  Senator SIMPSON. Let me tell you, it is true, you have to break it
with levity because it does get so, it is so stunning. But I do ask
you both, you two are really quite critical. And you have been
asked very little but the questions you have been asked have been
very important.
  But you two are probably the two who have seen her most re-
cently, and got an idea of her state of mind about Clarence Thomas
in the midst of his travail. In other words, he has been in the tank
now for 106 days. And you saw her in August and you spent 30
minutes with her, right?
  Mr. STEWART. If not longer.
  Senator SIMPSON. If not longer, and you talked about Clarence
and lots of other things as we do, we lawyers at bar conventions.
  Mr. STEWART. Mostly Clarence, because that is what we had in
common.
  Senator SIMPSON. And that was in an informal way, you are
having a drink or just sitting, talking or just that was it?
  Mr. STEWART. The former.
  Senator SIMPSON. And she was very pleased about Clarence
Thomas?

   Mr. STEWART. Yes.

  Senator SIMPSON. Or indicated that?
  Mr. STEWART. Yes, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. Proud of him, was she proud of him?
  Mr. STEWART. There seems to be--there was such euphoria, I
would assume she was proud of him.
  Senator SIMPSON. YOU recall that and her voice and her demean-
or?
  Mr. STEWART. Laughing, smiling, warm.
  Senator SIMPSON. And saying, isn't it great about Clarence?
  Mr. STEWART. And how much he deserved it and that, essentially
in other tones that his hard work was paying off.
                                      581

  Mr. GRAYSON. Senator, if I could comment. That particular after-
noon was the first, and only time I have met Anita Hill and Mr.
Stewart and Ms. Hill really spent a few moments sort of reminis-
cing, they both worked together. So, sort of as an observer, I clearly
walked away from that meeting with the clear sense that Ms. Hill
shared the excitement about Judge Thomas' nomination, and was,
indeed, very supportive of it.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, and I am sure you found her testimony
here incredible.

  Mr. STEWART. Well, I think the reason we are here is incredible.
It doesn't surprise me that she would say that after making all of
these other allegations.

  Mr. GRAYSON. I would have to say on my end, I was a bit sur-
prised by it. I am not a student of people but I think to the extent
of watching the interaction and the discussion, I was indeed sur-
prised that the reaction was that she Carlton's enthusiasm for the
Judge and didn't want to--I don't remember her exact words--but
basically didn't want to ruin the mood of the little meeting that
took place. If that is, in fact, the case, my response would be that
she is very good because that was not clear in my perception of the
conversation that took place.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I thank you, very much for coming. And
I realize the serious reason that you are both here. And Mr. Dog-
gett, you have been dealing with the issue of what you saw of her
and what she said to you. I accept your summary of your affidavit
and your testimony as something you feel very strongly about. And
apparently if someone else does not that is truly a difference of
opinion.

  But to you, from your background and the way you describe it, I
understand your reaction and I believe it sounds like a natural re-
action to you. And you, Professor, thank you. You have been very
kind and very patient, and I would like to, if I were in law school, I
would have loved to be under your tutelage. I had some rugged ras-
cals that nearly drive me insane. I needed kindness, I needed kind-
ness and sweetness that you could have given to me.

  Senator LEAHY. They succeeded, Alan.
  Senator SIMPSON. And as for Leahy
  Senator LEAHY. Alan, I think you succeeded in that insanity
drive.
  Senator SIMPSON. YOU see what happened to Leahy and I, we
were in a hearing here one day and a courier came in and he said,
I am looking for a bald-headed guy with gray hair and glasses and
homely as hell and they said there are two of them, meaning
myself and Leahy.
  So I want to tell you if we all started to trot out what we did in
law school that ought to be a riot for the American public. I don't
know what Clarence Thomas did in law school, but I got a hunch
about it. And I believe Playboy came out while I was in law school
and I remember reading it for its articles and its editorial content.
So maybe we can just drop all reflections of what we did in law
school, what we watched. It is like doctors going to medical school
and calling their cadaver certain names, you know, and lawyers
doing all the black humor and the white humor and the ghastly
                                      582

humor and the grotesque and the drinking. Well, some of you may
have missed law school.

  Anyway I thank you for coming and
  Mr. STEWART. Senator, may I make one comment?
  Senator SIMFSON. Yes, sir.
  Senator THURMOND. I believe we have six minutes left on this
round.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Stewart had a comment.
  Senator LEAHY. One thing I do want to say in fairness to the pro-
fessor when I quoted from the New York Times Ms. Coleman's dis-
cussion of the x-rated films, the professor obviously had not seen
that article. I am not going to go back to it--but out of fairness to
him, could somebody from the staff just give that to the professor,
please?
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Stewart had a question.
  Mr. STEWART. I would just like to make one comment. I under-
stand the need for levity at this late hour but we are here for a
very, very serious matter. I think we need not lose sight of the fact
that separate and apart from Supreme Court confirmation, Clar-
ence Thomas is a sitting Federal Judge. This process has treated
him, in the last several days, like he is a foreman in a manufactur-
ing plant. We are dealing with claims that are that's a nullity at
law.
  Allegations come in 10 years, eight years, whatever, way beyond
the statute of limitation and I think we need to keep these things
in focus and in vogue when we are trying to make a decision about
who is telling what. We have two witnesses today for Ms. Hill who
were told two different things. Two were told that she was being
sexually harassed by her supervisor and two were told by her boss.
  We still don't know who they are. There were giant leaps in logic
to conclude that it was Clarence Thomas, but that is clearly not
the case. Many were asked the question of why we are here? We
are here because of a leak, not because of allegations, but because
of a leak. This is publicized because of a leak by the committee,
somebody on the committee.
  Clarence should not be the person who receives the brunt of this.
The very same rights that they accuse him of being against, they
took from him by leaking this information.
  That's all I have.
  Senator THURMOND. I have propounded the question to Professor
Kothe and I want to ask a second one and I just put one question
to you three gentlemen.
  Even though Anita Hill may believe what she said was true, in
your opinion, is there any merit in the charges made by her
against Clarence Thomas?
  Mr. GRAYSON. In my judgment, Senator, absolutely not.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Stewart?
  Mr. STEWART. In my judgment, Senator, absolutely not. Whether
they are lies or a product of fantasy, they should be dismissed.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Doggett?
  Mr. DOGGETT. Absolutely not. Clarence has been trying to do
some things that are extremely important for this country and for
any of the things that Anita said to have been true would have to-
tally made it impossible for him to be successful.
                                                   583

  Senator THURMOND. I believe, Dean Kothe, you have already an-
swered that question.

  Mr. KOTHE. Yes, I share with those views.
  The CHAIRMAN. Are we prepared to dismiss this panel.
  I am sorry, Senator Brown?
  Senator BROWN. Mr. Chairman, I have a few brief questions and
I will try to make them brief.
  Dean Kothe, your statement indicates that you saw Professor
Hill and Judge Thomas together on a number of occasions. Do you
remember how many occasions?
  Mr. KOTHE. I don't think I said a number of occasions. I said I
saw them in Washington, in my home, at the seminar, that was
about it.
  Senator BROWN. Could you characterize for us the nature of the
conversations between them, the way they acted toward each
other?
  Mr. KOTHE. Oh, it was most friendly. And, in fact, it was a
matter of joviality and a lot of laughter. You know, when you are
around Clarence Thomas in a relaxed mode, it is a time of joy. And
they would reminisce about certain situations that I was not privy
to in their experience in Washington and people that they would
talk about and they would talk and laugh. But it was always one of
pleasure.
  Senator BROWN. Did you detect any latent hostility in the rela-
tionship?
  Mr. KOTHE. Oh, no, you couldn't possibly have.
  Senator BROWN. Did you have any occasion in the time you knew
Clarence Thomas to see him off-guard, see him in relaxed situa-
tions?
  Mr. KOTHE. I tried to convey that. I have ridden with him in a
car for 3 hours down in Georgia, right in the swamps where he said
he was reared. I have been in offices with him. I have been on sev-
eral college campuses with him. I have been with faculty. I have
been with students. I have been in my home when we just stripped
down and getting ready for bed and in my library and just talking
for a couple of 3 hours.
   Senator BROWN. In those relaxed situations, did his vocabulary
include any of the words we have talked about in these hearings?
  Mr. KOTHE. I said this over and over again, I never ever heard
this man use a profane word. And like I am experienced with other
lawyers and other men and in a long discourse inevitably there is a
story somebody wants to tell. I never heard him tell a dirty story,
so to speak, or make an off-color remark.
   It just has to be that this man in the situations I have seen him
in would have to be the greatest actor in history to have disguised
this part of his nature that has been described here, this totally
unreal.
   Senator BROWN. Thank you.
   Mr. Doggett, I liked your reaction to something. In reading
through the transcript or reading through your testimony, your
statement, it has been some time since I have been in a situation
as an unmarried person, so I am not sure I am an expert on this at
this point, but the conversation that took place seemed to me could
be nothing more than someone flirting with you.
                                                  584

  Specific, the language, the conversation that you had with Pro-
fessor Hill at the time, Anita Hill at the time, that the words could
have been simply a way of flirting, not terribly serious in their con-
tent other than engaging. Would you comment on that?

  Mr. DOGGETT. I never perceived Anita to be flirting with me. I
perceived her to, as a man, be indicating that if I was interested in
getting to know her better that she would be interested.

  Senator BROWN. YOU thought the words were quite serious,
not

  Mr. DOGGETT. Sir, the comments that she made at the going
away party, to me, seemed to be very, very serious and that is how
I took them.

  Senator BROWN. Mr. Stewart, one thing, Professor Hill here indi-
cated that it was you who made the comment about Judge Thomas
being, at least my recollection is that Judge Thomas being so well
suited for the Court and wasn't it wonderful, and so on. And that
rather than her instigating those remarks, that she merely main-
tained a politeness during that period without formally objecting
but without her uttering those words.

  Are you quite certain that those words came from Professor Hill?
  Mr. STEWART. I am absolutely certain that not only did they
come from Ms. Hill but that they were surrounded by euphoria and
a continuation of kudos for Judge Thomas that lasted more than a
few minutes, that lasted almost over 30 minutes.
  The one thing Anita Hill and I had in common was Judge
Thomas. That was the subject of conversation. There were no nega-
tives, there were all positives and Mr. Grayson was there and he
had not met Ms. Hill before that very instant.
  Senator BROWN. Thank you.
  Mr. Chairman, I want to yield back but if I could just make a
note about the legal research that Senator Simpson did in law
school.
  We had a student in Colorado's law school, who did legal re-
search, because he took certain pictures out of the magazine and
appended them to his answer in torts and in two or three places he
received the highest grade in the class.
  I will yield back.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is time to end this panel. Thank you, very
much.
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I just have something to enter
into the record because my friend from Vermont talked about
Lavita Coleman in a rather negative way and I wish that he had
finished the sentence.
  She also said that neither she nor the other students were of-
fended by his amusing comments about pornographic material and
then she said, Ms. Coleman, now a lawyer in Washington contin-
ued:

  Indeed we would have been hypocrites to have been offended since very few of us
failed to attend one or more similar films that were shown on the Yale University
campus while we were in school.

  We did not even do that in Laramie. So that shows you how far
behind the curve we were, but then she went on to say and I end
                                         585

with this sentence, she called, this is the same woman about this
pornographic stuff, she called him, calling Clarence Thomas--

  Particularly sensitive and caring regarding the professional and personal con-
cerns of the women he knows and with whom he has worked and she seriously
doubted that he harassed Professor Hill.

  That is what is wrong with this process, right there.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, Mr. Chairman, as the Senator from Wyo-
ming knows, I prefaced that by saying that Ms. Coleman is a very
strong supporter of Clarence Thomas.

  And the only reason I brought it up and sent the whole newspa-
per is that it would be in context for Professor Kothe because he
had said that he just could not imagine under any circumstances
Judge Thomas going to an X-rated movie. That was the sole point
of it. But as I have also stated, Ms. Coleman is a strong supporter
and has written to me strongly in support of Judge Thomas.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, gentlemen. I truly appreciate your
willingness to be here as long as you have. There is only one conso-
lation you all have; there is a panel of nine people to follow you.
Just be thankful you're not among them.

  Thank you very much.
  Senator THURMOND. We thank you very much for your appear-
ance.
  The CHAIRMAN. Our next and last panel--it is almost inappropri-
ate to say welcome at this hour of the night, but I thank you all
very much for your willingness to be here, and particularly for
your willingness to be here at this late hour.

  As I indicated to you a moment ago, we are going to insist on the
3-minute rule that was announced beforehand, notwithstanding the
fact, I am told, there are two witnesses who were going to be here,
and for understandable and appropriate reasons, in light of the
hour, are not here.

   But let me ask the timekeeper, when the clock goes on, will the
yellow light go on, with 1 minute to go? So, when the amber light
goes on, you will have a minute. One of you asked me how will you
know when we are getting near 3 minutes, and Ms. Johnson indi-
cated to me that she was pregnant and due at any moment, and so
I strongly urge my colleagues not to have it that they be responsi-
ble for her being here any longer than is necessary. If I can't con-
vince you, on my behalf, to stop questioning, I hope that you will
have some consideration for Ms. Johnson, who has not asked for
any. I am using you as a ploy, Ms. Johnson, to try and see if we
can move this thing along.

   Now, our panel is made up of Patricia Johnson, Director of Labor
Relations at the EEOC; Pamela Talkin, former chief of staff for
Clarence Thomas at the EEOC; Janet Brown, former press secre-
tary for Senator John Danforth; Linda Jackson, research associate,
Department of Education; Nancy Altman, formerly of the Depart-
ment of Education; Anna Jenkins, a former secretary at the EEOC;
Lori Saxon, former assistant for congressional relations of the De-
partment of Education; and Connie Newman, Director, Office of
Personnel Management.

   Thank you all very much.
                                         586

  Now, I was asked by the panel, they apparently have decided
how they would like to proceed, and I would just yield to the panel
to proceed in 3-minute intervals seriatim, and we will finish.

  I beg your pardon, I am required to swear you all in, I am sorry.
  Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you,
God?

   Ms. JOHNSON. I do.
   Ms. TALKIN. I do.
   Ms. BROWN. I do.
   Ms. NEWMAN. I do.
   Ms. JACKSON. I do.
   Ms. ALTMAN. I do.
   Ms. JENKINS. I do.
   Ms. SAXON. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.

TESTIMONY OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF PATRICIA C. JOHNSON,
  DIRECTOR OF LABOR RELATIONS, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OP-
  PORTUNITY COMMISSION; LINDA M. JACKSON, SOCIAL SCI-
  ENCE RESEARCH ANALYST, EEOC; JANET H. BROWN, FORMER
  PRESS SECRETARY, SEN. JOHN DANFORTH; LORI SAXON,
  FORMER ASSISTANT FOR CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS, DE-
  PARTMENT OF EDUCATION; NANCY ALTMAN, FORMERLY WITH
  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION; PAMELA TALKIN, FORMER
  CHIEF OF STAFF, EEOC; ANNA JENKINS, FORMER SECRETARY,
  EEOC; AND CONSTANCE NEWMAN, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF PER-
  SONNEL MANAGEMENT

  Ms. JOHNSON. Good morning, Chairman Biden, Senator Thur-
mond and other members of this committee.

  I am Patricia Cornwell Johnson, and I currently work as the Di-
rector of Labor Relations of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. I received my bachelor's degree from the American
University here in Washington, and my law degree from the
Georgetown University Law Center. I am a member of the bar of
the District of Columbia, the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, as well as the majori-
ty of other U.S. Courts of Appeals.

  I received my labor relations training at the National Labor Re-
lations Boards. I moved from there to corporate America, then to a
major transit authority, before going to the EEOC. I work in an
area that is dominated by men and I have never met a man who
treated me with more dignity and respect, who was more cordial
and professional than was Judge Clarence Thomas.

  Shortly after joining the Commission--and I must apologize to
my mother for making this statement on worldwide TV, and I am
grateful that she is asleep--then Chairman Thomas became aware
that I used profanity in some exuberant exchanges with union offi-
cials. Chairman Thomas made it clear to me that that was unac-
ceptable conduct which would not be tolerated. I was shocked be-
cause up until that time, such language had indeed been accepta-
ble, almost expected--it made me "one of the boys." Chairman
Thomas insisted that his managers conducts themselves in a
                                             587

manner that was above reproach and he held himself to that same
high standard.

  I had occasion to meet with Chairman Thomas alone to discuss
labor relations and strategies. He was always professional. As a
labor attorney with approximately 15 years of experience, I have
drafted policy statements concerning sexual harassment, I have
trained managers concerning what constitutes harassment, how to
deal with such allegations.

  Furthermore, with a previous employer, I was a victim of sexual
harassment. It was the most degrading and humiliating experience
of my professional career. I confided in friends and family concern-
ing the best manner to confront it. I did confront it and I eventual-
ly left that position. But I must tell you that, during the time I had
to continue to work with the perpetrator, I avoided contact, espe-
cially one-on-one contact with him, and since leaving that position
I have never had any further contact with that man.

  I do not believe these allegations that have been leveled against
Judge Thomas. Moreover based on my professional experience, as
well as my personal experience, I do not believe that a woman who
has been victimized by the outrageously lewd, vile and vulgar be-
havior that has been described here would want to have, let alone
maintain, any kind of relationship with a man that victimized her.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, and thank you for staying
within the time.

  Whoever is next please move forward.

                    TESTIMONY OF LINDA M. JACKSON

  Ms. JACKSON. Chairman Biden, Senator Thurmond and members
of the committee: I would like to correct the record. I am employed
as a social science research analyst at the EEOC.

  When I first met Clarence Thomas in 1981, he was Assistant Sec-
retary for Civil Rights in the Department of Education. My work
required him to contact his office to secure certain data and infor-
mation. After finding out the type of information I needed, Clar-
ence Thomas indicated that any followup contact I had with his
office should be through his aide, Anita Hill. He described her as
someone who would help me navigate and put me in touch with
the right people at OCR. He spoke in terms any mentor would use,
explaining she was very bright and knowledgeable about the work-
ings of OCR.

  During that time, Anita and I began to have lunch and discuss
both work and personal things. She referred to Clarence Thomas
with admiration, and never once mentioned anything was going
wrong at work. She seemed excited to be a special assistant to a
very visible public official. I never saw any strained relations be-
tween them, whenever I saw them together in the workplace or at
a meeting. She would generally look at him with a smile on her
face and have the kind of positive demeanor that would suggest she
respected and liked him as a person.

  We often discussed the social scene in Washington. In the con-
text of such discussions, it seems that she would have mentioned
something, if she were having a problem at the office, even if she
did not name a specific person. Subsequent discussions I had with
                                             588

Anita also yielded no mention of anything improper on the part of
Clarence Thomas.

  It is difficult for me to believe that Anita would follow her super-
visor to another agency, if he was subjecting her to the things she
has alleged. I remember Anita Hill as an intelligent woman and
one who would have found some way to retain her job at the de-
partment or find another in either the public or private sector, if
she were unhappy.

  After meeting Clarence Thomas through my job, I ran into him
in the hallway of my apartment building and found we lived in the
same place. We began to have numerous conversations about work,
politics and personal issues. We became very good friends in the
process.

  I believe I know the basic nature of this man better than most
people in this room. I believe, unequivocally, Clarence Thomas'
denial of these allegations. This is a very honorable man who has
the highest respect for women. He always treated me with utmost
respect and was more sensitive to women than most men I know.
He never engaged me in discussions of any kind that could be con-
sidered demeaning to women.

  He was often troubled by those women he knew, both profession-
ally and women, who were having difficulties with personal prob-
lems, particularly treatment by male friends, coworkers or spouses.
He and I had numerous conversations about abuse of women, phys-
ically, emotionally and verbally. You see, Senators, he helped me
pick up the pieces of my own crushed spirit, after I left an abusive
marriage.

  His sensitivity and honor, his respect for women, his helping atti-
tude toward all people in need, makes these allegations even more
ludicrous.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Who is next?

                     TESTIMONY OF JANET H. BROWN

  Ms. BROWN. My name is Janet Brown, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator HATCH. Would you pull your microphone over, Ms.
Brown?
  Ms. BROWN. Yes, I will.
  Senator HATCH. I would love to hear you.
  Ms. BROWN. This will be very brief.
  I have known Clarence Thomas very well for 12 years. We
worked for 2 years very closely here in the Senate on Senator Dan-
forth's staff. He is a man of the highest principle, honesty, integri-
ty and honor in all of his personal and professional actions.
  A number of years ago, I was sexually harassed in the work-
place. It was a demeaning, humiliating, sad and revolting experi-
ence. There was an intensive and lengthy internal investigation of
his case, which is the route that I chose to pursue. Let me assure
you that the last thing I would ever have done is follow the man
who did this to a new job, call him on the phone or voluntarily
share the same air space ever again.
  Other than my immediate family, the one person who is the
most outraged, compassionate, caring and sensitive to me was Clar-
                                         589

ence Thomas. He helped me work through the pain and talk
through the options. No one who has been through it can talk
about sexual harassment dispassionately. No one who takes it seri-
ously would do it.

  I don't subscribe to the belief that men, because they are men,
don't understand sexual harassment. My husband, my father and
my brother understand it. Clarence Thomas understands it. And
because he understands it, he wouldn't do it.

  Senator KENNEDY [presiding], Ms. Saxon?

                        TESTIMONY OF LORI SAXON

  Ms. SAXON. I worked at the Department of Education in the
Office for Civil Rights from September 1981 until September 1982. I
was 24 years old at the time. I was the confidential assistant to
Clarence Thomas. In that capacity, I handled congressional rela-
tions and public affairs. My office was just down the hall from
Anita Hill's during her tenure at the Department of Education.

  I never saw any harassment go on in the office. The office was
run very professionally. Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill were
always very cordial and friendly in their relations. There was
never any evidence of any harassment toward any of the female
employees. I dealt with Anita Hill on a daily basis in performing
my duties. She was happy in her position and she liked working for
Clarence Thomas.

  Anita Hill never indicated to me that he was harassing her. Clar-
ence Thomas generally left the door of his office open, so if he had
any meeting with Hill or any other employees, they were in view.
He operated with an open-door policy with every member of the
staff, regardless of gender. I never saw him meet in private with a
female employee, without someone else present. Unless it was a
group meeting and there were many staffers present, the door
would be open and his secretary would be right outside the door.

  Anita Hill was the only special assistant who accompanied Clar-
ence Thomas to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
upon his appointment in August of 1982. Anita told me that she
was very excited about the opportunity to work for the Chairman
of the EEOC. She related to me that she was pleased that Clarence
was taking her with him.

  I believe Anita Hill's statements that she felt pressures to accom-
pany Clarence Thomas to EEOC, because of fears of losing her job,
are simply untrue. I and the rest of the senior staff of the Office for
Civil Rights found other positions within a few months. That is
how the process of being a political appointee worked.

  I was Clarence Thomas' confidential assistant for a year. My job
required that I meet with him at least once a day. He never made
an inappropriate advance, uttered an off-color remarks, or used
coarse language in my presence. I was younger and more politically
active than Anita Hill. I introduced him to my friends in Washing-
ton, the political community and very social settings. I was the
first person to bring and introduce him to a luncheon with Thomas
Sowell and others at the Capitol Hill Club. During this entire
period, he never made any inappropriate actions toward me or any
other female with whom I saw him.
                                         590

  I understand what women in this country go through in the area
of sexual harassment. There is no place for sexual harassment in
the workplace. I experienced perhaps a different kind of harass-
ment, by being a victim of a violent crime. I know what it is to
have one's face violated. I know what it feels like to feel helpless
and humiliated.

  Let me assure you in no uncertain terms that no harassment
took place in the workplace at the Office for Civil Rights.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  Ms. Altman.

                  TESTIMONY OF PATRICIA C. ALTMAN

  Ms. ALTMAN. My name is Nancy Altman. I consider myself a
feminist. I am prochoice. I care deeply about women's issues. In ad-
dition to working with Clarence Thomas at the Department of Edu-
cation, I shared an office with him for 2 years in this building. Our
desks were a few feet apart. Because we worked in such close quar-
ters, I could hear virtually every conversation for 2 years that Clar-
ence Thomas had. Not once in those 2 years did I ever hear Clar-
ence Thomas make a sexist or offensive comment, not once.

  I have myself been the victim of an improper, unwanted sexual
advance by a supervisor. Gentlemen, when sexual harassment
occurs, other women in the workplace know about it. The members
of the committee seem to believe that when offensive behavior
occurs in a private room, there can be no witnesses. This is wrong.

  Sexual harassment occurs in an office in the middle of the work-
day. The victim is in a public place. The first person she sees im-
mediately after the incident is usually the harasser's secretary. Co-
workers, especially women, will notice an upset expression, a jit-
tery manner, a teary or a distracted air, especially if the abusive
behavior is occurring over and over and over again.

  Further, the women I know who have been victimized always
shared the experience with a female coworker they could trust.
They do this to validate their own experience, to obtain advice
about options that they may pursue, to find out if others have been
similarly abused, and to receive comfort. Friends outside the work-
place make good comforters, but cannot meet the other needs.

  It is not credible that Clarence Thomas could have engage in the
kinds of behavior that Anita Hill alleges, without any of the
women who he worked closest with--dozens of us, we could spend
days having women come up, his secretaries, his chief of staff, his
other assistants, his colleagues--without any of us having sensed,
seen or heard something.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  Ms. Jenkins.

                       TESTIMONY OF ANNA JENKINS

  Ms. JENKINS. Chairman Biden, Senator Thurmond and other
members of the committee, my name is Anna Jenkins, and I reside
in Silver Spring, MD. I am a staff assistant in the Office of Policy
Development at the White House. I was not asked by the White
House to give a statement. I went to them and asked if it was okay
for me to give a statement.
                                         591

  I have been a Federal employee since December 1965 and worked
for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from May
1970 to September 1989, with intermittent details to the White
House under the Carter and Reagan administrations.

  I was employed as a secretary in the EEOC's Office of the Chair-
man in the Executive Secretariat as a staff specialist. During my
tenure with the Office of the Chairman, I served under five chair-
persons, William Brown, John Powell, Lowell Perry, Eleanor
Holmes Norton, and Clarence Thomas. In September 1989, I left
the EEOC to join the Bush administration, Office of Policy Develop-
ment.

  When President Reagan appointed Clarence Thomas as Chair-
man of the EEOC, I was the only employee left in the Chairman's
office from the previous administration. Upon Judge Thomas' ar-
rival at the agency, I worked directly for him as his secretary until
his confidential assistant Diane Holt and legal assistant Anita Hill
came onboard. He brought them from the Department of Educa-
tion.

  Prior to Anita Hill joining the staff, she appeared quite anxious
to work for the EEOC. In fact, she called Judge Thomas several
times to inquire about the status of her appointment.

  I recall the first day Ms. Hill reported to work at EEOC. She was
very pleased and excited about being able to select an office with a
big picture window overlooking the Watergate Hotel and the Poto-
mac River.

  I had daily contact with Anita Hill and Judge Thomas. We
shared a suite of offices consisting of a reception area, conference
room, kitchen, and five offices. Judge Thomas' conduct around me,
Anita Hill, and other staffers was always proper and professional. I
have never witnessed Judge Thomas say anything or do anything
that could be construed as sexual harassment. I never witnessed
him making sexual advances toward any female, nor have I wit-
nessed him engaging in sexually oriented conversations with
women.

  I have witnessed Judge Thomas and Anita Hill interact in the
office. At no time did the relationship appear strained nor Anita
appear uncomfortable with the relationship.

  I understand that at Anita's press conference she denied know-
ing Phyliss Berry. I was confused by her denial, since Phyliss Berry
often visited the office while Anita worked there. I have seen them
exchange greetings.

  In closing, I wish to emphasize that I have the highest regard
and respect for Judge Thomas. In light of my experience with him
and the way I have seen him conduct himself around other fe-
males, I find this harassment allegation unbelievable.

  Senator KENNEDY. All right.
  Ms. Newman.

                  TESTIMONY OF CONSTANCE NEWMAN

  Ms. NEWMAN. Constance Newman. I appreciate the opportunity
to appear before you.

   I am both saddened and optimistic as a result of these proceed-
ings. I am saddened because of the way in which the raw nerves of
                                      592
America have been touched, the raw nerves of racism and sexism,
leading to too much mistrust between too many of us. Many of
these feelings are just below the surface of this great Nation, and
we are all victims of it. We are all hurt in some way by the side of
America that allows bigotry and unfairness to exist. We must come
to terms with what is unfair in this basically fair Nation.

  I am saddened for my friend, Judge Clarence Thomas, and his
family. All who are in public life must sympathize with their
plight.

  I am saddened for Professor Anita Hill. Her life will never be the
same. I don't know her, but I must believe that she must be a tal-
ented and conscientious woman, or she would not have completed
the tough educational requirements of Yale Law School or be a
tenured professor at a major law school. She must be a concerned
black woman, or she would not have chosen to work in civil rights.

  What was her motivation? Frankly, I do not know. I do not even
want to try to speculate.

  The waters are muddy around sexual harassment now, but I am
optimistic. I am optimistic because I believe that as a result of
these proceedings, you will know what I know about Judge
Thomas. He is competent, he has integrity, he has true grit, and I
do believe that these proceedings will make him even stronger and
even more sensitive.

  I have known him for 10 years. That does not mean that we have
not disagreed. We have. We have argued. Through the years he has
changed his mind some; I have changed mine a little. But I have
not changed my view about the basic decency and integrity of this
man. I know him and have worked with him. I have worked in the
halls of EEOC. Not once did I hear a hint of improper conduct. I
would have heard. I heard of disagreements, but not improper con-
duct.

  Finally, I am optimistic that positive change will take place as a
result of these proceedings. America has seen and understood some
of the delicate issues that we must face and will appreciate the gov-
ernmental process, painful though it may be.

                           STATEMENT OF CONSTANCE BERRY NEWMAN
                         BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

                                        UNITED STATES SENATE
                                           OCTOBER 13, 1991

MR. CHAIRMAN, SENATOR THURMOND AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE: I
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU IN SUPPORT OF THE
CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

I AM BOTH SADDENED AND OPTIMISTIC AS A RESULT OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.
I AM SADDENED BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE RAW NERVES OF AMERICA
HAVE BEEN TOUCHED. THE RAW NERVES OF WHICH I SPEAK ARE SEXISM,
RACISM, <gWW¥WiLllJillUlP?WWl*W#^^llgqg53--^BBMBlgMH--ft- LEADING
TO MISTRUST BETWEEN TOO MANY OF US. MR. CHAIRMAN, MANY OF THESE
THE FEELINGS MOVE JUST BELOW THE SURFACE OF THIS GREAT NATION. WE
ARE ALL VICTIMS . . . WE ARE ALL HURT IN SOME WAY BY THE SIDE OF
AMERICA THAT ALLOWS BIGOTRY AND UNFAIRNESS TO EXIST. WE MUST COME
TO TERMS WITH WHAT IS UNFAIR IN THIS BASICALLY FAIR NATION OR WE
WILL BE DESTROYED.

I AM SADDENED FOR MY FRIEND, JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS AND HIS FAMILY.
ALL WHO ARE IN PUBLIC LIFE MUST SYMPATHIZE WITH THEIR PLIGHT. ALL
WHO CHOOSE PUBLIC SERVICE AS A PROFESSION UNDERSTAND THAT THE
PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHETHER WE ARE COMPETENT. THE PUBLIC HAS
A RIGHT TO DEMAND THAT WE HAVE INTEGRITY AND THAT WE DO NOTHING TO
BRING SHAME TO THE OFFICES IN WHICH WE SERVE. THE PUBLIC HAS A
RIGHT TO DEMAND THAT WE BE FAIR TO ALL . . . THAT WE NOT ENGAGE
                                     594

                                                                                                                  2
IN BEHAVIOR SUCH AS SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION OF ANY
KIND. IN FACT, THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT PUBLIC
SERVANTS WILL USE ALL OF THEIR RESOURCES TO INSURE THAT THE
DIVERSITY OF THE NATION IS REPRESENTED AT ALL LEVELS IN THE PUBLIC
SERVICE AND THAT THE POLICIES OF THE NATION WILL RESULT ON ALL
SHARING IN THE NATION'S GREATNESS. THOSE WHO CHOOSE PUBLIC SERVICE
EXPECT THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF OUR PRIVACY MUST BE RELINQUISHED
WHEN WE TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE. BUT THE PUBLIC DOES NOT HAVE THE
RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT WE ARE STRIPPED OF ALL OF OUR RIGHT TO
PRIVACY. THE PUBLIC DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT PUBLIC
SERVANTS RELINQUISH THE GUARANTIES THAT UNDERLIE THE RIGHT TO
PRIVACY SUCH AS THOSE RELATING TO FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND RELIGION
AND PROTECTION AGAINST SELF-INCRIMINATION. THE DAY THAT IS EXPECTED
OF PUBLIC SERVANTS IS THE DAY THAT THE NATION WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
ATTRACT THE BEST TO PUBLIC SERVICE.

I AM SADDENED FOR PROFESSOR ANITA HILL. HER LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE
SAME. I DO NOT KNOW HER BUT I MUST BELIEVE THAT SHE MUST BE A
TALENTED AND CONSCIENTIOUS WOMAN OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE COMPLETED
THE TOUGH EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF A YALE LAW SCHOOL OR BE A
TENURED PROFESSOR OF A MAJOR LAW SCHOOL. SHE MUST BE A CONCERNED
BLACK WOMAN OR SHE WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN TO WORK IN CIVIL RIGHTS AT
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
COMMISSION. WHAT THEN WAS HER MOTIVATION. FRANKLY, I DO NOT KNOW
AND WILL NOT EVEN TRY TO SPECULATE. I DO BELIEVE THAT PROFESSOR
HILL WAS CAUGHT IN A WHIRLWIND NOT OF HER MAKING AND WAS SWEPT ONTO

                                                                                                             3
THE PUBLIC STAGE WHERE THE THIRTY AND SIXTY SECOND SOUND BITES
CONTROL. SHE WAS THEN IN POSITION WHERE SHE HAD TO MOVE FORWARD .
. . SHE COULD NOT TURN BACK THE CLOCK. HOW THE POWER TO TURN BACK
THE CLOCK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO US ALL ON OCCASION.

I AM SADDENED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE WATERS ARE MUDDIER AROUND
THE IMMORAL AND ILLEGAL PRACTICE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. EVEN IN
THIS DAY OF ENLIGHTENMENT IN EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES, WOMEN IN THE
WORKPLACE CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM PRACTICES OF INTIMIDATION. EVEN
TODAY, THERE ARE MALE MANAGERS AND EXECUTIVES IN THE WORKPLACE WHO
BELIEVE THAT THEIR ONLY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO REFRAIN FROM SEXUAL
HARASSMENT THEMSELVES. THEY'DO NOT ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
INSURING THAT ALL IN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS UNDERSTAND THAT SEXUAL
HARASSMENT WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. I AM SADDENED BECAUSE LITTLE OF
THE DISCUSSION OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT I HAVE HEARD SO FAR
CONSIDERS THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED. I KNOW THAT IS NOT THE INTENT
OF THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT . . . OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN A PART. THE
WOMEN'S MOVEMENT IS SEEKING EQUALITY AND FAIRNESS, BUT NOT BY THE
IMPOSITION OF AN UNFAIRNESS AGAINST THE ACCUSED.

MR. CHAIRMAN, I AM ALSO OPTIMISTIC AS A RESULT OF THE PROCEEDINGS.
I BELIEVE THAT AS A RESULT OF THE HEARINGS, JUDGE THOMAS WILL BE
CONFIRMED BECAUSE OTHERS WILL KNOW WHAT I KNOW - HE HAS THE
COMPETENCE, THE INTEGRITY, THE "TRUE GRIT," AND THE SENSE OF
FAIRNESS THAT SHOULD BE PRESENT IN A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT.
I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS PROCESS HAS MADE HIM AN EVEN BETTER

NOMINEE FOR THE SUPREME COURT THAN HE WAS BEFORE THIS PROCESS. I
KNOW THAT HE WOULD PROBABLY NOT AGREE WITH ME. BUT LET ME EXPLAIN.
THIS DIFFICULT PROCESS WILL INSURE THAT HE WILL UNDERSTAND MORE
THAN EVER BEFORE THE STRUGGLES THAT RESULT IN THE CASES THAT COME
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. HE WILL BE PREPARED MORE THAN EVER
BEFORE TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE TYPES OF CONFLICT THAT BRING CASES
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. HE WILL ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS FROM THE
POINT OF VIEW OF EACH SIDE OF EVERY ISSUE. HE WILL NOT
AUTOMATICALLY ACCEPT THE WORD OF ANY PARTY BEFORE THE SUPREME
COURT. THAT I BELIEVE.

I HAVE KNOWN CLARENCE THOMAS VERY WELL FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS. HE
IS MY FRIEND. THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE HAVE NOT DISAGREED. THAT
DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE HAVE NOT ARGUED - WE HAVE. THROUGH THE YEARS
HE HAS CHANGED HIS VIEWS SOME AND I HAVE CHANGED MY VIEWS SOME. BUT
I HAVE NOT CHANGED MY VIEWS ABOUT THE BASIC DECENCY AND INTEGRITY

OF THIS MAN. T^&mmBB^jmmmmi&iHj/tf^&b^6ttBMm***fWt&&^

OTHER STAFF PERSONS. NOT ONCE DID I HEAR A HINT OF IMPROPER
CONDUCT ON THE PART OF CLARENCE THOMAS. I WOULD HEAR FROM TIME TO
TIME, THAT THERE WAS DISAGREEMENT WITH HIS VOTES ON SOME OF THE
ISSUES BEFORE THE COMMISSION. BUT THAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are a great optimist, Ms. Newman, but I am
so delighted to hear somebody say that.

  Ms. Talkin.

                     TESTIMONY OF PAMELA TALKIN

  Ms. TALKIN. AS chief of staff of the EEOC for 3 years, I reported
directly to then-Chairman Thomas. We worked very closely. We
traveled together frequently, and we spent innumerable hours
alone together and as many hours in the company of other women.

  Judge Thomas was adamant that the women in the agency be
treated with dignity and respect, and his own behavior towards
women was scrupulous. There was never a hint of impropriety, and
I mean a hint; never a gesture, never a look, never a word, never
body language, none of the things that we women have a sixth
sense about and that very few men have any sense about. [Laugh-
ter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. [Laughter.]
  Ms. TALKIN. Needless to say, there was nothing explicit or coarse
in his language. Judge Thomas viewed such conduct, and I quote,
as "repugnant," "reprehensible," "deplorable," and "despicable."
He would not tolerate it.
  I have been in the work force for over 30 years. During that time
I have endured varying degrees of sexual harassment, sometimes
serious, sometimes subtle. I view myself as very alert to this; some
of my men friends say, overly sensitive. It is in that context that I
tell you that I have never met a man as sensitive. He has a femi-
nist's understanding of sexual politics. He is a man who loathes
locker room talk.

  This is a man who, when I had momentary lapses of language,
looked discomfited and never responded in kind.

  This is a man who looked at his shoes when other men were
craning their necks to look at a woman.

  This is a man who spent countless hours talking to me about his
efforts to raise his adolescent son to be a decent, dignified, reverent
man of women, and urging his son to treat his teenage female com-
panions with dignity and respect despite his raging hormones.

  This is a man who understood the inherent imbalance of power
in the work place between men and women, and frowned upon
even consensual romantic relationships because he did not want
one woman in the agency to even mistakenly believe that her dig-
nity had been compromised.

  I have spent over 18 years enforcing laws against employment
discrimination, and I can tell you that I have never worked in a
work environment where any individual, man or woman, was more
committed to establishing a work place free from discrimination
and harassment. It is the saddest of ironies to me that the behavior
that Judge Thomas found most abhorrent is the behavior that he is
now being accused of.

  [The prepared statement of Ms. Talkin follows:]
                                    599

                             Testimony of Pamela Talkin

          As Chief of Staff of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission from 1986 - 1989, I reported directly to
then-Chairman Clarence Thomas. We worked very closely,
traveled together frequently and spent innumerable hours
together, both alone and in the company of employees. In
all that time, Judge Thomas never acted with less than the
utmost professionalism and courtesy toward me and other
women.

          It was Judge Thomas' unequivocal, and oft-repeated,
policy that sexual harassment, even in its most subtle
forms, would not be tolerated. And it was not. If Clarence
Thomas was most intolerant of any behavior, it was the very
behavior of which he is now being accused.

           Without exaggeration, I would say we discussed the
 issue at least 100 times. Judge Thomas viewed such
 inappropriate behavior, even if it did not rise to the level
 of unlawful conduct, as (and I quote) "reprehensible11,
 "despicable", "repugnant", and "disgusting". And these were
 the more charitable terms he used.

           Judge Thomas was adamant in demanding that all female
 employees be treated with dignity and respect. He was
                                     600

                                                 -2-

always scrupulous in his approach to women and his behavior
was absolutely above reproach. In the years I worked with
and observed him, he invariably conducted all his
interactions with women employees in a highly appropriate
manner, with never even a hint of impropriety.

          As someone who has endured varying degrees of
offensive behavior from men in the workplace, I view myself
as reasonably alert to such misconduct. It is in this
context that I say that I have never known any other man who
was as sensitive to and careful about the subtle issues and
potential problems arising from relationships between men
 and women in the workplace. This was a man who had a
 feminist's understanding of "sexual politics".

           Judge Thomas was acutely aware that sexual harassment
 could occur even where a woman was not imposed upon
 physically or did not have her livelihood affected or
 threatened. Before it became the common view, Judge Thomas
 clearly understood and firmly believed that subjecting women
 to unwelcome attentions or inappropriate remarks also
 constituted sexual harassment. Early on, he foresaw and
 argued that conduct which creates a hostile working
 environment for women constituted a violation of Title VII
  of the Civil Rights Act. As we all know, that position was
                                     601

                                                 -3-
later adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of
Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson.

          Judge Thomas was rigorous in ensuring high standards
of conduct from all male employees of the Agency,
particularly those men in supervisory and management
positions. I witnessed his outrage and know that he took
immediate action when inappropriate conduct occurred. He
would not and did not condone even casual, inadvertent, or
potential mistreatment of female employees.

           Not only were male supervisors or managers forbidden
 to engage in any unlawful conduct, but Judge Thomas made it
 clear to them that the inherent imbalance of power between
 supervisors and employees required that persons in authority
 not act in anv manner that could be even unintentionally
 coercive or make employees believe, even mistakenly, that
 their dignity was being compromised or that unfair advantage
 had been taken of them. To that end, Judge Thomas did not
 permit even consensual relationships between male
 supervisors and female subordinates.

            Judge Thomas is a man of the highest integrity and
  character. In my 24 years of public service, over 18 of
  which have been spent enforcing laws against discrimination

in employment, I have never encountered any other individual
who was more committed to the establishment of a work
environment free from all forms of discrimination and
harassment.

  The CHAIRMAN. A very powerful statement, Ms. Talkin.
  I apologize for being out of the room while some of you were tes-
tifying. I don't believe there are any questions from the panel.
Your statements speak for themselves.
  Before I dismiss this panel, though, I have an announcement to
make, and that is that having spoken with Senator Danforth, and
Senator Danforth representing, and that is enough for all of us,
that he has spoken with Clarence Thomas--no, has not?
  Senator DANFORTH. Mr. Chairman, I have not. If you would like
me to call him on this matter, I will
  The CHAIRMAN. I think before I
  Senator DANFORTH [continuing]. But I can absolutely guarantee
what the answer will be.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I think it may be useful to call.
  Senator DANFORTH. All right.
  The CHAIRMAN. And I think that out of an excess of caution, be-
cause this is of such consequence, not that I doubt your judgment
on this, but it is--I will withhold. I will excuse the panel, but we
will just recess in place for a minute here, and I ask everyone to
wait just a minute because I will have an announcement, depend-
ing on the phone call, about tomorrow's proceedings that will--
today's proceedings. Yes, I am sorry, it is 2 o'clock.
  Senator HATCH. YOU may want to wait, as well. You may just
want to wait.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, this 2 o'clock is better than 2 o'clock 2
nights ago. Then I was sitting in a dentist's chair, so it is getting
better. At least we are in good company.
  Let me suggest once again that Judge Thomas is indeed fortu-
nate to have such friends and supporters as all of you women that
are here, and again I thank you, truly thank you, for being here,
and particularly at the hour. This is an unusual time to be sum-
moned to the committee--now you weren't summoned--to come to
the committee, to testify anywhere in the world, let alone here in
this old magnificent room. So thank you all, and you all are dis-
missed.
  Senator THURMOND. If I may say a word?
  The CHAIRMAN. I'm sorry. I beg your pardon. Senator Thurmond
would like to say a word.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman.
  On behalf of the Republican Senators I wish to commend you for
your appearance and for the excellent statements you have made.
And because you have made such outstanding statements, we have
no questions on this side of the aisle.
  The CHAIRMAN. I won't characterize why anybody has no ques-
tions, but nonetheless, seriously, thank you all very, very much for
being here.
  Excuse me. Yes?
  Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman, I just said the Chairman
made a valiant effort to justify to the American people why we got
a salary increase. We have been here until 2 o'clock.
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I learned a long time ago not to attempt to
ever justify anything like that, and I am certainly not going to-
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, if I may just, not a question,
but it is very helpful to hear from women like we have heard over
                                               604

these days, who have been victims of sexual harassment, which is a
very important thing for us. We hear it, we know it, we have hear-
ings, but to hear it from you and especially to hear your reaction to
it, and what you do and what your network is, and what it is in the
work place, and how that really works in real life, is very, very
helpful and very, very informative for me. And I have a very en-
lightened woman that I have been living with for 37 years, but she
has enlightened me a great deal more these last days.

  So thank you again. Powerful statements.
  Senator KENNEDY. I believe you are excused. Thank you. [Laugh-
ter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen and ladies and everyone here, and
members of the press who have been also equally as patient, both
Judge Thomas and Professor Hill have decided that they do not
wish to appear tomorrow.
  Now there is one caveat. Senator Danforth has represented and
indicated, with good reason, that having talked with Judge Thomas
earlier, that if Ms. Hill didn't come back, he would not come back,
and vice versa. But we formally haven't spoken to him this
evening, so that if there were any change it would be 6 o'clock in
the morning. There is no way to physically reach him. There is a
recording on.
  So, at any rate, I see no reasonable probability that anyone will
change their mind. Based on that, this entire proceeding is ended.
  [Whereupon, at 2:03 a.m., October 14, 1991, the committee was
adjourned.]

QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR BIDEN

1. After reviewing the transcript of your testimony, I am
uncertain as to whether you unambiguously believe that single
individuals have a fundamental liberty right which includes a
right of privacy on matters of procreation. For example, .on
Thursday, September 12, 1991, at page 50 of the transcript, you
and I had the following exchange:

         "The Chairman. ... Now, you said that the privacy right of
married couples is fundamental, and as I understand it now, you
told me -- correct me if I am wrong -- that the privacy right of
an individual on procreation is fundamental. Is that right?

         Judge Thomas. I think that is consistent with what I said
and I think consistent with what the Court --held in Eisenstadt v.
Baird."

         Shortly thereafter -- on the same day -- you had the
following response to a question asked by Senator Kennedy, at
page 82 of the transcript:

         "Judge Thomas. Senator, without commenting on Roe v. Wade,
I think I have indicated here today and yesterday that there is a
privacy interest in the Constitution, in the liberty component of
the Due Process Clause, and that marital privacy is a fundamental
right, and marital privacy then can only be impinged on or only
be regulated if there is a compelling State interest. ..."

         Because you spoke only about the marital right of privacy
with Senator Kennedy, I returned to the issue the next day, at
page 119-20 of the transcript.

         "The Chairman. Judge, very simply, if you can, yes or no:
Do you believe that the Liberty Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the Constitution provides a fundamental right to
privacy for individuals in the area of procreation, including
contraception?

        Judge Thomas. Senator, I think I answered earlier yes,
based upon the precedent of Eisenstadt v. Baird.

        The Chairman. Well, you know, what folks are going to say
is that Eisenstadt v. Baird was an equal protection case. All
right? That is not the question I am asking you. Let me make
sure and say it one more time. Do you believe the Liberty Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution provides a
fundamental right to privacy for individuals in the area of
procreation, including contraception?
                                  607

        Judge Thomas. I think I have answered that, Senator.

        The Chairman. Yes or no?

        Judge Thomas. Yes/ and --

        Judge Thomas. I have expressed on what I base that, and I
would leave it at that."

        To clarify the statements you made during the hearing
concerning the right of privacy, I ask you to answer the
following question:

        Do you believe that the due process component of the
        Fourteenth Amendment's liberty clause--- independent of the
        equal protection clause or the case of Eisenstadt v. Baird
         -- provides a fundamental right of privacy for individuals,
        both married or single, that includes a fundamental right of
        privacy with respect to procreation and contraception?

2. With respect to the First Amendment's protection of free
speech, and specifically the protections accorded to conduct that
is part speech and part action, please answer the following
series of questions:

(a) While on the Court of Appeals, you joined the opinion of
        Judge Sentelle in Community for Creative Non-Violence
         ("CCNV") v. Luian, in which the court upheld the National
        Park Service's denial of a request by CCNV to include its
        statue in the Christmas pageant of peace.

        The Park Service had rejected the statue because it was not
        a "traditional" Christmas symbol. The Court of Appeals
        upheld this decision because it was made "without regard to
         [CCNV's] message" and thus the First Amendment was not
        implicated.

        Doesn't a decision that a statue is not a "traditional"
        Christmas symbol involve its content and thereby implicate
        the First Amendment?

(b) Assume animal rights activists wanted to stage a silent sit-
        in on the public sidewalks in front of a research clinic at
        which experiments involving animals were performed. A city
        ordinance prohibited any person from sitting on the
        sidewalks in commercial areas because such activity might
        obstruct the flow of pedestrian traffic.
                                   608

        Does the First Amendment protect this conduct?

        Would you permit the city to apply its ordinance to the
        protestors, or would you require the city to permit the sit-
        in, albeit with certain requirements -- perhaps ensuring a
        lane was kept clear for passing pedestrians?

3. This past term, the Supreme Court decided Rust v. Sullivan,
        which involved a challenge to regulations adopted by the
        Secretary of Health and Human Services that prohibited
        women's health clinics which receive federal funds from
        counseling patients about abortion, or from referring a
        patient elsewhere for such information, even if the patient
        asked the doctor for such information.

        In fact, if asked, doctors in such clinics were instructed
        to inform patients that the clinic did not think abortion
        was an appropriate method of family planning.

        Chief Justice Rehnquist, in upholding the regulations,
        concluded that:

        "the government can, without violating the constitution,
        selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities
        it believes to be in the public interest, without at the
        same time funding an alternate program which seeks to deal
        with the problem in another way. In so doing, the
        government has not discriminated on the basis of viewpoint;
        it has merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion
        of another."
        Rust v. Sullivan, 111 S.Ct. 1772 (1991).

        Without addressing the issue of reproductive freedom, do you
        believe that the First Amendment does or does not protect
        the conduct -- doctors communicating with their patients --
        at issue in Rust?

accompanied your letter of September 20, 1991. Pursuant to the
agreement between Jeff Peck of your staff, and John Mackey at the
Department of Justice, I will provide answers to Senator Levin's
written questions as soon as possible.

1. As I sought to make clear in my testimony, I believe that
Eisenstadt was correct on both the privacy and equal protection
rationales.

2. (a) The court's holding in Community for Creative Non-
violence ("CCNVn v. Luian. 908 F.2d 992 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (R.B.
Ginsburg, Sentelle, Thomas, JJ.)/ did not involve the First
Amendment, because CCNV did not raise a constitutional challenge
to the Park Service's decision. Rather, CCNV's challenge was
based on, and the case decided under, the Administrative
Procedure Act. The Park Service had issued a Policy Statement
describing its administration of the Christmas Pageant of Peace;
it followed that statement when deciding on the inclusion of
proposed displays in the pageant. CCNV claimed that its proposed
display was within the category of displays described by the
Policy Statement and therefore was eligible for inclusion. It
did not claim that the statement violated the First Amendment.

In the Policy Statement the Park Service said that the pageant
was designed to present traditional American symbols of
Christmas. CCNV contended that its proposed display both
communicated a traditional Christmas message and constituted a
traditional Christmas symbol (i.e., a particular way of
communicating the message). Because of the stated purpose of the
pageant, the Park Service considered only the question whether
the display was a traditional symbol, and concluded that it was
not. Reviewing this determination under the deferential standard
set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, the court held
that the Park Service's decision was not arbitrary or capricious.

         In explaining that the Park Service's decision was not based
on the display's message, the court was referring to the
distinction between specific symbols and more general messages
that underlay the Park Service's Policy Statement. The question
whether the Park Service's decision was "content based" in the
constitutional sense did not arise because CCNV did not raise it.
Although First Amendment issues had been considered in earlier
litigation, see CCNV v. Hodel. 623 F.Supp. 528 (D.D.C. 1985), in
this case CCNV did not challenge the Policy Statement on
constitutional grounds.

         (b) A set of facts much like the one described in this
question could easily come before the Court, so I must be
circumspect in my answer. I will assume that the sit-in would
constitute expressive conduct of the kind protected by the First
Amendment, see, e.g.. Brown v. Louisiana. 383 U.S. 131 (1966),
and that the ordinance and its application would be found to be
content-neutral. I will also assume that the sidewalk at issue,
although public property, constitutes a "traditional public
forum," see, e.g.f Frisby v. Schultzf 487 U.S. 474, 480-81.
(1988). All of these conclusions depend on the facts of a
particular case, and therefore could be otherwise. Under these
circumstances, the Court has held that the government may enforce
                                    611

reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions if they are
'narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest"
and "leave open ample alternative channels of communication."
Perrv Education Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators/ Ass/n. 460 U.S.
37, 45 (1990). See also United States v. O'Brien. 391 U.S. 367
(1968).

        This balancing is fact-based and thus its application would
require more information than is presented in the question. It
is likely that the government's interest in maintaining the
sidewalk for its primary purpose -- pedestrian traffic -- would
be found to be significant. Whether the restriction is narrowly
tailored would depend on facts such as the width of the sidewalk
and the usual level of traffic. Moreover, it would be necessary
to inquire into the availability of alternative channels of
expression.

3. The First Amendment clearly protects communications between
doctor and patient. The Constitution limits the extent to which
the federal government may directly regulate such communication.

Questions from Senator Levin for Judge Thomas

1. You've said that your personal political opinions would not
        taint you as a Supreme Court justice. Please list two
        Supreme Court cases in which you disagree personally with
        the effect or policy implications of the court's decisions,
        but believe were correctly decided?

2. Do you believe the Supreme Court's decision in Moore v. City
        of East Cleveland was correctly decided?

3. Which two U.S. Supreme Court justices of the last fifty
        years do you most admire, and why?

4. In the area of affirmative action, do you personally draw a

distinction between goals and quotas?          -~i.

5. Do you personally oppose a company's policy of setting
        nonbinding goals (i.e. not fixed quotas) for the promotion
        of minorities in a work force that was historically without
        any minority promotions?

6. When you said that Chief Justice Rehnquist "failed all
        Americans" in upholding the special prosecutor law, did you
        personally believe what you were saying or were you just
        reflecting what you perceived to be the executive branch's
        position?

7. You were quoted in 1980 regarding your sister as saying that
         "she gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare
        check," and that "What's worse is that now her kids feel
        entitled to the check, too. They have no motivation for
        doing better or getting out of that situation." Were those
        three statements factually true when you made them?

8. You have been quoted as saying that Congress is "a coalition
        of elites which failed to be a deliberative body that
        legislates for the common good or the public interest," and
        that Congress is "no longer primarily a deliberative or even
        a law making body," and that "Congress is out of control,"
        and that there is not "a great deal of principle in Congress
        itself." Did you personally believe those statements when
        you wrote or spoke them? Do you believe those statements
        today?

9. In 1987 you told the Heritage Foundation that "I, for one,

        do not see how the government can be compassionate...." IIs
        this also your current position?

10. In 1989 you wrote that "Faced with enemies more ruthless and
        zealous than those in Jefferson's time, can this nation
        possibly go forward without a science of the rights of man?"
        Do you believe the rights of man is a science?
                                    614

1. In stating that the personal views of judges should play no
role in judicial decisionmaking, I believe that I was stating a
truism. I believe that proper judicial decisionmaking requires a
judge to determine first what his or her role is in a particular
case, and then to discharge his or her responsibilities in an
impartial manner.

         Although there may be Supreme Court decisions that involve
policy implications with which I may have disagreed while a
policymaker, but which were correctly decided, as a general
matter I do not believe that it is appropriate for me to endorse
the results in specific cases. I also believe that the policy
implications of decisions are matters for the political branches.
A judge's objective must always be to determine the intent of the
legislature.

2. As I explained during the hearings, I believe it generally
would be inappropriate for me to identify precedents I do or do
not believe are correctly decided. I have no agenda ^f
precedents I wish to revisit. However, in response to a question
from Chairman Biden, I explained that I believe the notion of
family is one of the most personal and private relationships we
have in this country, and that had Moore been decided differently
it could have had ramifications for those in the same situation I
was in as a child, living with my grandparents. As I indicated
to the Committee, I have no reason to disagree with the method of
analysis applied in Moore.

3. It is difficult to state categorically that I most admire
any particular justice. I have great admiration for the second
Justice Harlan for his principled decisionmaking and his constant
efforts to identify the appropriate role of the Supreme Court in
relation to the other two branches of government. I also greatly
admire Justice Thurgood Marshall for his courageous efforts to
assure that the rights of all citizens were protected.

4. Yes. A goal can differ from a quota in at least two ways.
First, it can be less absolute: a quota must be met, whereas a
goal can be flexible. Second, a goal can be implemented with
differing methods. For example, a goal that was pursued through
expansion of the applicant pool and outreach programs would
differ significantly from a goal that was pursued through the use
of direct preferences at the selection stage; the latter would be
more like a quota than the former.

5. In general, no. "Nonbinding" goals can be very useful as a
management tool to determine the effectiveness of an employer's
efforts to promote equal employment opportunity.

6. The tone and phrasing of my remarks, and my willingness to
address such an issue, reflected my position in the executive
branch. As to the substance of my comments, it was of personal
importance to me that my audience understand that the system of
separated powers, including the accountability of the political
                                    615

branches, is a basic protection of our most treasured rights and
liberties. That point is important whether or not one agrees
with the majority's decision in Morrison.

7. I made the unfortunate remark concerning my sister to a
single reporter seated next to me at a luncheon in December 1980
in an effort to explain how much I cared about the unintended
consequences of certain social programs. I was dismayed to see
the statement in print. I immediately traveled to Savannah from
Washington, D.C. to discuss the statement with my sister and my
family. The statement was not made in a public forum. The
statement was not intended to show any resentment toward my
sister, with whom I am very close.

8. Again, the tone of my comments reflected my position in the
executive branch and several difficult but unrepresentative
experiences with the congressional oversight process. I.shared
with many observers, both within and without Congress, the fear
that Congress was devoting too much attention to the ^day-to-day
operations of executive agencies and not enough to the
formulation of public policy. In my testimony, I gave the
decision on military action in the Persian Gulf as an example of
Congress at its best: the great issues of war and peace were
powerfully debated, and each Senator and Representative took a
public stand on the ultimate question.

9. I believe that remark to have been seriously misunderstood.
It was not an objection to government programs of aid to the
needy. As I attempted to explain in response to questions from
Senator Simon, my comment rested on my philosophical
understanding of the proper role of government. To my way of
thinking, programs of public assistance rest on our obligation as
an organized society to the disadvantaged: as part of its basic
function, government must provide for the least fortunate, just
as it is obliged to protect us from private violence. I regard
the fulfillment of that obligation as a basic responsibility, not
an act of compassion.

10. I did not mean to suggest that the study of the rights of
man is a "science" in the sense that physics is a science.
Rather, my point was that, as a matter of political theory,
organized societies can rationally conclude that all persons are
inherently equal. As I attempted to make clear in my testimony
before the Judiciary Committee, I believe that a judge must
separate political theory from law.

Dear Joe:

I would appreciate your submitting the following two
questions to Justice Clarence Thomas on my behalf:

1. Do you believe that a Presidential line-item veto is
constitutional? Please elaborate as much as possible.

2. If you believe that a line item veto is constitutional,
please cite the authority under which you conclude that it is.

If at all possible, I would like to have a response by
Monday, October 7, 1991.

Dear Chairman Biden:

         You have asked that I respond to the questions of Senator
Byrd concerning my views, if any, as to the ccnstitutionallty of
a line-item veto. As I understand them, the questions assume a
set of circumstances where the Congress has net acted to give the
President a line-item veto.

         I have not examined the question whether as a matter of
constitutional law the President has inherent line-item veto
authority. r will say, however, that T know of no historical
examples of the exercise of such authority by a President. Let
me reemphasize, however, that I have not had cccasion to examine
the issue.

                                                       Sincerely yours.

                             Oral Version of Thomas Statement

Thomas C. Grey
Sweitzer Professor of Law,
Stanford Law School
9/16/91

         Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know that all three of us,
along with a number of other law professors, have signed a
statement which expresses our views in writing, and I hope the
senators will read it.

         I will try to be even more brief than my colleagues. Frank
Michelman said something of what I wanted to say on the role of
the Senate, so I will shorten what I had to say about that.

         On that score, though, I do want to point out something that
I think is wrong in the Washington Post editorial endorsing Judge
Thomas' confirmation, which Senator Thurmond entered into the
record. The editorial says: "It is still pretty widely accepted
that a president has a right to choose justices who reflect his
own philosophical predisposition, and that if the nominee is to
be rejected, it should be on some other grounds, grounds of
moral, mental, or professional disqualification."

         Now I think that is not the understanding of the
Constitution held by most scholars who have studied the
nomination and confirmation process. It's not the one verified by
 our history; it's not the one backed up by the original intent,
 as best that can be ascertained; and it's not one that has
 consistently been followed by the Senate.

         The confirmation process was meant to be and has been a
political process. That doesn't mean that adjudication is itself
political in the same sense. It rather means that the
 Constitution sets up a political process to screen who will
become lifetime federal judges. This screening process is in the
 hands of two kinds of politicians: the President on the one hand,
 and the senators on the other. These politicians are supposed to
 exercise their political judgment on the question whether a
person should become a federal judge -- in this case, a Supreme
 Court justice.

         As others have pointed out, judges -- this particular
 justice, if confirmed -- will serve for a whole generation. The
 law of the United States for a generation or more is at stake in
 proceedings like these. And it seems to me that this body has a
 responsibility for the outcome equal to that of the President,
 and so must exercise its independent judgment on whether this
 nominee is appropriate for this job.

          This doesn't mean that senators should necessarily vote

                                                          1
                                    620

Grey -- Thomas Statement

against confirming any judge they wouldn't have appointed
themselves. That would probably be an unworkable system.

         It does mean, though, that senators should apply the same
criteria to confirmation as the President applies in nominating
judicial candidates. I ask you to consider for yourselves what
criteria -- political criteria -- this President has applied in
this case, and in other cases.

         Then, I would suggest that senators take essentially the
same attitude toward the confirmation vote as you think the
President should appropriately take toward the question whether
to veto or sign legislation. The President doesn't veto every
bill he would rather not have seen passed. That would be
unworkable. But he does consider the same criteria that the
Congress has consulted in deciding whether to pass the
legislation in question.

         I think the analogy of the presidential veto provides a
historically attested way of looking at the advice and consent
power. It suggests a role for the Senate that is appropriate
given the theory of our institutions -- appropriate as a guide to
this body in carrying out its function of checking the President
in the appointment of a Supreme Court justice.

         Now I am going to move along to the question of natural law.
Senator Leahy said a lot of people were asking him about it in
Vermont over the weekend, and a lot of people have been asking me
as a law professor: what is this natural law business that they
are talking about in the Thomas hearings?

         I don't think the concept is quite as arcane as some have
tried to make it seem. In a broad sense, for a judge to follow
natural law is simply to do justice, and there is nothing wrong
with the idea that judges are there to do justice while they
apply law in deciding cases. If that's all it means, natural law
is an idea that I think most senators would endorse. I would
certainly endorse it.

         In this broad sense, natural law simply means the practical
application of human reason to difficult questions of right and
wrong -- the application, I would add, in all humility, given
what we know about the limitations of human reason.

         Let me say what I think has frightened some Americans about
the idea that Judge Thomas will be a judge who will apply natural
law in constitutional adjudication. I will come back in a moment
to his statement that he does not plan to do so.

         What has frightened people comes from another approach to

                                                          2

Grey -- Thomas Statement

natural law that lurks in the background. This other approach to
natural law is not necessarily a bad thing when an individual
uses it in making personal decisions about right and wrong. But,
in constrast to the broad notion of natural law as attempting to
do justice by applying reason, this approach does seem
inconsistent with the attitude toward deciding cases we expect
from our judges.

         This is the approach that we see in Judge Thomas' repeated
references, in speeches and articles, to self-evident truths. Now
the Declaration of Independence does declare certain truths to be
self-evident, of course, and in some sense, indeed, it is perhaps
self-evident that people have human rights, including the rights
of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

         But I think it's fair to say that no lawsuit that ever comes
before the Supreme Court -- or perhaps any other court -- simply
involves the application of self-evident truths. The answers in
the cases judges have to decide can't be deduced simply and
dogmatically from clear, self-evident moral premises.

         It's the attitude that natural law is something simple and
self-evident that frightens people when it shows up in some of
Judge Thomas1 speeches and writings, the speeches he gave before
he went on the bench. This attitude says, first, that natural law
 is God's law. There is, of course, nothing wrong with that, taken
by itself. At the same time, though, natural law is also said to
be, as Judge Thomas puts it in a number of places, "a science of
the rights of man." I quote from the end of his article in the
Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy: "Can this nation
possibly go forward without a science of the rights of man?"

          "A science of the rights of man"! Now I don't know what that
 science is. I don't have access to any such science. I don't
think most Americans believe they have any access to any "science
of the rights of man." They may believe there are rights of man,
they may even be convinced they personally know what those rights
 are. But I think they regard their beliefs as essentially matters
of commitment, of personal belief -- not as matters for proof,
not as scientific truths.

         The point is that belief in this kind of natural law -- a
combination of God's law and scientific truth -- gives great and
 indeed excessive confidence to a person whose views he thinks
have this status. Such a person says: There is a natural right to
 life or liberty; the Declaration of Independence tells us so. The
 right to life or the right to liberty means X -- whatever this
person believes strongly. It is totally clear to this person what
 these rights are. They are God's truth. They are the higher law.
 They are the brooding omnipresence in the sky.
                                    622

Grey -- Thomas Statement

         It is this attitude, brought to the judiciary, which I think
is inappropriate, and which seems to me frightening when joined
to the actual views on public issues, constitutional issues no
less, that we know Judge Thomas has already expressed in his
writings.

         Now Judge Thomas has said to this committee that in fact he
will not apply natural law to constitutional adjudication -- or
so some people think. But if you actually go back and look at
what he said during these hearings on this question, you will
find he did not quite say that. He did not say that natural law
is for him simply a matter of philosophical musing or political
theory.

         What he did say in his testimony, several times, is that he
would not directly apply natural law. He would, however, regard
natural law as the background for his decisions on questions of
what is life, liberty, and property.

         As he put it in his Harvard article, when discussing Justice
Harlan's dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson: "Justice Harlan's
reliance on political principles was implicit rather than
explicit, as is generally appropriate for Supreme Court
opinions." Implicit rather than explicit -- this is what he said
before he became a judge, and I think this helps explain what he
meant when he said here that he does not believe in appealing
"directly" to natural law.

         He means that he does not think natural law can overrule the
the Constitution itself. However, he clearly does believe that
natural law -- meaning of course his convictions about the self-
evident content of natural law -- should inform the construction
of the broad, majestic phrases of the Constitution, those
guaranteeing liberty, equal protection, protecting the privileges
and immunities of citizens, and the like.

         And we know what those convictions are. My predecessors on
this panel have spoken about them. The Lehrman speech provides
the most striking example. Remember what Judge Thomas said about
that speech -- that it was a splendid example of applying natural
law to a constitutional question. What Lewis Lehrman did was to
go straight from a natural human right to life to the right of
every fetus to absolute legal protection from the moment of
conception.

          Translating this view into constitutional doctrine would
mean something more radical than any nominee for the Supreme
Court has heretofore proposed -- something more radical than
Judge Bork proposed, and he was rejected by the Senate.
                                    623

Grey -- Thomas Statement

         Basically, Judge Thomas' kind of "implicit11 or "indirect" or
"background" use of natural law is all anyone needs to give him
full freedom in adjudicating cases -- anyone, that is, who holds
sufficiently firm, simple, dogmatic convictions about the content
and method of natural law reasoning. His formulation leaves him
all the room he needs to translate his most deeply held personal
convictions into the law of the land.

         Judge Thomas' own deep personal convictions include much of
the agenda of the far right portion of the American political
spectrum. I think it would be a great mistake -- I think it would
be a tragedy -- if the Senate confirmed someone who held those
views, and who has strongly implied his intention to implement
those views as a judge, to be a justice of the Supreme Court.

         Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Dear Senator Thurmond:

        One of my most valued constituents, Mrs. Thomasina Jordan of
Alexandria, Virginia, has been kind enough to provide the
attached endorsements supporting the confirmation of Judge
Clarence Thomas as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court.

        Mrs. Jordan, an acknowledged leader of the Native American
community, has requested that these resolutions and letters from
prominent Native American organizations and individuals be
included as a part of the confirmation hearing record. It is,
therefore, my privilege to provide the endorsements for your
attention and that of your fellow distinguished members of the
Judiciary Committee. The record of this most important
confirmation hearing will be significantly strengthened by this
splendid demonstration of support by these Native American
leaders.

        With my thanks for your continuing good efforts, I am

                                                   Sincerely,

RE: Nomination of lion. Clarence Thoniaa 10 U.S. Supreme Court

Greet Ingsi

Your efforts have recently cone to the attention Of the Alabama Xntartrlbal
Council and lta leadership. Aa the President of the Council, I am writing
to express to you Borne of the fce)inga of suppoit for Judge Thomas among our
people here in Alabama. While our Council has not formally discussed thia
 and therefore hos not adopted an official position, it la proposed for the
 agenda of the next Council meeting.

 At a community gathering a few dsya ago some of our tribal leaders and pro-
 minent tribal members dlscuased this upcoming natter informally. It was
 the general consensus that Judge Thomas has many fine and unique qualifica-
 tions and thai in view of your efforts we should at least convey.our support
 to you for your efforts in including Indian concern* among the nutters for
 consideration In his nomination.

 Me sincerely hope that you will maintain, and oven strengthen, the longstanding
 relationship of protection and trust between the United States nnd ltB Indian
 nations.

 Yours very truly,

Moreover, Judge Thomas' philosophy regarding opportunities for

Gentlemen:

I am pleased to offer my support for the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of
the United States. By his rise from poverty to prominence, ludge Thomas is an example and a model
for Indian people in America. Hard work, education, self-reliance and perseverance are among the
fundamental tools needed to overcome poverty, oppression and racism.

In my view, Judge Thomas' conservative theory of jurisprudence will contribute to the Supreme
Court's tradition or recognizing -- and respecting ·· the sovereign-to-sovereign nature of the rela-
tionship between the federal government and Indian tribal governments.

I hope that one day we will return to the White House to endorse the nomination of an American
Indian to join Judge Thomas on the Supreme Court.

Respectfully, *

DEAR MS. JORDAN:

        We, the undersigned, Tribal Chairman from the Lakota/Dakota Nation,
do support the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of
the United States.

We feel that with Judge Thomas'6 humble-beginnings he -can relate to

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
The Honorable Strom Thurmond
Senate Judiciary Committee
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senators Biden and Thurmond:

         As law school deans, teachers of law, and citizens vitally
interested in constitutional and civil rights, we are writing to
express our serious concerns about the nomination of Clarence
Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme
Court. Judge Thomas, in our view, lacks the experience, the
commitment to fundamental constitutional rights and liberties,
and the respect for law which are necessary prerequisites for
elevation to this important position.

         A decision to oppose confirmation of a nominee to the
Supreme Court is never an easy one to reach. Judge Thomas has a
compelling personal history of overcoming poverty and
discrimination. He is only the second member of a racial minority
group ever to be nominated to the Supreme Court, an institution
where diversity of membership is significant. These factors,
however, cannot qualify him for a lifetime seat on the most
important Court in the land in light of the serious problems
evident in his record and his philosophy.

         Former Solicitor General Erwin Griswold recently commented
that in replacing Thurgood Marshall on the Court, the President
"should have come up with a first-class lawyer, of wide
reputation and experience," but "that, it seems to me obvious, he
did not do." Dean Griswold noted that Judge Thomas "has no
breadth of experience at all." Indeed, Judge Thomas has been on
the Court of Appeals for only 18 months. He does not have
extensive experience as a practicing lawyer in the federal
courts, where he has never argued a case, or as a legal scholar
who has researched and taught concerning constitutional and legal
issues. Prior to his appointment to the court, Judge Thomas1
experience consisted almost exclusively of serving as director of
the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the Department of Education
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Far from
supporting his qualifications for the Court, however, that
experience raises troubling concerns about his commitment to the
rule of law and to civil rights protections for all Americans.

         For example, while at OCR during 1981-82, Judge Thomas
admitted in federal court that he was violating "rather
grievously" a court order governing the processing of civil
rights cases. At EEOC, he allowed over 13,000 age discrimination
cases to lapse by failing to act on complaints filed with the
agency. A federal court found in 1987 that his failure to act
with respect to pension rights of older Americans was "entirely
unjustified and unlawful" and "at worst deceptive to the public."
Also at EEOC, he sought to abandon affirmative remedies for job
discrimination that had been provided by Congress and upheld by
                                     638

the courts, first by claiming that the change was dictated by the
Supreme Court's decision in the Stotts case and then, when that
claim was demonstrated to be erroneous, by stating his "personal
disagreement" with such remedies. Indeed, fourteen members of
Congress, including 12 chairs of committees with oversight
responsibility over EEOC, concluded in 1989 that Judge
Thomas'"questionable enforcement record" at EEOC "frustrates the
intent and purpose" of Congressional civil rights legislation and
that he had demonstrated an "overall disdain for the rule of
law."

         In a series of articles and speeches over the past decade,
moreover, Judge Thomas has expressed a deep hostility towards key
Supreme Court precedents protecting fundamental individual rights
and upholding Congressional authority in our constitutional
system. At the same time, he has espoused a judicial philosophy
based on "natural law" that provides no reliable anchor for
constitutional adjudication and that could result in dramatic
reversals of important Court precedents.

         One important manifestation of the nominee's hostility
towards fundamental rights has been his sharp criticism of a
series of Court decisions implementing the school desegregation
requirements of the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Brown v.
Board of Education and of other Court decisions upholding the use
of race-conscious remedies where necessary to remedy job bias and
its effects. He has attacked a number of such precedents not
simply as wrong, but as "egregious" or "disastrous." Indeed, he
has specifically urged the overruling of the Court's decision in
Johnson v. Transportation Agency, commenting that he hoped that
the dissent in the case would "provide guidance for the lower
courts and a possible majority in future decisions."

         With respect to the right of privacy, Judge Thomas has
criticized the Court's landmark decision in Griswold v.
Connecticut, in which the Court struck down a Connecticut law
banning the sale of contraceptives. In particular, he has
attacked opinions in Griswold which relied upon the Ninth
Amendment as a basis for the right of privacy, claiming that the
decision represented the improper "invention" of the Ninth
Amendment which would "likely become an additional weapon for the
enemies of freedom."

         At the same time that he has attacked the use of the Ninth
Amendment as a basis for recognizing unenumerated rights implicit
in the Constitution, however, Judge Thomas has espoused a
"natural law" philosophy which claims that there are fixed
objective truths derivable from higher law that somehow override
the Constitution or other written law. The dangers of such a
philosophy were illustrated during the Lochner era over 50 years
ago, when a majority of the Supreme Court used it to invalidate
minimum wage laws and health and safety regulations and to uphold
such practices as excluding women from the practice of law. Since
that time, courts and scholars have thoroughly repudiated this
                                    639

brand of constitutional decision-making.

         Unfortunately, Judge Thomas1 writings suggest that his
"natural law" views are much more than simply abstract
philosophy. He has asserted that the Supreme Court is justified
in overturning the decisions of "run-amok majorities" as long as
it adheres to natural law. Judge Thomas strongly endorsed an
article that condemned Roe v. Wade on grounds that natural law
requires the outlawing of abortion, calling the article a
"splendid example of applying natural law." He co-authored a
1986 report that not only sharply criticized Roe, but also
attacked other Court decisions protecting privacy rights by
invalidating laws which forbade unmarried people from using
contraceptives and prohibited a grandmother from living in
extended family fashion with her son and grandsons. The report
specifically noted that such "fatally flawed" decisions could be
"corrected" by "the appointment of new judges and their
confirmation by the Senate."

         Our concerns about Judge Thomas are strongly reinforced by
the persistent and vehement attack on legislative authority in
his speeches and writings. Recently, he assailed the Supreme
Court's near-unanimous decision upholding the authority of
Congress to appoint special prosecutors to investigate charges of
serious misconduct by executive branch officials. Judge Thomas
claimed that Justice Rehnquist's opinion for the Court "failed
not only conservatives but all Americans." Similarly, he has
severely criticized Court precedent in Fullilove v. Klutznick
upholding Congressional authority to enact legislation to remedy
past discrimination. These views correspond all too closely with
his harsh criticism and personal failure to cooperate with
Congress in its execution of its oversight responsibilities over
the EEOC, indicating a clear lack of respect for the legislative
branch. For a potential Supreme Court justice charged with
faithfully interpreting Congressional legislation and determining
Congress1 authority in our constitutional system, such views and
actions are extremely troubling.

         We do not contend that there are no respectable arguments to
be mustered for some of the positions that Judge Thomas defends.
Overall, however, his clear hostility to judicial protection for
fundamental constitutional and civil rights and to Congressional
authority is extremely troubling. This is particularly true with
respect to the current Court, on which several members have
already expressed interest in overruling prior Court precedents
protecting individual liberty and mounting what Justice Marshall,
in his final dissent on the Court, called a "far-reaching
assault" on the Bill of Rights. Based on his record and his
clearly expressed philosophy and beliefs, we are concerned that
Judge Thomas would join in such a dangerous attack on our rights
and liberties.

        We urge you and the other members of the Senate to examine
closely the record on Judge Thomas, particularly the findings of
                                    640

federal judges and Congressional committee chairs concerning how
the nominee has performed his responsibilities. If you and other
Senators conclude, as we have, that the nominee lacks the
experience, the commitment to fundamental constitutional values,
and the respect for the rule of law necessary, we urge you to
fulfill your constitutional responsibility to withhold the
consent of the Senate to the nomination.

Sincerely yours,
                            641

Dear Senator Biden:

         Enclosed please find copies of an article I wrote on why
Clarence Thomas's natural law views are incompatible with
constitutional protections for women and gays. Would you please
distribute a copy to each member of the judiciary committee and
enter one into the official record. Thank you.

                                                                       Sincerely,

                                                          I . INTRODUCTION

         Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas adopts the judicial
philosophy known as Natural Law theory. The theory can be used
to provide a basis for deciding whether a particular
constitutional interpretation is just and therefore whether it
is properly part of the constitution. In its traditional
formulation, the theory is at odds with privacy rights for gays
and lesbians and choice for women. Additionally, the theory is
unsound on its own merits and better theories are available.

                                              II. BACKGROUND

         On the surface, Thomas's views on c o n s t i t u t i o n a l
interpretation appear expansive. In two law review articles, he
says t h a t the i n s t i t u t i o n of slavery and the d o c t r i n e of
"separate but equal" education were wrongful because they
violated the higher law principle of equality as found in the
Declaration of Independence. The Declaration is looked to as the
framer's embodiment of Locke's concept of n a t u r a l r i g h t .
However, nothing in either of these articles suggests any broader
expansion of constitutional equality to other than racial
minorities and, even then, never under the guise of affirmative
action. More importantly, Thomas's natural law views suggest
that the constitution may not'protect privacy or equal protection
rights for gays and lesbians or abortion for woman.

         In his latter article, Thomas trys to clarify the priveleges
and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by stating that
the fundamental rights of the Declaration ("those of l i f e ,
liberty and property") were "given to man by his Creator, and did
not simply come from a piece of paper." (Interestingly, Thomas
does not use " l i f e , liberty or happiness". Instead, he follows
an e a r l i e r draft of Jefferson's that borrowed on Locke's use of
"property", suggesting that Thomas views property rights on par
with life and liberty rights.)

         In the e a r l i e r a r t i c l e , Judge Thomas o f f e r s an
i n t e r p r e t a t i o n of these fundamental r i g h t s . He avoids
Jefferson's more open ended reliance on "self-evidence" in favor
of a paraphrase of St. Thomas Aquinas. "A just law is a man-made
code that squares with the moral law or the law of God.... An
unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law or
natural law."^ This is the only method Judge Thomas mentions.

                                                        I I I . NATURAL LAW

         In contradistinction to the randomness associated with
modern evolutionary and quantum theories, Aquinas's 14th Century
theory of natural law presupposes a purposive deterministic view
of the universe. Even from a secular reading, the theory
provides that morality requires conformity of human actions with
                                           646

the widest design of nature. For instance, the most important
moral rule i s that human action conform to what a l l nature has in
common--namely, continuation in existence. Consequently, rules
a g a i n s t murder are j u s t i f i e d , but also r u l e s p r o h i b i t i n g
abortion. The l a t t e r is justified under the interpretation that
termination of a pregnancy is not in conformity with continuation
of the species.

         The second most important rule i s for human action to
conform to what a l l animal nature has in common--that being,
procreation and the rearing of offspring. Consequently, rules
that protect the privacy of marital relations but allow states to
p r o h i b i t a d u l t consensual homosexual (or nonprocreative
heterosexual) "sodomy" are justified.

         Least important on the l i s t i s what conforms only to the
unique nature of man. While t h i s natural law p r i n c i p l e would
support rules protecting r e l i g i o u s freedom (something animals
have no part i n ) , i t would not recognize the legitimacy of
arguments such as the one David A, J, Richards makes that humans
express sexuality for love, recreation or procreation.

                                  I V . PROBLEMS WITH NATURAL LAW

        Principally, there are two types of problems with natural
lav/ theories: conceptual and logical.

A. Conceptual;
        Here the problem is with defining the word natural. Is

natural to mean statistically average, found among lower animals,
oriented to preserving the species, oriented to uniquely human
nature, or moral. With respect to interpreting "natural" to mean
statistically average, the argument leads to the ridiculous
conclusion that it is morally better to be a "C" student than an
"A" student, since being a "C" student is more average of what
most students are. With respect to found among lower animals,
the theory would have to give up its prohibition against
homosexuality since "[v]irtually every animal whose activity has
been studied in detail shows some forms of homosexual behavior."

        As to preserving the species, studies show that in
nonindustrial societies, gay men often provide home support which
aids close relatives to reproduce efficiently. In industrial
societies, the issue of one parent care is not unusual and
lesbians or gays could be allowed to adopt or become parents in
their own right. Clearly, gays and lesbians have contributed and
are a part of human culture. "

        The last possibility of saying that unnatural is immoral
begs the question. * Even if homosexuality were unnatural, that
would not by itslf show that it is immoral? The problem is one
of going from an is to an ought.

B. Logical;
        Aquinas's version of natural law claims that "one must not

kill" may be derived from the natural law principle that "one
should do harm to no m a n . " 1 2 No mention is made of any
exceptions for killing the guilty nor could the theory on its own
647

merits support such a claim. Yet, Aquinas allows human law to
specify the death penalty based on a determination of the natural
law principle that "the evil-doer should be punished."13 The
trouble is that relating human law to natural law in this way
creates rather than avoids inconsistencies.14 Indeed, the same
inconsistency occurs with Jefferson's list of natural rights as
indicated by his own acceptance of capital punishment.

V. A BETTER APPROACH

While it is not my intention to engage in comparative

theory, I do think it is important to show that not all judicial

theories are subject to the same questionable results as natural

law. in contrast to Aquinas, Ronald Dworkin's theory tells the

judge to give deference to the best principle based on
considerations of fit and political morality.15 Fit means that

the judge must develop a theory of the settled case law,

constitutional provisions and requisite statutes that not only is

coherent but is able to provide determinative answers in hard

cases. In the abortion case, for example, the principle that the

unborn is not a person fits better with other parts of our law

and also our sense of how related issues should be decided than

does the alternative. We would probably not want a mother held

criminally liable if due to negligence she has a stillbirth. Nor

is it likely that we would want IUDs and birth control pills that

act as abortifacients outlawed? My own theory on privacy shows

that the Supreme Court was mistaken in not extending the coverage

of the constituional right to privacy to protect adult consensual

homosexual activity in the home.

On the issue of political morality (and this applies only

if fit does not produce a determinative result), the point is to

show which theory of law better recognizes the rights people

actually have. A right to control ones part in procreation finds

support in the principle of a society truly committed      to

individual liberty and dignity. It closely relates to other

privacy decisions, and serves to guarantee the moral, social 'and

economic freedom of women, gay people and others.

                                            VI. CONCLUSION

        For the aforesaid reasons, whatever other considerations
might exist, the United States Senate should seriously question
Judge Clarence Thomas as to his judicial philosophy. If indeed
he holds to the natural law theory of St. Thomas Aquinas, he
should not be confirmed.

                                  Respectfully submitted,

Dear Mr. President:

We commend you for your sensitivity to the diverse cultural
make-up of our nation, and the principles of the founding
fathers that all are created equal under God. And we are
pleased that you took these factors into consideration as
you made your nomination for an associate justice of the
Supreme Court in the Honorable Judge Clarence Thomas.

We have carefully studied the writings, decisions, and
judicial contributions of Judge Thomas; and in our
considered judgment he possesses all the skills,
preparation, and judicial expertise that would suit him to
be a most efficient Supreme Court judge. He is worthy of
such an honor in the light of his distinguished career
accomplishments.

As Senior Bishop/Chief Executive Officer of the Christian
Methodist Episcopal Church, I represent a denomination which
has a rich history of promoting positive and progressive
improvements, and is composed of a constituency who have oft
times been the victims of the vicious treacheries acted out
upon a powerless people confined within a limited mobility.
It is our sincere prayer that as Judge Thomas assumes this
awesome challenge, that he will possess a compassionate zeal
to empower the downtrodden, socially outcast,
underprivileged, disenfranchised, and poverty stricken
masses which are desperately seeking to achieve the American
Dream.

Clarence Thomas will continue to bring the judicial
integrity and expertise which he possesses together with the
sense of caring inherent in his heritage.

My name is Frederick Douglass Gray. I live at 6712 Hastings Drive, Prince
George's County, Maryland 20743. First, I would like to thank the members of
this committee for permitting me to appear before you today. On this very
date 46 years ago, I was walking the volcanic ashes of Iwo Jima happy as one
could be that the war had ended, and, I, along with millions of other young
veterans, would be coming home.

Now, 46 years later, having survived one of the worst battles in military
history, I come before you asking this committee to look favorably and fairly
upon the information you have before you concerning Judge Thomas's
appointment to the Supreme Court. I believe Judge Thomas will prove to be
what some are saying he is not. He will be a justice for all Americans. He
will carry out the laws of this land to the best of his ability.

Yes, he comes from rural Georgia, and I come from rural Southern Maryland
from the town of St. Leonards in a little county called Calvert. We both
understand hardship. We both believe in the true American way: working
for a living. We both do not believe in handouts. We both do not believe in
quotas. So, Mr. Chairman, if the above is reason to deny a seat on the
Supreme Court to Judge Thomas, so be it.

Judge Thomas would never let his personal beliefs in any way interfere with
his ability to render a just and fair decision for all Americans. I thank you,
again, Mr. Chairman and the members of this committee.

                                                       INTRODUCTION

          As an organization formed to defend, preserve and expand civil rights and liberties in Puerto
Rico, the Puerto Rican Institute of Civil Rights (Instituto Puertorriqueno de Derechos Civiles) opposes the
nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of the United States.

          For the Puerto Rican people, the selection of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice is of considerable
importance. Over two million Puerto Ricans reside in the United States, of which close to 34% live below
the poverty level. Although U.S. citizens, Puerto Ricans are often the victims of widespread and deeply
rooted discrimination and are in particular need of a Supreme Court that will be responsive to their plight.

          The U.S. judicial system arrived with the U.S. naval invasion of 1898. And like the Navy, it also
has never left. Indeed, the U.S. court system has played a crucial role in the island's history. Of its
different branches, the Grand Jury in particular has been used as an instrument of repression against
Puerto Rico's independence movement. Because we continue to be subjected to the U.S. Constitution
and its laws, we are subject to the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, the final arbiter of these
doctrines. The following outlines our position regarding Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the U.S.
Supreme Court.

          Choosing a judge for the highest court of the United States requires in depth investigation as to
his/her ability to uphold the United States Constitution and laws and should not be based solely upon
the nominee's race or political philosophy. We find that the nominee falls far below the necessary
qualifications for such a position. Unfortunately, our investigation shows that Judge Clarence Thomas
will carry out his political goals, goals which often contravene with the preservation and expansion of
civil rights, despite his sworn duty to uphold the U.S. Constitution and laws.

          Our research has confirmed our fears that Judge Clarence Thomas is not qualified to serve in
the United States Supreme Court. First, because of his extremely short service on the bench, 15 months
in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals and no federal district court service nor even state court service,
we must base most of our analysis of his ability to uphold the law on his eight years as Chair of the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as well as his various speeches and publications.
Upon careful analysis of this record, we find that Judge Thomas did not understand or decided to ignore
laws which he was employed to carry out as Chairman of the EEOC, behavior which is unfit for the
highest court of the United States.

          Second, Judge Thomas has shown himself capable of evading the law which does not fit his
political philosophy. His political speeches and actions, or often the lack of the latter, show an
insensitivity to the Constitutional rights of those who would come before him. We see no evidence that
he will not continue to do the same as a Supreme Court Justice, and thus fail to uphold the civil rights
of those seeking judicial redress and the millions affected by such decisions.

          After some background information on Judge Thomas, we will first discuss his employment
record and why such practices signal that he is not qualified to serve as a Supreme Court Justice.
Second, we will examine his speeches and political philosophy which his record shows he will allow to
interfere with his interpretations and rulings of the law, to the detriment of the Constitutional rights of not
only those who come before the Supreme Court, but the millions of others affected by such precedent.

                                     Biographical and Employment Background

          Clarence Thomas grew up in Georgia under state-enforced segregation: "I was raised to survive
under the totalitarianism of segregation, not only without the active assistance of government but with its
active opposition". He graduated from Holy Cross College in 1970 and received his J.D. from Yale Law
                                       657

School in 1974. He served as assistant attorney general in Missouri for the then attorney general John
Danforth, specializing in tax and finance matters. In 1977 he began working for the chemical company
Monsanto. He went to Washington D.C. In 1979 to work for U.S. Senator Danforth as his aide on energy
and environmental matters. In 1981, President Reagan appointed Mr. Thomas to head the Department
of Education's civil rights division. A year later President Reagan named him to chair the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), where he served for two terms.

          In October 1989, President Bush nominated Mr. Thomas to the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia. Despite his mediocre rating of 'qualified' from the ABA judicial screening committee, the
expression of serious concerns or outright opposition from the Alliance for Justice, the American Way,
the American Association of Retired Persons, the National Council on Aging, the House Congressional
Black Caucus, the Chair of the Senate Committee on Aging, the Chair of the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, the Chair of the House Select Committee on Aging and
various civil rights organizations, he was confirmed in February 1990 where he has been serving until the
present. His judicial history spans a mere 15 months, during which he has written 19 opinions, fewer
than any other judge on that court.

                                             CLARENCE THOMAS' RECORD

          Normally in evaluating a nominee for the highest court of the United States one extensively
reviews the judicial record of the nominee. To the extent possible, we have done so, but as stated
above, it Is brief and thus tells us very little. Therefore, we focus most of our analysis on his record as
chair of the EEOC.

                                      Clarence Thomas' Record as EEOC Chair
          The most significant and revealing part of Clarence Thomas' record is his 1982 - 1990 tenure as
chair of the EEOC. His record is marked with problems, at times so severe as to require Congressional
and judicial action to remedy.

          The EEOC is responsible for enforcing various federal statutes guaranteeing equal employment
opportunity including Title VII, the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Section 501
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (prohibiting discrimination on the basis of handicap), Section 717 of Title
VII of the Civil Rights Act (covering equal employment opportunity for federal employees) and the Fair
Labor Standards Act Amendments of 1974 (which prohibit age discrimination in federal employment) .

          In addition, the EEOC is responsible for "leadership and coordination to the efforts of Federal
departments and agencies to endorse all Federal statutes, Executive orders, regulations and policies
which require equal employment opportunity^. In other words, the EEOC is the lead agency for
coordinating all Federal EEO programs.

          Despite the EEOC's necessarily affirmative role in upholding the rights of workers who are victims
of discrimination while insuring that such claims are valid, Thomas allowed the EEOC to lose its
effectiveness as such a law enforcement agency. A letter from the American Way to Senator Joseph
Biden, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stated the following, regarding Thomas' nomination to

      1Govan and Taylor, One Nation. Indivisible. Report of the Citizens' Commission of Civil Rights, August
 1989.

      2Order No. 12,067 §1-201 (June 30, 1978). Despite this order, Thomas gave in to White House
pressures when there was a conflict. The Civil Rights Commission noted this misunderstanding. "The
EEOC's coordination role under executive order 12067 has been far less significant than was intended'
See U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Clearinghouse Report, Federal Enforcement of Equal Employment
Requirements 10 (1987).
                                       658

the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals:

          Thomas has attempted, through regulatory or
          administrative policies, to weaken the very anti-
          discrimination laws that he was sworn to uphold.
          In short, Mr. Thomas' service at the EEOC raises
          serious questions concerning his respect for the law,
          a respect that is a sine qua non for a federal judge'.

          In fact, in one instance it was necessary for the court to order the EEOC to carry out its
obligations under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) to require employers to make
pension contributions for the benefit of those of their employees who continue to work past 'normal"
retirement age. American Association of Retired Persons v. EEOC. 655 F.Supp. 228 (D.D C. 1987). In
holding that the EEOC unreasonably delayed in carrying out its duties, Judge H. Greene stated the
following.

          Although it is among the Commissions duties under law
          to eradicate discrimination in the workplace and to
          protect older worker's against discrimination, that
          agency has at best been slothful, at worst deceptive
          to the public, in the discharge of these responsibilities.
          These Commission derelictions are estimated to affect
          hundreds of thousands of older Americans, and to cost
          these individuals in lost pension benefits as much as
          $450 million every year. ld_ at 229.

          What is distressing is that this is the very organization formed to protect the rights of such
plaintiffs. Noting this, Judge Greene remarked.

          It is worth recalling in this connection that the
          government agency which has engaged in these tactics
          detrimental to workers over 65 is not one, such as the
          Department of Commerce, which might perhaps legitimately
          have an outlook favorable to business interests,
          but, sadly, a commission created by the Civil Rights Act
          of 1964, charged by law with the eradication of
          discrimination in the workplace on the basis of age,
          race, national origin, sex and religion, one of whose
          responsibilities is thus to protect the older worker.
          Id. at 240-241.

          The following details how, under Thomas, the EEOC substantially lost its effectiveness in
opposing discrimination in the workplace despite the United States Constitution, case-law and statutorily-
mandated-action contrary to Thomas' policies.

           1) Thomas misunderstood or blatantly ignored the law he was employed to uphold for eights
          years.

       The EEOC conceded that its delay in implementing rules on pensions for older workers may cost
such workers $450 million per year in benefits. Id. at 229 n.2.
                                       659

         2) Thomas failed to perform the EEOC's statutorilv - mandated responsibilities regarding federal
         anti-discrimination plans .

         3) Despite prevailing case-law to the contrary, Thomas attempted to weaken federal employee
         selection guidelines .

         4) Thomas failed to follow Supreme Court precedent in seeking remedies for victims of
         employment discrimination .

          5) Under Thomas, the EEOC also failed to support the civil rights of women in the workplace.

          6) Thomas not only failed to enforce the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, he frequently
          took positions opposing the rights of elderly workers .

          7) Thomas evidenced further disrespect for the law in his evasiveness towards Congress and
          retaliatory actions towards employees who aided Congress.

1) Thomas Misunderstood or Blatantly Ignored the Law He was to Uphold for Eight Years.

          In the confirmation hearings to place Thomas on the bench in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals,
Senator Metzenbaum emphasized the following.

          I am not here saying that Mr. Thomas should not be
          confirmed because thousands of age discrimination
          charges lapsed between 1984 and 1988, which required
          Congress to enact legislation to restore the rights
          of older workers. And I am not here because he failed
          to act with respect to the 1,500 subsequent cases
          that lapsed after [Congress passed special legislation
          to remedy the EEOC wrong], I am here today because
          I believe that Mr. Thomas' answers to me in committee
          prove conclusively that he does not know the law
          he was responsible for administering for the last
          8 years. 136 Cong. Rec. S2013, S2016.

          Federal law provides that charges filed with the State agencies which have work-sharing
agreements with the EEOC are regarded as charges filed under both State and Federal law. Regarding
charges filed with the Fair Employment Practice Agencies (FEPAs), Mr. Thomas stated that the "the
charges filed with the State agencies are filed under state law and, to our knowledge, none of these
State laws have statutes of limitation. So there cannot, by definition, be lapses in those agencies'.

          Senator Metzenbaum noted three disturbing points from Thomas' remarks. First, that "he did not
understand for 8 years that these were Federal rights, not State rights; and that they were paying the
State agencies to handle the claims of individuals under the Federal law" Id. at S2016.

          Second, Federal law provides that the EEOC may enter into agreements with state or local fair

Senate Judiciary Committee.

employment practices agencies...and may engage the services of such agencies in processing charges

assuring the safeguard of the federal rights of aggrieved persons. 29 CFR 1626.10 (a). Yet Mr. Thomas

did not know that older workers lose their right to pursue Federal age discrimination claims when State

agencies fail to act in a timely manner. As Senator Metzenbaum pointed out, we only have to look at

the special Congressional law passed to remedy such inaction to note that Thomas was wrong in stating

that "there cannot be lapses in the State agencies'.  Third, Mr. Thomas stated that the 'EEOC does not

supervise or regulate State agencies', thus supposedly absolving the EEOC of responsibility for the many

lapsed claims. He was unaware of his own regulations stating that the EEOC in fact has the legal

responsibility to ensure that these State agencies precess Federal age discrimination charges in a timely

manner. (29 CFR 1626.10).

          As Senator Metzenbaum noted, 'if he did not understand that elementary idea...that law...what will
he understand when he reads complicated briefs that come before him... . At best, Thomas
misunderstood the laws regulating his work for eight years, at worst he was pursuing a political agenda
of his own. Neither is fitting for a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

2) Thomas failed to perform the EEOC's statutorily - mandated responsibilities regarding federal
anti-discrimination plans.

          Thomas' lack of enforcement of the law reduced the power of the EEOC. Title VII, section 717
makes the EEOC responsible for enforcing the adoption of effective anti-discrimination programs.
Thomas claimed the EEOC lacked enforcement powers when several federal agencies repeatedly refused
to comply, yet he did not support a Congressional proposal to expand the EEOC's power to obtain such
anti-discrimination plans.

          Further weakening the EEOC's power, in 1987 the Commission issued a Management Directive
(714) which shifted the primary responsibility for anti-discrimination plans to the heads of each individual
agency.

          Thomas' failure to carry out the EEOC's Title VII duties to collect and evaluate anti-discrimination
plans from federal agencies substantially weakened the EEOC's ability to eradicate discrimination in the
workplace and again raises questions about Thomas' ability to abide by law contrary to his political
beliefs.

3) Despite prevailing case-law to the contrary, Thomas attempted to weaken federal employee
selection guidelines.

          The Uniform Guidelines provide employers, employees and all other interested parties with a
description of the law on selection practices for employment decisions such as educational requirements,
application forms and standardized tests. The Guidelines are used so that an employer may not use
selection criteria which have an "adverse impact" on the hiring or promotion of women and people of
color unless the criteria are proven to be job-related. They represent a statement of the prevailing law
to the courts. Although there had been no change in the controlling /awr, Thomas stated in an interview
that changing the Uniform Guidelines was the "number one item on my agenda" in order to de-emphasize
the use of statistical evidence to demonstrate disparate impact.

          Leading Members of Congress noted that Thomas lacked a proper understanding of Title VII, its
purpose, policy and case law. The Lawyers' Committee on Civil Rights testified the following.

Efforts by the current leadership of the EEOC to
change [the Uniform Guidelines] are based solely

          on the extreme personal views of its highest
          officials, without regard to any practical consideration
          and without regard to the commands of the law.

                    Thomas eventually backed down. Attempts such as this lead us and many others to
question Thomas' respect for established law.

4) Thomas failed to follow Supreme Court precedent in seeking remedies for victims of
employment discrimination (lack of enforcement of affirmative action laws).

          Although the EEOC's own guidelines on affirmative action sanction the use of goals and
timetables , in 1986 the EEOC announced that it would no longer seek to include goals and timetables
in the consent decrees that it negotiated with employers. During his reconfinrtatlon hearings in the
Senate, after severe criticism and pressure from civil rights organizations and Congress, Thomas
promised to withdraw the policy-

          Thomas stated in the Regulatory Program of the United States that the use of goals and
timetables was a fundamentally flawed approach to enforcement of the anti-discrimination statutes".
Leading Members of Congress objected to the EEOC's unilateral decision not to seek certain legally
permissible remedies for victims of discrimination with its policy of no goals and timetables. Thomas
responded to the House Education and Labor Subcommittee that he believed the Stotts decision
prohibited the use of goals and timetables in all circumstances, Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 v.
Stotts. 467 U.S. 561 (1984) (though he earlier had written to Congress that the 'Stotts decision does not
require the EEOC to reconsider its stated policies with respect to the availability of numerical goals and
similar forms of affirmative, prospective relief in Title VII cases'). Yet the Supreme Court held that goals
and timetables could be included among remedies for employment discrimination in appropriate
circumstances1 .

          Interestingly enough, at his reappointment confinvation hearings, Thomas acknowledged the
Supreme Court reaffirmation that goals and timetables are appropriate remedies and promised to seek
all appropriate remedies in his future work. Yet once again, Thomas renewed his lack of support for
goals and timetables when he joined Attorney General Meese and Assistant Attorney General Reynolds
in seeking to have President Reagan abrogate the executive order requiring federal contractors to have
minority hiring goals and timetables. Bipartisan opposition, from a list including the Secretary of State,
Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Transportation, 69 Senators and 180 House Members, caused the
Administration to give up changing the law.

          As part of such a policy contrary to affirmative action, Thomas focused on one-to-one cases in
an effort to shift from what he called an 'emphasis...on obtaining broad remedies for a theoretical group
that had not filed charges'. As a result he was criticized for 'new procedural issuances [whichj have
focused on one-to-one cases that have virtually no impact on the phenomenon of discrimination'^2

          Such a lack of enforcement and further attempts to change affirmative action laws supported by
Supreme Court precedent raise serious questions as to Thomas' ability to respect established law which
may conflict with his personal political agenda.

        Guidelines designed to protect employers who voluntarily take affirmative action measures received
protection from charges of "reverse discrimination" under the EEOC Guidelines on Affirmative Action
Appropriate Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. as amended. 29 CFR 1608 (1988).

5) Under Thomas, the EEOC failed to support the civil rights of women in the workplace.

          777e EEOC frequently filed briefs contrary to the rights of those the Commission was formed to
protect in sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination cases. In Miller v. Aluminum Company of
America. 679 F.Supp. 495 (W.D. Pa.), affd mem.. No. 88-3099 (3d dr. 1988), the EEOC's brief stated that
favoritism toward a female employee because of a consensual romantic relationship with a male
supervisor is not sex discrimination within the meaning of Title VII. Yet 29 C.F.C. § 1604.11(g) states
that where employment opportunities or benefits are granted because of an Individual's submission to
the employer's advances or request for sexual favors, the employer may be held liable for unlawful sex
discrimination against other persons who were qualified for but denied that employment opportunity
benefit.

          Regarding pregnancy discrimination, in California Federal Savings and Loan v. Guerra. 479 U.S.
272, 107 S.Ct. 683 (1987), the EEOC said that a California law providing unpaid leave for up to four
months for employees disabled by pregnancy, but not other disabilities, violated Title VII. Yet the Court
upheld the California law with the support of women's legal groups.

6) Thomas Failed to Enforce Age Discrimination Laws and EEOC Opposition to Elderly Workers'
Rights.

          The EEOC's handling of age discrimination cases was one of the most controversial areas of
Thomas' tenure. The controversy was not limited to severe criticism from members of relevant
Congressional committees who often found it necessary to have Thomas defend his policies and criticism
from senior citizens groups, at different occasions, Congressional legislation and court orders were
necessary to correct EEOC action or lack thereof. A letter from the House of Representatives' Judiciary
Committee to President Bush stated the following.

          As members of [the] Congressional Committees with
          oversight responsibilities for the EEOC, we believe
          Mr. Thomas has developed policy directives and
          enforcement strategies which have undermined the
          effectiveness of the Age Discrimination in Employment
          Act (ADEA) and Title VII.

          In 1987 and 1988, the EEOC allowed more that 13,000 ADEA claimants to lose their right to bring
their cause of action in federal court by not taking action within the two year statute of limitations,
adversely affecting thousands of older workers. As a result, Congress ultimately passes legislation to
reinstate the rights of those older workers. At the congressional hearings on Clarence Thomas'
nomination to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Senator Metzenbaum noted that even since the special
law was enacted to take care of the cases upon which the EEOC failed to act, another 1,700 age
discrimination charges filed with the Federal agency and the State agencies under contract to the EEOC,
which were not covered by the law passed in 1988, had not been processed within the necessary 2-
year statute of limitations and were thus lost claims in federal court. Senator Pryor, chairman of the
Aging Committee also has spoken on the floor on the recurring problem of inaction by the EEOC and
State agencies and the serious consequences to the individuals who lost their Federal rights to sue for
age discrimination.

          Not only did Thomas allow such losses to elderly workers, the EEOC adopted positions that
contradict the letter and spirit of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). Often the EEOC
sided with the employer in cases involving early retirement plans with programs that coerce older workers
into taking early retirement, plans the ADEA was formed to prohibit. For example, in Paolillo v. Dresser
Industries Inc.. 821 F.2d 81 (2d Cir. 1987), the EEOC filed an amicus brief in support of the employer to
request a modification of the decision, after the plaintiffs had prevailed. The EEOC supported a higher
standard for demonstrating coercion and argued that plaintiffs should carry the burden of proof regarding
voluntariness.
                                       663

         Also in opposition to elderly workers interest was EEOC regulatory policy. For example, prior to
1987 an employer had to receive EEOC approval in order to ask an employee to waive ADEA. In 1987
the EEOC issued a rule permitting waivers that were knowing or voluntary without EEOC approval, shifting
the burden of proof of showing coercion to the employee and destroying the barriers to waiving ADEA
rights. That is, the effectiveness of the ADEA was weakened. As a result of severe objection by senior
citizens groups, Congress placed riders on the 1988, 1989 and 1990 EEOC appropriations to prevent
implementation of the rule, yet Thomas continued to state that EEOC supervision of waivers was unduly
burdensome for the EEOC, employer and employee.

          The American Way stated the following in its letter regarding Thomas' D.C. Circuit confirmation
hearings to Senator Joseph Biden, Chair of the Judiciary Committee:

          Mr. Thomas' record has been marked by an unwillingness
          to vigorously enforce the laws protecting older
          workers...[c]onstant Congressional vigilance and
          prodding has been necessary to ensure that the EEOC
          fulfills even its most basic obligations under the ADEA.

          Equally disturbing was Mr. Thomas' response to Congress, which was evasive as to how many
age discrimination claims were lost.

7) Thomas was Evasive to Congress and Retaliated Against EEOC Employees Who Aided
Congress.

          In Congress' investigation of the lapsing of age discrimination cases problem, it called upon
Thomas to reveal how many cases had lapsed due to the lack of EEOC action. First Thomas responded
that 78 cases had lapsed. He later revised that figure to approximately 900, then 1608, then over 7,500,
and finally over 13,000. Simultaneously, he refused to provide Congress with the necessary documents
for its independent determination. As a result, the Senate Aging Committee had to subpoena certain
EEOC records to get a full accounting of the lapsed cases.

          In addition, after talking to the press and Congress about the EEOC's failure to process
backlogged age discrimination cases, Lynn Bruner, a district director in the EEOC's St. Louis office,
received an unsatisfactory performance review in 1988 criticizing her for talking "to the press on a
national and volatile issue' and that her quotations 'present the chairman in a negative lighf. The Office
of the Special Counsel commenced investigating whether Thomas' plans to demote Bruner constituted
retaliation (which, as the Chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights
and Chair of the House Select Committee on Aging stated would be a violation of federal law). Less
than a month before President Bush announced Thomas' nomination to the Court of Appeals, Thomas
sent her a memo that although he believed no EEOC officials had treated her unfairly, he was dropping
plans to demote rter13.

          Another example is that of Frank Quinn, director of the Los Angeles office. Thomas attempted
to transfer Quinn to Birmingham two months prior to his retirement because Quinn had allegedly made
statements to the press critical of agency policy. Quinn filed court action claiming retaliation and
successfully prevented the transfer.

                                         Judge Thomas' Record on the Bench

          We hesitate to read too much into such a small record. We note only his possible desire to

        The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (including members from the Wall Street
Journal, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Walter Cronkite, Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw, and more)
took special note of the demotion proposal in its report to the editor of 3 July 1991.

combat crime at the expense of privacy rights by ruling in favor of questionable searches and seizures,
as well as warrantless searches, and his tendency to rule against environmental concerns. Both are
areas of great concern to the Institute. The fact that his record is so brief is also of great concern since
clearly there are other much more well qualified and experienced judges currently on the bench whom
President Bush would find agreeable. Nonetheless, politics, rather than judicial experience, seems to
be the primary criterion for Bush nominees.

                                                Criminal Law and Procedure

          Judge Thomas held the following in United States v. Halliman. 923 F.2d 873 (1991): 1) Exigent
circumstances justified the warrantless search of a hotel room even though police officers were informed
about the suspect's use of the room before leaving the police station to go to the hotel, and had
obtained a warrant to search three other rooms which the suspect had rented. 2) Officers had an
'independent source' for the drugs and other evidence seized so that defendant's invalid consent was
not fatal to admissibility; and 3) Even though drugs found in the hotel room were admissible only against
one of the two defendants, the district court did not err in refusing to sever their trials.

          In United States v. Harrison: Unites States v. Black: United States v. Butler. 931 F.2d 65 (1991),
Judge Thomas rejected defendant Butler's argument that there was insufficient evidence to convict him
of using or carrying a firearm during a drug crime. Even though the only firearms confiscated were on
the persons of the other two defendants, Butler had constructive possession of a gun because he could
have either easily obtained a gun or instructed the others to use one.

                                                      Environmental Law

          In Citizens Against Burlington v. Federal Aviation Administration. 1991 U.S. App. LEXIS 12036 (June
14, 1991), an alliance of individuals living near the airport contended that the FAA violated several
environmental statutes in failing to consider the alternative sites. Judge Thomas rejected this argument,
finding that the FAA's action was not arbitrary and capricious under the applicable statutes even though
it did not consider the feasibility of alternative sites. In Judge Buckley's dissent-in-part, he stated that
the FAA had 'sidestepped its obligations' to prepare a detailed statement on alternative courses of action.

          In Cross-Sound Ferry Services. Inc. v. Interstate Commerce Commission. F.2d, 1991 WL 73244
(May 10, 1991), the court upheld the Interstate Commerce Commission's decisions that the transportation
service in question was a ferry service' and thus exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction. Judge
Thomas concurred in the decision but dissented on the issue of Cross-Sound's standing. He held that
Cross-Sound could not challenge the Commission's decision under either the National Environmental
Protection Act (NEPA) nor the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA). Yet the majority stated it had
"serious doubts' about Judge Thomas' interpretation of the national transportation policy which led to
Judge Thomas' legal conclusion on standing.

          Because Thomas allows his political philosophy to interfere with his upholding of the law, we
must also carefully examine these views.

                      THOMAS' SPEECHES AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY: THOMAS'
                             RECORD REVEALS THAT HE OFTEN IS NOT WILLING
                             TO UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION AND ESTABUSHED
                                    LAW WHICH IS CONTRARY TO HIS BEUEFS

          Thomas' lack of enforcement of the law which he was to uphold and blatant opposition to the
rights of those he was to protect reflect his political philosophy as clearly expressed in his speeches and
interviews. Time and again, Thomas' record demonstrates his ability to ignore law contrary to his beliefs.
Willfully or not, Thomas has consistently applied the Constitution and laws of the United States in a

                                                                 10
                                        665

manner detrimental to civil rights. We believe he will continue this practice to the detriment of the civil
rights of those who come before the Supreme Court and the millions of others adversely affected.
The Fundamental Right to Privacy

          Shortly after President Bush announced the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S.
Supreme Court, the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) and Catholics for a Free Choice
separately stated their opposition. NARAL stated that the Senate has an obligation to uphold the U.S.
Constitution and thus must 'refuse to confirm Judge Thomas unless he explicitly repudiates the positions
he has taken against the right to privacy and affirmatively states his support for the principles protected
in Griswold and Roe .

          In his June 18th, 1987 speech to The Heritage Foundation, Thomas specifically praised Lewis
Lehrman's essay on "the Declaration of Independence and the Right to Life' as a 'splendid example of
applying natural law". Lehrman's essay referred to Roe v. Wade as "a spurious right born exclusively of
judicial supremacy without a single trace of lawful authority, implicit or explicit, in the actual text or history
of the Constitution itself". Thomas' agreement with such an essay reveals that he blatantly fails to
recognize the Constitutional right to privacy. How far he would let M§ view of 'natural law' cloud his
ability to uphold the Constitution, we shall regret discovering through the tyranny it will place on individual
rights.
Affirmative Action

          Besides his direct action at the EEOC contravening affirmative action, Thomas has made
numerous comments clearly stating his opposition to affirmative action. Apparently tired of the criticism
for his anti-affirmative action policies, he stated "I am tired of the rhetoric - the rhetoric about quotas and
about affirmative action. It is a supreme waste of time. It precludes more positive and enlightened
discussion, and it is no longer relevant . He even compared affirmative action to South African
apartheid:

          those who insist on arguing that the principal of
          equal opportunity...means preferences for certain
          groups have relinquished their roles as moral and
          ethical leaders in this area. I bristle at the
          thought, for example, that it is morally proper to
          protect against minority racial preferences in South
          Africa while arguing for such preferences here .

          He stated in his speech to the Heritage Foundation on "Why Black Americans Should Look to
Conservative Policies' that under the Reagan Administration, "we began to argue consistently against
affirmative action. We attacked welfare and the welfare mentality. These are positions with which I
agree", and in the same speech he stated that he had "lived the American dream; and that I was
attempting to secure this dream for all Americans'. Clearly Thomas has worked extremely hard against
poor odds. But can Thomas really believe affirmative action did not help him overcome some of the
discriminatorily placed obstacles he faced, such as his entrance into Yale Law School? Does he not
regard this nomination as a quota fulfillment?

         Griswold v. Connecticut protected the right to use contraception. Roe v. Wade protected the
fundamental right to choose.

          In this same speech, he referred to the state-enforced segregation, under which he was raised,
as not only a lack of government support, but the complete opposite, governmental opposition to his and
other's exercising of their individual rights. To this we strongly agree; clearly such repressive practices
constituted governmental opposition. Yet his actions against the elderly and affirmative action constitute
government opposition to the rights of individuals in another fom.

          It seems that Thomas' personal success has blinded him to the needs of others. Though he was
raised under institutionalized racism and class discrimination, he stated the following in the same speech
about his household:

          [it] was strong, stable, and conservative...[t]hose
          who attempt to capture the dally counseling, oversight,
          common sense and vision of my grandparents in a
          governmental program are engaging in sheer folly.
          Government cannot develop individual responsibility,
          but It certainly can refrain from preventing or hindering
          the development of this responsibility.

          He even stated the following:

          I, for one, do not see how the government can be
          compassionate, only people can be compassionate
          and then only with their own money, their own property
          and their own effort, not that of others.

          Does Thomas believe those living without such a sturdy family life, or perhaps living in an abusive
family should not receive government assistance? Will his tendency to ignore the Constitution and laws
of the U.S. which are contrary to Ns political philosophy prevent him from protecting these people's
rights?

          Lulann McGriff, president of the San Francisco, California branch of the NAACP stated this
concern clearly:

          It serves us no good for someone to come from a
          humble background and not understand how he got
          where he is - through the blood, sweat and tears
          of other Afro Americans.

          In the same speech to the Heritage Foundation, Thomas stated 'equality of rights, not of
possessions or entitiements, offered the opportunity to be free, and self-governing'. What does such a
right mean when not supported by the means to enjoy thatright,when not supported by a Supreme Court
of the United States that will protect these rights?

                                                         CONCLUSION

          Even more than his minimal judicial service, Judge Clarence Thomas' record of EEOC leadership
shows he is not qualified to rule in the Supreme Court of the United States. This is evidenced by his
undermining of the effectiveness of the law he was to uphold for eight years, his failure to carry out
statutorily - mandated responsibilities, his attempts to weaken employee selection guidelines used to
prevent adverse Impact, his failure to follow Supreme Court precedent, his opposition to the civil rights
of women, his disastrous record regarding therightsof elderly workers, his evasiveness to Congress and
his retaliatory actions.

          Numerous cMI rights groups have raised serious doubts about his ability to serve and numerous

                                                         12
                                        667

groups actively oppose his nomination. In a press release dated July 7, 1991, the League of United Latin
American Citizens (LULAC), the oldest and largest Hispanic organization in the United States, stated the
following.

            [Thomas] has shown by word and by deed to be
            insensitive to the Issues of concern to Hispanics
            such as affirmative action, equal employment opportunity,
            and civil rights protection.
            Because of his decisions ignoring laws contrary to his beliefs, persistently demonstrated as the
EEOC chair, we see no evidence that Thomas will not continue to let such insensitivity to civil rights
obstruct his reading of the United States Constitution and laws.
            While we look forward to the day when the Supreme Court is representative of the people whom
it serves, we must bear in mind Thurgood Marshall's comment regarding his successor, that we must
beware of 'a black snake as well as a white snake - they both bite". Both by word and deed, Thomas
has shown his disregard for the struggles and often bloody sacrifices which have resulted in the civil
rights advances of the last century.
            We Puerto Ricans have been and will continue to be a part of that struggle and will therefore
oppose Judge Clarence Thomas, or any other United States Supreme Court nominee, who puts at risk
the ideals and values we treasure most.

                                                                  13

ON THE NOMINATION OF CLARENCE THOMAS TO THE SUPREME COURT

SEPTEMBER 1991

         Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, thank you for the
opportunity to testify on the nomination of Clarence Thomas to
the Supreme Court. As the president of Business and Professional
Women/USA, I speak on behalf of working women across the nation
who strongly believe that Clarence Thomas should not be confirmed
to the Supreme Court.

         BPW/USA was founded in 1919 to improve the status of women
in the workforce and continues today to be the world's preeminent
organization for working women. BPW/USA is a diverse bi-partisan
organization of men and women of all racial, ethnic, and
religious backgrounds who are brought together by their common
interest in promoting economic self-sufficiency, equity, and full
participation for working women. Comprised of 100,000 members
in 3,000 clubs nationwide, BPW/USA is represented in every
Congressional district in the United States.

       The United States has reached a juncture where many of the
advances realized by working women over the past several decades
are threatened. There is a real danger of these advances being
diluted or eliminated completely by laws that make it difficult,
worthless, or even impossible to prove discrimination. BPW
believes America needs a Supreme Court Justice who understands
the necessity for and the appropriate role of the law in
addressing the broad issues of discrimination and injustice.
Simply speaking, Clarence Thomas is not a worthy heir to Thurgood
Marshall's legacy.

         Clarence Thomas undoubtedly knows great personal struggle,
and I join Americans across the country in recognizing Judge
Thomas for his ability to overcome the tremendous obstacles he
has faced. I agree that his personal story is truly compelling
and moving. Unfortunately, his story of a successful rise from
an impoverished childhood is still all too rare.

         Today, however, we must determine whether Clarence Thomas is
qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. And although his
background may give him unique insight, we must look beyond this
to determine what his personal experiences have taught him, and
whether he is qualified to serve on the SuDreme Court.
                                 669

         As business professionals, we view the nomination process as
being similar to the hiring practices of a private corporation.
Clarence Thomas is applying for an important and powerful job,
and the Senate is the interviewing team. The selection of a
Justice is much more significant, however, because unlike elected
officials and other workers across the nation, the person who is
selected to sit on the Supreme Court will be there for a
lifetime. Once confirmed, no one has the authority to fire a
Justiee--not the President, not Congress, and not the American
people. I encourage you to carefully scrutinize Clarence Thomas'
record, for this may be the last job application he may ever fill
out.

       /

         You have heard from many distinguished witnesses, as well as
Judge Thomas himself, who have discussed many issues with you.
Unfortunately, however, numerous questions remain and new
questions come to light as a result of these hearings. Judge
Thomas has made a calculated effort to avoid questions, give non-
answers, and deny his past record. As elected officials, you are
held accountable for vour record. and BPW asks that you hold
Judge Thomas accountable for his.

         While we do not expect Judge Thomas to prejudge the cases he
may hear if confirmed to the Supreme Court, his legal
interpretation of the Constitution is not only a valid question--
but it is a critical part of the nomination process. The framers
of our Constitution conferred upon the U.S. Senate and the
President equal roles in the selection of Justices to sit on the
U.S. Supreme Court. It is simply one of the checks and balances
established to balance the power among the branches of
government. The Senate is no more obligated to defer to the
President on judicial appointments than the President is
obligated to defer to the Congress on legislation. We all know
that the President has repeatedly exercised his right to veto
legislation passed by Congress.

         Furthermore, BPW is concerned about the ease with which
Judge Thomas cast away his previous writings, endorsements,
speeches, and comments during the confirmation hearings. He
dismisses many of his controversial views as the musings of a
"part-time political theorist." On other occasions, Judge Thomas
discards his comments as insincere, claiming that they were made
simply to win the trust of his audience. With this in mind, I
must question the honesty of his testimony before the Judiciary
Committee.

         Having traditionally supported and sought to protect
individual rights and freedoms for all people--and particularly
for women--BPW members unanimously passed a resolution to oppose
the confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.
BPW's opposition to the confirmation of Clarence Thomas is based
on four concerns: his limited qualifications; his views on the
right to privacy; his contempt for Congress and existing laws;
and his opposition to equal opportunity.
                670

QUALIFICATIONS

Like many of you, I was taught that the Justices of the

Suprene Court Here sore of the nation's "best and brightest."

They were people who exhibited a thorough understanding of the

legal systen, our laws, and our Constitution, and their extensive

knowledge of the judicial system was to be adnired and respected.

Unfortunately, I do not believe Clarence Thonas has this

comprehensive experience...and his peers agree. As you know, the

American Bar Association has given Judge Thomas the lowest

"qualified" rating it has--the lowest rating of any Supreme Court

nominee in the history of the ABA rating system.        This

"qualified" rating is similar to the rating that Judge Thomas

received when he was first nominated to the federal bench in

1990. However, since being on the court, Judge Thomas' ABA

rating has actually declined, with two ABA board members now

calling him "unqualified" to sit on the Supreme Court.

         Judge Thomas has limited experience with Constitutional law
and limited experience in the judiciary, having served on the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for
less than eighteen months.. At this critical stage in the
development of law and policy, we need a Supreme Court Justice
with significantly more experience.

RIGHT TO PRIVACY

         BPW is also concerned about Judge Thomas's views on the
Constitutional right to privacy. Although Thomas has refused to
clearly state his position on basic individual rights and
reproductive freedom while testifying before the Judiciary
Committee, his previous record paints a clear picture. He has
been critical of the constitutional right to privacy as it is
stated in the Grisunld decision, which provided the foundation
for Roe v. Hade.

         Throughout his work, Thomas has advocated a consideration of
"natural" or "higher" law in interpreting the Constitution. He
praised Lewis Lehman's article "on the Declaration of
Independence and the right to life" as "a splendid example of
applying Natural Law." While this provides considerable
information on his predisposition toward a woman's right to
choose, it also invokes a theory, Natural Law, which has long
been used to prevent the advancement of women on the basis of
their "natural" roles as mother and care-taker.

         Clearly, Judge Thomas' beliefs show evidence of a
willingness to restrict individual liberties, including a woman's
right to make her own reproductive choices. BPW members believe
that a woman can only be in control of her economic life in so
far as she is in control of her reproductive life.
                     671

CONTEMPT FOR CONGRESS AND EXISTING LAWS

         As an appointed official, Thomas demonstrated his disregard
for the laws that he was charged with implementing.
Specifically, Thomas failed to provide full and fair
interpretation and enforcement of existing civil rights laws
throughout his career.

         When Thomas headed the Education Department's Office of
Civil Rights (OCR), a federal judge found that OCR was both
misinterpreting and inadequately enforcing Title IX, the statute
that prohibits gender discrimination in federally-funded
education programs and institutions.

         Thomas served as the head of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1989. Despite
Congress' mandate that the EEOC initiate class-action suits in
employment discrimination cases, Thomas openly opposed such suits
and defied the Congressional mandate, allowing his personal
beliefs to interfere with his duty to uphold the law. Also as
head of EEOC, Thomas permitted the backlog of cases to double
from 31,000 to 61,686 and the delay in processing discrimination
charges to slow dramatically from five and a half months to nine
months. In fact, Thomas failed to process more than 13,000 age
discrimination claims before their statute of limitations ran
out, requiring Congressional intervention in order to ensure the
victims their right to prove discrimination and seek retribution.

         I find it unconscionable that our nation is considering
appointing a person to the Supreme Court who has such a blatant
disrespect for the law, legislative intent, and the legislative
branch of our government as a whole.

OPPOSITION TO EQUAL OPPORTUNITY

         BPW actively promotes full participation, equity and
economic self-sufficiency for all. Although Judge Thomas claims
to support these issues, as we say in the Midwest, "his talk
isn't his walk."

Despite the personal benefits Thomas derived from

affirmative action in his own admission to Holy Cross and Yale

Law School, Thomas puts his faith solely in personal self-

reliance. In embracing the idea of "pulling oneself up by the

bootstraps," Thomas seems to overlook some of the things that

distinguished him from other disadvantaged people in enabling him

to be self-reliant.  Certainly the loving, motivating and

hard-working example set by his grandparents, the $300 dollars

given to him anonymously which enabled him to take a reading

course, and his above-average intelligence contributed to his

success.

         In fact, Clarence Thomas has been an adamant critic of
efforts to ensure equal opportunity in the workplace. Not only
                                 672

did Thomas oppose most affirmative action plans as the head of
the EEOC, but he continued to oppose these plans even after
findings of discrimination. Thomas characterized a 1987 Supreme
Court ruling upholding an affirmative action program that
promoted female workers as "just social engineering" and stated
that he did not "think the ends justify the means." Under
Thomas leadership in 1985, the EEOC ruled that federal law does
not require equal pay for jobs of comparable value--a finding
that contradicts the Supreme Court's 1981 Gunther decision, and a
finding which is an affront to the working women of America.
Apparently, equality in the workplace is not something Thomas
sees as vital.

         Although significant strides have been made toward equality
in the workplace, discrimination against women and minorities
remains. Only one month ago, the U.S. Department of Labor
released a study that clearly documents a "glass ceiling" which
prohibits women and minorities from entering into top management
positions in companies. The study found this ceiling to be
pervasive throughout corporate America, and at lower levels than
previously believed.

         BPW continues efforts to work with corporations to develop
initiatives designed to enable women to break through the glass
ceiling, to encourage adoption of model programs developed by
leading edge companies, and to work with corporate America to
change employee attitudes toward women and minorities. These
efforts are not always successful, however, and lega^. remedies
must remain an option for women faced with discrimination--
partieularly in cases where the discrimination is deliberate and
intentional.

         We seek level playing grounds, not special treatment. And
we firmly believe that corporations with more women at the top of
their management structure will improve their bottom line. If 98
out of 100 U.S. Senators were HfljaeJi, if 98 out of 100 Directors
of Fortune 500 companies were women r if 96 out of every 100 CEOs
in America were women. I don't think the men in this country
would feel as though they were full participants.

         The judicial system, and in particular the Supreme Court, is
often given the task of sorting out the complexities of these and
other difficult problems and questions. The handling of these
societal problems is our nation's blueprint for the future. We
must continue on the path to a better society which permits equal
opportunity for all. BPW/USA believes that the confirmation of
Clarence Thomas would turn back the clock on important progress
already made toward this goal.

         BPW/USA strongly urges the Senate to oppose the nomination
of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. Again, thank you for
the opportunity for to share our views with you.

Natural Law and the Nominee

What Natural Law Does Clarence Thomas Defend?
by Anthony Battaglia

   Natural law is both familiar and strange. In its long history it has accumulated enough
shadings to be a part of several conversations at the same time -- among theologians,
philosophers, judges, lawmakers, social reformers, people on the street Natural law is an
integral element of our American political tradition, but it can be fraught with threats to
liberty, perhaps especially for women. The Declaration of Independence contains three
strands of natural law thought: sweeping transcendent claims, the enunciation of natural
human dignity, and specific rules of natural morality. All three generate controversy on
theoretical grounds. All have practical consequences that are troublesome.1

   The ringing phrase "The Law of Nature and of Nature's God," inscribes the most
fundamental ~ and most abstract - natural law idea into our national consciousness. The
most elevated of natural law theories explain the way in which morality is a part of the
universe itself. They usually run philosophy and religion together so that they are really
indistinguishable. The writers of the Declaration appeal to a moral authority so great that
it legitimizes the political rebellion the document announces; no merely human authority
can withstand such power. This transcendent kind of natural law claim provides a basis
for civil law, but it also suggests that civil law can be overridden. It is the most abstract
and also the most powerful kind of natural law.

   The middle level of natural law is articulated in the Declaration's often quoted phrase,
"... that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain
unalienable rights." While still abstract, this middle kind of natural law assertion is more
firmly within the realm of human investigation. In this context we find the most familiar
                                        676

natural law vocabulary, the language of rights developed in the late 17th century and
associated with English philosopher John Locke.

   This central category, abstract but not transcendental, is the area where most discussion
of natural law in legal theory takes place. The Bill of Rights takes its name and content
from this kind of natural law and has enshrined appeals to natural rights in the American
tradition. A characteristic reverence for this kind of language has recently popularized
discussion of the "rights" of animals, the "rights" of nature, etc. Such new applications of
what is essentially old language show the vitality of a certain kind of natural law theory.
Nevertheless, the language of rights is at best metaphorical when taken out of the context
of civil law, from which it sprung.

   The third strand of natural law in the Declaration, the most specific, is the kind which
tells us what human behavior is natural (and therefore moral) and which is not It is
established in the phrase,"... that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness..." This is the area of greatest difficulty, not only historically and theoretically,
but also with regard to a specific nominee to the high court like Judge Clarence Thomas.2
Here the airier elements of natural law come down to earth. Despite frequent assertions to
the contrary, even in natural law the influence of history and culture is unavoidable. More
than we sometimes think, claims to what is natural - and therefore naturally moral -- must
be adapted over time. Thus, for example, John Locke (and more recently, Pope Leo XIII)
thought that private property was a matter rooted in the law of nature. With greater
caution, the writers of the Declaration confined themselves to the far vaguer formula we all
know. They did not assert a natural right to property but rather to the "pursuit of
happiness."

   The problem with this third line of thought -- specific rules -- is in the determination of
what is natural. It is easy to become too specific and describe particular behavior as

                                                          2
                                         677

natural - and therefore good ~ when it is actually only what we are used to, the actions
that "come naturally" to us, even though they are shaped unavoidably by our class, race,
gender, and so forth. If we do that, we elevate the practices we grew up with, or which are
unquestioned in our particular society, into nature itself. The unreflective judgments of
people on the street can thus become enshrined in high sounding moral theories. If these
opinions and prejudices were simply the matter of street corner and dinner table
conversation, they would be of little interest to us. But they are not They have politically
powerful advocates. Personal moral convictions are easily transformed into judgments
about how everyone should behave, and natural law seems to facilitate this transformation.

   Qtizens, of course, will differ on definitions of moral behavior. And each of us has the
right to promote his or her morality according to the democratic political process. It is not
the valid application of democracy that is troublesome here. But in choosing justices for
the Supreme Court, we are deciding who shall be the final interpreters of what the law
means. We should take care that we are not inviting interpretations of the law which
short-circuit the democratic process in the name of inappropriate ideas of natural morality.

                                                   II
   Nowhere has the danger of turning prejudice into law been more real than in the
matters of human sexual and reproductive behavior. A brief history exposes the
background of this danger. Concepts similar to our notion of natural law can be found in
many different cultures. Our present-day usage goes back to ancient versions in both
Greek and Roman cultures. The Greek Stoics held a variation of transcendent natural law -
- it provided them with an understanding of the reason in the universe and a belief that
morality was a part of the nature of things. The Roman version, much more juridical and
less philosophical, institutionalized a universal "law of nature" that underlay the diversity

                                                    3
                                         678

of laws among the many peoples of the empire. This law of nature was very vague, and
often seems to have been a combination of what we would call due process and a generous
dose of common sense.1

   Natural law was not a widely used category in the middle ages until relatively late. It is
rightly associated with the most important intellectual of the era, St Thomas Aquinas. He
used natural law as a bridge between the churchy, authority-based morality of the time
and an ethic based more on ordinary experience. It was both traditional and reasonable. It
was a daring move and had far-reaching effects. St Thomas's understanding of natural
law was that it is our human, intelligent, "sharing" in the "eternal law" of the universe.2

   But along with his convictions about the moral nature of the universe, he found room in
his system for an application that has been invoked ever since as a justification for all sorts
of highly questionable prescriptions about sexual and reproductive morality. When
dealing with human sexuality, St Thomas invoked a phrase that came to him from Roman
times, the saying of a second century Roman jurist named Ulpian, that natural law
included "what nature teaches all animals."3

   Even to us, so many years later, this formula has a familiar ring. But underneath its
apparent clarity, it actually tells us nothing. In nature, a wide variety of mating habits
abound. And animal behavior in other respects - with regard to aggression, for example-
is not normative for humans. We have difficulty specifying what in nature justifies the
exclusive emphasis upon the possibility of reproduction in each and every sexual act that
became the meaning of the phrase in the Medieval Christian tradition. Moreover, this
emphasis on reproduction was made the justification for lifelong monogamy, for the
submission of women to men, and for absolute prohibitions of various lands of sexual
activity that abound in observable nature even though nature does not follow these rules.
What the phrase was taken to mean was much more specific than the words themselves

                                                          4
                                        679

would indicate -- an early example of the problems of natural law interpretation. What got
added to natural law as a result of this formula, in fact, was what the interpreter wanted to
add, the sexual/marital system in which men had more rights than women, and sexuality
was entirely oriented toward reproduction, a system that is often called simply
"patriarchy.11 Arguably, patriarchy is consistent with the social world of feudalism, in which
power seemed to flow downward from God to the King, and continued descending down
through the lower, clearly defined divisions in which human beings were organized -- the
very world view the Declaration of Independence would declare unnatural. But in
medieval times this pattern was the standard for everyone.

   The medieval understanding of human sexuality continued to be normative even here in
the United States until very recent times. A world in which women were not allowed to
vote and were expected to stay out of public life, where divorce was difficult and women
had littlerecourseagainst an abusive or philandering husband, where laws prohibited
contraception as well as adultery and fornication, not to mention homosexuality -- these
were all a part of the natural order of things that came down to us from our historical
forebears.

   Ideal natural law, not the nature that could be observed, pushed this morality into
something much more absolute than the evidence suggests. What was natural was not
merelyrecommendedor praiseworthy, but became a rule which allowed no blameless
exceptions. Natural sexual behavior was supposed to be perfect in a way not found in
nature and not forced on people in other areas of human behavior. The impossibility of
reading this system back into observable nature was simply ignored. The goal of
procreation - increasingly with emphasis on the very minimum, namely conception -- was
eventually taken by church authorities to be the single-minded aim of nature. From this
decision about the purpose of sexuality it was possible to define normal human sexual

                                                    5
                                         680

activity. Each and every sexual act was justified or condemned according to whether it
could be seen as leading to the impregnation of a woman. All other sexual morality fell
into place around this simplification.

  Even this brief summary of medieval sexual morality would be superfluous except that
this understanding of human life continues to influence the law in the United States even
today. Slogans like "a woman's place is in the home" harken back to this medieval moral
system and the belief that patriarchy is what "nature itself" teaches us.

  Cases that come before courts bearing on these issues involve the rights of women -- in
matters of rights to economic and legal equality, fairness and equal opportunity in the
workplace, as well as with issues of rights to privacy and the right to bodily integrity. The
emphasis on women's gender roles and the importance of childbearing has not led the
natural law tradition to be sensitive to such rights.

  Indeed, the idea of women's rights is highly suspect within the religious traditions most
likely to talk the language of natural law. The leadership of the Roman Catholic church
publicly opposes virtually any changes that would alter the familiar patriarchal sexual
morality outlined above. In many people's minds it is identified with natural law thinking
and its use of that tradition deserves at least a mention here. Two recent examples illustrate
the persistence of natural law reasoning in the sense of specific rules about sexual and
reproductive morality and the status of women. In 1987 the Vatican issued a policy
statement on Human Life and Reproduction that banned all forms of artificial fertilization,
even for married couples.4 Using deductive reasoning, the document relies upon "the
natural moral law" to arrive at its conclusions, a use of medieval methodology that was
criticized widely, even by mainstream Catholic commentators. For example, the document
states that medical technology cannot be a substitute for the "conjugal act" but must rather
be an aid to it Commentators were quick to notice that only one possibility fulfilled the

                                                    6
                                        681

stringent conditions the Vatican set out. The husband's sperm could be used in one (and
only one) kind of technology to assist fertility, as long as both contraception and
masturbation were avoided. The obligation imposed by "natural moral law" could be met if
the husband's sperm were to be gathered in a specific way: sexual intercourse in which a
perforated condom is used. To avoid masturbation, intercourse must take place; to avoid
contraception, an "unnatural sex act," in which a barrier to reproduction has been used, the
condom should be defective. (The use of condoms even to avoid the spread of disease is
not permissible in official Catholic teaching.) The regulations reveal how little the
medieval thinking involved has changed.

   In a second context, the U.S. Catholic bishops have been trying for several years to write
a national policy on the rights of women in the church. In formulating the pastoral letter,
the prelates gathered testimony from women in their dioceses. The bishops have been
hampered again and again by the Vatican, and their document has gone through a
number of drafts, each less egalitarian that the former.5 During a recent summons to Rome
for further consultations on the matter, the U.S. bishops were told that if they must write
such a statement, they should rely more upon the tradition -- the very natural law tradition
we have been talking about -- and less upon the real life testimony of actual women. In
that tradition, women have had no real power, not even nuns manage their own lives. The
exclusion of women from economic or political power in the secular world has been
extended within the church to exclusion from becoming priests and, unofficially, from all
forms of leadership roles. Asking women's opinions about such treatment would lead to
predictable demands for change; therefore their opinions should not be heard, Rome must
have thought As we see, natural law provides some partisans a way to bypass the
procedures of democratic lawmaking in the religious sphere. Rather than learning from
experience and from evaluating evidence, they seem able to leap effortlessly to the right

                                                    7
                                         682

conclusion. And then conclusions arrived at in this manner are often presented in secular
contexts as universal and natural rather than as the partisan statements they are.

  In fact, official Roman Catholic teaching can serve as an example of the problems
associated with natural law in many people's minds. The Catholic use of natural law
contrasts sharply with the use in the Declaration of Independence. Instead of questioning
the past in the light of the best reasoning in the present, the opposite occurs too often: the
past is given special authority as more natural than the present Moreover, the
administrators of the church often write and speak as though they had special access to the
law of nature and special privileges to be its interpreters. Transcendent natural law is seen
as reinforcing the specifically religious elements of the Catholic tradition and extending the
authority of church officials to all humanity. Natural rights and dignity have occasionally
been called upon in new ways to establish the rights of workers, but more often than not
these rights are seen as proving that the way things have been done over the centuries are
in accord with nature itself.

   These errors do not characterize all Catholic uses of natural law, but such usage is
frequent enough. It is the kind of natural law thinking that worries those who recognize
the strengths of natural law but who also see that it can be used to resist change and to
preserve the authority of those who already have power. No application of natural law is
immune to abuse.

                                                   Ill
  Many people, not only Catholics, think of natural law only as specific rules. Judge
Thomas's present relation to the Catholic church is unknown, but a good deal of his
education took place in Catholic schools and in a Catholic seminary. When he refers to
natural law, we should reflect on the context in which he is likely to have learned about it

                                                    8
                                         683

Questions that must be answered about the candidate's adherence to natural law theory
then become clear. What exactly are the human rights that natural law explains? Are
there such rights that override the body of civil law? What are they? What is the
relationship between secular law and the natural law? Does Judge Thomas's adherence to
a natural law standard mean that he can -- or even must ~ disregard the duly constituted
laws of the land in order to preserve the natural law as he understands it? The possibility
of judicial activism in defense of a natural law must be probed.

   Knowing the judge's position is especially vital in light of the many cases facing the
court involving the rights of women, especially in the context of reproduction, the rights of
gay people, issues regarding sterilization, issues of discrimination based on pregnancy, and
the like. The tendency to describe some actions as natural and others as unnatural - and
to try to turn these descriptions into law -- continues in our society, even outside the
context of Roman Catholicism. In some such cases, parties have claimed a right to privacy
or some other right grounded in their dignity as persons. The climate of decision-making
in such cases is made more emotional and less rational because of the claim that
homosexual behavior is unnatural or the assumption that pregnancy is natural and moral
while abortion is not

   Along with the problem of knowing in too much detail, there is the problem of knowing
too certainly. Among its many uses, natural law calls us to behave according to a morality
written in the nature of things. It also tells us that any law that is not in accord with
nature is provisional, suspect, even immoral. As is commonly said in the natural law
tradition, "An unjust law is no law at all." Here the usually cool voice of human reason
speaks with the fiery urgency of the biblical prophets. This truly revolutionary use of the
law of nature is, in fact, the use to which the founders put it in 1776; the law of nature
entitled them to declare their independence from England. Such an example may lead us

                                                          9
                                         684

to forget that appeals to nature have been used for other, undesirable purposes. True,
Martin Luther King, Jr. used natural law arguments to explain that segregation violated a
higher law. But his opponents had exactly contrary convictions, that nature did not intend
races to interact as equals. The Greek philosopher Aristotle, in a lapse from his usual
reliability as a guide to ethical behavior, concluded that non-Greeks -- Barbarians, they
were called -- were naturally inferior to Greeks, were "natural slaves" in fact.1 This
assertion has been cited by racists through the centuries.2 Nothing human is beyond
corruption; natural law theory is no exception.

   The majesty of natural law has been the source of a certain dynamism in the American
political tradition. Belief in natural law has even served as a source of hope for
improvement in the future. But in case after historical case we are reminded that it does
not lift us out of our ordinary human condition. A decade after writing the reverberating
words of the Declaration of Independence that insist so stirringly on human equality,
Thomas Jefferson was all too aware of the limitations of that document Thinking about
slavery, he wrote "I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just"3 It was not the
prospect of the Christian Last Judgment that worried him - countries have no standing in
that vision -- but natural consequences, ones that would, in time, include the Civil War,
and that continue with us to this day.

  After all, no matter how revolutionary and "natural" they wanted to be, the Founders
were locked into the mindset of their own time and place. The "all men" that the Creator
had endowed with such "unalienable rights" as "liberty" turned out to be, sad to say, only
white males. Indeed, not even all white males. It was only the ones who belonged to the
propertied class who would be given the vote in the original constitution thirteen years
later. We can learn a great deal about the limitations of natural law, whether dealing with
political equality or sexual morality, by noticing the context in which it entered American

                                                   10
                                         685

political life. The road to universal suffrage and human equality stretched out on a strife-
torn and bloody road ahead of the Founders, though they did not know it The road
stretches out ahead of us still. The Declaration of Independence thus turns out to be an
exemplary natural law document not only in its strengths, but also in its weaknesses.

   In assessing the qualifications of Judge Thomas for the Supreme Court, it will not be
enough to gauge whether or not he believes in natural law as a lofty generalization. We
need much more specific information about what his adherence to a natural law
philosophy actually means. Does Judge Thomas believe that human dignity extends
equally to women as well as men? Or does he believe the opposite, that women have a
special responsibility to stay at home and raise children and that economic and social
equality would undermine their natural childraising mission? Does he believe that he can
decide on the basis of abstract theory that abortion is wrong? Where does he, in fact, differ
from the natural law sexual morality that is so controversial in our society? Abstract
adherence to a natural law perspective can seem as American as the Fourth of July. The
nominee should be asked to go beyond such abstractions to explain the real impact of
natural law convictions on his understanding of individual rights. What does he really
think of the natural sexual morality and natural gender roles?

   It is not natural law as such that is the problem here. In fact, the enforcement of these
pre-modern roles does not deserve to be included within natural law today. They are no
more natural than the theories of the divine right of kings that flourished at the same time
as that earlier, less democratic use of natural law. We should not elevate to the Supreme
Court judges who would defend a medieval understanding of human beings in the guise
of an otherwise honorable tradition.

   1. Among the many books on natural law available, three could usefully serve as further
introduction. John Courtney Murray, S.J., We Hold These Truths: Catholic Reflections on
the American Proposition (Garden City: Doubleday Image, 1964), remains the classic work
combining the best of the American and the Catholic versions of the tradition. A.P.
D'Entreves, Natural Law [2nd Edition; London: Hutchison, 1970), is a useful historical
introduction to the philosophical issues, while Paul Sigmund, Natural Law in Political
Thought (Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1982), provides the orientation its title
promises. In addition, see Anthony Battaglia, Toward a Reformulation of Natural Law
(New York: Seabury, 1981), for a fuller version of the author's position.
   2. Judge Clarence Thomas's ideas on natural law are set out in his lecture at the Heritage
Foundation, June 18,1987, "Why Black Americans Should Look to Conservative Policies."

   4. The full text of the Vatican document banning "artificial reproductive methods was
published in The New York Times, March 11,1987. The next day, "Catholic medical

to avoid the ban as described. "It shows how precise is the Catholic teaching," said one
authority. (New York Times, March 12,1987, p. B-ll). Jesuit Richard A McCormick was
not the only Catholic to "find such casuistry debasing and repugnant" (America, March 28,
1987, p. 248).

         If I were given the opportunity to appear before the Senate
Judiciary Committee, I would say - This is a great moment in
history for me and the social group from whence I come to be
present and testify on the question: Whether or not Clarence
Thomas should be confirmed by the advice and consent of the
United States Senate?

         A commonality of Southern, ethnic and religious heritage
preordained my alignment in support of judge Clarence Thomas, it
is easy for me to empathize with clarence Thomas since we both
have deep roots from the same geographic section of the deep
South. I, one of eleven (11) sons and two (2) daughters of
Edward, a railroad attendant and Katheryn, a housewife, became a
product of an education struggle by parents whose total
commitment in the rural area of Kingstree, South Carolina was to
educate all of their children through college; they achieved this
level and in addition, most have received post graduate
professional degrees. Or, in the Clarence Thomas1 case, in
excerpts taken from his commencement address, Savannah state
College, June 9, 1985, he states that "I watched the strongest
man in the world endure so that he could raise his two grandsons,
aa that he could make something of his life; and s_o_ that his two
grandsons (my brother and me) could do the same with ours. I
watched a quiet strong grandmother slave away in the kitchen,
                                     689

clean house, cook and endure, so we could make it. I watched
through a child's eyes as my young mother, Nisa Mariah, Miss Bee,
Niss Gladys, Miss Gertrude, Cousin Hattie, Cousin Bea, Cousin
Julie all worked countless hours in other peoples' kitchens, with
aching feet and pain filled heads for little pay and no
benefits - but they endured so that we who watched them could
make it."

         Though there were degrees in the manner in which harsh
segregation rules and laws were administered and though these
harsh segregation policies and laws put a different strain on the
impact that each of us felt by virtue of their placing a
different tenor on the same experience; nevertheless, the
oppression struck our hearts and souls the same way.

         Also, we were both directed and guided to a pathway of
necessity for pursuing an education to its fullest extent as a
way to escape total destruction and ultimately, to reach a
highway to a meaningful and successful life.

         To be sure, we are now parked in the State of Virginia; for
Clarence Thomas, it was Pin Point, Georgia and for me, it was
Kingstree, South Carolina. It has been said of such experiences
that we have had that they are not worth a "nickel"; however, I
would wager that neither Judge Thomas nor I would be willing to
sell all of these experiences for a million dollars.

         Similarly, both of us are lawyers, though our law degrees
were earned at different law schools, his at Yale University Law
School and mine at Howard University School of Law. Contrary to
                                     690

any Other school of thought in our social group, X, like Clarence
Thomas, subscribe to the theory that there is a way to succeed,
and if you trill, promote "Civil Rights", without being per ae,
offensive. These methods are unique for they do not embrace or
countenance with "selling out" our social group.

         The protagonist for our social group who so vociferously
hollows "no confirmation" contends that you must offend "The Han"
in order to pursue "Civil Rights". Let us be a little mindful of
1st Peter, 2nd Chapter, verses 4 thru 9 - "coming to Him as to a
living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and
precious." it is thusly said that

                    "The stone which the builders rejected
                     Has become the chief cornerstone. "

 A warning, we must be careful not to kill the messenger.
         Notwithstanding other non-ethnic voices opposing

confirmation, we must look to the body politic of America
Majority who don't find Clarence Thomas per se, offensive to them
as a Supreme Court justice. For this reason, these various
Interest groups have to depend and rely upon the protagonist from
our ethnic group to pull "their chestnuts out of the fire for
then, lest they would seriously offend their own body politic."

         in closing, what I have come to sayt I stand absolutely for
the confirmation of Clarence Thomas as an Associate Justice of
the United States Supreme Court. Bis confirmation is in the best
interest of all of the people of the United States.
                                      691

       The naysayers or dissenters will ultimately come to learn
that the United States Senate, if it finds it to be its proper
discretionr exercised a wise judgment in its confirmation of
Clarence Thomas as history unfolds itself. This is my faith in
my brother from the South, a black man, a good role model for our
little boys and girls...

Introduction

        The National Committee on Pay Equity (NCPE), formed in 1979, is a coalition of
labor, women's and civil rights organizations working to eliminate gender- and race-based
wage discrimination and to achieve pay equity. Since its inception NCPE has monitored the
activities of federal agencies on the issue of wage discrimination. We have testified at
congressional oversight hearings, met with agency policymakers, and commented on agency
policies regarding wage discrimination. Based on its experience in monitoring the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission under the leadership of Chairman Clarence Thomas,
NCPE has grave concerns regarding the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S.
Supreme Court. Accordingly, we believe that Judge Thomas' record on the enforcement of
the laws prohibiting wage discrimination while EEOC Chair should be carefully scrutinized.
Pav Equity

         The term pay equity means that compensation for jobs should not be based on the race
or sex of workers, but according to legitimate job factors such as skill, effort, responsibility,
and working conditions. Although the term pay equity has been used interchangeably with the
term "comparable worth" for the proposition that race or gender should noj be a factor in
setting wages, opponents have attempted to describe "comparable worth" as an esoteric notion
involving the intrinsic value of jobs. Pay equity, quite simply, is a remedy for wage
discrimination based on race or sex. Wage discrimination can be challenged under the Equal
Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
                              695

The EEOC and Wage Discrimination
The EEOC Prior to Judge Thomas. Prior to Judge Thomas' tenure as Chair, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission played an active role in the movement to end wage
discrimination and to achieve pay equity. Under the leadership of Eleanor Holmes Norton, the
Commission held extensive hearings on wage discrimination. Further, the Commission
helped shape litigation strategies to enforce Title VII's ban on wage discrimination and filed
amicus curiae briefs in support of workers charging sex-based wage discrimination under Title
VII in County of Washington. Oregon v. Gunther. 452 U.S. 161 (1981) and WE v.
Westinghouse. 631 F. 2nd 1094 (3rd Cir. 1980). Finally, the EEOC commissioned a National
Academy of Sciences study on gender-based wage discrimination.

         In 1981 the Supreme Court held in Gunther that Section 703 (h) (the "Bennett
amendment") of Title VII did not limit sex-based wage discrimination claims to those
involving substantially equal work (an Equal Pay Act limitation), but rather was meant to
prohibit discrimination in pay even where the jobs being compared were totally different. The
Court made clear, however, that the fact that two different jobs were of equal value or
"comparable worth" (based, for example, on a comparison of the skill, effort, responsibility
and working conditions) did not necessarily prove a violation of Title VII. Rather, the
plaintiffs would have to produce evidence to show that the disparity in pay resulted from
discrimination. The Court also stated that it was not dealing in Gunther with the issue of

   Hearings before the United States Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission on Job Segregation and Wage

Discrimination. Washington, D.C. April 28-30, 1980.

                     696

"comparable worth". The Court stated that the affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act
were incorporated in Title VII, but it did not explain what evidence would be necessary to
establish that the disparity in pay resulted from race or sex discrimination.

        After the Gunther decision the EEOC under the leadership of Acting Chairman J. Clay
Smith, Jr. issued a 90 day notice on September 15, 1981 to the agency's field offices. The
notice provided important information on the Gunther decision and on how to investigate
charges of wage discrimination. The policy also identified several issues which were to be
considered "non-CDP" (non-Commission Decision Precedent). Among these were "claims of
sex-based wage discrimination brought under Title VII that may be based on... 'comparable
worth'". Although the notice stated that the Gunther decision had left unclear the likelihood of
success or failure of "comparable worth" claims, it did make clear that wage discrimination
charges were to be investigated thoroughly.

   The Court referred to "comparable worth" as a concept "under

which plaintiffs might claim increased compensation on the basis

of a comparison of the intrinsic worth or difficulty of their job

with that of other jobs in the community". 452 U.S. at 166.

However, there was no evidence heard by any court in Gunther on

"comparable worth".

         interviews in which actual job duties are described;

         wage disparity, the EOS should obtain copies of the

         disparity, determine the underlying factors relied upon by
         the employer and the methods the employer used to determine
         the market wage rate;
         8. If union collective bargaining agreements are the basis
         for the sex-based wage disparity, the EOS should obtain

The EEOC Under Judge Thomas. Judge Thomas became Chair of the EEOC in May of
1982. The Commission's efforts to eliminate wage discrimination came to a standstill. Under
Judge Thomas' leadership, the EEOC did nothing with the wealth of information acquired
from their earlier hearings, except publish the transcripts. Nor did the Commission act on the
results of the NAS study, which documented the extent of wage discrimination and provided
guidance for evaluating sex bias in job evaluation systems. The agency was positioned after
the hearings and the study to take a variety of actions. It could have, for example issued
findings or implemented new initiatives to alleviate wage discrimination. It did neither.

        The Commission did renew regularly the 90 day notice. However, it appeared that
even the 90 day notice was not being carried out. In the field, charges were mishandled; they
were dismissed for no cause, or were not investigated at all.

In 1983 NCPE issued a set of Recommendations to the EEOC, in which we called upon the
Commission to:

         1. Vigorously enforce the "90 day notice" in order to provide adequate guidance to
                  field regarding the identification and processing of gender-based wage
                  discrimination charges under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.

         2. Give specialized review and processing to wage discrimination charges.
         3. Establish a mechanism to ensure that wage discrimination charges received by

                  field offices are referred to EEOC headquarters so that proper monitoring could
                  take place.
         4. Provide, on a quarterly basis, information to NCPE regarding wage
                  discrimination charges and cases.
         5. Establish an EEOC Headquarters Task Force that would target wage
                  discrimination cases for possible litigation, ensure that wage discrimination
                  cases are a Commission priority, and designate individuals in headquarters who
                  would be responsible for review of all wage discrimination cases.
The EEOC declined to follow any of our recommendations.
         The Subcommittee on Manpower and Housing of the Committee on Government
Operations, concerned that all activity on wage discrimination ceased after the appointment of
Clarence Thomas to EEOC, held oversight hearings on February 29 and March 14, 1984 and

policy for handling such cases. NCPE provided a copy of the 90-
day notice to the individual so she could show it to the
 investigator in Chicago.

      National Committee on Pay Equity, "Summary of Recommendations
         to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission" (1983).
         700

issued the following finding on May 22, 1984:

        The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has taken no action on charges and
        cases of sex-based wage discrimination other than straight Equal Pay Act cases, since
        the June, 1981 Supreme Court decision in Gutuher determined that charges involving
        dissimilar jobs could be brought under Title VII. At the time of the Subcommittee
        hearing, EEOC had no policy on handling these types of cases, yet the Commission
        believes it needs to adopt such a policy before any charges can be processed and cases
        can be filed. By its insistence on a policy in this area prior to taking action and then
        refusing to adopt a policy, the Commission has denied relief to victims of
        discrimination and has failed to provide guidance for the courts and for employers in
        this area.5

        On May 1, 1984, in a likely response to the Subcommittee's investigation and

impending report, the Commission adopted Section 633 of the Compliance Manual, which

clarified for field staff how to investigate and handle some wage discrimination charges.

Section 633 divided all wage discrimination charges into three categories: equal pay for

substantially equal work, intentional wage discrimination and "comparable worth" charges.

Section 633 instructed field staff to continue sending all "comparable worth" charges to EEOC

Headquarters. The Commission also submitted a written response to the Committee Report.

However, three years after the Gunther case was decided, the EEOC had still not taken a
definitive position on how to handle wage discrimination charges involving jobs that were
different under Title VII.

        In 1985, the Commission finally issued a "Commission Decision Precedent," which it
characterized as its "first decision on comparable worth." The charge at issue alleged that a
municipal housing employer paid the administrative staff (85% female) less than maintenance
staff (88% male) even though the duties performed by the women required equal or more skill,
effort, and responsibility than those performed by men. The female employees also charged
that the employer intentionally set wage increases for female-dominated jobs at lower levels
than the prevailing rate of increase for such jobs in local municipal agencies, while giving men
wage increases that equaled the prevailing rate for their jobs. The EEOC found that the case
was a "comparable worth" case and thus not within the agency's jurisdiction. "

         NCPE disagreed with this decision. We challenged the adequacy of the investigation,
which led to the decisions, as well as the overly restrictive reading of Gunther. * * The 1985

         The EEOC adopted the Gunther terminology regarding
"comparable worth" as claims involving "increased compensation on
the basis of a comparison of the intrinsic worth or difficulty of
their job with that of other jobs in the same organization or
community." Gunther. 452 U.S. at 166.

decision went too far in categorizing all charges where there is no evidence of intentional
discrimination as "comparable worth" charges. It appears that after the Commission issued the
198S decision, field investigators did not investigate wage discrimination charges that were
filed. Instead, they turned away charging parties who alleged wage discrimination because
they were paid less than comparable male-dominated or predominantly white jobs on the
theory that the agency lacked jurisdiction to handle such cases. Because these cases were
turned away for lack of jurisdiction, they could not be appealed under the EEOC's
"Determinations Review Program," which allowed charging parties to appeal "no cause"
decisions to EEOC headquarters. Charging parties, including those individuals alleging
intentional wage discrimination, were thus denied access to EEOC's administrative process
because intake officers were encouraged to treat these charges as "comparable worth" charges.

         For example, in wage discrimination charges brought by the Fairfax Library
Association against Fairfax County, the EEOC dismissed the charge because "...comparable
worth is not an issue over which the agency has jurisdiction." This decision was made
notwithstanding the fact that charging parties specifically alleged that "Fairfax County
intentionally discriminated against me on the basis of sex in compensation and other terms and
conditions of employment." In declining even to investigate this and other potential wage
discrimination charges the Commission failed to follow federal court precedent. In every
wage discrimination lawsuit where defendants have attempted to characterize claims as
"comparable worth" claims, the courts have denied motions to dismiss complaints. c

         Even Equal Pay Act litigation languished while the EEOC was under the leadership of
Judge Thomas. The Equal Pay Act standard is clear and uncontroverted. Yet the number of
Equal Pay Act cases that EEOC filed in court fell from 79 cases brought in fiscal year 1980 to
just 7 cases in fiscal year 1989.

Conclusion
         As Chair of the EEOC, Judge Clarence Thomas was charged with enforcing the laws

against employment discrimination. The record clearly demonstrates that in the area of wage
discrimination, he failed to adequately enforce the laws for which he had primary
responsibility. He was regularly called before congressional oversight committees who had to

constantly prod him to take action.
        Judge Thomas, and the EEOC during his tenure, treated wage discrimination cases as a

political issue in which he adopted opponents' overly restrictive distinctions between wage
discrimination and comparable worth. By focussing on issues such as the "intrinsic value" of
different jobs rather than on the need to eliminate wage discrimination, the EEOC under the
leadership of Judge Thomas failed to address the needs of working women and their families.
Instead of exhibiting leadership in the elimination of discrimination from wage setting systems
in this country, Judge Thomas gave voice to those who would deny women and people of
color fair pay for their work.

        The Center for Law and Social Justice (CLSJ) at Medgar Evers College, CUNY,
strongly opposes the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the United States Supreme
Court. CLSJ is a legal research and advocacy institution which conducts litigation and public
policy projects on matters involving pressing civil and human rights issues. CLSJ is opposed
to Thomas's nomination because 1) lie is blatantly unqualified to hold the position, 2) he is
incapable of separating his political views from jurisprudential precedent, and 3) his
nomination is an affront to all who have struggled and continue to struggle for realization of
the democratic ideals on which this country is supposed to be based. For these reasons,
which are more fully explored below, we urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject
Clarence Thomas as a candidate for the United States Supreme Court.

                                            QUALIFICATIONS

       Although Judge Thomas may be qualified to serve as a Supreme Court justice in the
view of President George Bush, his nomination represents a cunning plan to place a lifetime
appointee with a black face on die high court whose primary qualifications are his race and
an apparent oath of fealty to an and '-civil rights, affirmative action, and abortion rights
agenda. Long after Mr. Bush is gone from office, America, especially Black America, will
feel the devastating diminution of civil and individual rights which Judge Clarence Thomas
will affect, if confirmed.

       Clarence Thomas is a product of Catholic elementary and secondary schools. He
attended St. Benedict die Moor, an all-Black grammar school run by white nuns, one of
whom still refers to die students she taught as "nigger children."1 These early years impacted
greatly upon Thomas's development, instilling botii a strong affinity for die work ethic
espoused by die nuns, and die negative stereotype of Blacks as niggers. Self-hatred and die
resultant desire not to be identified by his race would become an obsession for him and a
recurring theme throughout his life.

       For example, he took great pains to avoid being identified as a Black student while at
Yale Law School, sitting in die back of classes and opting to take courses such as tax and
business law that he felt would in no way invoke issues related to race. Upon graduation
from Yale, he intentionally avoided contact with any work that would associate him with
                           709

racial issues. He even went so far as to tell an interviewer that accepting a job at an agency
that focused on civil rights, such as the EEOC, would irreparably ruin his career.2 Needless
to say, Thomas was able overcome his disdain for race issues when it proved advantageous to
his careen rejecting an offer to join the White House policy staff handling energy and
environmental issues and four months later accepting a position as head of the Office of Civil

Rights in the Department of Education. Ten months later, in 1981, President Reagan named

him chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the same agency he predicted

would ruin his career.  '

       Thomas's attitudinal shifts, which suggest opportunism, are also evidenced by his sharp
change from a liberal Democrat to a conservative Republican. Note that he was a registered
Democrat, having voted for George McGovem in 1972, but switched to the Republican party

shortly after accepting a position with then Missouri Attorney General, John Danforth in
1974. One wonders if Thomas would have switched so quickly had he received prestigious
law firm offers like so many of his classmates? Or if the Missouri Attorney General had
been a Democrat? It appears that Thomas was as eager to please those who seemed to accept

him as he was eager to distance himself from Blacks. In essence, Judge Thomas seems to be
an individual who has longed to be accepted by whites on their terms and in their institutions.
He seems to feel ashamed by the discrimination and racism Black Americans have
experienced, much as an abused child experiences anger and shame for their parents' abusive

behavior.

While at the EEOC, he acted as an anchorless ideologue, sitting on thousands of

lawsuits and rejecting goals and timetables while publicly stating that his reservations were
                                     710

"purely personal."3 These practices serve as predictors of future performance and foreshadow
what could be a four decade tragedy on the Supreme Court

        Judge Thomas's record on the federal bench is not much better. He has served for just
over a year and has written 20 opinions that do little to distinguish him with respect to legal
philosophy or judicial skills. If confirmed, Judge Thomas would have less legal experience
than all but one other Justice and would have less actual judicial experience than all who
have preceded him on the Supreme Court4 By his own admission, he does not have an
"individual, well-thought-out constitutional philosophy" and has told colleagues that he wished
that this nomination had come five years from now.5 The American Bar Association gave
him its lowest acceptable rating and two members rated him as "unqualified."6 He obviously
lacks the necessary qualifications, particularly when compared with other Black jurists. For
example, Amalya Kearse, a noted litigator, a former partner in a major Wall Street law firm,
and a long-standing member of the Republican Party, has been a federal appellate judge for
over a decade. Similarly, Judge Harry Edwards, who sits on the same circuit as Thomas, is a
former professor at Harvard and Michigan Law Schools, has published several books on the
law, and has also sat on the bench for nearly a decade. There are others, but the main
difference between Thomas and these jurists, aside from their superior qualifications, is his
vociferous opposition to civil rights and affirmative action. These factors not only disqualify
him, but also make him a dangerous choice for the Supreme Court because they demonstrate
a lack of judicial sensitivity to those classes traditionally protected by the Constitution.

                                                LEGAL PHILOSOPHY

        The political views of a candidate for the Supreme Court are relevant only to the extent
that those views influence the candidate's legal philosophy and thereby reveal the degree to
which the candidate, if confirmed, will engage in judicial activism. In reviewing Judge
Thomas's record, it is clear that his political ideology is his legal philosophy. It is also clear
that his ideology often contravenes established constitutional law.

        For example, Judge Thomas has asserted repeatedly his belief in a natural rights or
natural law basis for individual rights. According to Judge Thomas, "...the thesis of natural
law is that human nature provides the key to how men ought to live their lives....[o]ur
political way of life is by the laws of nature, of nature's God, and of course presupposes the
existence of God, the moral ruler of the universe, and a rule right and wrong, of just and
unjust, binding upon man, preceding all institutions of human society and of government." 7
These fundamental rights of nature are derived, according to Thomas, from the Declaration of
Independence which proclaims the existence of "inalienable rights" such as life and liberty.

        Judge Thomas's natural rights philosophy is an outright rejection of positivism which
declares that the law is only what is set forth in the Constitution, statutes, or court decisions.
Positivism has been the basis of our legal system for at least the last century. Yet, as Judge
Thomas would have it, there exists some, as yet, undefined body of rights which nature has
bestowed upon humans, and, to which, even the United States Constitution must defer. Who
determines what these rights are and their scope? Apparently, they are whatever Judge
                                        712

Thomas says that they are. Not surprisingly, this has caused concern among many legal
scholars and among those who fear that a woman's constitutional right to choose abortion will
be viewed by Thomas as inconsistent with his naturalrightstheory.

       Unfortunately, those fears are not unfounded. Judge Thomas has been quoted praising
an article authored by Lewis Lehrman who argued that natural law mandated that abortion be
outlawed.* Lehrman proclaimed that fetuses have a God-given inalienable right to life which
supersedes a women's constitutional right to privacy as articulated by the Supreme Court in
Roe v. Wade.9 Thomas found Lehrman's article to be "a splendid example of applying
natural law" with no criticism of the fact that it contravened established constitutional law.10
That Judge Thomas opposes abortion is obvious, but, irrelevant More important is his
inability to set aside his personal views in the face of constitutional mandates. Yet, this is
precisely what a jurist, particularly a Supreme Court jurist is required to do as an integral part
of the position. S/h£ must uphold the law as established by the Constitution, statutes and
judicial precedents. To ignore constitutional protections whenever one's politics differ, is
wholly inappropriate behavior for a Supreme Court justice. In articulating his natural law
philosophy, Thomas demonstrates his contempt for legal precedents and his unworthiness to
sit on this country's highest court.

       Thomas's contempt for the law is evidenced also by his conduct while chairperson of
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) during 1982-1989. During his
tenure, the EEOC intentionally failed to pursue class based discrimination cases." On
Thomas's order, regional EEOC attorneys failed to include goals and timetables in case
settlements, and failed to enforce the goals and timetables established in existing settlement

                                                        8
                                        713

decrees.12 This dereliction of duty attitude which the agency adopted under Thomas directly
mirrored Thomas's political views on affirmative action. Thomas has been quoted as saying
that he is "unalterably opposed to programs that force or even cajole people to hire a certain
percentage of minorities."13 In his view, affirmative action programs breed dependence and
stigma. Apparently believing his personal views to be above the law, Thomas ignored
statutory and judicial precedent authorizing the use of goals and timetables as remedial
measures for proven class based discrimination. Indeed, so blatant was his refusal to uphold
and enforce the law, that it prompted five members of Congress to openly protest, stating that
the "Commission is forfeiting the most effective tool to combat centuries of
discrimination."14

        It took the urging of Congress and no less than three Supreme Court decisions
upholding the use of affirmative remedies, to induce Thomas to agree to change the
Comission's policy back to pursuing class based discrimination.15 During the eight years of
Thomas's reign at the EEOC, the backlog of cases rose from 31,500 to 46.000.16 The
number of cases closed due to inadequate investigation rose 30 percent17. But, the worst
representation provided by the EEOC undeniably was that given to age discrimination claims.
The EEOC was not merely reluctant to bring these claims, but openly hostile, allowing 13,000
such claims to perish due to lapsed statutes of limitation18. Thomas was forced to admit
responsibility for this atrocity in testimony before Congress on the abominable performance of
the EEOC. Yet, even his admission was tainted since Thomas, on two occasions, told
Congress that the number of stale age discrimination cases was only 78 or a few hundred'9.
If Thomas is unafraid to place his politics above the law while in a position from which
                                         714

dismissal or removal is relatively easy, then is there any reason to expect that he would not
do the same or worse as a Supreme Court justice who serves a life tenure? Ethical questions
about Thomas's judicial demeanor have already surfaced despite his short tenure on the
federal bench.

        For example, recently, Judge Thomas ruled that Ralston-Purina did not have to pay a
$10.4 million fine or attorney fees imposed for false health benefit claims it made about its
Puppy Chow products20. Senator John Danforth owns at least $7.5 million in Ralston-Purina
stock, a company founded by his grandfather, and his brothers are on the board and control
almost 5% of its shares21. Judge Thomas and Senator Danforth are close friends. Indeed,
Sen. Danforth hired Thomas in 1974 as an assistant attorney general while Danforth was
attorney general, and again in 1979, Danforth hired Thomas as his legislative assistant Sen.
Danforth actively aided Thomas's nomination to the federal appeals court, and upon request
of President Bush, is personally guiding Thomas through the present confirmation hearings.
It would seem if for no other reason than good judgment, that Judge Thomas would have
recused himself from ruling on a case which so deeply involves Sen. Danforth and his family.
But, good judgment aside, judicial ethics require a judge to disqualify himself or herself from
a case whenever the mere appearance of impartiality might be questioned. In this instance
Judge Thomas not only failed to recuse himself, but he also wrote the opinion which threw
out the fine against Ralston-Purina. Once again Thomas's disdain for the law reveals itself.
Clearly, this is not appropriate behavior for any judge, and it would be most abhorrent in a
Supreme Court justice.

                                     POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS
       It is no surprise that President Bush has nominated a conservative judge to replace
Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court. Indeed, Bush only follows in the footsteps
of past presidents by offering someone who is like-minded to himself. Rather, what makes
the nomination of Clarence Thomas so distasteful, is the fact that it is actually insulting to
Blacks. Thomas's concept of the self-help doctrine not only denies his personal reality of
benefitting from the civil rights movement and affirmative action policies, but also denies the
societal reality in which Blacks die disproportionately more than whites, receive far inferior
educational training, and generally suffer from the ills of poverty to a greater degree than
whites.22
       Moreover, Thomas's nomination is insulting because it constitutes a bastardization of
affirmative action. Affirmative action regarding race is supposed to mean that employers,
educators, etc., may consider race as a positive factor in their hiring and admission practices.
Such policies are necessary to overcome centuries of discrimination during which Blacks and
other people of color and women have been shut out from jobs and schools. Affirmative
action has not meant, as its opponents would claim, that race is the only factor to be
considered to the exclusion of other qualifying criteria. Yet, both opponents and proponents
of affirmative action must declare that Judge Thomas's nomination is nothing more than a
perversion of that policy. Since Judge Thomas lacks sufficient qualifications to be a Supreme
Court justice, there can be no other reason for his nomination but the fact that he is Black.
       Judge Thomas's role on the Supreme Court would be to give legitimacy to attitudes,
beliefs, and ideals that absolve anyone other than Blacks of responsibility for the current state

                                                        11
                                         716

of that community. He would be the point person on all issues concerning race and, if past
performance is any predictor of future performance, would not fail to deliver opinions that
resonate primarily in the conservative community. If there were any chance that Judge
Thomas would do anything other than what Senator Danforth and other conservatives in this
country expect, he would not be before the Senate Judiciary Committee today, and he would
not currently be on the federal bench. Thomas's identification with and desire for acceptance
from whites assures us that he will eagerly adopt whatever stance or opinion will make that
acceptance a reality.

                                                      CONCLUSION
        If Judge Thomas is confirmed, he could well be a jurist shaping laws that will affect
the lives of our grandchildren. His nomination represents a reward for a lifetime of faithful
service to those who have advanced his career, rather than the ideals of the offices for which
he was chosen. His role will be to hold back the civil and human rights tide as America's
complexion rapidly darkens in the coming century. Judge Thomas is contemptuous of those
who would taint his accomplishments with their inability to do all he has done. He has
limited judicial experience and legal scholarship and ironically represents what white
conservatives fear most about affirmative action: a Black person who obtained a position
over more qualified whites solely because of his race.
         Judge Thomas's prior legal experience and political ideology are outstanding only to
the extent that they so vividly demonstrate his unworthiness to sit on this country's highest
court. CLSJ strongly encourages the Senate Judiciary Committee members to question Judge

Thomas vigorously concerning his ability to uphold the Constitution given his failure to do so
while chair at the EEOC, his willingness to acknowledge the appropriateness of class based
remedies for proven systemic discrimination, and his understanding of how the natural law
thesis relates to the Constitution and the rights and protections which derive from i t It is our
belief that after a thorough investigation into these matters, the only possible conclusion is
that Judge Thomas's nomination should be rejected.

            Washington, D.C. 20510

            Dear Senators:

            We write to express our strong support for President
            Bush's nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to be an
            associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United
            States.

Judge Thomas sees a vigorous yet defined role for the judiciary.
He wrote in 1989 of "a judiciary active in defending the
Constitution, but judicious in its restraint and moderation." The
courts, in his view, are one of several players in our political
system. Legislatures, both federal and state, are another.

As the Washington Post (7/14/91, p.C3) recently observed, states
are increasingly having to grapple with serious issues and problems
we once thought the federal government or an unelected judiciary
would handle for us. In many ways, however, this avoids the
accountability that is essential to a vital and participatory
political process.

We believe that with Judge Thomas on the Supreme Court, the
political process will be more active, all people will have more
choice about how they wish to be governed, and we as state
legislators will be able to do our job better. Wholly apart from
his views on specific issues, Judge Thomas' judicial philosophy
gives the people more of a say in how things are run. Self-
government, after all, is the genius of America.

Judge Thomas brings a virtually unique set of personal and
professional qualities to the Supreme Court. He is literally a
product of the American dream. We urge your committee and the full
Senate to consent to his appointment.

Sincerely,
                              720

A UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICA

               An analysis of
President George Bush's nomination of

       CLARENCE THOMAS
    to be an associate justice on the
  Supreme Court of the United States

                    A UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO AMERICA

        On July 1,1991, President George Bush exercised his power under Article II, Section
21 of the U.S. Constitution and nominated U.S. Circuit Judge Clarence Thomas to be an
associate justice on the Supreme Court of the United States. He would replace Thurgood
Marshall, who announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, after 24 years on the Court

        This preliminary analysis and any that follow are intended to assist the Senate in
fulfilling its constitutional role of advice and consent

                                  THE NOMINEE'S BACKGROUND

        This analysis bears the title "A Unique Contribution to America" because Clarence
Thomas would bring to the Supreme Court, and hence to America, a unique combination
of personal and professional experience. His personal background of growing up poor in
the segregated South differs from that of any sitting Justice. His professional record of
work in both private and public law practice, in both state and federal government, and in
all three branches at the federal level, is practically unique. This first section reviews
Clarence Thomas' background.2

         Clarence Thomas was born with the assistance of a midwife on June 23, 1948, in a
small wood frame house in the rural town of Pinpoint, Georgia, nine miles southeast of
Savannah. His father left while Clarence was still a toddler and Clarence saw him just once
during his childhood. For nearly seven years, Clarence lived in the house where he was
born with his mother, her aunt and uncle, and Clarence's older sister and younger brother.
That house had no indoor plumbing and the family shared an outhouse with several
neighbors. They carried water in buckets from a common pump. The women of Pinpoint
typically cleaned houses for whites who lived nearby and the men were day laborers.
Everyone worked.

         Clarence started the first grade at the segregated Haven Home School in 1954, the
same year the Supreme Court declared segregated education unconstitutional in Brown v.
Board of Education.3 Mid-way through the school year, Clarence and his brother Myers
moved to Savannah to live with their mother. They lived in one room of a tenement with

             Article II, Section 2 states in part that the President "shall nominate, and by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, shall appoint..Judges of the Supreme Court"

a common kitchen and common toilet outside. Their mother worked long hours as a maid,
making $20 every two weeks. Clarence completed the first grade at Florance Street School,
though he had poor attendance and often wandered the Savannah streets.

        In the summer of 1955, Clarence and brother moved again to live with their
maternal grandparents, Myers and Christine Anderson, who had an ice delivery and fuel oil
business. Myers Anderson had gone to the third grade and Christine Anderson had a sixth
grade education. Mr. Anderson was a proud, disciplined man who believed that everyone
who could work should work. He had never known his own father, and his mother died
when he was just nine years old. He lived first with his grandmother, who he said was freed
from slavery as a young girl, and then with his uncle, a hard man who led a family of about
16 children. Myers Anderson's hard life, without father or mother, no education, in an era
of segregation and Jim Crow laws, made him determine that his grandson would learn how
to work and to survive, no matter what happened in the world around them.

         All of life in the world of Clarence's youth was segregated. Schools, libraries, water
fountains, movies, lunch counters, and public restrooms were segregated. One time, the
family was traveling and stopped for gasoline. Myers Anderson asked whether his wife
could use the restroom. When the attendant said there was no "colored" restroom, Mr.
Anderson replied that if his wife could not use their restroom, he could not use their gas.

         Clarence and his brother worked with their grandfather delivering fuel or whatever
else he was doing. During the school year, they had to be dressed and ready for work at
3:00 p.m., half an hour after the close of the school day. They worked in the yard, on old
houses their grandparents owned, on trucks and cars, painting, roofing, and plumbing.
Clarence's grandfather taught them that they could do anything. During 1957-58, they
helped build a house on some family farm land and then began to farm, clearing land and
raising chickens, pigs, and cows. They built garages, barns, and fences, plowed, hauled logs,
and raked hay. They worked from sun-up to sun-down since their grandfather believed that
the sun should never catch anyone still in bed. If the boys ever slept past sun-up, their
grandfather would observe that they must have thought they were rich since a poor man
could not afford to sleep that late.

         Clarence's grandparents were honest, hardworking, and deeply religious people.
They taught the boys decency and respect for others. For example, Clarence and his
brother were never allowed to refuse to do an errand for a neighbor or to argue with an
adult. They were to address adults in a respectful manner. And honest, hard work was the
constant lesson. Myers Anderson told his grandson that if they did not work they did not
eat. He reminded them daily of his goal to "raise them right," to teach them "to do for
yourselves." He wanted them to be self-sufficient, able to survive in a hostile, segregated
world where the odds seemed so heavily stacked against them.

         Clarence and his brother Myers attended St. Benedict's Grammar School, a
segregated Catholic school, and were taught by Franciscan nuns. They missed just one-
half day of school during the years they lived with their grandparents. Their grandfather
felt Catholic schools were better because there was strict discipline, corporal punishment,
and school uniforms. He could not understand how children could properly be taught
                                    728

without these. Clarence also attended St Benedict's Catholic Church, where he served as
an altar boy and where the nuns also pushed the students to excel. They taught him that
all people are inherently equal.

         Clarence attended the segregated St. Pius X High School for the 9th and 10th grades
and in 1964 transferred to St. John Vianney Minor Seminary near Savannah, where he
repeated the 10th grade to take three years of Latin. He graduated in 1967 from St. John's,
where he was the only black student in his class - his first regular contact with whites. One
indication of his drive to excel at St. John's comes from the statement his classmates chose
to place under his year book picture: "Blew that exam, only got a 98."

         Clarence was the first person in his family to attend college. He spent his freshman
year at Immaculate Conception Seminary in Conception Junction, Missouri, and then
transferred to Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts. He graduated with honors
in 1971. At Holy Cross, he helped found the Black Students Union and served as an officer
for three years. He worked in the Free Breakfast Program and tutored in the Worcester
community. He financed his college education through a combination of scholarships, loans,
and work study income.

         From 1971-74, Clarence attended Yale Law School in New Haven, Connecticut. He
worked for New Haven Legal Assistance during school and for two summers. During the
summer of 1973, he worked for a small integrated firm back in Savannah financed, in part,
by a grant from the Law Students Civil Rights Research Council.

         John C. Danforth, then Attorney General of Missouri, hired Clarence as an assistant
in 1974. Three days after being sworn in as a member of the Missouri bar, Clarence argued
his first case before the Supreme Court of Missouri. Over the next 2 1/2 years, he
represented the state in many cases before all levels of the Missouri courts in matters
ranging from criminal law to taxation.

         From 1977-81, Clarence first worked in the legal department of the Monsanto
Company on general corporate legal matter including antitrust, contract, and governmental
regulations. Then he re-joined John Danforth, this time in Washington as a legislative
assistant to Senator Danforth. Clarence supervised work on issues including energy, the
environment, federal lands, and public works.

         President Ronald Reagan first nominated Clarence to be Assistant Secretary of
Education for Civil Rights in 1981 and a year later to be the eighth chairman of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission. He began service on May 17, 1982 and was
renominated and reconfirmed in 1986. For most of his tenure at the agency, Clarence was
a single parent. His first marriage had ended in divorce and he received custody of his son
Jamal. His second wife, the former Virginia Bess Lamp, is now a Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Labor.

                           I. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

                                        A. Enforcement philosophy

        Chairman Thomas' record at the EEOC has both qualitative and quantitative
dimensions. On the qualitative side, he implemented a fundamental shift of focus in
enforcement philosophy. The previous "rapid charge" approach was geared toward
negotiated no-fault settlements and was actually not enforcement at all, since no effort was
made to determine the merits of discrimination charges. Frivolous and meritorious claims
received the same treatment. Few cases were actually investigated and decided on the
merits. In fact, about 50% of charges brought to the agency were settled in this manner.

        The new chairman changed this philosophy to require that each discrimination
charge be investigated and, if necessary, litigated. This shifted the focus from generating
statistics to credible, effective enforcement of the civil rights laws. His approach sought to
maximize the relief available under the applicable statutes, eliminate discrimination from
the workplace, and make the discrimination victim whole.

         Making actual enforcement a reality required a series of policy initiatives. The 1984
Enforcement Policy required that all charges failing conciliation were to be forwarded to the
full Commission, rather than given to the staff. The 1985 Remedies Policy required seeking
maximum statutory remedies rather than minimum negotiated settlements. The 1987 No
Cause Review Policy allowed independent review of no cause determinations.

                                         B. Enforcement statistics

         On the quantitative side, the EEOC's record under Clarence Thomas' leadership
speaks for itself. The number of discrimination charges considered for litigation
authorization rose from 401 in fiscal year 1982 to 764 in 1988 and approximately 800 in
1989. The number of cases granted such authorization likewise grew from 241 in fiscal
year 1982 to 554 in 1988.

         Merit resolutions, including simple settlements and both successful and unsuccessful
conciliations, declined. Resolutions on the merits after full investigations, however,
increased from 38% of total resolutions in 1982, when Clarence Thomas became chairman,
to 50-60% by 1986-88. These statistics directly reflect the change in enforcement philosophy
discussed above. Table 1 following shows these statistics from before Chairman Thomas
took office and throughout his tenure.

        Under Chairman Thomas, the EEOC steadily increased the number of suits filed
and, by the close of his tenure, was filing more than at any time in the agency's history.

                                         under Chairman Thomas

        There can be no better testimony to Chairman Thomas' leadership, effectiveness, and
dedication to the cause of civil rights than the editorial appearing in the liberal Washington
Post on May 17, 1987. The Post lamented that the overall civil rights enforcement picture
was dismal. The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights "no longer seems to be fulfilling a
function" and the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights since 1984 "has been
unable to move against many kinds of discrimination that had been its responsibility
before."4 However, the Post cheered that "things are markedly different at the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission." The editorial offered as proof some of what has
been discussed here. Citing "the quiet but persistent leadership of Chairman Clarence
Thomas," the Post observed that "the caseload is expanding and budget requests are
increasing."

         The Detroit News noted that EEOC enforcement actions under Chairman Thomas
were 60% ahead of the pace under President Carter. "He also obtained more than twice
the level of damages collected during the Carter years," the News declared. Indeed, "Mr.
Thomas' EEOC processed an average of more than 15,000 age discrimination cases a year,
50 percent higher than the average under President Carter." Finally, the News opined that
the "hypocrisy of the left's attack on Mr. Thomas is revealed by the fact that under his
leadership the Reagan administration sought some $30 million more in EEOC funding
(1983-89) than Congress was willing to approve."5

                                         II. U.S. Court of Appeals

         President Bush announced his intention in early 1989 to nominate Clarence Thomas.
He did so on October 30,1989. The Senate Judiciary Committee finally held a hearing on
February 6, 1990 and voted 13-1 on February 22 to approve the nomination. The full
Senate consented to the appointment on March 6 by unanimous consent.

                                   A Endorsement of the nomination

         Just as he was appointed to the EEOC by a conservative President and received rave
reviews by the liberal media, Judge Thomas' 1989 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals
was endorsed by both conservatives and liberals.

             Clarence Thomas left his position as Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights in 1982.

        Paul M. Weyrich, National Chairman of Coalitions for America, stated the day after
the nomination that "[djuring more than seven years as chairman of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, Clarence Thomas demonstrated superb management ability,
leading that agency out of the doldrums in which it had languished."

the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, stated the same day that "I think this is a fine
appointment and that Mr. Thomas will add further luster and judicial ability to the Court."
To his legal abilities, according to Secretary Coleman, Judge Thomas "adds the drive and
understanding of human frailties which those who have not always had it easy had to have
to reach important positions of public service."

        Albert Nelson, president of the International Association of Official Human Rights
Agencies, stated on October 5 that "we believe that Chairman Clarence Thomas would
bring to the Federal judiciary a sense of fairness, a passion for fundamental commitment
to the rule of law, and a temperament that would bring great credit to our system of
justice." The IAOHRA represents "over 160 civil and human rights law enforcement
agencies...which receive, initiate, investigate, mediate, and resolve complaints of
discrimination in their individual jurisdictions." This organization is active in actual, hands-
on law enforcement and had continuous opportunity to observe and interact with the EEOC
under Chairman Thomas' leadership.

         Senator John C Danforth, Republican of Missouri, praised Clarence Thomas from
the floor of the U.S. Senate when he said: "I know him to be an absolutely first-rate lawyer,
and beyond that, I know him to be a first-rate human being."8

                                     B. Opposition to the nomination

         The civil rights establishment did not oppose Judge Thomas' nomination. The
Baltimore Sun noted that "the Leadership Conference [on Civil Rights] does not appear to
have arrived at a consensus."7 The Washington Times later observed that "[c]ivil rights
groups are not united in opposition."* The Associated Press likewise reported that the
Leadership Conference "has not adopted a position thus far."8 This was despite the fact that
President Bush announced his intention to nominate Judge Thomas more than five months
before; potential opponents had nearly half a year to probe, investigate, and analyze.

        The opposition that did surface was centered not on qualifications or the facts about
Judge Thomas' record as EEOC Chairman, but on ideological differences. Indeed, there
was "acknowledgement from both sides of Mr. Thomas' keen intellect,"10 and "Mr.
Thomas...is commonly described as brilliant."11 Rather, the opposition stemmed from a
liberal demand that Clarence Thomas walk in some kind of ideological lock-step. This
prompted Senator Danforth to urge his colleagues not to "attack Clarence Thomas because
of some stereotype of what they think a black lawyer should believe."12

         The nature of the opposition spoke volumes of its legitimacy. In a letter dated July
17, 1989, fourteen of the most liberal members of the U.S. House of Representatives
expressed "concern about the possible nomination of Clarence Thomas." Disregarding the
plain facts about the EEOC's enforcement record, this letter referred to "Mr. Thomas'
questionable enforcement record." Ignoring Chairman Thomas' successful effort to shift the
EEOC's enforcement policy toward accomplishing genuine law enforcement, the letter
contended that "Mr. Thomas has demonstrated an overall disdain for the rule of law." An
appropriate response was issued two days later by 52 members of the House in a letter
expressing "strong support for the nomination of Clarence Thomas." It stated:

                  The record of the EEOC speaks for itself, however, we would like
                 to point out that the number of discrimination cases processed
                 since Mr. Thomas became Chairman has increased significantly
                 as has the number of legal actions filed. This record of
                 achievement has taken place during a period of budget cutbacks
                 and a lower profile of the civil rights movement. Claims to the
                 contrary are nothing more than political posturing.

         To some, "the rule of law" means little more than "our agenda." The Washington
Times noted13 that in September 1989 a group called the Alliance for Justice told the
American Bar Association's controversial Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary that
Judge Thomas "has shown a disregard for the rule of law." The Alliance for Justice is a
paper organization devoted to enforcing conformity with the liberal political agenda. The
International Association of Official Human Rights Agencies, in contrast, is actually
involved with enforcing the civil rights laws, stated emphatically that "Chairman Clarence
Thomas would bring to the Federal judiciary a...passion for fundamental commitment to the
rule of law."

        Clarence Thomas has always been forthright and open about his personal positions
on civil rights issues. He has never attempted to change EEOC policies, however, in any
manner inconsistent with proper administrative procedures. This demonstrates a
commitment to, rather than a disregard of, the very essence of the "rule of law," though it
might not pass the ideological litmus test of some interest group.

        The Alliance for Justice's September 22, 1989 memorandum to the ABA assaults
Mr. Thomas' published articles for such deep and fundamental flaws as not citing enough
(by the Alliance's measure) cases or for failing to discuss the Alliance's preferred topics.
It says that he did not develop "a potentially substantive topic" and discussed others
"without linking them to his thesis." These are the comments of someone editing a college
term paper, not a meaningful substantive evaluation of an individual's qualifications for the
federal appellate bench.

                                          C. Judicial performance

        Judge Thomas' tenure on the appellate bench has allowed him to write opinions on
a wide variety of subjects including antitrust, civil procedure, constitutional law, criminal
law, labor relations, and trade regulation. These opinions are thorough, well-written, and
consistently observe the appropriate limits on the role of a federal appellate court. Their
breadth of subject matter required application of various kinds of authorities including the
Constitution, federal statutes, agency regulations, court decisions, authoritative texts and
treatises, and court records and transcripts. Judge Thomas' opinions certainly belie the
Alliance for Justice's outrageous claim to the ABA that he could not write well.
Summaries of representative cases follow.

                                                  a. antitrust

         United States v. Baker Hughes, Inc..'* In this decision for a unanimous bench,15 Judge
Thomas affirmed the district court's denial of an injunction sought by the United States
against a Finnish manufacturer's acquisition of a French manufacturer of underground
drilling rigs. He held that the district court was correct that the acquisition would not
undermine competition.

         Western Maryland Railway Co. v. Harbor Insurance Company.1'' In a decision for a
unanimous bench,17 Judge Thomas held that railroads suing insurers in two separate actions
were not indispensable parties in each others' lawsuits and therefore did not have to be
joined.

                                             c. constitutional law

         National Treasury Employees Union v. United States.TM In this case, federal employees
argued that a statutory ban on receiving honoraria violated their First Amendment rights.
Writing for a unanimous bench,19 Judge Thomas affirmed the district court's denial of a
preliminary injunction against the ban on the ground that the employees would not suffer
irreparable harm by complying with it. This allowed the constitutional challenge to the ban
to continue in the district court.

         United States v. Halliman.20 Writing for a unanimous bench,21 Judge Thomas
affirmed convictions for possession of cocaine and crack with intent to distribute. He held
that exigent circumstances justified a warrantless search of a hotel room, that officers had
properly seized drugs and other evidence even though a defendant's consent to search was
invalid, and that improper admission of drugs at trial against a second defendant did not
unfairly prejudice that defendant. This case involved multiple defendants, complicated
facts, and narrow points of law regarding search and seizure as well as joinder and
severance. During his extremely careful analysis, Judge Thomas was again careful to
identify questions he felt it unnecessary to answer22 and to explain how the law of his
circuit differed from that in other jurisdictions on important points.23

         United States v. Whole.2* A convicted drug dealer appealed, claiming entrapment.
Writing for a unanimous bench," Judge Thomas affirmed the conviction. He noted that
the "Supreme Court has stressed that the [entrapment] defense centers on...a person's
predisposition to commit a crime, not on the government's conduct."28 In this opinion,
Judge Thomas carefully explained the appropriate standard of review and avoided
answering unnecessary questions or addressing non-essential issues.

         United States v. Rogers." A jury convicted John Rogers of possessing crack with
intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school. Writing for a unanimous bench,2" Judge
Thomas affirmed the conviction. He rejected various arguments, among them that the trial
court improperly admitted evidence of the defendant's prior distribution of crack. In doing
so, he construed the Federal Rules of Evidence using "traditional tools" of statutory
construction and began, "as we do with any statute, with the language of the rules
themselves."29 He refused to stretch these rules beyond their intended scope.30 Finally, he
ruled that sufficient evidence supported the conviction. Again, Judge Thomas refused to
decide unnecessary issues.31

         United States v. Poston.32 In this appeal of a conviction for aiding and abetting
possession of the drug PCP, Judge Thomas, writing for a unanimous bench,33 addressed
several statutory, evidentiary, and constitutional issues before affirming the conviction.

                Id. at 214: "We need not decide here which interpretation of section 845a(a) is correct."
            32 902 F.2d 90 (D.C. Cir. 1990).

                Judges Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Lawrence Silberman joined the opinion.

                                       737

Judge Thomas was careful to note the limited nature of the appellate court's role34 and
rejected the invitation to contort a criminal statute to achieve a certain result.35 Even
though the defendant had retained a new lawyer just one day before trial began, Judge
Thomas rejected the argument that this constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. He
did so by a candid reading of relevant Supreme Court precedents,38 rather than making up
a rule of his own. This is a particularly careful, exhaustive opinion.

         United States v. Long.37 In this appeal of convictions for firearms and drug offenses,
Judge Thomas showed his attention to jurisdictional as well as substantive legal issues.
Writing for a unanimous bench,38 Judge Thomas refused to consider the arguments by one
appellant because her notice of appeal was filed one day late. He remanded her case to
the district court to decide whether she should be granted an extension.39 As is his
practice, Judge Thomas carefully outlined the limited role of the appellate court.40 In
reviewing the conviction for using a firearm in the commission of a drug offense, Judge
Thomas, after a very careful analysis, gave the word "use" a concrete and logical definition,
rather than a "loose, transitive" one.41 He then reversed the conviction on that count but
emphasized the narrowness of that conclusion: "[W]e reverse Long's conviction because the
government failed to adduce any evidence suggesting that Long actually or constructively
possessed the revolver."42 After rejecting the appellant's remaining claims, Judge Thomas
affirmed the conviction for possessing cocaine with intent to distribute.

              Id. at 94 (This court's role in assessing a sufficiency of the evidence claim on appeal is sharply

         Otis Elevator Co. v. Secretary of Labor.*3 This brilliant opinion is a model of judicial
restraint. A company servicing the elevators of two mining companies challenged citations
issued by a Mine Safety and Health Administration inspector for safety violations. Writing
for a unanimous bench*4 in this complicated case, Judge Thomas carefully avoided
answering unnecessary questions,45 sorted through difficult questions concerning application
of cannons of statutory construction,46 distinguished inapplicable precedents from other
courts,47 and declined the invitation to decide the case on purely policy grounds.46 Judge
Thomas first concluded that the elevator company was an "operator" within the meaning of
the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act. He then affirmed the citation received at one
mine after determining that the Administrative Law Judge's similar finding was supported
by substantial evidence.49 Finally, he refused to address the merits of the second citation
because the elevator company had failed to pursue proper procedures for contesting it
earlier.

reversed the district court's judgment awarding attorney's fees to Alpo, allowing the district
to redetermine the amount of damages.

        Other analyses of Judge Thomas' record and judicial philosophy will follow. This
preliminary report demonstrates that he will bring a unique combination of professional
and personal features to the Supreme Court of the United States.
        The arguments against his nomination to the Court of Appeals were laughable and
proven to be without merit. They have no more merit today. Indeed, he has added to his
impressive qualifications a set of outstanding opinions while a U.S. Circuit Judge. He
deserves swift approval.

                          A RESPONSE TO JUDGE THOMAS' CRITICS

        By now, everyone knows that President Bush's nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge
Clarence Thomas to replace Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall has caused some
controversy. Organizations have announced their support or opposition, though the former
outnumber the latter by about 3-to-l.1 The purpose of this report is to respond to the
central arguments raised by the opposition.

        Judge Thomas' opponents make the same fundamental errors we have seen in past
nomination battles. The left cannot distinguish private opinions on policy or politics from
an individual's judicial philosophy. Perhaps they cannot conceive of judges who do not
mistake their personal opinions for the dictates of the law. The left cannot distinguish
criticism of legal reasoning from criticism of case results. In short, the left sees judges as
politicians and judicial nominees as congressional candidates. By doing so, they imperil
not only the independence of the judiciary but the very notion of a judiciary at all.

                     I. Why Ignore a Judicial Record in the Search for One?

         Every report, press conference, and public statement by Judge Thomas' opposition
has ignored his judicial record. Listening only to the opposition, an uninformed observer
would have no idea that Clarence Thomas is in fact a sitting federal appellate judge who
has actually authored his own judicial opinions and participated in many others.

         For example, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund
(MALDEF) based its opposition and report solely on Judge Thomas' "extrajudicial writings
and speeches."2 People for the American Way Action Fund (PAWAF) cites only the
relative brevity of Judge Thomas' judicial record.3 Americans for Democratic Action
(ADA) completely ignores that record.4 The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund

             A list of organizations supporting the nomination is attached.

            Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, "Natural Law: Not On Our Supreme Court,"
August 14, 1991, at 6 (hereinafter MALDEF Report).

             People for the American Way Action Fund, "Judge Clarence Thomas: 'An Overall Disdain for the
Rule of Law"," July 30, 1991, at 3,4 (hereinafter PAWAF Report).

             Americans for Democratic Action, "Nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court of

(LDEF) bases its opposition and report on "Judge Thomas' writings and speeches."5 The
nominee's judicial record likewise goes completely unnoticed in the reports by the Women's
Legal Defense Fund (WLDF)e and the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL).7
The AFL-CIO focuses exclusively on Judge Thomas' "public statements" and non-judicial
writings.' Neither the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California (ACLU/SC)9
nor the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)10 mention
the nominee's judicial record. The National Women's Law Center (NWLC) completely
ignores it as well,11 as does the American Association of University Women (AAUW).12
Two reports prepared by law professor Erwin Chemerinsky for opposition groups also
ignore that record.13

         This pattern of selective examination is very significant and perhaps says as much
about Judge Thomas' opponents as their own reports do. They claim his past non-judicial
record tells us, with an apparently high degree of confidence, what his future judicial record
will be. But why do the nominee's opponents pass up the opportunity to test whether the
views Judge Thomas has expressed as a private citizen or agency administrator on policy
issues influence, determine, or otherwise are reflected in his work as a judge on legal
issues? Why do they ignore the judicial record of a judicial nominee?

         One leftist group let slip the answer. Within days of the nomination, the Alliance
for Justice issued a document titled "Alliance for Justice Preliminary Report on Clarence
Thomas," dated July 1, 1991.14 It included summaries of Judge Thomas' opinions and
concluded:

                           "His decisions overall do not indicate an overly
                          ideological [sic] tilt, although they generally are
                          conservative, especially his criminal law and
                          procedure decisions."

When the Alliance announced its opposition to Judge Thomas' nomination on July 29,
1991, it released four documents. One of them was titled "Alliance for Justice Preliminary
Report on Clarence Thomas," dated July 1,1991. It included summaries of Judge Thomas'
opinions and purported to be the same document the Alliance had earlier released.
Curiously, however, this July 1 opinion summary differed from the first July 1 opinion
summary. The positive evaluative statement quoted above had mysteriously disappeared.

         The Alliance owes everyone an explanation. Which is the real July 1 report? Do
Judge Thomas' opinions suddenly tilt because the Alliance does? This approach of
doctoring documents resembles turning the odometer back on a used car and raises serious
questions about the Alliance's credibility. Not surprising, the same media which had
investigated the flag Clarence Thomas had on his desk nearly 20 years ago15 never raised
an eyebrow over such tactics.

         The Alliance was, in fact, right the first time. Judge Thomas' opinions are not
ideological. Rather, in the words of one legal analyst, they are "textbook examples of
judicial restraint."18 No one who candidly examines Judge Thomas' entire record can
honestly conclude that he imposes his personal views about policy or politics when
performing his judicial function.

         Quite the contrary, Judge Thomas believes in "a judiciary active in defending the
Constitution, but judicious in its restraint and moderation."17 The judiciary, in his view, has
a vigorous yet defined role. His opinions reflect such a traditional commitment to judicial
restraint and the rule of law in several ways.

              The Alliance acknowledges that many of the decisions it reviewed are per curiam decisions not
authored by Judge Thomas.

        * He consistently avoids answering questions or addressing issues unnecessary for
          deciding the particular case before the court.20

        * He has declined the invitation to decide cases on purely policy grounds.21

        * He pays close attention to issues affecting the court's jurisdiction.22 Judge
          Thomas' leftist opponents, of course, characterize the desire to ensure that the
          court properly has jurisdiction as "limiting access to the courts."23

        * He emphasizes a properly narrow role for an appellate court.24

        * He utilizes traditional standards of construction and interpretation.25

        Judge Thomas' opponents ignore his judicial opinions because that record
undermines rather than advances their case against him. They must ignore the most
relevant part of his record in order to pursue their campaign. For them, no distinction
exists between politics and law, between politicians and judges. For them, raw results are

more important than objective and dispassionate application of the law to the facts of a
particular case. Judge Thomas believes otherwise and his judicial record shows it, so they
look the other way and move on.

        Judge Thomas' opponents will no doubt claim that his judicial record is relatively
brief. And so it is. He has to date authored 20 opinions and participated in approximately
170 cases during his tenure on the U.S. Court of Appeals. Nevertheless, relative brevity
does not mean irrelevance. Again, the supposed goal is to determine what Clarence
Thomas will do on the bench in the future; it is fundamentally irresponsible, therefore, to
ignore what he has done on the bench in the past. That tactic can only be a deliberate
attempt to distort the nominee's record.

         People for the American Way actually claims that Judge Thomas' brief judicial
tenure is itself sufficient reason for the Senate to withhold its consent to his appointment.28
The American people will wait in vain for that group to announce that liberal Chief Justice
Earl Warren, who had absolutely no judicial experience prior to taking the Supreme helm
in 1953, should never have been appointed. But, then, PAWAF agrees with most of Chief
Justice Warren's activist decisions.

         The opposition will also contend that Judge Thomas' judicial record is irrelevant
because, as a lower court judge, he was constrained by Supreme Court precedent.27 On the
highest court in the land, they contend, he will be unshackled to do as he pleases. Just
when the left discovered this sudden devotion to judicial restraint remains a bit unclear.
Nevertheless, by their logic, no one who has not previously served on the Supreme Court
should be considered for appointment to that bench. Actually, this is not logic at all. Nor
does it have any basis in reality. Judge Thomas' leftist critics have the burden of proof on
this point. They have yet to provide a single shred of evidence that he lacks respect for
precedent. He has already shown, albeit through the judicial opinions the left consistently
ignores, that he knows the difference between his personal views and the requirements of
the law.

                  II. Affirmative Action: Why Won't Anyone Read His Record?

         It may serve to create some hysteria or raise some money, but tactics such as "the
sky is falling" rarely have anything to do with the truth. Judge Thomas' opponents have
made enormous general statements about his supposed opposition to "affirmative action."
They have also refused to define that term so that the American people can have some
idea of what they are talking about.

_______ See, e.g, NWLC Report at 35: "As a lower court judge, Judge Thomas was duty-bound to follow

        It appears that the chorus of critics are reading off a single lyric sheet, at least on
some of the songs. The choirmaster appears to be law professor Erwin Chemerinsky.
Compare, for example, a passage on the affirmative action issue taken from his
memorandum to the ACLU/SC Board of Directors and the MALDEF report:

Chemerinskv memo - July 17. 1991                        MALDEF report - August 14. 1991

p.l "The most pervasive theme in Clarence               p.6 "One of the most frequently-repeated
Thomas' writings is his vehement opposition to          themes in Clarence Thomas' writings and
all forms of affirmative action, even affirmative       speeches is his steadfast opposition to
action taken to remedy clearly proven past              affirmative action in all forms, including
discrimination. He expresses a view that the            affirmative action ordered by the courts to
Constitution requires that government be color-         to remedy proven past discrimination. Clarence
blind under all circumstances."                         Thomas' opposition to affirmative action is
                                                        based on his belief that the Constitution must
                                                        in all circumstances be colorblind."

        Others repeat the same party line. The most outrageous comes from Americans for
Democratic Action, which states that "his numerous publications and speeches dealing with
affirmative action show that he is opposed to even non-numeric approaches (i.e., special
outreach and recruiting efforts) to enhance employment opportunities for minorities and
women."28 The NAACP claims that Judge Thomas' "position on affirmative action shifted
dramatically" after 1986.29 They, of course, offer no evidence for this claim.

         Such sweeping generalizations can only be attributed to a desire to inflame passions
because they have nothing to do with Judge Thomas' record. In fact, they are directly
contradicted by that record, which has been consistent on this point for nearly a decade.
In an April 1983 article in the Labor Law Journal, EEOC Chairman Thomas wrote: "Much
of. the heated debate and public confusion over affirmative action, in fact, stems from the
confusion between flexible goals and inflexible quotas, and the use of these two distinct
terms interchangeably."30

         On August 17, 1983, Chairman Thomas delivered a speech in Chicago and drew the
distinction between the general notion of affirmative action and rigid programs such as
quotas. He stated:

        In light of real world facts of life, there should be no reasoned disagreement over
        the underlying premise of affirmative action: that is, that we simply must do more
        than just stop discriminating if we are ever going to stop the effect of a history
         of discrimination. But, we must have the courage to recognize that there is room

        to question the effectiveness and legality of certain affirmative action programs
        and policies."

         Similarly, in an opinion piece for a major newspaper, Chairman Thomas
distinguished between affirmative action and quotas. Failing to draw this distinction, he
wrote, "we will fail to address the real issues and condemn the most disadvantaged
individuals in our midst to an even bleaker future."32 In a book chapter published three
years later, he again distinguished between "affirmative action policies as they have
developed" in the form of racial set-asides or preferences and "reducing barriers to
employment, instead of trying to get 'good numbers.' Those who have been in the
government know the artificial barriers to hiring someone you want. That is the sort of
practice we should be seeking to eliminate. That is the sort of affirmative action I practice
at my agency."33 He is right. As EEOC Chairman, his hiring practices looked like this:

* Hired 49 individuals who reported directly to him - 53% women, 67% minorities

· 9 Office Directors  · 29 Special/Exec. Assts  * 11 personal support staff
    5 women               14 women                   7 women
                          15 black
    5 black                                         10 black
                           1 Hispanic

                           2 Asian

* Hired 28 individuals as District Directors - 10 women, 10 black, 4 Hispanic

More recently, in a 1989 interview, Chairman Thomas was even clearer. He said:

/ believe in affirmative action; my problem is with 'preferential treatment'
because in there it assumes that I am not the equal of someone else, and if I'm
not equal, then I'm inferior....! know what it feels like. I'm not a white male out
there telling you that it ought to feel that way and it ought to do this and that.
I'm telling you how it actually felt to me.3*

        When Senator Sam Nunn (D-GA) announced on July 16, 1991 that he would
introduce Judge Thomas to the Judiciary Committee when it begins considering the
nomination on September 10, he noted that in their private meeting the nominee continued

to draw this same distinction "between affirmative action, which he supports, and the
affirmative action quota type that he doesn't support."35

        Allen Moore wrote: "When he gets a chance to fully explain his views in Senate
hearings, he will challenge his listeners to think beyond platitudes and conventional
orthodoxy. Clarence Thomas has always supported the idea of giving preferential treatment
to the truly disadvantaged, especially minorities, rather than to those from middle- or upper
middle-class backgrounds who happen to be members of a targeted minority. To do
otherwise risks stigmatizing those favored~to make it appear as if they are incapable of
competing fairly."38

        Judge Thomas' opposition just hate mentioning that Arthur Fletcher, Chairman of
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and the architect of affirmative action in this country,
has publicly endorsed the nomination. He stated:

        / / anything should occur to diminish the effectiveness or eliminate opportunities
        in [employment or education], I would have as much, if not more, to lose than
        anyone....After reading all I could find written about him...and after talking to
        people who have known him "up close' for a decade or more....I am convinced
        that in his heart of hearts, he knows that he has benefited from the fallout of the
        Brown Decision, and that he also has benefited from the dramatically improved
         opportunities environment created by the employment affirmative action
         enforcement movement; and that he has ridden it all the way to the top....I
        support the nomination.

                        III. What's Good for Marshall is Good for Thomas

         Judge Thomas has most often cited the American natural rights tradition when
discussing the case against slavery, segregation, and discrimination - practices he repeatedly
connects and condemns. In so doing, he has aligned himself with the dissenting opinion by
Justice John Marshall Harlan in Plessy v. Ferguson,37 the decision legitimating the "separate
but equal" doctrine. He has called that dissent "one of our best examples of natural rights
or higher law jurisprudence."38 As a result, he has criticized the decision in Brown v. Board
of Education,3' which correctly repudiated the doctrine, because the Court based its opinion

not on the enduring natural rights principles in Justice Harlan's Plessy dissent, but on social
science data and psychological theories.

         Judge Thomas' opponents frequently cite his criticism of the reasoning in Brown v.
Board of Education as a reason to oppose his nomination.40 By their failure to distinguish
criticism of legal reasoning from criticism of case results, these folks who themselves have
never endured segregation apparently intend the incredible suggestion that Judge Thomas
supports the practice! Judge Thomas' record completely repudiates this offensive notion.

         Americans for Democratic Action compares Judge Thomas to Judge Bork. The
group might as well have compared him to Justice Thurgood Marshall who in Brown argued
before the Court for the same position that Judge Thomas today says the Court should
have adopted - one based on enduring natural rights principles rather than social science
data and psychological theories. Legal analyst Gordon Crovitz writes that "when it comes
to the Supreme Court's most important civil-rights case, Clarence Thomas is another
Thurgood Marshall."41 But then, selective memory seems to be standard operating
procedure in this debate.

         These fundamental principles of equality and liberty in fact formed an essential part
of the legal assault on slavery, segregation, and discrimination. The brief for Oliver Brown
in Brown v. Board of Education, filed by then-attorney Thurgood Marshall, is very
instructive. Marshall summarized the issue at the very heart of this landmark case as
"whether a nation founded on the proposition that 'all men are created equal' is honoring
its commitments...when it...confers or denies benefits on the basis of color or race."42 His
assault on the Plessy doctrine was based squarely on Justice Harlan's dissent in that case.
Marshall wrote:

         While the majority opinion [in Plessy/ sought to rationalize its holding on the
         basis of the state's judgment that separation of races was conducive to public
        peace and order, Justice Harlan knew all too well that the seeds for containing
         racial animosities had been planted.... 'Our Constitution,' said Justice Harlan, 'is
         colorblind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.' It is the
         dissenting opinion of Justice Harlan, rather than the majority opinion in Plessy
         v. Ferguson, that is in keeping with the scope and meaning of the Fourteenth
        Amendment.*3

        Thurgood Marshall argued that the "first Section of the Fourteenth Amendment is
the legal capstone of the revolutionary dream of the Abolitionists to reach the goal of true
equality."44 The "central rallying point" for the Abolitionists, in turn, was the Declaration
of Independence. "The philosophy upon which the Abolitionists had taken their stand,"
Marshall argued, "had been adequately summed up in Jefferson's basic proposition 'that all
men are created equal' and 'are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
Rights."145

         Marshall must have anticipated the charge that his natural rights argument and
appeal to the Declaration's principles of equality and liberty would be labeled "outside the
mainstream" or "reactionary" because he took great pains to trace the deep "roots of our
American equalitarian ideal."46 The philosophers of centuries past who laid the foundation
"rested upon the basic proposition that all men were endowed with certain natural rights."47
The Founding Fathers, Marshall argued, considered these "self-evident truths" to be the
basis for America itself. It was, he said, "the only political theory they knew" with roots
extending "[l]ong before the Revolution."48 This political theory was "popularly regarded as
the marrow of the Constitution itself'48 and the drive against slavery and for women's
suffrage "was based fundamentally on Judeo-Christian ethic and was formulated in terms
of equalitarianism and natural rights."50

         Some of Judge Thomas' opponents seem blinded by their rage against this nominee
to the facts of history. MALDEF, for example, cites Judge Thomas' criticism of Brown but
makes the astonishing charge against "his apparent willingness to reject the legal arguments
advanced by all the parties in a case and to legislate his own views instead."51

         First, as detailed above, Judge Thomas' criticism of the reasoning in Brown simply
mirrors a central legal argument advanced by the appellant in the case. Perhaps MALDEF
has never read the briefs. Second, a private citizen offering an evaluation or opinion of the
Brown decision more than 30 years after it was rendered is not the same as "rejecting" legal
arguments and "legislating his own views instead." Indeed, the meaning of this legislating
notion is a complete mystery.

IV. Age Discrimination Cases: Liars Figure and Figures Lie

         Perhaps the most persistent charge against Judge Thomas has been the lapse of a
certain number of age discrimination charges beyond their statute of limitations, thus
precluding relief in federal court. This is certainly an example of where a number takes
on a life of its own and, if repeated often enough, lives on unchallenged. What it actually
represents and whether it has any basis in reality is beside the point.

        The EEOCs 50 field offices receive, investigate, and resolve charges of employment
discrimination. To do this, EEOC contracts with 46 state and local Fair Employment
Practices Agencies (FEPAs), which pre-date the 1964 Civil Rights Act creating the EEOC.
Individuals can file charges of discrimination with either the EEOC or a FEPA. The right
to sue in court lapses when neither the EEOC/FEPA nor the individual alleging
discrimination initiates court action within two years of the alleged violation.
Discrimination "charges" become discrimination "cases" only when actually taken to court.

        Judge Thomas' opponents have invented numbers out of thin air, confused
discrimination charges with discrimination cases, and lumped together actions handled by
EEOC field offices and FEPAs to concoct a case against him.

         The following table lists the opposition reports discussing this issue, the number of
lapses they allege, the labels they use for the matters at issue, and the sources they provide.

        Even this cacophony of sourceless numbers does not reveal the sloppy nature of this
attack on Judge Thomas. PAWAF claims the EEOC allowed more than 13,000 cases to
lapse and cites a letter from 14 members of Congress to President Bush dated July 17,
1989. That letter never mentions the number 13,000.S2 A virtually identical letter from 11
of those members of Congress to Senator Biden dated February 28, 1990 also fails to
mention this number.53 The source of this figure remains a mystery.

         Lapses did occur, both in EEOC field offices and in FEPAs. These are the facts for
the period from April 8, 1988, to June 30, 1990 (three months after EEOC Chairman
Thomas became Judge Thomas), according to the U.S. General Accounting Office:54

EEOC Field Offices  Resolved Charges  Lapsed Charges  Ratio of Lapsed to Resolved
FEPA Offices          39,626            348                 19.17
                      12,796           2453

        Between January 1, 1984, and April 7, 1988, a total of 4377 lapses occurred among
charges filed with either EEOC or FEPA offices.55 A breakdown of this figure to
determine the number for which the EEOC was responsible is unavailable, but it is clear
that FEPAs were responsible for the vast majority of lapses and that the total was far less
than Judge Thomas' critics have alleged.

        The only reason we are now aware of the nature and extent of this lapsing problem
at all is because of the case management and litigation tracking improvements initiated by
Chairman Thomas. The problem had no doubt existed for a long time, but Chairman
Thomas' commitment to real law enforcement made it possible to identify and finally
correct the problem.

         Of course, none of Judge Thomas' critics ever mention that both EEOC field offices
and FEPAs are involved in this process and that many lapses occurred in the FEPAs. As
part of his attempt to move the EEOC from an advocacy organization to a true law

enforcement agency, Chairman Thomas initiated several policy changes which offered
parties charging discrimination more opportunities for relief than the law itself requires.
He activated the "dual filing" system, whereby a party can file a discrimination charge with
the EEOC if he or she was dissatisfied with how a FEPA is processing a claim. Chairman
Thomas thereby heightened his agency's responsibility in protecting the rights of charging
parties beyond what is required by law.

         This commitment to protecting individual rights beyond what the law requires is
hardly the mark of the typical bureaucrat; it was motivated by Clarence Thomas' personal
commitment. He increased his agency's involvement and responsibility and, as a result,
increased the potential points of criticism. And it was Chairman Thomas who brought this
problem to the public's attention, accepted full responsibility for it before congressional
committees,58 and supported measures to correct the problem. He took the agency a long
way from the days when no one even knew just how bad the problems were, let alone
found ways to solve them.

         Judge Thomas' opponents also will never reveal certain other facts about his record
of fighting age discrimination. In fiscal year 1981, before Chairman Thomas' tenure, the
EEOC recovered less than $30 million in benefits for victims of age discrimination; in fiscal
year 1989, the agency recovered nearly $61 million. In 1981, the EEOC filed 89 lawsuits
under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; in 1989, the agency filed 133. This
dramatic increase in litigation and benefit recovery for the victims of age discrimination
occurred during a period when the agency's manpower decreased by 10%.57

                                 V. What Stream Are They In Anyway?

         Judge Thomas has written and spoken about the fundamental principles that
underlie the sweeping guarantees of the Constitution and give that compact its moral and
legal force. He has argued for a deeper appreciation of the Declaration of Independence
in understanding the Constitution. In short, he has embraced the "natural rights" tradition
on which this country was founded.

         The Declaration of Independence reflects this tradition when it states as a "self-
evident truth" that "all men are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights." The Constitution, which along with the Declaration is one of
the "organic laws of the United States" according to the U.S. Code, implements these truths.
Judge Thomas has indeed called the Constitution "a logical extension of the principles of

                 The Chicago Tribune editorially praised Chairman Thomas on January 30, 1988 this way: "No
excuses, no bellyaching about the other guy, no flabby claim that it's difficult--or impossible, as bureaucrats and
elected officials increasingly bleat in sticky situations-to assess blame. Everybody makes mistakes. Too few
people in public life own up to them, much less pledge uncompromisingly that they will be corrected. Bless you,
Mr. Thomas, for straight talk in an age of waffling."

the Declaration."58 This fact about Judge Thomas' record makes unintelligible AAUWs
claim that Judge Thomas believes "that the 'inalienable rights' cited in the Declaration of
Independence are a higher authority than the U.S. Constitution."59

        Judge Thomas' critics appear completely unaware of American history, especially
when they attribute these principles to him. For example, the Alliance for Justice states
that "Judge Thomas also displays a strong adherence toward 'natural law' theory, which he
says stems from a belief in 'the laws of nature and of nature's God.' (Speech to the Pacific
Research Institute)."60 Similarly, the National Women's Law Center states that "Judge
Thomas grounds his constitutional theory in the 'laws of nature and nature's God.'"81
Perhaps the quoted phrase never rang a bell for anyone at either the Alliance or NWLC,
but those words come from the Declaration of Independence.

         In fact, Judge Thomas is in good company in embracing the American natural rights
tradition. Throughout American history, statesmen and judges, liberals and conservatives,
have embraced this view.

         * In 1987, after the defeat of Judge Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme
Court, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D-Del.) said that "I have
certain inalienable rights because I exist, [not]...because my government confers them on
me."62

         * Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whom Judge Thomas cites more often than any other
individual in this regard, said in his 1961 address at Lincoln University that the best
expression of the American dream is the "sublime" statement of self-evident truths in the
Declaration of Independence.83

         * Abraham Lincoln regularly attacked the Supreme Court's decision in Dred Scott
v. Sanford, which denied citizenship to black Americans, by reference to the inherent
equality of all human beings.

         * Natural rights thinking was the basis of the shared political philosophy of the
Founding Fathers. Both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are based
firmly on it and, indeed, are inexplicable without it.

         * Judge Thomas has cited James Madison, Alexis de Tocqueville, Winston Churchill,
and Booker T. Washington as other prominent figures in this long tradition. Attorney
Patrick Riley likewise notes that this history of "natural law jurisprudence runs from
Cicero...through Bracton, Coke and Blackstone - some of the greatest names in the law.
It is a long, constructive and noble history....In embracing a jurisprudence of natural law,
Clarence Thomas puts himself in the best tradition of ancient Rome, of the great jurists,
both Catholic and Protestant, and of our Founding Fathers."84

        Now Judge Thomas' opponents make the astonishing claim that embracing the
fundamental principles which served as the principal weapon against slavery, segregation,
and discrimination, is reason to oppose his nomination! The Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights says it is "radical and places him well outside of the judicial mainstream."85
The Alliance for Justice says it is "dangerously out of the mainstream."88 The National
Women's Law Center repeats that "Judge Thomas's theory sets him far outside the
mainstream of legal thinking."87 The NAACP dismisses it out of hand as "reactionary."88
The Women's Legal Defense Fund says it is cause for "serious concern," "alarm," and
"considerable discomfort."69 They and others claim that Judge Thomas' support for natural
rights means he will not adhere to the 14th Amendment.70 Americans for Democratic
Action claims flatly that, because Judge Thomas embraces this core American tradition, he
"will not enforce the U.S. Constitution"71 and "[o]n this basis alone he is unqualified to serve

held that there exist certain inalienable rights, including equality before the law, he stands not only in the political
and moral mainstream of our polity, but also in the mainstream of our judicial history-one that Justice Marshall
himself helped to shape and articulate."

as a Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States."72 NARAL tries to cast this
American tradition as existing only as Catholic Church doctrine since the 13th century."
People for the American Way claims it "has been widely discredited."74

         What has happened to the judicial selection process when an interest group receives
anything but derision for claiming that a judicial nominee will not enforce the Constitution
because he embraces the principles in the Declaration of Independence? The American
people have every right to demand that the NAACP brand Martin Luther King as a
reactionary for embracing these same principles. Fat chance.

         Judge Thomas' opponents, of course, have every right to repudiate the entire
American political and legal tradition, reject the Declaration of Independence, and claim
that James Madison and the Founding Fathers, Abraham Lincoln, the Abolitionists, and
Martin Luther King are "outside the mainstream." But they should have the guts to do so
up front. One wonders what stream, main or otherwise, the leftist opposition must be
traveling in if it excludes the very principles underlying the American system of law and
politics.

         The central fallacy in the leftist assault on Judge Thomas is its claim that he will
use the American natural rights tradition not as a means to understand the Constitution
but as a tool to interpret the Constitution. NARAL claims that belief in natural rights is
"central to Judge Thomas'...approach to constitutional interpretation."75 The Women's
Legal Defense Fund says it is "a theory of jurisprudence to be applied by the Supreme
Court."76 In characteristically extreme fashion, Americans for Democratic Action claims
that "Judge Thomas has been bold in asserting that he will interpret the U.S. Constitution
on the basis of natural law."77 People for the American Way states that "Mr. Thomas has
written and spoken extensively about natural law or higher law as being a necessary part
of constitutional interpretation."78 The National Women's Law Center likewise refers to
"Judge Thomas's writings on 'Natural Law' as the basis for constitutional interpretation."79

         Anyone who has studied Judge Thomas' record will scratch her head wondering
who these folks are talking about. Judge Thomas has discussed the American natural
rights tradition as political philosophy, not a blueprint for judicial review. He has gone
further to explain the difference:

         The best defense of limited government, of the separation of powers, and of the
        judicial restraint that flows from the commitment to limited government, is the
        higher law political philosophy of the Founding Fathers....Moreover, without
        recourse to higher law, we abandon our best defense of judicial review--a
        judiciary active in defending the Constitution, but judicious in its restraint and
        moderation. Rather than being a justification of the worst type of judicial
         activism, higher law is the only alternative to the willfulness of both run-amok
         majorities and run-amok judges.TM

         To believe that natural rights thinking allows for arbitrary decisionmaking would
         be to misunderstand constitutional jurisprudence based on higher law."

        Justice Harlan's reliance on political principles was implicit rather than explicit,
         as is generally appropriate for Supreme Court opinions.*2

         One can easily see the consistency in Judge Thomas' judicial philosophy. A judiciary
"active in defending the Constitution" will be a hedge against "run-amok majorities" and a
judiciary "judicious in its restraint and moderation" will guard against "run-amok judges."

         One analyst recently concluded that Judge Thomas' views "have been not only
caricatured but turned on their head. Far from being a judicial activist, Thomas has
repeatedly criticized the idea that judges should strike down laws based on their personal
understanding of natural rights. Far from being bizarre or unpredictable, Thomas's view
of natural rights is deeply rooted in constitutional history."*3 He points out that the liberal
groups opposing Judge Thomas today because he does take the American natural rights
tradition seriously also opposed Judge Robert Bork in 1987 because he did not take that
tradition seriously.*4 This writer has also drawn the same distinction outlined above: "But
in Thomas's case, fears of judicial activism seem to be unfounded, like many liberals,
Thomas believes in natural rights as a philosophical matter, but unlike many liberals, he

does not see natural law as an independent source of rights for judges to discover and
enforce....Natural law for Thomas, then, is a way of providing 'moral backbone' for rights
that are explicitly listed in the Constitution, rather than a license for creating ones that
aren't."85

        The real issue is that Judge Thomas will indeed enforce the U.S. Constitution, but
not the leftists' political agenda. They seem to mix those up most of the time.

                   VI. Unenumerated Rights: Shooting Themselves in the Foot

         In complete disregard of Judge Thomas' record, his opponents claim his embrace of
the American natural rights tradition describes his judicial philosophy rather than his
political philosophy. They claim that he will therefore be an activist, giving meaning to
constitutional provisions based on his personal predilections. They say this will be the same
"substantive due process" approach the Supreme Court once used but has rightfully
abandoned. The Alliance for Justice uses as an example of the approach Judge Thomas
will supposedly champion the Court's 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York" striking down
a law prescribing maximum hours for work in bakeries.'7 The Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights'* and others*9 make this same comparison.

         As we have already seen, Judge Thomas does not embrace the American natural
rights tradition as a blueprint for judicial review; as such, all the accusations, speculations,
and predictions about where this view would take him simply miss the point. That minor
hurdle aside, however, the nominee's leftist critics shoot themselves in the jurisprudential
foot. They claim he will do what the Supreme Court did in Lochner. They say that's bad.
Yet the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade90 did exactly what it had done in Lochner. They say
that's good. Justice Potter Stewart acknowledged this fact in his Roe concurrence.91
Moreover, Professor John Hart Ely, whom Judge Thomas' critics frequently cite with
approval when discussing the nominee's judicial philosophy,92 has written: "The Court

continues to disavow the philosophy of Lochner. Yet as Justice Stewart's concurrence
admits, it is impossible candidly to regard Roe as the product of anything else."93

        Just why the left ventures into this thicket is a mystery. Judge Thomas' record, both
on and off the bench, could not be clearer. He is hardly a judicial activist who will simply
pour his personal opinions into open-ended constitutional provisions. Yet even if he were,
his critics are caught between a rock and a hard place. How can Lochnering be bad should
he do it but just fine when the Court in Roe does it? If Judge Thomas will not do what
they predict, they are now simply blowing more smoke. If Judge Thomas will do what they
predict, they cannot criticize him without criticizing the foundation for their most prized
"privacy" precedents.

                     VII. I Thought They Said Too Many Rich White Guys?

        Another strawman popular with the left has also fallen. Last year, leftist critics
including the Alliance for Justice and People for the American Way attacked President
Bush for appointing too many rich white males to the federal bench." Conservatives
responded that if the federal judiciary were stacked with liberal activists, the left would not
care about race or wealth. The Thomas nomination shows which side was right.

        The left claims that the "archetypal Bush judicial nominee is a white man...with a net
worth upwards of $l,000,000."95 Clarence Thomas is black and, according to the
information he submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, his net worth was
$91,978.16.98 He grew up in segregated Southern poverty. If race and wealth really
mattered, the left would cheer a nominee so different from the "archetypal" norm. Their
opposition lays bare the fact that this too is a strawman. They want liberal activists. Judge
Thomas is neither.

                               VIII. Whatever Happened to Sensitivity?

         On September 14, 1990, during the hearing on the nomination of then-Judge David
Souter to replace Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, Senator Paul Simon (D-IL) said
to the nominee: "I want you to understand perhaps a little more than you now do some of

the aches of America." Doing so, Simon said, would make someone "a better United States
Supreme Court justice." Senator Simon recommended spending some time in "the West
Side of Chicago, maybe an Indian reservation." He quoted Justice Benjamin Cardozo to
the effect that a justice gets an important component of the knowledge he needs "from
experience and reflection; in brief, from life itself." On September 17, Senator Simon again
emphasized the need "to understand a little more the desperation of some in this country."

         Clarence Thomas spent more than 15 years in poverty. He lived in tenements with
no plumbing. His world was entirely segregated by race; he entered the first grade the
year the Supreme Court outlawed segregation in education but had to endure the practice
for years thereafter. Not until college did he interact regularly with white people. Nearly
half a lifetime in segregated poverty certainly trumps a few days on an Indian reservation.
Where are the sensitivity police today? If sensitivity and compassion are really what they
mean, they should be out in front cheering for this nominee. If sensitivity and compassion
are merely another smokescreen for the drive toward liberal activism, they will oppose him.

         Judge Thomas told the Senate Judiciary Committee: "The reason I became a lawyer
was to make sure that minorities, individuals who did not have access to this society, gained
access. Now, I may differ with others as to how best to do that, but the objective has
always been to include those who have been excluded." Others who have known Judge
Thomas know that he retains the sensitivity and compassion born from life itself:

         * William Robinson, dean of the District of Columbia School of Law, said in an
interview that "Clarence Thomas has felt the lash of injustice. He's old enough to have
experienced the pre-1964 apartheid system in this country."

         * James Clyburn, a black member of the South Carolina Human Affairs
Commission, says the nominee "has a great deal of sensitivity for his background and
upbringing....He said he understood what it's like to be poor."97

         · Senator John Danforth (R-MO) says that Clarence Thomas is "a first-rate human
being" and "a compassionate kind of conservative, not rigid or ideological in his views. His
every motive is that he empathizes with ordinary people; he's one of them."

         · The late Althea Simmons, long-time director of the NAACP's Washington bureau,
met with Clarence Thomas at the time of his first judicial nomination and concluded that
"he had not forgotten his roots or Black folk....I gained a new meaning of Clarence Thomas
and feel that he will help us. He's a very dedicated man."**

         * Margaret Bush Wilson chaired the NAACP from 1975 to 1984. She has known
Clarence Thomas for nearly two decades. She wrote recently that "Clarence Thomas knew
how to listen as well as talk....Even when we disagree, I have found him to be a sensitive
and compassionate person trying to do what is right, working to make the world a better
place....On a personal level, he knows the struggle and hardship blacks and the
impoverished of every race grapple with daily....I asked him to promise that if he were ever
in a position to reach out and help others that he would do it, just as some had done for
me and as I had done for him. He promised he would, and Judge Thomas has been
keeping his word ever since, looking out for the vulnerable and victimized on the job, in
the community and at the court. I know that as a Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas
will continue to defend and protect the rights of the needy."9*

         * Allen Moore, a long-time policy advisor to Senator Danforth and a friend of Judge
Thomas' for more than a decade, wrote: "The Clarence Thomas I know is a caring, decent,
honest, bright, good-humored, modest and thoughtful father, husband and public servant
who has already come farther in 43 years than most of us will in a lifetime....Thomas'
professional and personal life, not to mention his conscience, wouldn't permit him to forget
his roots if he wanted to. Neither would the world around him."100

         * Constance Newman, director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, wrote
that Judge Thomas is "a person who will be fair and sensitive to the struggles of all
Americans....He has a special understanding of those poor striving for political and
economic empowerment."101

   IX. Confirmation Conversion: The Left Calls for Judicial Restraint and Moderation

         The left's sudden discovery of judicial restraint and its call for "moderation"102 fool
no one. They have never believed in these principles and only appear to embrace them
now in the hope of achieving the singular objective of defeating Judge Thomas' nomination.
Their opportunism and hypocrisy just won't fly.

         The Alliance for Justice takes the transparently simplistic view, at least for the
moment, that being willing to "overturn Supreme Court precedent on Constitutional issues"
automatically makes one an "activist."103 The American people will wait in vain for the

Alliance to denounce the Warren Court and its upsetting of the precedential applecart
This double standard is, of course, explained by which precedents the Alliance likes and
which ones it doesn't.

        But the Alliance is more than hypocritical; it is also pathetically uninformed. The
Supreme Court itself, through both its liberal and conservative members, has repeatedly
held that the doctrine of stare deems, or respecting prior decisions, is least binding in
constitutional cases. Justice Louis Brandeis explained more than a half century ago that
"in cases involving the Federal Constitution where correction through legislative action is
practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its prior decisions. The Court bows
to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning."104 Justice Brandeis cited 28
decisions by which the Court changed its own prior interpretations of the Constitution.
Writing 35 years later, Professor Albert Blaustein identified 60 constitutional law
reversals.105 The Court overturned nearly SO constitutional decisions between 1960 and
1979.106 The Library of Congress in 1987 identified 184 Supreme Court reversals of its
prior rulings.107

         The appendix to the annotated version of the Constitution published by CRS shows
that the Court overruled more than 260 of its prior decisions of all types, in whole or in
part, through 1988. While Eleanor Holmes Norton, Judge Thomas' predecessor at EEOC,
has said that the Court had never overruled more than the five decisions it did last term,
as a law professor she should know better. Analyst Terry Eastland points out that this tally
has been exceeded many time before the Rehnquist Court began - for example, in 1964 (11
overruled), 1967 (7 overruled), 1968 (6 overruled), 1970 (6 overruled), 1976 (9 overruled),
1978 (11 overruled).108

         Justice Hugo Black wrote that "[a] constitutional interpretation that is wrong should
not stand."109 Justice Felix Frankfurter stated that "[t]he ultimate touchstone of
constitutionality is the Constitution itself and not what we have said about it."110 Even

Justice William Douglas, author of the cherished Griswold v. Connecticut*" decision that the
left wants so badly to preserve, said that the doctrine of stare decisis is "tenuous" where a
prior decision may conflict with the Constitution itself:

        A judge looking at a constitutional decision may have compulsions to reverse
        past history and accept what was once written. But he remembers above all
        else that it is the Constitution which he swore to support and defend, not the
        gloss which his predecessors may have put upon it."2

        Apparently, an "activist" is one willing to apply this long-standing view only to
precedents the left would rather keep on the books. Gordon Crovitz described the left's
new "stare-decisis litmus test" this way: "[C]onservative judges are supposed to follow
precedents, no matter how unprincipled the earlier rulings, while liberal judges are free to
ignore even the most firmly rooted constitutional precedents."113

        The Alliance for Justice ends its report with an unprecedented call for "moderation."
It wants a Court that reflects "the rich texture and complexity of American society itself."114
It defies the imagination, not to mention reality, how any group of nine individuals can
reflect the "texture" (whatever that means) of any society. That minor problem aside, the
Alliance's smokescreen could not be more obvious. They cannot simply demand "nine like
me" up front so they cast it in terms of an institution reflecting "the diversity of viewpoints
representative of American society."115

         The suggestion that the Supreme Court be a representative institution is hardly
moderate; it is radical. The Founding Fathers created a governmental structure with three
branches, two of which would be political and reflect textured diversity, and the third which
would be insulated from politics. It would be guided by law, not passion or public opinion.
It would protect the rights even of minorities against majorities - that is, it would buck the
political tide when the law required it. A "representative" institution is a majoritarian
institution and cannot guarantee protection of individual rights.

        Judge Thomas himself provided the best response to this radical idea. He wrote that
"the founders purposely insulated the courts from popular pressures, on the assumption that
they should not make policy decisions. The judiciary was protected to ensure justice for
individuals. This required insulating judges from other groups or interests in society, even

the interests of the majority. However, it was unthinkable that courts would take the side
of particular groups in the policymaking arena....By turning Supreme Court nominations
into power struggles, they transform the Court into another majoritarian institution. How,
then, can it protect the rights of politically unpopular minorities?"118

         Columnist Charles Krauthammer recently wrote:

                 And what exactly is Thomas's offense? Whether a judge calls
                 what he believes natural law or something else, every justice brings
                 a certain intellectual structure and understanding of rights to his
                 interpretation of the Constitution. Thomas is simply more
                 ingenuous than most: He spells out what it is he appeals to--the
                 classical tradition of natural law and the explicit words of the
                 Declaration of Independence. The nation is far safer entrusting
                  its future to such a justice than to the kind that pulls new rights
                  out of a hat and declares them penumbral emanations."7

                                    X. Who Wrote Griswold After All?

         Judge Thomas' opponents ignore his lengthy record on many substantive issues and
try to create one that simply does not exist on others. Americans for Democratic Action,
for example, makes a claim that will no doubt surprise both Judge Thomas and anyone who
has actually read his record: "Judge Thomas has publicly stated his position on the issue of
reproductive freedom."11* NARAL claims to have uncovered "strong evidence" that is
"overwhelming" about exactly what he would do in this area on the Supreme Court.119
AAUW states flatly that Judge Thomas "has said that he believes the Griswold
decision...was wrongly decided."120 They offer neither source nor citation for this notion
and none exists; he has never said any such thing.

         These critics claim that Judge Thomas has criticized the Supreme Court's decision
in Griswold v. Connecticut.TM Professor Chemerinsky, in contrast, admits that the nominee

"has not expressly discussed abortion."122 This confusion is the inevitable result of
attempting to create something that just is not there.

        The only way they can build their case is to take Judge Thomas' skepticism about
"judicial activist use of the Ninth Amendment"123 and link it to the completely false idea
that Griswold is based on the Ninth Amendment. AAUW says that Griswold "was based on
the Ninth Amendment."124 The National Women's Law Center says that the Court held in
Griswold that the "right to privacy" is found in the "penumbras" of the Bill of Rights and is
"protected by the Ninth Amendment."125 One will read the Court's opinion in vain looking
for this "protection" idea.

        The fact remains that the Griswold decision in not based on the Ninth Amendment.
Neither is Roe v. Wade, which is based on the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment. In fact, the Court explicitly rejected the lower court's conclusion in that case
that the "right to privacy" was based on the Ninth Amendment.126 The Supreme Court has
never held that the Ninth Amendment is a open-ended repository of substantive
constitutional rights which judges are free to discover, announce, and use to invalidate
undesirable legislation. The left perhaps wishes that were the case, but it is not.

                    XI. Grasping at Straws: Separation of Church and State?

        The Women's Legal Defense Fund argues that "critical questions about the
separation of church and state" would arise if a Supreme Court justice were motivated at
all by personal religious beliefs.127 Likewise, AAUW states that "Thomas' statements about
'natural law" raise serious doubts about his commitment to maintain separation of church
and state."128 The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution reads in part: "Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment of religion." It boggles the mind how the
subjective motivation of an individual member of the judicial branch can somehow violate
a constitutional provision directed at the results of actions by the legislative branch!

        Attorney Thurgood Marshall argued before the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board
of Education that the drive to achieve suffrage for women "was based fundamentally on
Judeo-Christian ethic"129 and constituted "an ethico-moral-religious-natural rights
argument."130 The American people will wait in vain for the Women's Legal Defense Fund
to argue that the suffrage movement raises "critical questions about the separation of
church and state."

        This argument has been rejected by both liberals and conservatives. Professor
Laurence Tribe once argued that laws against abortion were unconstitutional because
legislators often voted for them out of religious conviction. He said that a constitutional
problem exists "whenever the views of organized religious groups have come to play a
pervasive role in an entire subject's legislative consideration.131 Even he later recanted this
view: "But, on reflection, that view appears to give too little weight to the value of allowing
religious groups freely to express their convictions in the political process."132 Justice
Antonin Scalia wrote in 1987 that "political activism by the religiously motivated is part of
our heritage."133 This view applies with equal force to the personal beliefs or motivations
of judges.

         This argument is really no different than the comments by Virginia Governor
Douglas Wilder,134 NOW Massachusetts president Ellen Convisser,135 and others suggesting
that Judge Thomas' nomination should be more carefully scrutinized because he supposedly
was raised a Catholic. This is, at its root, religious bigotry and anyone who fosters it
should be repudiated outright. The Founding Fathers were correct when they prohibited,
in Article VI of the Constitution, a religious test for public office. The Women's Legal
Defense Fund is scraping the bottom of the tactical barrel by attempting to impose one.

         Judge Thomas' opponents have refined their approach, to be sure, but continue
trying to exploit bigotry in a number of ways. NARAL tries to suggest that the American
natural rights tradition actually has existed nowhere but in Catholic Church doctrine for
more than 600 years!136 Professor Chemerinsky points out that "Thomas' view of natural

law is openly religious."137 The National Women's Law Center likewise states that
"Thomas's views of natural law include a strong religious emphasis."138 The Women's Legal
Defense Fund is more heavy-handed. Compare their claim and the truth:

WLDF Report, p.55 n.112                              The Center Magazine. Nov./Dec. 1987. p.21

"Judge Thomas, paraphrasing St. Thomas               "In his 1963 book, Why We Can't Wait, Dr. King,
Aquinas, has further explained that 'an              citing St. Thomas Aquinas, notes that 'an unjust
unjust law is a human law that is not                law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal
rooted in eternal law and natural law.'"
                                                     law and natural law."
The Center Magazine, November/December 1987, at 21.

        Judge Thomas provided the same reference to Dr. King's reliance on Aquinas in a
1987 speech at the Department of Justice commemorating the Martin Luther King, Jr.
holiday.139 Yet the NAACP's secret report to its board insists that "[t]he natural law of
which Clarence Thomas speaks has...a great deal to do with the sectarian and highly
theological writings of medieval scholastic philosophers like Thomas Aquinas."140

         Goodness, the Rev. Martin Luther King sounds pretty motivated by religious values.
Perhaps his leadership during the civil rights movement raises "critical questions about the
separation of church and state." One wonders why the NAACP has not similarly dismissed
Dr. King as "sectarian and highly theological."

                         XII. Do They Want a Stealth After All?

        President Bush nominated someone who has written and spoken extensively on a
wide array of issues. Because the left knows they cannot come forward and say they
oppose Judge Thomas simply because of the substance of his views, they attack the
nominee's attitude in expressing his opinions. The AFL-CIO charges him with
"intemperance" for not affirmatively recognizing "the legitimacy of competing ideas."141
Maybe he disagrees with those ideas! Judge Thomas' opponents, including the AFL-CIO,
certainly devote little ink to recognizing the legitimacy of his ideas. Does that make them
similarly intemperate?

        The Alliance for Justice claims that Judge Thomas' supposed "animosity to views
different from his own" is evidence of "lack of compassion."142 Are they kidding?
Committee chairman Joseph Biden offered the right response back in 1977, during the
hearing on the nomination of former U.S. Representative Abner Mikva to be a U.S. Circuit
Judge:

        / frankly do not know how we could approve any Members of the U.S. Senate,
         U.S. Congress, a member of any legislative body, or anyone who ever served in
        a policy position, who has taken a position on any issue, if the rationale for
        disqualifying you is that you have taken strong positions. That is certainly not
        proof of your inability to be objective and avoid being a policymaker on the
        bench. If we take that attitude, we fundamentally change the basis on which we
        consider the appointment of persons to the bench.1*3

                                  XIII. Additional Specific Responses

A. Response to National Women's Law Center

         The National Women's Law Center first tries its best to paint the so-called
"Rehnquist Court" as activist. But the Center can't seem to get its facts straight. It claims
that in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services,1** "Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for five
justices in upholding the preamble."145 In Webster, the Court expressly refused to rule on
the constitutionality of the statute's preamble.148

         The Center next claims that Judge Thomas "cites both Roe and Griswold v.
Connecticut--as examples of activist judicial use of the Ninth Amendment in violation of
higher law principles."147 This is false for two reasons. First, the text which the Center
cites proves them wrong. In a speech to the Federalist Society, Judge Thomas said that the
"expression of unenumerated rights today makes conservatives nervous, while at the same

In a footnote, he offered an example: "The current case provoking the most protest from
conservatives is Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1979), in which the Supreme Court found a
woman's decision to end her pregnancy to be part of her unenumerated right to privacy
established by Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965)."149 In a subsequent paragraph
in that footnote, he referred to another if his writings as discussing his "misgivings about
activist judicial use of the Ninth Amendment."150 No one who reads this footnote can
conclude that Judge Thomas cited either Roe or Griswold as examples of judicial activist
use of the Ninth Amendment.

        Second, neither Roe nor Griswold are based on the Ninth Amendment. Griswold
is based on the notion that "specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras,
formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance."151 It
was Justice Goldberg's concurrence that argued for grounding the decision in the Ninth
Amendment. The Court in Roe specifically held that its decision was based on "the
Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty" and not on the Ninth Amendment,
as the district court in that case had concluded.152

        The Center next contends that, in Judge Thomas' view, '"allowing, restricting,
or...requiring abortions are all matters for a legislature to decide."1153 It provides the
following as the source for this notion: "Thomas, Notes on Original Intent, unpublished
paper, at 2 (emphasis in original)."154 The misquoted fragment does appear, though without
any emphasis, in the cited paper, which was devoted largely to a critical evaluation of the
"original intent" approach to constitutional interpretation. Here it is in context:

        Recall Judge Bork's problems before the Judiciary Committee, when he tried to
        explain his views about privacy and the proper interpretation of the Ninth
        Amendment. His reading of the Amendment appeared to be a legalistic means
        or eliminating what most Americans believe they hold: a right of privacy.

Amendment," 12 Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy 63,63 (1989).

                 Id. at 63 n.2. Technically, Judge Thomas was incorrect on one point. Griswold was based on the
penumbral emanations of the Bill of Rights and Roe was based on the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

        Restricting birth control devices or information, and allowing, restricting, or (as
        Senator Kennedy put it) requiring abortions are all matters for a legislature to
        decide; judges should refrain from "imposing their values" on public policy.

        Surprise! In context, the Center's fragment of choice is not an expression of Judge
Thomas' view at all, but what appeared to some in 1987 to be the implication of Judge
Robert Bork's view of the Ninth Amendment. Oops! Wrong judge.

        While the Center claims he is the author of this unpublished paper, Judge Thomas
did not write it. While he was head of EEOC, Judge Thomas regularly had his staff draft
memoranda and make arguments to explore various legal issues. The paper on original
intent which the Center, and even the Washington Post,TM claims he wrote was in fact
authored by a member of his staff.

         Fourth, the Center insists that "[according to Judge Thomas, the Constitution should
be interpreted by examining the Declaration of Independence to discern the 'original intent'
of the Framers."15* The simple fact is that Judge Thomas has never said any such thing,
and the Center provides no source for this notion. This report has already discussed how
Judge Thomas has embraced the American natural rights tradition as a matter of political
philosophy, not as a tool for judicial review. Indeed, die connection the Center's attempts
to draw between "natural law" (a phrase Judge Thomas has rarely used) and "original
intent" would probably confuse other jurists who have embraced the latter. Judge Bork,
perhaps the most widely known proponent of interpretevist jurisprudence, has written
negatively about reliance on natural law in constitutional interpretation.1" During his
September 1990 nomination hearing, Justice David Souter openly embraced the need to
determine the meaning originally given a legal document by its drafters without ever
mentioning natural law principles. This configuration remains a figment of the Center's
imagination.

         Disregarding the facts, the Center claims that the EEOC during Chairman Thomas'
tenure inadequately handled individual discrimination cases.15* It cites a General
Accounting Office report claiming that between 41% and 82% of the discrimination charges
closed by EEOC offices had not been fully investigated.1" Even the untrained observer

should question why the GAO's conclusion appears to have a 100% margin of error. This
is because it was based on just 3.28% of the cases investigated and closed during just three
months in early 1987 and focused on only six of 50 EEOC field offices.180

B. Response to AFl^CIO

         The AFI^CIO makes a charge that, like so many others, flies directly in the face of
Judge Thomas' record. The union's report states: "Judge Thomas has aligned himself with
the theorists who not only accept the harshness and inequality of the unfettered market, but
claim that such markets provide the answer to every social problem and that mute
acceptance of their harshness and inequality is the very essence of human liberty."181

        This is what Judge Thomas has actually said: "Surely the free market is the best
means for all Americans, in particular those who have faced legal discrimination, to acquire
wealth. Yet the marketplace guaranteed neither justice nor truth. After all, slaves or drugs
can be bought and sold. The defense of equal opportunity to compete in a free market is
a moral one that presupposed the Declaration....In striving to preserve and bring about
what is good, politics must measure itself by the standards of the higher law, of rights, or
else it becomes part of the problem instead of part of the solution."182

         Pursuing this theme of fundamental rights providing the need to temper the excesses
of the unfettered marketplace, Judge Thomas elsewhere has criticized libertarians who
would go too far in unshackling that marketplace.183

                 Chairman Thomas repeatedly pointed out the basic flaws in the GAO report's methodology and also
its refusal to compare the agency's performance before and after a series of fundamental substantive and
procedural changes in its operations. See, e.g., Thomas, "EEOC Counters the GAO," Miami News Weekender,
November 19,1988; Thomas "EEOC Responds," St. Petersburg Tunes, November 17,1988; Thomas, "'Biased' Job
Report," Detroit News, November 27,1988; Thomas, "Against Discrimination," St. Louis Post-Dispatch, November
19,1988; Thomas, "EEOC Criticism Based On a Misleading Report," Denver Post, November 20,1988; Thomas,
"A Misleading Report," Los Angeles Daily Journal, December 6,1988; Thomas, "EEOC Chief Defends Agency,"

C. Response to Americans for Democratic Action

        On July 12, 1991, the Dallas Times Herald reported that Judge Thomas had praised
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan in two 1983 speeches.1*4 Given Farrakhan's
reputation for bigotry, the left tries casting Judge Thomas the same way. Americans for
Democratic Action states that "in 1983, Thomas referred to Louis Farrakhan 'as a man I
have admired for more than a decade.'"1'5 That tactic has already flopped. In 1983,188
Judge Thomas knew only about Farrakhanin's emphasis on black self-help. On July 12,
1991, Judge Thomas flatly repudiated Farrakhan: "I am and have always been unalterably
and adamantly opposed to antisemitism and bigotry of any kind, including by Louis
Farrakhan. I repudiate the antisemitism of Louis Farrakhan or anyone else."1*7 In an
interview with Catholic Twin Circle magazine in early 1989, Judge Thomas was asked
whether hate groups "such as the skinheads...represent a growing trend of racism?" He
responded: "Of course, you never want to have hate groups in your society-whether it's
Farrakhan or the skinheads."18*

D. Response to Professor Chemerinsky

         Professor Chemerinsky offers perhaps the most outrageous accusation in his July 17
memorandum to the ACLU of Southern California board. He asserts, in the ambiguous
manner characteristic of those who have absolutely no evidence to back them up, that
"Thomas appears to have intentionally omitted his most controversial article from the
listing of his publications submitted to the Senate at the time of his appointment to the
D.C. Circuit."189 Because Judge Thomas did list many other publications, the professor
says, "there is an inference that this chapter was intentionally omitted because of its
controversial content."170

publicity the next year during the presidential campaign of Jesse L. Jackson. Jackson refused to repudiate
Farrakhan."

        Whether that article is controversial is a matter of opinion, but Professor
Chemerinsky's opinion that it is does not then question Judge Thomas' candor. Absolutely
no evidence exists of any intentional omission. None. Period. Judge Thomas did submit
the article in question in its original speech form, containing all the supposedly
controversial material, to the Senate Judiciary Committee.

                                               XIV. Conclusion
        The left has pulled out the stops to defeat Judge Thomas' nomination to the
Supreme Court. This report examines the results of their efforts. They must ignore
entirely the most relevant part of the nominee's record and completely distort the rest just
to be in the ballpark. But when all the smoke and mirrors are removed, what remains is
a fully qualified individual whose judicial philosophy is restrained and with whom some
leftist fringe groups differ on some matters of substantive policy.
        Nothing has happened since the Senate voted nearly unanimously to approve Judge
Thomas' appointment to the federal appellate bench to make the result of this current
process any different. Indeed, what has happened is the judicial record the left refuses to
examine. Judge Thomas is more qualified to sit on the Supreme Court in 1991 than
Chairman Thomas was to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1990.

Honorable Patrick Leahy
United States Senate
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Leahy:

        For the past week, we have looked on as the Judiciary
Committee has begun to grapple with the nomination of
Clarence Thomas to serve as an Associate Justice of the
United States Supreme Court. If past hearings are any
guide, the Committee will be hearing in the next week from
the proponents and opponents of Judge Thomas. There will
be calls for speedy confirmation of an "outstanding
nominee," for "continued scrutiny" of the nominee's
commitment to civil rights, privacy rights, and gender
equality, and, no doubt, for outright rejection of Judge
Thomas.

        We are writing to you with a plea of a different
sort-- not a plea to confirm or to reject Judge Thomas,
but a plea to you and your Democratic colleagues to take a
different approach:

        It is time to stand together and insist on the
        appointment of a highly respected, veil-qualified,
        moderate Supreme Court Justice.

Put another way, the Democrats in the Senate should draw
up their own list of candidates for the Supreme Court, and
call on the President to select a nominee from it.

        Drawing up a list of Democratic alternatives is
something that Senate Democrats have the constitutional
power to do, have the political power to do, and that
might even do some good for the Democratic Party. This
would be a list of men and women that any bar committee
would find well qualified to serve on the nation's highest
court. It would be a list of people who could add some
balance to a Court that is now skewed heavily to the
right. It probably would not be a list composed entirely
of avowed liberals. Rather, it would be a list of eminent
and outstanding lawyers and judges that any American would
be proud to have on the United States Supreme Court.
                                   779

        It is not hard to think of candidates for the list.
Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg is one. Judge Ginsburg has been
a judge of the District of Columbia Circuit Court for
almost a dozen years (not 18 months, like Judge Thomas),
and has distinguished herself there as outstanding judge
who is neither an ideological liberal nor an ideological
conservative. Before joining the Court, Judge Ginsburg
was a professor at one of the most prestigious law schools
in the country, who had written extensively on important
legal questions and had been repeatedly honored for her
work. Judge Ginsburg was also a well-respected advocate,
and an active participant in numerous bar organizations.

        Another example is Judge Jose Cabranes, who serves as
a federal District Judge in Connecticut. Judge Cabranes
has also been on the bench for a dozen years, and has been
described by members of the bar as a simply brilliant
judge. In earlier years, Judge Cabranes served as Counsel
to the Governor of Puerto Rico, as General Counsel of Yale
University, and also was a founder of the Puerto Rican
Legal Defense and Education Fund. Judge Cabranes has
written widely on law and international affairs, and in
1988 was appointed by the Chief Justice as one of five
federal judges to develop a long-range plan for the future
of the federal judiciary.

        A third example is Judge Amalya Kearse of the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals, who has also come to be known as
outstanding judge who is both moderate and open-minded.
When she was appointed to the bench in 1979, Judge Kearse
was a partner of one of the largest and most prestigious
law firms in New York. She was also a board member of the
Lawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the
Legal Defense and Education Fund-- in other words, an
active and accomplished lawyer, a well-respected judge,
and a clearly qualified candidate for the United States
Supreme Court.

        The constitutional premise for the development of a
Senate list is plain from the language of the
Constitution. Article II requires the Senate not simply
to consent to judicial nominations, but to give advice and
consent. For most of the 200 years since the Constitution
was ratified, the Senate has routinely used the "advice"
power to urge the appointment of judges to the lower
federal courts. This advice has been given, received, and
accepted hundreds, if not thousands of times. The Senate
has also, although less often, used the power to urge the
appointment of Justices to the Supreme Court. A prominent
example is Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was appointed by
a reluctant President Herbert Hoover at the insistence of
the Senate and many vocal members of the bar.
                                780

        The political practicality of offering such advice
lies in two facts. First, a majority of the American
people trust the Senate, more than the President, to
decide who should sit on the Supreme Court. In a recent
New York Times/CBS poll, when respondents were asked whom
they trusted more to make the right decisions about who
should sit on the Court, 55 percent said the Senate, while
only 31 percent said the President. Second, Democrats
hold 57 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate. If
the Democratic members were to put together their own list
of moderate, respected candidates for the Supreme Court,
and agreed to reject any nominee who was not on that list,
they would have the power to make it stick.

        Even more important, a list of alternatives would
give Senate Democrats something positive and constructive
to stand for, instead of simply playing^a nay-saying role.
Over the last decade, many Americans have begun to wonder
what our Party has to offer. By drawing up our own list
of candidates, Democrats would be standing for quality and
balance on the Supreme Court, not "against Clarence
Thomas."

        Although President Bush has claimed that he picked
Judge Thomas because he is the person best qualified to
fill the current vacancy on the Supreme Court, the
evidence certainly does not support this claim. Rather,
it is clear that the President picked Judge Thomas because
of a political philosophy Judge Thomas has vocally
espoused for years.

        The Democrats in the Senate therefore have every
right to insist on a different philosophy-- to insist on
quality and balance on the Supreme Court-- and to offer a
list of strong and respected alternatives. We urge you
and your colleagues to do so.

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
United States Senate
221 Russell Senate Building
Washington, DC 20510

Dear Senator Biden:

         I urge you to vote against the confirmation of Judge
Clarence Thomas to become an Associate Justice of the United
States Supreme Court. There is no compelling reason why Judge
Thomas should have a seat on the nation's highest court. He
has not achieved distinction either as a lawyer or as a judge.
I am certain that you will join me in saying that the United
States Supreme Court deserves the very best justices that the
nation can provide.

         The President has done a disservice to the nation by
claiming that Judge Thomas is the "best man" for the post.
This claim cannot be substantiated on any grounds. The
President insists that we should be color-blind in matters of
race; yet this appointment has all the earmarks of being
race-based. If this is so, and there is every indication that
it is, then the President could still have maintained the
highest professional standards by appointing any one of a
number of truly distinguished, highly qualified African
American federal judges or attorneys, several of whom are
Republicans. Under the circumstances, the President satisfied
those who wanted him to assign a seat or fill a "quota" for
African Americans on the high court, but his action did not
conform to the affirmative action standards envisioned in the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which does not compromise on
quality. After all, programs of affirmative action, seriously
and effectively enforced, would preclude reaching as far down
as the President did in this case for, clearly, more qualified
candidates were passed over.

         I sincerely hope that you have had an opportunity to
examine the record of Judge Thomas when he was Assistant
Secretary for Civil Rights in the Department of Education and
Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In
both positions his conduct raised serious doubts about his
fitness even for those positions, to say nothing of his fitness
for a place on the United States Supreme Court. He neglected
784

Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr. 2  September 16, 1991

the mandated duties of his position as Assistant Secretary to
the point of possibly being held in contempt of court, as the
judge in one case threatened. As Chairman of the E.E.O.C. he
simply declined to process thousands of complaints where the
aggrieved individuals claimed they had suffered discrimination
based on age, sex, or race. If Judge Thomas truly believes in
relief for individuals rather than for classes or groups, this
was his opportunity to provide it. He did not. It has been
suggested that Judge Thomas is an ideal role model for young
African Americans. I would hope that young African Americans
would not be invited to emulate a role model who breaks the law
with impunity in refusing to carry out the duties of his office.

         You may count me among those citizens who recognize that
under the Constitution the Senate has a co-equal responsibility
with the President in the appointment and confirmation
process. I sincerely hope that you will exercise that
responsibility not only in scrutinizing the candidate with the
utmost care but also in saying to the President that you
decline to confirm on grounds that are much more substantial
and defensible than the vague and indefensible grounds on which
he made the nomination. Best wishes to you.

                                            Sincerely yours,

                                      SEPTEMBER, 1991

MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I AM PLEASED TO
APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO DISCUSS MY
INDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL REASONS FOR SUPPORTING THE
CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS TO THE SUPREME
COURT OF OUR COUNTRY.

THE NATIONAL DEBATE SURROUNDING THE PRESIDENTS
NOMINATION OF JUDGE THOMAS TO SIT ON THE COURT AND THE
NOMINEE'S QUALIFICATIONS TO DISCHARGE THE DUTIES OF
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ARE BOTH:

        OF GRAVE CONCERN TO ME ALONG WITH MANY OTHER
       AMERICANS, BUT ALSO

        INDICATIVE OF THE "PROGRESS" THE "MINORITY BODY POLITIC"
        HAS MADE IN THIS COUNTRY.
                                        787

                                                 -2-
WHEN JUSTICE THURGOOD MARSHALL WAS APPOINTED, AND LATER
CONFIRMED, THERE WERE BUT A FEW THAT WORRIED ABOUT HIS
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OR HIS LIKELY INTERPRETATION OF
CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES. HOWEVER, EVERYONE FOCUSED ON HIS
RACE. WORDS HEARD THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WERE -- A NEGRO
ON THE SUPREME COURT - CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

TODAY, THE MAJORITY OF THE MINORITY COMMUNITY OF THIS
COUNTRY SUPPORTS JUDGE THOMAS. HOWEVER, THE LEADERS OF
THE "MINORITY BODY POLITIC" LARGELY DO NOT SUPPORT HIM.
THERE IS A GREAT DISPARITY BETWEEN THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
AND ITS LEADERSHIP.

THE "PROGRESS" IS THAT ALL AMERICAN'S (THE PEOPLE)
UNDERSTAND JUDGE THOMAS'S STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE RESPECT AND
PERSONAL FREEDOM. AND IN SPITE OF THE OVERT RACISM AND
PREJUDICE WHICH HE HAD TO OVERCOME, HIS NOMINATION TO THE
SUPREME COURT IS NOW A REALITY.

MY GRAVE CONCERN IS THAT MANY STILL BELIEVE JUDGE THOMAS
WAS APPOINTED BECAUSE HE IS AN AFRO-AMERICAN WITH A
CONSERVATIVE PHILOSOPHY ANTITHETICAL TO THE LIBERAL VIEW
                                        788

                                                 -3-
OF CIVIL RIGHTS. IT IS THIS ATTITUDE WHICH IS PREVALENT AMONG
THE LEADERSHIP REFERRED TO EARLIER.

TO THE PEOPLE, THIS ATTITUDE AND BELIEF IS NOTHING MORE THAN
DISRESPECT AND REFLECTS THE ASSUMPTION THAT JUDGE THOMAS
IS NOT -FREE" AND THEREFORE NOT CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT AND
OBJECTIVE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
WHICH LAY AHEAD.

ON THE OTHER HAND, THE VIGOROUS DEBATE RAISES SUBSTANTIVE
CONCERNS WITHIN THE MINORITY COMMUNITY WHICH CLEARLY
BARKEN THE DAY THAT NO AMERICAN CAN ALLEGE THAT AFRO-
AMERICANS LOOK. SOUND. OR THINK ALIKE! THE STRATIFICATION OF
THOUGHT WITHIN THE "MINORITY BODY POLITIC" DEMONSTRATES
THAT THE AFRO-AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS STRONG, VITAL,
INDEPENDENT AND WORTHY OF EVERYONE'S RESPECT. THE AFRO-
AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS NOT:

        REPULSED BY THE AMERICAN POUTICAL PROCESS ANY LONGER;

        HELD OUTSIDE OF THE AMERICAN POLITICAL PROCESS ANY
        LONGER;

          LONGER; AND

          BEING CONTROLLED OR ENSLAVED BY CERTAIN PHILOSOPHICAL
          IMPERATIVES ANY LONGER.

  SO YOU CAN SEE WHY MY "GRAVE CONCERN" AND "OPTIMISM" BOTH
  APPEAR IN CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROCESS. THIS DEBATE SAYS
  THAT JUDGE THOMAS CAN BE CONFIRMED AS A JUSTICE OF THE
  SUPREME COURT BY A U.S. SENATE WHICH:

          ACKNOWLEDGES HIS UPBRINGING;

          COMPREHENDS HIS PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN PURSUING THE
          IDEALS EMBODIED IN THE CONSTITUTION;

          UNDERSTANDS THE BENEFITS OF HIS TENURE IN THE PRIVATE
          SECTOR, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT; AND

          RECOGNIZES THAT THEY FOUND HIM QUALIFIED AND
          CONFIRMED HIM FOR HIGH GOVERNMENTAL OFFICE THREE
          TIMES BEFORE.

THE CONTROVERSY ·· PHILOSOPHICAL DIVISION, PARTISAN DIVISION,
AND RACIAL DIVISION - THAT MANY RAISE IN CONJUNCTION WITH
THIS NOMINATION IS IMMATERIAL TO ME AND OTHER AMERICANS
KNOWLEDGEABLE OF THE RECORD JUST DESCRIBED. WE BELIEVE
THAT JUDGE THOMAS IS WORTHY OF OUR RESPECT AND IS CAPABLE
OF INDEPENDENT AND JUST INTERPRETATION OF OUR
CONSTITUTION.

NATURAL LAW AS SOME SEEK TO USE IT IS ANTITHETICAL TO ALL
AFRO-AMERICANS WHO HOLD DEAR THEIR LOYALTY TO THE
CONSTITUTION AND ITS INTERPRETATION THAT SET US FREE.
INDEED, THOSE INTERPRETATIONS HAVE FACILITATED OUR
CAPABILITY TO LEARN AND THINK AND DECIDE OUR INDIVIDUAL
DESTINY WITHOUT INFRINGEMENT OF OUR RIGHTS.

YES, THE CONSTITUTION IS DEAR TO ALL AFRO-AMERICANS:

        WE KNOW ITS POWER;

        WE KNOW ITS INFLUENCE; AND

           WE KNOW THAT IN SPITE OF IT THERE IS STILL SUBTLE
           DISRESPECT TO PERSONAL FREEDOM WHICH EMANATES FROM
           SOME WHO CHARGE THAT SOMEHOW NATURAL LAW COULD BE
           INTERPRETED TO RULE OUR THOUGHTS.

   I SUGGEST THAT THE ISSUES OF NATURAL LAW, ABORTION, RACE,
   LIBERALISM, OR CONSERVATISM ARE SUBTERFUGE TO THIS
   CONFIRMATION PROCESS. THIS MAN, CLARENCE THOMAS, SHOULD BE
   ACCORDED THE SAME LEVEL OF RESPECT AS OTHER NOMINEES
   BEFORE HIM, SUCH AS DAVID SOUTER, SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR AND,
   YES, THURGOOD MARSHALL.

   THE KEY QUESTIONS: DOES JUDGE THOMAS' BACKGROUND AND HIS
   RECORD AS AN AMERICAN DEMONSTRATE HIS LOYALTY TO OUR
   CONSTITUTION AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF OUR SYSTEM OF
   GOVERNANCE - OF, FOR AND BY THE PEOPLE? I HOPE YOU WILL ALL
   SAY YES, AS I DO.

   SECOND, DOES HIS PERSONAL STRUGGLE, HIS FORMAL EDUCATION
   AND HIS PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE QUALIFY HIM TO INTERPRET THE
   CONSTITUTION AS JUSTICES GONE BEFORE? I HOPE YOU WILL ALL
   SAY YES, AS I DO.

FINALLY, AS OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, WHO WILL SHORTLY
VOTE ON THIS IMPORTANT NOMINATION, I LEAVE YOU WITH THIS
CHARGE ·- A CHARGE IN WHICH EVERY AMERICAN WOULD CONCUR --
DO NOT PRACTICE PARTISAN, RACIAL, OR PHILOSOPHICAL POLITICS
WITH THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS FOR THE SUPREME COURT.
RATHER, REAFFIRM THE PROGRESS AND INTEGRITY OF THE
"MINORITY BODY POLITIC BY CONFIRMING CLARENCE THOMAS.

BY HARD
Honorable Joseph Biden, Chairman
Honorable Strom Thurmond, Ranking Minority
U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee
Dirksen Senate Office Building
First and Constitution Avenues
Washington, D.C.

Dear Sirs:
         I wish to go on record as supporting the nomination of Judge

Clarence Thomas and urging a strong positive recommendation to the
Senate as a whole.

         I am living overseas and could not get my testimony delivered
by mail quickly enough, so I have brought it by hand to the
Committee office.

        My determination to submit testimony for the record was
triggered by the highly visible, vocal and widespread media
coverage of civil rights groups' opposition to President Bush's
nominee.

         I have a long and well known record as a civil rights
activist. I was the founder of the Western Christian Leadership
Conference that supported Dr. Martin Luther King in 11 western
states in the 1960's. I was a founding member and co-chairman of
the National Republican Task Force on civil rights in the 1980's.
The struggle for equal economic opportunity in the 1970's found me
working as Executive Vice Chairman to Rev. Leon Sullivan and
serving as National Coordinator of the Pilgrimage to Washington to
put job training and employment on the minds and hearts of America.

         I deeply resent the attempt to gloss over the fact that 59% of
Black Americans have indicated their support for Judge Thomas'
confirmation. The idea that the civil rights lobby can speak on
behalf of all Black Americans is unfortunately an old-fashioned
idea. It just is not true in 1991 in this particular case.

        Therefore I am writing to testify that the historical
precedents clearly indicate that national elective office and
Supreme Court appointment will shape a man and influence his growth
beyond his previous level of thinking. I see Judge Thomas growing
continuously and in the tradition of Justice Hugo Black and
President Lyndon Johnson making history as an advocate for equal
justice under the law. He is and will be his own man, dedicated to
serving the American people -- preserving democracy and freedom and
conserving the principles of the founding fathers and the legacy of
the judicial history of the Supreme court.

        As a Black Jeffersonian Conservative, I stand 100% in favor of
civil rights and constitutional rights. I served as a member of
the advisory committee on constitutional rights to the Attorney
General of California.

        As a civil rights activist I want you to know that there are
many like myself who will be grateful to you if you let the record
show that this man has a sizeable vote of both Democrats and
Republicans in favor of his confirmation. History should tell the
next generation that his was not just a vote of response to a wide
array of either right wing or left wing groups -- barely getting by
with a small margin.

        The nation should know that the mainstream thinking evaluating
the man and his potential prevailed. The judgment of the Senate
should reflect our faith that the democratic process can produce a
product of which we can all be proud.

        The President's nomination and the Senate's advice and consent
works well when we respond to our faith rather than to our fears.

        Thank you for your prayerful consideration.

 An Anti-racist, Anti-sexist, Anti-ageism Activist testifies

                      for Judge Clarence Thomas Confirmation

 My name is Maurice Dawkins, I am a militant black patriot
 whose life has been dedicated to fighting racism and sexism.
I am 70 years young, advocate of equal opportunities for
senior citizens. My track record in the 1960's was one of
fighting the good fight for civil rights with
A. Phillip Randolph, Adam Clayton Powell, Roy Wilkins,
Whitney Young, Martin Luther King, Dorothy Height
Franklin Williams, Walter Reuther and the Leadership of the
National Council of Churches, the American Jewish Committtee
and the National Catholic Conference of Social Welfare.

I cite my own personal experience in the struggle to gain
equal justice under the law because a strong civil rights
lobby has chosen to oppose Judge Clarence Thomas confirmation
by the Senate Judiciary Committee.

An unsung hero of the American Civil Rights Movement, the
West Coast Executive Director of the NAACP nominated me to
be named as a member of the Advisory Committee to the
Attorney General of California when I served as the West Coast
Chairman of the NAACP Regional Convention.and President of
the Los Angeles NAACP Branch.
                                  797

                                                -2-
 I cite this particular role that I played in those days
 to indicate my orientation with the legal realities that
 the judicery branch of State government must deal with.
This particular Attorney^ Stanley Mosky went on to become a
member of the State Supreme Court. Like many Californians,
 I maintained my contact and followed the record of his
decisions at that time.

This kind of personal involvement and commitment is relevant
I believe to justify my coming forward at this time to
defend President Bush's Nominee to fill the vacancy of
what we in the Civil Rights Movement regard with genuine
reverence,, the historic Thurgood Marshall seat on the
Supreme Court of the United States.

Like Ben Hooks and the membership of the largest, oldest
and most effective civil rights organization in America,
The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured
People;I have deep emotional feelings about the fantastic
contribution to Black Progress and the Democratic process
that Judge Marshall has made. Like many of the traditional
Civil rights advocates, I agree that Judge Clarence Thomas
is no Thurgood Marshall. Unlike many of these fellow
freedom fighters however I do not feel that this disquali-
fies him or prevents him from doing a good, or even an
excellent job as a judge on the Supreme Court.
                                 798

                                                       -3-
  Having lived through the debates about Justice Hugo Black,
  former Klu Klux Klan member who became a strong and
  respected advocate for equal justice under the law, I do
 not buy the theory that a man's actions and public position
 on issues prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court
 prevent him from becoming a new man or born again civil
 rights champion.

 None of us in the movement will ever forget how this same
 civil rights lobby, then under the leadership of our
 revered hero, the 101st Senator Clarence Mitchell, opposed
 Lyndon Johnsoa as the nominee of the late President Kennedy
 and the Democrat Party for the Vice Presidency.

 As the Senate's records will show, I testified for the
nomination of Predident Gerald Ford to the Vice Presidency
when this same civil rights lobby campaigned and testified
against him because of his checkered civil rights record.

I remember saying then, as I think should be stated now -
Lyndon Johnson became a champion for the rights of black
Americans and the late Adam Clayton Powell Jr., who had
supported him in 1960 couldn't get into the White House
to see him without stumbling over the civil rights
leadership who had opposed him in 1960.
                                   799

                                               -4-

I cite this story to illustrate how history has shown that
men are often made and their attitudes and decisions shaped
by the position to which they are elected by the American
 People or appointed with the advice and consent of the
 United States Senate.

Mr. Chairman, my testimony is designed to remind th« members
of the Committee that we have no reason to b e l i e v e , based
on historical precedent, that Judge Clarence Thomas could
not or would not become an outstanding Supreme Court Judge.

Judge Warren Burger was not appointed by a Democratic
President, yet Democrats recognize that his record was an
honourable one that Americans can understand even though
there may be differences of opinion about specific decisions

When President Johnson appointed Judge Tom Clark^ Republicans
were not rejoicing, but they recognized that the President
has the right and the responsibility to exercize his own
best judgement in his nominations for a seat on the Supreme
Court.

Put another way democracy works best when we have faith in
a process that produces a unity that permits diversity.

                                                      -5-
 We can agree to disagree agreeably in our American Democracy
 We can debate and win or debate and lose. Yet once the
 debate is over we can come together and work together for
 a common cause.

 The debate in Congress concerning the Gulf War against
 Saddam Hussein is a case in point. There are always
 extremists on the right and the left who go all out to
 show how the nation will be endangered unless their extreme
 position prevails. However the mainstream provides a
balance representing a majority of the citizens which
through the years has given us the best democracy in the
world .

Mr. Chairman, today I strongly recommend that the majority
of your committee look objectively at the legal requirements
for a Supreme Court Judge and dispassionately at the human
rights record of Judge Thomas. I urge the Confirmation of
this nominee of President George Bush as a demonstration
of our faith in democracy and the Christian principles
which have undergirded our government since the founding
Fathers and the Declaration of Independence promised future
Americans, all Americans an equal opportunity to secure
the rights of liberty and justice.
                                    801

                                                     -6-
Surely a Clarence Thomas can be granted an equal opportunity
with the other nominees who have become members of the
Supreme Court. His record is not perfect. His detracters
say he was judged 'qualified' by the A.B.A. rather than
 'well qualified'^ and Judge Bork, Judge Souter, Justice Rhe,.quist
were all given this highest possible rating. The Committee
should call the role in their minds of other Justices who
were not given the 'highest possible' rating by A.B.A.
They served and served democracy well and the Nation has
survived and succeded in maintaining a balance through the
years, the decades, the generations.

Some of our Justices have been appointed by Democrat Presidents,
some by Republican Presidents. Some have been more con-
servative than others. Some have been more liberal than
others - But through it all we have come to trust our sys-
tem of Presidential nomination and Senatorial advice and
consent.

To the members of the Committee I would also like to point
out some of the flaws in some of the arguments that are
being used to try and persuade you to reject this President's
nominee.

                                                      -7-
 I do not claim that some of their arguments are not valid -
 However I strongly submit to you that a_l,l of them are not
 valid and some of them are half truths and distortions of
 the truth and on balance the positive record outweighs the
 negative criticism. Let us look, together for a moment at
 a few illustrations.

 His opponents cite his "Hostility to the Civil Rights
Movement", this is a broad generality. He has vigourously
opposed that part of the leadership of the movement which
marches lock-step with liberal ideology because he is a
conservative. But gentlemen, believe it or not there are
legitimate, fully committed, 100% Civil Rights Advocates
who are conservative on fiscal polices, foreign policy,
social welfare policy and political philosophy. I am a
 Black Conservative. I call myself a Jeffersonian Conser-
vative or a Bob Dole Conservative. Yet Thomas Jefferson
gave us the guidelines for democracy. Cabinet members
Jack Kemp and Senator Robert Dole are consumate practitioners
of Democracy. They have earned blue ribbons or gold medals
or whatever the symbols of appreciation Black Americans
can give to proven fellow-fighters for freedom.

 His opponents say he was a beneficiary of affirmative
 action and yet condems such programs for others. This is
a specious argument, partly true, leaving out important
dimensions of his track record with reference to
affirmative action. Surely the voluntary adoption of fair
employment practices by corporation*has worked well. The
Thomas Chairmanship and tour of duty at EEOC does not show
him tearing down this pragmatic demonstration of determi-
nation to provide corrective medicine for past injustices.
However his position on- "class action suits" or dependence
on legal appelate approach to solving the problem of racial
injustice is one about which has always been differences
of opinion, within the civil rights movement, within the

EEOC Agency, the U.S. Civil Rights &***»««*/> and within the
rank and file grassroots of Unions and Management in America.

Isn't that what makes America great - Honest Differences of
Opinion - hammered out on the Anvil of Debate.

Surely Judge Thomas has a right to take a position and
debate it as an individual. My knowledge of him as a
person of integrity and commitment to principle makes me
know that he would not as a member of the highest court in
the land fail to abide by principles and refuse to compromise
the fundamental principle of equal justice under the law.

                                                              -9-
  I do not believe that as a Oi* 1 of principle he will be
  found supporting racism, sexism or ageism. If I thought
 for a moment he would disappoint m e , a veteran in the wars
 against racism and the battles to win equal rights for
 women and older Americans - I would be arguing against his
 Confirmation.

 It is my view that too many people have made up their minds
 that a conservative can't be honestly and sincerely in
 favor of equal Justice under the law. They do not want to
 be confused by any new f a c t s . They are not willing to
reexamine and reevaluate their own positions in the light
of new discoveries and new information. They only want to
use scientific method of analyzing when it suits their
purpose. They simply look for data to support their orig-
inally pre-conceived idea about a man or an argument.

Before I die I would like to see a new dimension to the
Civil Rights Movement - A recognition that two-party politics
provides a racial minority with the best opportunity to
get the best results in a democratic society. Such recog-
nition would lead to the admission that you don't have to
be a liberal democrat to be 100% committed to civil rights
and you can be a conservative Republican and be 1 0 0 % com-
mitted to civil rights.

                                                    -10-
 I see myself, as an illustration of this dimension. I see
 Judge Thomas as a catalyst and these confirmation hearings
 as a catalytic force making people look more closely at
 the issues involved. The National Urban League looks
 more closely when it takes a position of neutrality on the
 nomination because they see 'blackness' as more important
 in the long run than conservative or liberal ideology
 when black progress is the goal.

The 59% of minority reported by Jet Opinion Poll as sup-
porting Judge Thomas nomination and the 41% reported as
opposing it reflect what I am talking about. Black Americans
or Afro-Americans as Thurgood Marshall prefers to call us,
are not monolithic in their thinking. Both the 59% and
the 41% are sincere, they sincerely disagree. Their votes
and their letters to the editors indicate that they are
just like white Americans; they have varitties of opinions
on almost everything.

This becomes an important factor when you are making your
deliberations. You as committe' members should be able to
rise above the temptation to think you will have a better
chance to get black voter support if you oppose or support
Thomas .

 You should be able to rise above the temptation to oppose
 the Thomas Nomination either because a wide array of right
 wing groups are in favor or a wide array of left wing groups
 are opposed to the nomination.

 You should be able to rise above the temptation to base
 your decision on the attitudes, biases, or judgements of
 various Deans of various Law Schools.

 I submit that you must look at the man. Here ye him.
Consider where he comes from. He is a product of our
democratic process - yours and mine and all Americans.
He is a man of sensitivity and courage who is not afraid
to take a stand, even if it is unpopular and he may be
misunderstood. As long as he is consistent with his prin-
ciples he is at peace with himself. Perhaps poetically
he fits the Admonition "To Thine Ownself Be True and Thou
Canst Not Be False to any Man".

I have talked to this man personally - I have heard him
say proudly I am not in a popularity contest. I have heard
him protest vigorously against the highly visible failure
of the U.S. State Department to have enough black Ambas-
sadors, Deputy Chiefs of Mission, Political and Economic
officers and equal opportunity for Civil Service and
Foreign Service Employees.

 I know this man just as Adam Powell knew Lyndon Johnson.
 I know that- given a choice between two sols o> facts
 regarding equal justice he can be trusted to come down
 on the right side..

 I do not expect you, gentlemen to know him as I do. I do
 not expect you to have the same amount of faith in him
 that I have. However I do hope that my testimony will
help you assess objectively the merit of granting your
consent to the President's Nomination.

Surely this President these past years and especially
in the matter of world affairs and the peace-process
has earned your confidence and mine.

Surely this President in his own personal commitment
from college days through his tour of duty in the congress
and in key appointed positions in Government earned our
faith in his belief that all men are created equal and
entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

Surely this President would not send you a nominee whom
he did not feel would serve the nation well and protect
the basic rights of all the American People. Surely this
President deserves the opportunity to name his own nominees
as othdfPresidents have done - I urge you to support the
President and recommend Judge Clarence Thomas to the Full
Senate for Confirmation.

Subject:  Confirmation Hearing on the Nomination of
          Judge Clarence Thomas to be an
          Associate Justice of the Supreme Court:
          Separation of Powers v. Delegation of Powers or
          The Rule of Law v. The Rule of Men.

Dear Mr. Chairman:

Some audiences may not get excited about separation of powers, especially
yours. On the other hand, some do, especially ours.

Whatever happened to the Subcommittee on Separation of Powers? Why was it
dropped? What are you trying to hide?

Tour committee's line of questioning and Judge Thomas's responses disclose
an effort to perpetuate Judicial legislation not sanctioned ty the
Constitution.

In any case, please accept this letter as our statement in opposition to
confirmation cf Judge Thomas to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court on the grounds that he has exhibited not only a disdain for the
principle of separation of powers but also a total misconception of our
constitutional system of checks and balances.

Please also include this letter in the public record of the hearing on his
nomination and give him a copy.

                      Definition and Reasons for
                          Separation of Powers

Separation of powers means keeping our powers of government separate and
distinct so that one branch shall not exercise the powers nor perform the
functions of the other two or either of them. See also, James Madison's
definition. 1 Ann. ^35-^36.

Separation of powers is not only the basis for the rule of law (as
distinguished from the rule of men), but also it is the foundation of
American freedom and democracy under the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

We, the people, have three powers of government vested in us by operation
       809

Biden                                                                     2.

of natural lav. That is ve have legislative, executive and judicial powers.
Each one of our natural powers of government is vested by the Constitution
in a separate and distinct branch. In the absence of a specific article on
separation of powers, the only %ay to keep our powers of government
separate and distinct is not to give any away.

The principal reason for keeping our natural powers of government separate
and distinct is a simple matter of the rules. That is, the rules of one
branch do not vork in the other two or either of them.

For example, the legislative branch(Congress)operates under the rules of
parliamentary procedure including Jefferson's Manual. The rules of
parliamentary procedure do not vork in the executive nor in the judicial
branch.

The executive branch (the President and his Departments) operate under
administrative rules and regulations including executive orders.
Administrative rules and regulations do not vork in the legislative nor in
the judicial branch.

The Judicial branch (the Supreme Court and lower federal courts) operate
under rules of court subject to the rules of evidence. Rules of court and
evidence do not work in the legislative nor in the executive branch.

A second reason for keeping our natural powers of government separate and
distinct is really a matter of function. That is, the function of the
legislative branch is to make laws in pursuance of the Constitution. CJ*.,
Const., Art. VI, second paragraph. It is the function of the executive
branch to enforce laws made in pursuance of the Costitution. The function
of the judicial branch is to apply the laws made in pursuance of the
Constitution.

The third reason for keeping our natural powers of government separate and
distinct is essentially a matter of policy. That is, the legislative
responsibility of Congress is to make national policy. The executive
responsibility of the President and his Departments is to enforce national
policy (not to make it.1). The Judicial resonsibility of the Supreme Court
and lower federal courts is to apply national policy (not to make it.').

When all three branches get involved in making, enforcing and applying
national policy under the wrong rules, we, the people, become unduly
burdened by unregulated bureaucracy, astronomical public debt fueled by
deficit spending, and perennial budgetary imbalances to the detriment
of local, state and national economy.

       Historical Analysis

When both sides were deadlocked during Virginia's ratification convention,
John Marshall took the position that "this Constitution" would ensure
regulated democracy. His position took for granted that our powers of
government would remain separate and distinct, the deadlock was broken
       810

Biden                                                 3.

and Virginia ratified the Constitution by ten votes.

During the initial debates of the First Congress under the Constitution,
James Madison declared that the principle which separates our powers of
government "is the most sacred principle of the Constitution, indeed of any
free constitution." 1 Ann. of the First Congress 116.

The documentary history of American government shows conclusively that the
Constitution, Bill of Bights and our constitutional system of checks and
balances are all based upon the principle of separation of powers.

             Flagrant Violations of the
       Principle of Separation of Powers

Congress has violated the principle of separation of powers time and time
again, but the most flagrant violations occurred in 19^6 and 19^9. Public
Law kOk, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., Ch. 32^, June 11, 1946, Sec. 2 (c), 60 Stat.
237; and Public Law 72, 8lst Cong., Ch. J.39, May 24, 19^9, Sec. 102, 63
Stat. 104. Public kOk, supra, how 5 USC 551, et seq., is known and cited
as the Administrative Procedure Act. Public Law 72, supra, amended Title
18, entitled Crimes and Criminal Procedure, and Title 28, entitled
Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, of the United States Code. Title 28 is
also known as the Judicial Code of the United States.

                  Public Law kOk
       Administrative Procedure Act

Public Law kOk, Section 2 (c), supra, gave the executive branch the power
to "prescribe law or policy'Vby regulation without sanction of a
constitutional amendment. Likewise, the Administrative Procedure Act,
Poblic Law kOk, supra, gave the executive branch a wide range of judicial
functions.without sanction of a constitutional amendment. See also, the
Attorney General's Manual on the Administrativr Procedure Act (l9*+7)·
Making law and policy are functions of the legislative branch. Performing
judicial functions is the responsibility of the judicial branch. Public
Law hOk,supra, contains two flagrant violations of the principle of
separation of powers even though members of Congress knew or had reason to
know better.

       Legislative History

In 1935, the Supreme Court held the National Industrial Recovery Act
unconstitutional because among other things it violated the principle of
separation of powers. That is, the NIRA gave legislative powers to the
executive branch with out sanction of constitutional amendment. Schecter
v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935)- President Roosevelt immediately
appointed a blue-ribbon commission to study the problem of administering
the Federal Government. His letter transmitting the Commission's report to
Congress pointed out among other things that if Congress continued to
delegate powers of government it would create a "fourth branch" not

Biden                                                                    <t.

sanctioned by the Constitution. Members of Congress ignored the warning
and passed the Administrative Procedure Act, Public Lav kOk, supra.
President Truman signed it into lav.

            Public Lav 72
       Technical Amendment

An obscure technical amendment added to the Judicial Code of the United
States gave legislative powers to the Supreme Court without sanction of a
constitutional amendment. Public Lav 72, eupra, Section 102, 63 Stat. 104,
now 28 USC 2071. President Truman signed it into lav. Making lav is the
function of the legislative branch. Public Lav 72 contains a flagrant
violation of the principle of separation of powers.

       Historical Analysis

The Judicial power of the United States is defined in Article III, Section
2, of the Constiution. After describing the Court's jurisdiction, the.
second sentence of the second paragraph of Secdion 2 goes on to provide
that the Court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as t- lav and fact
"with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall
make." That particular check on the Court's otherwise unlimited judicial
power was given away by the 19^9 technical amendment without sanction of a
constitutional amendment. The 19^9 technical amendment is a deliberate and
flagrant violation of the principle of separation of powers. Mebers cf
Congress should have known better.

The Judicial Code of the United States was enacted by the First Congress
of the United States in pursuance cf the Constitution. Cf., Const., Art..
VI, second paragraph. Subsequent amendments developed the substantive
rules governing, the practice and procedure in the Supreme Court. Such rules
were made pursuant to the legislative power reserved to Congress by the
express proviso contained in the second sentence of the secondr paragraph
of..Section 2 of Article III of the Constitution. The 19U9 technical
amendment gave the substantive rule-making power to the Court without
sanction of a constitutional amendment.

       Subsequent History

After the Court was empowered to make its own substantive rules governing
its practice and procedure, it discarded the old rules made by Congress and
adopted new rules of its own without sanction of a constitutional amendment.

The old rules made by Congress in pursuance of the Constitution became an
integral part of the supreme law of the land by operation of the definition
in the second paragraph of Article VI. The new rules promulgated by the
Court do not form any part of the supreme law of the land nor are they
sanctioned by the Constitution.

Among the old rules discarded by the Court were the rules relating to
evidence. Since the Court was given appellate jurisdiction both as to law
and fact, rules of evidence are necessary and advisable.
       812

Biden                                               5-

In place of the old rules relating to evidence, however, the Court
substituted new rules based on oral argument. The new rules do not meet
the constitutional definition of the supraire law of the land nor are they
sanctioned by the Constitution.

       Destruction of Our Constitutional System of
                           Checks and Balances

Our constitutional system of checks and balances is based upon the principle
of separation of powers. When our powers of government are not kept separate
and distinct, our costitutional system of checks and balances breaks down.

Public Law UoU, supra, which gave legislative powers and judicial functions
to the executive branch not only violated the principle of separation of
powers, but also broke down our constitutional system of checks and
balances.without sanction of a constitutional amendment.

Public Law 72, supra, which gave legislative powers to the Supreme Court
not only violated the principle of separation of powers, but also broke
down our constitutional system of check and balances without sanction of a
constitutional amendment.

Those two laws as signed by President Truman destroyed our constitutional
system of checks and balances. The destruction has been compounded by
Congressional and Presidential acquiescence in the exercise of executive
powers by the judicial branch. The destruction has been compounded further
by the exercise of all three powers of government fcy Congress.

       Judicial Legislation Not Sanctioned
                    By the Constitution

As demonstrated above, Congress gave its constitutional legislative
responsibility to the Supreme Court without sanction of a constitutional
amendment. Likewise, when the Court was given the power tc make its own
substantive rules, it discarded the old rules made by Congress. Acting
under its newly delegated authority, the Court adopted new rules to govern
its substantive practice and procedure. The new rules do not fit the
constitutional definition of the supreme law of the land, nor are they
sanctioned by the Constitution.

Among the old rules discarded by the Court were the rules relating tc
evidence. The new rules are based on oral argument without reference to
the rules of evidence. In legal effect, the 19U9 technical amendment of
the Judicial Code opened the door to judicial legislation not sanctioned
by the Constitution. Moreover, laws not made in pursuance of the
Constitution, even though signed by a President, cannot qualify nor be
substituted as constitutional amendments. In any case, since the Court is
operating under substantive rules not sanctioned by the Constitution, some,
if not all, of the Court's recent opinions have no constitutional validity
whatsoever.

The most flagrant piece of judicial legislation not sanctioned by the
Constitution is the infamous case of Brown v. Board of education (and
related cases), 5U7 U.S. U8} (1953).

                                                 Brown Revisited

At the outset it should be noted that Brown and the related cases were
treated as if they had been brought under the new rules even though those
rules were not published until after the fact.

The official public recosd of Brown and the related cases shows on its face
that the entire legislative history of public education in the United States
was not only left out of the picture, but also totally ignored. The scenario
was such that nine justices of the Supreme Court and all of their law clerks,
including now Chief Justice William Rhenquist, the Attorney General of the
United States and his Staff, the Solicitor General of the United States and
his Staff, the Attorneys General of the several States and their Staffs, and
private counsel and their associates all failed or otherwise neglected to
look in the indexes to the United States Code, Statutes at Large and the
Congressional record to find out what the law was and when, how and why it
was made. In any case, the laws of the United States made in pursuance of
the Constitution for such cases were not raised, briefed, cited, argued,
presented or otlferwise put in Issue. At this juncture, it should also be
noted that Congress specifically reserved the power to enforce the
Fourteenth Amendment by appropriate legislation and that it did. Under the
circumstances, the Court did hot have jurisdiction to decide the issue.

The record shows further that the plaintiffs filed a stipulation of
equality. Accordingly, the case was moot on its facts. It was also moot
because the City of Topeka, Kansas had ended separate Schools. Chief
Justice Earl Warren denied defendant's motion for dismissal. In United
States v. Grant, 5U5 U.S. 629, 652, Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter
reaffirmed the general rule that the defendant in a moot case is entitled
to dismissal as a matter of right.

The record shows further that Chief Justice Earl Warren was dissatisfied
with the first round of argument and ordered the cases to be set down for
reargument. His order, however, arbitrarily limited the inquiry to the
ten-year period immediately following ratification of the Fourteenth
Amendment, 1868-1878. The issue was not resoved until 1390. Third
Morrill Act, 51st Cong., 1st Sess., Ch. 8Ul, August 30, l8°0, 26 Stat. Ul7,
now 7USC 323; 109 Cong. Rec. 6332-6351, 6369-6371; see also, Act to admit
the State of Oklahoma (1906), 3fc Stat. 271.

The record also reveals that the Solicitor General of the United States
advanced false and misleading arguments in response to questions put by
Associate Justices Reed and Jackson. That is, the Solicitor General argued
that Congress had not acted upon the question of separate schools in public
education. His argument was false because Congress had acted after nearly
a quarter of a century of debate on the issue. Third Morrill Act, supra;
       814

Biden                                                                     7.

see also, 109 Cong. Bee. 6371; and the Act to admit the State of Oklahoma,
supra. lhe Solicitor General then compounded his own error by arguing that
because Congress had done nothing (which was false), the Court had
concurrent Jurisdiction to do southing (vhich vas doubly false). The
principle of separation of powers does not admit concurrent Jurisdiction to
do anything*

       Perpetuation of Judicial Legislation
        Hot Sanctioned by the Constitution

Members of Congress have demonstrated a predilection to perpetuate judicial
legislation not sanctioned by the Constitution as evidences by the progeny
generated by Brown and the related cases. Presidents have perpetuated
judicial legislation not sanctioned by the Costltutlon by signing such
measures into law. All of which indicate Congressional abdication of its
legislative responsibility.

        Abdication of Constitutional Responsibility:
       Creation of an Unmanageable Form of Government

Instead of maintaining a regulated democracy tased separation of povers as
sanctioned by the Constitution, Congress has created a "fourth branch" of
government not sanctioned by the Constitution based on delegation of powers.
That is, Congress has created an unregulated bureaucracy which has mush-
roomed out of proportion to our ability to deal with it. In short, the end
result of flagrant violations of the principle of separation of powers is a
government out of control. In legal effect, Congress has created an
unmanageable form of government not sanctioned by the Constitution.

       Separation of Powers v. Delegation of Powers

Congress has turned the American dream of regulated democracy based on
separation of powers into a nightmare of unregulated bureaucracy based on
delegation of powers.

Separation of powers means the rule of law and not of men.

Delegation of powers means the rule of men and not of law.

Separation of powers is the foundation of American freedom and democracy
under the Constitution and Bill of Rights.

Delegation of powers circumvents American freedom and democracy by
violating the principle of separation of povers, destroying our
constitutional system of checks and balances, and perpetuating Judicial
legislation not sanctioned by the Constitution.

Separation of powers not only provides us with the key to our constitutional
system of checks and balances, but also is sanctioned by the Constitution.

Delegation of powers is not only the key to the destruction of our
constitutional system of checks and balances, but also it is not sanctioned
by the Constitution.

       The Trillion Dollar Question

If confirmed, how can Judge Thomas conscientiously give his oath to support
and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,
without reservation or purpose of evasion If he knew or had reason to know
that the Supreme Court is operating under substantive rules of practice and

                 Re: The Honorable Clarence Thonas
                                Confirmation Hearing*

Dear Hr. Chairman:

        This letter is submitted respectfully in response to the
obviously able and brilliant four Black law professors who
testified against Judge Thonas's confirmation in the above
hearings. You unquestionably have been chairing excellently and
fairly the continuation hearings. However, I an disturbed by the
possible odsleading and unintended or inadvertent impression that
all Black Constitutional Law scholars are against the
confirmation of Judge Thonas. I emphatically support the
confirmation of Judge Thomas. Although my main position is now
Distinguished Professor of Higher Education, a significant part
of ay background is in constitutional Law, Theory, and History as
the attached Resiae makes clear. Therefore, I humbly request
that you make my views a part of your record which I briefly
outline as follows:

        1. Special deference should be given to the Supreme
        Court nominations of the President where the nominee is
        a good example of or consistent with the type of
        nominee the President promised in his campaign for
        President. The Presidential political campaign process
        will be delegitimized and trivialised if the
        President's campaign promises are ignored or abandoned,
        except for very compelling reasons, such as an
        emergency or serious crisis. See Tollett and Janes,
        "Heo-Federalism: Taking Liberties With the
        Constitution," ZSBP MONITOR 5:4 (December 1931):13-16.
        For a strong argument that congress is the
        superordinate branch of governoent in the United States
        Constitution's scheme of separation and balance of
        powers, also see Kenneth S. Tollett, "William Winslow
        Crosskey and the constitution," (M. A. Dissertation,
        University of Chicago, 1958).

        2. It is inconceivable to ite that President George
        Herbert walker Bush will nominate anyone with a
        significantly or measurably different or more liberal
        jurisprudence than that of Judge Thomas. Indeed, if he
        did, he would violate his campaign promises and
        exacerbate cynicism about Presidential politics.

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr. -2-  September 19, 1991

         3. It is also inconceivable to me that Judge Thomas
        totally has lost his Black identity such that if
         confirmed, he would not make decisions sensitive to the
         needs, interests, and rights of Blacks and other
         disadvantage*} or deprived groups. For a reference to
         the importance of biography in constitutional law
         analysis from the Black perspective, see Kenneth S.
        Tollett, "The Viability and Reliability of the U.S.
         Supreme Court As An Institution for Social Change and
        Progress Beneficial to Blacks--Part II," The Black Law
        Journal 3 (1973):5-50, 6.

         4. Judge Thomas is hardly an extremist or outside the
        mainstream of constitutional Law, even considering his
        problematic views about natural law and rights in
        political theory or philosophy, with which I disagree
        as I disagree with many of Judge Thomas's other views,
        especially on affirmative action. For an illuminating
         "Note: Natural Law and the Supreme Court," see Stone,
         Saidman, Sunstein and Tushnet, Constitutional Law
         (1386), 62-65. Nevertheless, the failure to confirm
        Judge Thomas will appear inescapably to indicate that,
        as has so often happened in the experience of Blacks,
        the rules of the game are changed when Blacks have
        mastered then and put themselves into a position to
        profit front them, as has been the case with Judge
        Thomas. For a discussion of "the paradoxes and
         ironies" of the Black experience and how "the rules of
        the game seem to change when blacks master them and
        begin to benefit" from them, see Kenneth S. Tollett,
        "Commentary," in Between Two Worlds: A Profile nf Negrc
        Higher Education, by Frank Bowles and Frank A. DeCosta
         (1971), 251-271, 252, 253.

        Hoping that the above will assist you in coning to a fair
and reasonable decision in the confirmation hearings of the
Honorable Judge Clarence Thomas, I am

                                 SUBMITTED SEPTEMBER 19, 1991

INTRODUCTION
        The Organization of Chinese Americans, Inc. (OCA) welcomes the

opportunity to submit the following testimony before this Committee
on the nomination hearing of Judge Clarence Thomas to the United
States Supreme Court.

         Founded in 1973, OCA is a national, non-profit, non-partisan
network of concerned Chinese Americans. Since its formation, OCA
has been dedicated to promoting the active participation of Chinese
Americans in civic affairs at all levels and securing justice,
equal treatment and equal opportunities for Chinese Americans and
Asian Americans. With 41 chapters throughout the country and one
chapter in Hong Kong, OCA is the only national Chinese American
civic organization with headquarters in Washington, D.C.

STATEMENT
         OCA and two of its affiliates - the Chinese American Forum and

the Chinese American Alliance - express grave concerns about the
nomination of Judge Thomas to the highest bench. We base our
decision on Judge Thomas' record as chairman of the Equal
                                    821

Page 2

Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for eight years, his
limited tenure as a Federal District Court judge and his
extrajudicial writings.

         Because Mr. Thomas' tenure at EEOC represents approximately
one-half of his professional career and was more than twice as long
as his next longest position, great weight should be given to his
performance and accomplishments at EEOC.

         OCA is concerned that under Mr. Thomas' leadership, the EEOC
appears to have attempted to unilaterally change federal rules
based on existing case law and federal law, failed to follow
Supreme Court precedent, and failed to perform statutorily mandated
responsibilities.

         Of particular concern is Judge Thomas' views on employment
discrimination and the use of goals and timetables. Notwithstanding
the stereotype that Asian Americans excel academically and have
above average incomes, not all Chinese Americans and Asian
Americans are succeeding. We must ensure that everyone receives an
equal opportunity through the proper use of goals and timetables.
Employment discrimination still abounds and OCA receives a steady
stream of calls from Chinese Americans throughout the country who
seek advice and assistance on their employment discrimination
complaints.

         Shattering the glass ceiling for all levels of employment
opportunities is a priority issue for Chinese Americans and Asian
Americans. Judge Thomas' opposition to affirmative action in any
                                   822

Page 3

form, including affirmative action ordered by the courts to remedy
past discrimination, would leave Chinese Americans and Asian
Americans, confronted by the societal problems of the "glass
ceiling", with few, if any, effective means of redressing
employment-related grievances.

         In explaining his steadfast opposition to affirmative action
and the concept of a "colorblind Constitution", Judge Thomas cites
Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson as "one
of our best examples of natural rights or higher law
jurisprudence." It is distressing to note Judge Thomas' failure to
confront the clear racial bias evident in such dissent,
specifically, the attitude expressed by Justice Harlan:

                  there is a race so different from our own that we
                  do not permit those belonging to it to become citizens
                  of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with
                  a few exceptions absolutely excluded from our country.
                  I allude to the Chinese race.

The attitude was and is deeply held and manifesting itself by the
reluctance of this nation not to lift the bar on Asian immigration
until 1965 and today, is typified by the marked increase in anti-
Asian violence.

         While it is clear that this country cannot now deny Chinese
Americans equal rights under the law, it may still deny us equal
justice under the law. Thus, while no immigration ban bars us from
this country because we are an economic threat, the more subtle
barrier, the glass ceiling, now replaces the ban.

CONCLUSION
        While OCA is heartened that President Bush would nominate a

person of color to diversify the bench, we must ensure that the
next U.S. Supreme Court justice is sensitive to the concerns of all
Americans including the Chinese American and Asian American
communities. For the foregoing reasons, the Organization of Chinese
Americans, the Chinese American Forum and the Chinese American
Alliance urge the United States Senate not to confirm Clarence
Thomas to the United States Supreme Court.

        RE: Subai.agi.ojii f o r HftffirilH FiWffHfd on

Dear Chairman Biden:
Please find enclosed a resolution passed at the 56th annual
convention of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of
America (UE) which we submit as our testimony in the ongoing
Judiciary Committee hearings on the nomination of Clarence Thomas
for the U.S. Supreme Court. Please enter it into the official
hearing record.

This resolution was approved in August 1991 in Pittsburgh, Pa.,
by delegates representing approximately 80,000 UE members
nationwide. We urge the commitee to consider our views.
Sincerely,

Robert Kingsley--*
Political Action Director
                                      825

* Resolution of the 56th Convention of the United
Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE)

                          REJECT THE CLARENCE THOMAS NOMINATION

 Judge Clarence Thomas has been nominated by president Bush to fill
 the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice Thurgood Marshall.
 Thomas, an African-American, is an opponent of affirmative action
  for racial minorities and women. This position he justified by
  saying, "I was raised under the totalitarianism of segregation not
  only without the active assistance of government, but with its
  active opposition."

  in fact, Thomas himself was the direct beneficiary of laws,
  rulings, and programs which required affirmative action. It is
  doubtful whether Thomas could have attended either Holy Cross
  College or Yale Law School without the existence of minority
  preference admissions policies. He is like a "freeloader" in a
  union shop who enjoys all the benefits of a union contract, but
  bad-mouths the union because he just doesn't want to pay his union
  dues.

  Thomas opposes affirmative action on the grounds of opposing any
  government role in bringing about eguality of opportunity. Seated
  on the Supreme Court, Thomas could extend this doctrine to its
  natural conclusion: to oppose government help to the children of
  workers seeking higher education, to lower-income people seeking to
  purchase a home, to those who have lost their livelihood through no
  fault of their own, to those needing medical care without the
  ability to pay. Such are the true targets of those in the crusade
  against affirmative action: the working poor and, through them, all
  workers.

  Thomas' views are well known due to his seven-year tenure as head
  of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). As EEOC
  Chairman, Thomas refused to enforce the Age Discrimination Act and
  allowed suits involving thousands of older workers to languish. He
  has also criticized minimum wage laws and the Brown vs. the Board
  of Education desegregation case, challenged the separation between
  church and state, and hinted that he would like to see abortion
  outlawed.

  These views and others have already led many to oppose the Thomas
  nomination, including the Congressional Black Caucus, Americans for
  Democratic Action, the League of United Latin American Citizens,
  the National Organization for Women, the AFL-CIO, and the NAACP.

  THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT THIS 56TH UE CONVENTION:

  1. Urges the Senate to oppose the nomination of Clarence Thomas
          to the United States Supreme Court and to demand that President
          Bush nominate a qualified jurist who will restore balance to
          the Court;

  2. Urges those who opposed the nomination of Robert Bork to
          mobilize once again to oppose this nomination;

  3. Urges all locals and districts to alert UE members to the
          dangers of the Thomas nomination; to mobilize UE members in
          letter-writing campaigns; and to work in coalitions with other
          unions and anti-Bush forces to defeat this _ dangerous
          nomination.

        Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, and guests, my name
is Connie Mack Higgins. I am Chairman and President of the Omega
Group, Inc. and Chairman of D. C. Black Republican Scholarship
Fund, Inc.

         It is my pleasure to appear before you to testify in support
of the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.

        I have known Clarence Thomas for over ten (10) years and the
respect I have for him is not solely based upon on political
affiliations. But out of the commonality of background, Judge
Thomas in his youth knows rural poverty and the ever present shadow
of separate but, certainly not equal, justice. I too am a product
of poverty but not rural poverty, but urban proverty,
public housing and Aid to Dependent Children.

            Like Judge Thomas, I too had a strong parental hand. My
mother was from Mississippi and had a fourth grade education.
Like Judge Thomas, I too was taught the value of hard work and that
in America all things are possible.

            Those of us who are politically active sometimes forget that
we should give back to our community. In 1985 a group of us in the
D.C. Black Republican Council was searching for a vehicle to make
an impact in our immediate community. Consequently, we decided to
828

invest in our future and created a tax exempt 301(d) organization
called the D.C. Black Republican Council Scholarship Fund, Inc.

         The scholarship fund was created to assist graduates of the
D.C. Public Schools regardless of their party affiliation or
political beliefs. During our inaugural fund raiser we didn't have
a lot of "heavy hitters," yet Clarence Thomas unselfishly gave of
himself to our cause. As a result, in our first year we were able
to award eleven (11) scholarships in the amount of $2,000 each to
financially and academically deserving graduates of the D.C. Public
Schools. The total scholarships awarded up to now has been sixty-
six thousand dollars ($66,000).

         Mr. Chairman we need Judge Thomas to be confirmed because his
experiences and background bring a sensitivity and vision on those
matters of law that will clearly impact the fabric of our society.

In conclusion, the confirmation of Judge Thomas to the Supreme

Court clearly is a symbol of all that is right about this great

country of ours. No one doubts that there are still mountains to

climb, but every journey begins with one step and each successive

step brings the destination closer and clearer into view. Judge

Thomas confirmation clearly brings the journey to the realization

of the American Dream clearer for all.  THANK YOU.

                     CONSIDERING THE NOMINATION OF
                            JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS

                   AS JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
                                     838

         As in my previous appearance before this committee, I wish
to express my appreciation for granting me the opportunity to
appear before you today to testify in these important hearin?<;
considering the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas.

         My name is John J. Bellizzi. Currently I serve as the
Executive Director of the International Narcotic Enforcement
Officers Association (INEOA) which is an organization composed
basically of narcotic enforcement officers from all levels of
government and from throughout the United States and 50 other
countries.

         I appear here today on behalf of 15,000 members and thousands
of other drug enforcement officials throughout the United States.

         Recently drug traffickers have suffered some serious setbacks
as a result of an intensified and concentrated effort by law
enforcement.

         The impact of the multitude of seizures of drugs, money auu
other assets brought about by successful investigations, arrests
and prosecutions has put such a dent in the illegal trafficking
operations that by furious retaliation the traffickers are committing
assaults, violence and murder on our drug agents and other officals
responsible for drug enforcement.

         Narcotic law enforcement agents have always operated under
high risk conditions, but recent events have created a situation
where their lives are at stake constantly and these men and
women deserve to be recognized for their dedicated service.

         The thousands of drug enforcement agents who risk their
lives each time they set out on a drug investigation are dedicated.
Notwithstanding the imminent risk they face, they are not the
least dissuaded from performance of duty.
                                      839

                                                   -2-

         These officers and their family members are very much concerned
that they receive the same equal protection, the same constitutional
rights, the same constitutional protection afforded to any suspect,
defendant or prisoner charged with the commission of the crime.

         I wish to make it clear that by this endorsement we do not
seek to ingratiate ourselves with Judge Thomas or the court. We
seek no favor, we seek no special privileges. What we do seek is
protection of the constitutional rights of the accused and we also
seek protection of the constitutional rights of our law-abiding
citizens and of our law enforcement agents.

         I submit that by his record Judge Thomas has demonstrated that
he is capable and indeed willing to do just that - ensure equal
protection to all regardless of race, color, sex, religious or
social background.

         Four times the United States Senate has confirmed Judge
Thomas' appointment to high-ranking government positions. In
1981, Thomas was appointed Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights
in the United States Department of Education. One year later, he
was appointed Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission;
he was reappointed in 1986. The EEOC, an agency that employs 3,100
persons and has an annual budget of $180 million, enforces Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination
based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The EEOC
also enforces laws against discrimination based on age or disability.
Thomas' tenure as chairman was the longest in the history of the
Commission, and the Commission's new headquarters building is named
after him.

          On April 30, 1990, Thomas assumed his present position as a
judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
                                     840

Columbia, to which he was appointed by President Bush. During his
time on the bench, he has written opinions in criminal law, anti-
trust law and trade regulation, constitutional law, and adminis-
trative law.

        Throughout his distinguished career, Thomas has championed the
principle that individuals should be judged on the basis of abilities
and character, not on skin color. He believes that every American
should have the same opportunity to stand up and be judged on his
or her own merits. He has lucidly explained his views on a variety
of issues, legal and otherwise, in his judicial decisions and in
articles and speeches. He has been described in the press as smart,
tough, a man who "speaks powerfully about overcoming racism and
poverty in the deep South" and who "embodies the ideal of personal
achievement rather than reliance on government programs for a leg
up." As Senator Hatch has observed, Thomas "came up the hard way"
and "understands the sting of oppression." Senator Banforth isadc
a similar point when he observed that Thomas "is a person who knows
discrimination. He has a real commitment to fighting injustice."

        Judge Thomas is a tough, anti-crime judge. He takes a common-
sense approach to questions of criminal law and procedure;" and has
recognized the practical problems that law enforcement officers
face in combatting crime on the streets.

        Commenting in 1985 on what should be done to solve the problems
faced by America's inner cities, Judge Thomas remarked: "The first
priority is to control the crime. The sections where the poorest
people live aren't really livable. If people can't go to school,
or rear their families, or go to church without being mugged, how
much progress can you expect in a community? Would you do business
in a community that looks like an armed camp, where the only people
                                      841

                                             -4-

who inhabit the streets after dark are the criminals?" Black America
Under the Reagan Administration: A Symposium of Black Conservatives,
THe Heritage Foundation Policy Review (FA11 1985).

        In another context Judge Thomas asserted: "We should be at
least as incensed about the totalitarianism of the drug traffickers
and criminals in poor neighborhoods as we are about totalitarianism
in Eastern bloc countries." Why Black Americans Should Look to
Conservative Politics, Heritage Foundation Reports (June 18, 1987).

        Judge Thomas' opinions in the field of criminal law demonstrate
a deep understanding of the community's interest in deterring crime.
He has resisted efforts to impose unreasonably burdensome require-
ments on the police and prosecutors or to overturn criminal convictions
on technicalities not required by the Constitution, while guarding
against infringements of the fundamental rights of criminal defen-
dants .

        Judge Thomas has affirmed judgments of conviction in all but
one of the seven criminal appeals for which he wrote opinions while
on the Court of Appeals. Of the eighteen additional criminal
appeals considered by Judge Thomas, he joined the majority in
upholding sixteen criminal convictions and/or sentences.

        Judge Thomas has rejected the argument that a conviction for
aiding and abetting narcotics distribution should be reversed
because the defendant's involvement was limited to giving a drug
dealer a ride to the site of the illegal transaction. (United
States v. Poston, 902 F.2d 90 (D.C. Cir. 1990).

         Judge Thomas has rejected arguments that a trial judge erred
 in admitting police testimony as to the contents of a telephone
 call, answered by police during a search of a defendant's apartment,
which tended to show that the defendant was dealing in narcotics.

                                                  -5-

(United States v. Long, 905 F.2d 1572 (D.C. Cir.), cert, denied,
111 S. Ct. 365 (1990). Similarly, he has upheld the admission at
trial of evidence of a defendant's prior drug dealing activity.
(United States v. Rogers, 918 F.2d 207 (D.C. Cir. 1990).

        In a case involving narcotics dealers who conducted their
illegal trade out of serveral rooms in a hotel, Judge Thomas
rejected the argument that police had seized evidence against them
in violation of the Fourth Amendment. In response to the contention
that the warrantless search of one of the rooms was unlawful, Judge
Thomas held that it was justified by exigent circumstances, and
noted that, although "the police carefully investigated the suspicious
hotel guests for more than a week and sought warrants for all the
rooms that they could link to [defendant!," the defendant "tried to
frustrate the warrant process by hopping from room to room."
Following recent Supreme Court precedent, he further ruled that
evidence seen by the police during an unlawful search was nonetheless
admissible at trial on the grounds that it was subsequently acquired
on the basis of an independent and lawfully procured search warrant.
(United States v. Halliman, 923 F.2d 873 (D.C. Cir. 1991).

        Judge THomas ruled against a defendant who argued that, at his
trial, the judge had improperly instructed the jury as to his
entrapment defense. In so holding, Judge Thomas observed that
"the government [had] introduced overwhelming evidence of [defen-
dant's] eagerness to sell crack, enough, we are certain, for the
government to have carried the burden of proof it needed to defeat
[defendant's] entrapment defense." (United States v. Whoie, 925
F.2d 1481 (D.C. Cir. 1991).

        Judge Thomas is not, however, excessively deferential to the
prosecution at the expense of fairjies,£..£.ow3rd^£riminal defendants.

                                                   -6-

In United States v. Miller, 904 F.2d 65 (D.C. Cir. 1990), Judge
THomas joined an opinion by Judge Silberman overturning defendants'
conviction for wire fraud on the ground that the trial court had
excluded admissible exculpatory evidence.

         THe matter of Judge Thomas' nomination and record was reviewed
by the 50 members of the Board of Directors of INEOA and the General
Membership at our 32nd Annual International Drug Conference held in
Montreal, Canada, September 1-7, 1991, and Judge Thomas received the
unamimous endorsement, for his appointment to serve as Justice to
the United States Supreme Court.

                     Judge Thomas has failed to accept the concept that women
                     belong in the workplace. His "cultural differences" excuse
                     for the continuance of the historic pay and job inequities
                     for women is insensitive and reveals a lack of scholarship

but certainly not by the women of America. This record
leaves no conclusion, despite his current protestations, but
that when faced with the opportunity, he will overrule Roe
v. Wade. and that he will furthermore provide a lackluster
if not damaging performance in correcting the historic pay
and job inequities between men and women in the work place.
Judge Thomas's recent back-pedaling and recanting is clearly
that of a person who believes the "end justifies the means."
The Supreme court appointment that has been offered to him
has become the pole star guiding his each and every
utterance during these confirmation hearings.

We challenge each of you in your own review of Judge Thomas'
report card to first cast aside any consideration of the
political exigencies of the moment. Use as your pivotal
point the support for the constitutional right to "choice"
by the vast majority of your women constituents, a support
that crosses party lines. Next, resolve to support the
constitutional requirement of equal protection to bring
about the termination of the inequities for women in the
work place. Then review Judge Thomas' report card - the
evidence of his lack of commitment to the legal status of
women - and contrast it with your own support and with your
own resolve. We further challenge each of you to vote your
conscience on this candidate's commitment to the legal
values the Supreme Court is entrusted to protect. In view
of Judge Thomas' demonstrated wavering, we believe your
conscience will dictate a decision that will protect a
woman's choice and support the removal of the barriers
holding back women from equal pay and professional status.

Judge Thomas is not the only candidate in the vast talent
pool from which our President can choose. Let President
Bush use this opportunity to appoint a person to the bench
who not only is eminently qualified, but who is attuned to
the basic rights of the women voters of America. Clarence
Thomas never was and never can be such a person. You and
the President of the United States can do better, and we
challenge you to do so.

Very truly yours.

Supreme Court.

         I come before you as a woman, legislator, and a citizen to
ask you to consider the implications of Judge Thomas'
appointment as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court for
women's equality and women's opportunities. Judge Thomas'
record as chief of the Office of Civil Rights and of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission reveals his disregard for
women's legal rights to equal treatment in education and in
employment.

         At the helm of the Office of Civil Rights, Judge Thomas
sought to narrow and to weaken women's Title IX guarantees of
non-discrimination and equity in education. Placing his views
and his agenda above existing law, he worked to narrow the scope
and quality of Title IX safeguards available to women in
educational institutions. He sought permission from the Justice
Department to repeal established regulations, most especially
including Title IX protections for women employed in educational
institutions. He defied a court order to enforce Title IX
through timely compliance reviews. He weakened enforcement of
Title IX by retrenching OCR's monitoring role, accepting mere
promises of remedial action by institutions against which
complaints had been filed rather than demanding that
institutions demonstrate compliance with the requirements of
Title IX. He substituted his own interpretation of Title IX for
established regulations governing admissions, employment,
athletic, and counseling practices which have an adverse impact
based on sex. Judge Thomas imposed an intent standard on Title
IX enforcement, making it difficult to prosecute broad
violations of women's educational rights. As a result, during
Judge Thomas' short tenure at OCR, the remedies available to
women aggrieved by discrimination in education were narrowed.
The agency responsible for protecting women's rights in
education instead made it easier for educational institutions to
discriminate.

         As one of the original authors of Title IX I am acutely
disturbed by Judge Thomas' contempt for the law of educational
equity. Title IX is the fountainhead of women's equality of
opportunity, not only in education but in employment and public
life, as well. Education opens doors, and more important,
creates choices. Judge Thomas' narrow view of the problem of
                                      847

discrimination, combined with the benefit of the doubt he
extended to institutions against which claims were made, showed
his lack of commitment to women's opportunities and choices.
More significant still, Judge Thomas' decision to eschew
precedent, evade court orders, and shun legislative history with
respect to Title IX enforcement is part of a larger pattern of
imposing his own agenda upon the law and at the expense of the
civil rights of women.

         This pattern is further revealed if we look at Judge
Thomas' records at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Commissioner Thomas left a legacy of neglect for women's wage
and job discrimination claims at EEOC. In 1988 the General
Accounting Office concluded that Thomas' EEOC typically closed
cases without adequately investigating employee's claims: by FY
1989, in fact, more than half of the individuals who filed
complaints with EEOC got no relief. (By comparison, only 29% of
complainants got no relief in FY 1980).

         Host women who filed discrimination complaints against
employers' fetal protection policies were ignored by Judge
Thomas' EEOC. The agency charged with protecting working
women's rights simply defaulted on enforcing Title VII's
prohibition against intentional, sex-based discrimination. When
the EEOC issued guidelines on fetal protection policies in 1988,
it weakened women's Title VII protections by expanding employer"
defenses. Several years earlier, Judge Thomas' EEOC had
participated in lower court cases, arguing that the stringent
BFOQ (bona fied occupational qualification) test need not be met
by employers implementing fetal protection policies. Rather,
the EEOC argued, "business necessity" might be argued to
justify the policy. Lower courts so ruled in two cases,
creating precedents that the EEOC then incorporated into its own
guidelines. Under Judge Thomas, then, the agency charged with
enforcing Title VII lowered employers' threshold defense for at
least one form of blatant, facial discrimination.

         Working women aggrieved by wage discrimination fared no
better than women aggrieved by fetal protection policies when
they sought relief from Judge Thomas' EEOC. Judge Thomas may
have convinced this committee that he didn't mean it when he
quoted Thomas Sowell -- arguing that women don't have the skills
for or interest in better-paying jobs, that they choose low-wage
labor, that they choose to be unreliable workers because they
choose to have babies. But his record at EEOC shows that he did
mean it. He warehoused more than 250 disparate impact wage
discrimination claims for more than three years while the EEOC
tried to develop a policy. Meanwhile, straightforward Equal Pay
Act cases -- where women and men performing the same work
received different pay -- did not receive vigilant attention.
                                      848

         More strikingly, in the most important wage discrimination
case pursued by the EEOC in recent years -- the Sears case --
Judge Thomas publicly disparaged his own agency for bringing the
suit on behalf of women employed by Sears. The fact that Judge
Thomas' EEOC did not initiate the case -- the Carter
Administration EEOC filed the suit in 1979 on behalf of women
segregated into lower-paying jobs -- did not absolve him of his
ethical professional obligation to the EEOC's clients, the women
workers at Sears. Judge Thomas was resoundingly criticized for
his comments about the case, including by the esteemed former
Chair of the House Education and Labor Committee, Augustus
Hawkins, and by the trial judge. The EEOC lost the case, never
appealed, and, under Judge Thomas, ceased to take on cases on
behalf of large numbers of women.

         Judge Thomas' conduct during the Sears case, clearly
privileged his own views and agenda over the precedents and
legal responsibilities of the EEOC. The Sears case is not an
isolated example of Judge Thomas' disregard for law and
government. His record on affirmative action while at EEOC and
his public criticism of the Supreme Court's decision in Johnson
v. Santa Clara County also expose the Judge's proclivity for
rule by opinion and his disregard for the rule of law. Under
Judge Thomas, the EEOC in 1985 effectively banned the use of
goals and timetables in any settlements in which the EEOC was
involved, and stopped enforcing goals and timetables in existing
consent decrees. Thomas promised to lift the ban under pressure
of his reconfirmation hearings in 1986. Though he promised to
lift the ban, he continued to speak out against affirmative
action. He condemned the Supreme Court's decision in Johnson,
embraced Justice Scalia's very troubling dissent, and stated his
hope that Scalia's dissent would provide a basis for overturning
the decision. This raises serious questions not only about
Judge Thomas' substantive views, but about his respect for share
decisis.

         Judge Thomas' approach to discrimination law as the
country's chief anti-discrimination officer bespeaks a man with
a clear political agenda, an agenda which has filtered his
interpretation and driven his non-enforcement of rights and
remedies. So, too, does his list of heroes from whom he quotes
or to whom he approvingly points: Lewis Lehrman, Thomas Sowell,
Oliver North.

         Now he asks you to believe that his record of actions,
speeches, and writings is not a record at all, but merely a
series of random quotations, philosophical musings, and highly
context-specific decisions by a politically purposeless
bureaucrat. In his testimony before this committee, Judge
Thomas labored hard to show himself to be everywhere and
nowhere, to have uttered words but not to have had opinions, to
have taken stands but not really to have meant anything by them.
                                      849

         The confusion Judge Thomas has deliberately created about
who he is, about what he thinks, and about how he thinks, ought
to disqualify him from ascent to the High Court. He fails as a
nominee on the merits of his own case. No one who cannot or
will not articulate his view of constitutional interpretation,
who cannot or will not share his view of fundamental rights, who
cannot or will not admit to having a view of Roe v. Wade, and
who cannot or will not show enough courage to stand by the
convictions that have driven his actions and writing...no one,
in short, who is a legal and jurisprudential vacuum deserves
appointment to the body that guards our democratic rights and
processes.

         It is unfair to wise and courageous jurists -- female or
male; black, latino, asian, indian, or white -- to settle for
this appointment to the Court. It is unfair to the people who
place their trust in law and democracy to give the power and
responsibility to write judicial opinions to an unseasoned judge
and sloppy reasoner who does not even read (by his own
admission) the materials which he approvingly cites. And it is
a grave injustice to the women of America to place the future of
reproductive choice in the hands of someone who has habitually
placed himself above law and precedent, who refuses to disclose
what the reproductive rights "controversy" to which he has
alluded is about, who will not explain how he approaches
constitutional adjudication, and who will neither affirm nor
deny that Roe is or should be settled law.

         The reproductive rights questions that Clarence Thomas so
clumsily ducked during five days of questioning are not trivial
or inappropriate questions to ask of a Supreme Court nominee.
Women's full equality and personhood depend on our ability to
make reproductive choices. Women's health and women's lives
depend on continued protection of reproductive decision-making
as a realm of fundamental liberty. We should not ask how
Clarence Thomas will rule in a particular case given particular
facts. But we rightfully demand an answer when we ask of him:
Does the fundamental right to privacy encompass a woman's right
to terminate a pregnancy as handed down in Roe? And we deserve
to know whether he believes -- not whether the Court has stated
-- that the due process clause of the 14th Amendment encompasses
a fetal right to life. The public has a right to know how a
prospective Justice approaches rights, how he interprets the
Constitution, and how he relates both to gender equality. Much
is at stake here. The first right ever to be withdrawn from the
American people may well be withdrawn by the Rehnquist Court.
The reproductive right. And it will be taken away from American
women.

         Choice and personal welfare strike to the core of what's
at issue in the Thomas nomination. Choice -- educational,
occupational, and reproductive -- has been this society's chosen
                                      850

pathway toward equality. But choice must be tied to the
fairness and support that underpins personal welfare. It is not
enough for a woman to have the choice to attend a university, if
her educational welfare in the university is put at risk because
law Title IX enforcement means that sexual harassment goes
unpoliced and unpunished. It is not enough for a woman to have
the choice to be a nurse, if her economic welfare is put at risk
because she hasn't chosen a less skilled, but male-dominated,
and higher-paying job. And it is not enough for a woman to have
the choice to seek a back alley abortion -- for women will find
ways to make reproductive choices even if Roe is overturned --
if her health is put at risk by unlicensed practitioners in
unsanitary locations. It is this range of women's choices and
the legal protections that must accompany them for which the
Clarence Thomas we know best -- as head of OCR and the EEOC and
as "part-time political theorist" -- lacks understanding and
commitment.

         I urge you to reject Judge Thbmas' nomination to the
Supreme Court.

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden
Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee
224 Dirksen Senate Office Building
Washington, D.C. 20510
Attn.: Ron Klain, Chief Counsel

Dear Senator Biden:

        I am writing for the expressed purpose of clarifying issues
raised concerning the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC)-issues that have dominated the confirmation hearings of
Judge Clarence Thomas, United States Supreme Court nominee. The
period at EEOC prior to Judge Thomas' tenure as Chairman, based on
the agency's record, would appear to be in dire need of
clarification.

        Denigrating language has been used during the hearings to
describe an agency in shambles when Chairman Thomas arrived. I
submit, the agency was not in shambles. Far from it, EEOC was
doing quite well, having fended off an unprecedented assault by
persons who would have liked to have seen EEOC closed. The
agency's budget had been targeted for severe reduction which caused
the staff to have to fight to save the agency at the very door
steps of the Office of Management and Budget. This action can be
easily found in EEOC's records.

         EEOC won its fight to have the budget restored, even during
a time when it was without a quorum for 81 days, the first time in
the agency's history when it had only two commissioners.

         During the confirmation hearings of Judge Thomas, there have
been several references to the Commission prior to Chairman Thomas'
arrival, mostly negative. In fact, to my knowledge the record
reveals no responses from the nominee or from former members of
EEOC defending the Commission and its faithful and productive
employees during some very trying times prior to Judge Thomas'
confirmation a Chairman.

         I was appointed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
as a Republican in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and ?s acting
chairman by President Ronald Reagan on March 3, 1981. I served as
acting chairman until I resigned on March 3, 1982.
            852

         I was succeeded by Cathie A. Shattuck, also a Republican, who
served for a short period as acting chair until Clarence Thomas was
confirmed by the Senate. Clarence Thomas was nominated as a
Commissioner and designated as Chairman by President Reagan the day
after I tendered my resignation as acting chairman in order to
start my transition out of government.

         I feel compelled to provide two reports for the record that
I issued on October 8, 1981 (Year-End (FY '81) Report on EEOC
Activities) and on January 13, 1982 (Report To Field Directors).
These reports reflect the state of the Commission immediately
before Chairman Thomas was confirmed by the Senate.

        As the reports are contemporaneous with Chairman Thomas'
appointment by President Reagan, I will not editorialize on them
beyond the text of the reports. I do, however, want to laud the
faithful staff at the Commission in 1982 without whose assistance
and guidance the agency may have been irreparably crippled by the
Office of Management and Budget.

         I respectfully request that these reports be entered into the
record of the hearings of Judge Clarence Thomas for the United
States Supreme Court. The purpose of this tender is to show that
EEOC was operating at high standards when Judge Thomas assumed
leadership of EEOC.

                                                              Sincerely,

        ACTING CHAIRMAN, EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION

             REPORT TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND BUSINESS COMMUNITY
                                          October 8, 1981

                    YEAR-END (FY '81) REPORT ON EEOC ACTIVITIES

        Several prominent civil rights groups, members of the
business community and the House Subcommittee on Employment
Opportunities chaired by the Honorable Augustus Hawkins, have asked
me in my capacity as head of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission to report to them on those matters which might be of
interest concerning the on-going activities of the agency.

        The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is alive and well
at this time, but I kid you not when I say that we are in a desperate
fight for survival. The President has stated or. several occasions
that he is firmly committed to equal job opportunity for all
Americans. I have not been informed that he has wavered, changed
or altered this view. Yet there is that underlying perception,
fear and apprehension that things are not the same and that
there will not be continued vigorous enforcement of civil rights
laws.

        To allay some of the existing pessimism, I thought it would
be appropriate for me to issue a first time ever report to the
civil rights and business communities on the current status of
the Commission's activities. So what will follow here will be a
chronological play-by-play of the various program areas in the
agency, followed-up by an urgent concern which faces us today.
This report covers the following subjects:

Compliance Activity

        Charge processing figures for the first three quarters of
Fiscal Year 1981 show a continued climb in the area of production
and benefits. During this period the Commission received for
processing 40,293 charges. Our field offices have resolved 54,482
charges or 35% more charges than we have taken in. This represents
a one-third increase in production over comparable figures for
Fiscal Year 1980.

        In the Title VII area, the Commission took in 31,751
charges and resolved 45,456 or almost 45% more than we have taken in.
The Commission's Title VII backlog, which stood at almost 70,000
charges as of January 1979, is now below 24,000 charges.

        tiore important, Commission processes continue to provide
substantial relief. Despite the extraordinary number of resolutions,
the Title VII rapid charge settlement rate is holding at 43%. The
settlement rate for Age discrimination charges has risen to 25% and
Equal Pay settlements have gone up to 27%.

        Through nine months of 1981, approximately $60 million in
relief was obtained for 36,682 people. These figures exceed
benefits attained for all of Fiscal 1980.

to establish a settlement fund for the benefit of a nationwide

significant provisions of the settlement:

          (1) assign all new production trainees to perform tasks in
                   both traditionally male and traditionally female entry
                   level jobs to afford exposure to the duties of both jobs;

          (2) conduct, semi-annually, a training program for the pur-
                   pose of training female production employees to fill
                   temporary openings in higher-paying job classifications;

          (3) allow female employees the opportunity to work overtime
                   without imposing certain conditions that interfered with
                   overtime opportunities in the past;

          (4) eliminate all differences in work rules between pro-
                   duction departments;

          (5) implement a sex-sensitivity program for management
                   personnel to be monitored by counsel for plaintiffs
                   and counsel for the EEOC;

          (6) take steps necessary to discourage harassment of female
                   employees--establish a procedure by which females'
                   grievances of sexual harassment will be promptly resolved
                   and take disciplinary action against any employee who
                   engages in such harassment;

          (7) post openings for all production jobs bakery-wide rather
                   than departmentally;

          (8) include in all job postings a description of the job, a
                   statement that the successful bidder will be trained,
                   and a statement that the successful bidder has a right
                   to return to her former classification without loss o°f

                   at least 60 percent of the vacancies that occur in the
                   assistant foreperson position and at least 60 percent
                   of the vacancies that occur in the foreperson position
                   at each bakery;

          (10) immediately promote certain long-term female supervisory
                   personnel to higher level positions;

          (11) post in all bakeries, for a period of six months, a
                   notice, to be approved by counsel for plaintiffs and
                   counsel for EEOC, highlighting the affirmative relief
                   provisions;

          (12) provide the EEOC with reports which will be used to
                   monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement;

          (13) evaluate management employees and use as a criterion
                   for promotion their performance in securing and enforcing
                   equal employment opportunities for female employees;

          (14) abolish the practice of allowing employees in male-
                   dominated jobs to have first choice in bidding on most
                   desirable shifts before the jobs are posted for bid
                   bakery-wide;

          (15) have no rules prohibiting the carry over of seniority
                   between departments or classifications.

         The agreement resolved a lengthy and complex litigation matter

which arose out of a complaint filed in 1975 by two employees at

the Nabisco Bakery in Pittsburgh.

         The EEOC intervened in the lawsuit in 1977, following an

investigation of the numerous charges of sex discrimination filed

by the Pittsburgh bakery women on behalf of themselves and all

other female employees working in the production departments of the

bakery.

         The settlement, one of the most far-reaching in EEOC history,

may impact as many as 8,000 women. The settlement fund will be

distributed to all female employees working in production departments

at the 11 bakeries any time on or after January 21
                                  859

Nabisco will bear the cost of notifying all eligible claimants
and distributing awards.

         We also signed a settlement agreement with Sears, Roebuck
and Co., that resolved four EEOC employment discrimination suits
against this nation's largest retailer. The terms of the agree-
ment were directed at insuring that Sears would implement pro-
cedures to monitor its own hiring practices in ways that should
assure compliance with the law. We believe then and now that
the agreement will enhance minority opportunities at Sears,
and we hope to observe signs that will justify that belief in
the near future.

         The suits, filed in October 1979, alleged that Sears used
discriminatory hiring practices involving race and national origin
at seven facilities in Atlanta, Memphis, Montgomery and New York.
This suit largely involved procedural issues. A few days prior
to the settlement the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York affirmed
a lower court's dismissal of the New York suit. It ruled that the
Commission had not adequately negotiated the practices of the
facilities named in that suit.

         The settlement agreement called for Sears to modify its
personnel practices at every facility throughout the nation. While
the agreement recognizes Sears' voluntary affirmative action efforts,
it required amendment of Sears' affirmative action program.

         According to the agreement, Sears will have to give greater
attention to the minority composition of applicants and establish
procedures to monitor, at several levels, the comparison of a
minority group's composition of applicants and the group's
composition of hires in order to insure there is no discrimination
at any stage of the hiring process.
                                  860

         The agreement has a duration of five years during which, if
Sears complies with the agreement, the EEOC will not sue to seek
class-wide relief for hiring discrimination, although the EEOC
may seek relief for individuals alleged to be victims of hiring
discrimination. The agreement does not affect the rights of
private parties to seek individual or class-wide relief for
allegations of hiring discrimination.

         The settlement agreement does not affect the EEOC's nation-
wide sex discrimination suit against Sears which was also
brought in October 1979. A Federal judge recently ordered the
parties to be ready for trial in that case by June 1982.

Office of_ Systemic Programs

        The Office of Systemic Programs has made significant progress
during the latter half of FY '81. A number of new charges were
issued, and charges which had been previously issued began moving
through the administrative process at a much more rapid pace.
The program is now fully staffed and operating at its projected
workload. The Office anticipates continued progress leading to
a significant number of settlements and the initiation of as many
as 15 lawsuits in the coming year, depending on budgetary constraints.

        During the latter half of FY '81, OSP issued 23 Commissioner
Charges, bringing its total to date to 130. Included in the last group
of new charges was the first charge ever issued by the Headquarters
Unit. This is especially significant since it reflects substantial
progress in the processing of the large number of backlogged pattern
and practice charges inherited by that unit at its inception.

        The process of issuing charges was more firmly structured with
the completion of OSP's targeting model which compares the employ-
ment profiles of similar employers within a given area. This
system permits OSP units to concentrate their limited resources on
specific targets. The targeting model will be updated this year
as soon as the most current EEO-l's are placed on computer, and will
be expanded to permit the review of the employment membership
practices of unions and joint apprenticeship programs. We believe
that this expansion will represent a major advance in the area of
efficient resource allocation.

        Of the 104 charges issued prior to FY '81, 20% have now
been fully investigated, most of these in the past six months.
During the 4th quarter of FY '81, the Commission issued its first
7 decisions based on systemic charges and achieved settlement
of one additional charge. The 7 decided charges are now in
conciliation, and will either result in settlement or be referred
for litigation early next fiscal year. An additional 8 charges
have been fully investigated, with decisions drafted, but are
being held pending settlement discussions and 4 other decisions
are presently undergoing headquarters review. Moreover1, a number
of charges pending in the investigative phase are the subject
of ongoing settlement discussions. We project that more than 50%
of the present "charge load (i.e., that which has not yet reached
the decision stage) will either reach decision or settle prior
to decision during the next fiscal year.

        OSP's Technical Services Division has continued in its role
as expert advisor to field and headquarters investigative and legal
units. The Technical Services Division has assumed a particularly
important role with respect to the Uniform Guidelines on Employee
Selection Procedures. During the 4th Quarter, the Division compiled
its first comprehensive data on review of test validation studies
and found that approximately 75% of such studies have been approved
either in whole or in part. This information has been published
in a number of EEO newsletters in order to allay employers' concerns
that the UGESP standards are exceedingly difficult to meet.
Additionally, in keeping with EEOC's position that the UGESP should
                                     863

                                 - n -

be consistent with current professional standards on test
validation, TSD staff members have been active participants in
the American Psychological Association's current review of its
standards.

        In the area of litigation, the Office has achieved several
major resolutions this fiscal year. Early in 1981, we entered into
a $1.1 million settlement with the Commonwealth Oil Refining Company.
The Commission's suit against CORCO had alleged pervasive sex and
national origin discrimination by the Puerto Rican refinery. Two
other settlements were tendered to district courts within the past
six months, but final decrees have not been entered. An Office of
Systemic Programs lawsuit against the Alabama Power Co. and IBEW
was settled for approximately $2.2 million and included increased
job opportunities for minorities and women, company-wide. Most
recently, the Office settled a major portion of its protracted
litigation against the Operating Engineers unions in New York City.
Total monetary relief in that case was $81,500. More importantly,
in the light of current ongoing discussions relating to a
changing policy pertaining to affirmative action requirements, the
settlement provided for preferential work referrals for identified
victims of past discrimination. These referrals are especially
significant as the funding of the West Side Highway project in New
York insures the availability of jobs and the opportunity to
acquire necessary skills.

        The Litigation Enforcement Division filed four new
actions during 4th Quarter FY '81 and these, along with its
existing docket, will proceed in FY '82. The major focus of the
Division's resources over the next several months, however, will
be the nationwide sex discrimination action against Sears,
Roebuck & Co., which is scheduled for trial in June 1982. Prep-
aration for this trial has been a ma^or activity during the past
six months. Such activity, coupled with the ongoing and intensive
settlement negotiations with another major corporation and union,
makes it extremely likely that FY "82 will see all of the
backlogged SICD charges resolved.

Office of Policy Implementation

        One of the issues that has increasingly attracted the interest
of both the public and private sector is the need for regulatory
reform. Depending upon one's political or economic perspective, the
term "regulatory reform" may have many different meanings. Re-
gardless of the philosophical perspective of who is addressing
this issue, almost everyone will agree that the issue of
regulatory reform is one that needs to be addressed in a very
systematic and intelligent manner, with an eye to developing a less
burdensome regulatory framework without dismantling the underlying
rationale which initially dictated the need for such government
interest. I will attempt to bring you up to date on the past and
present efforts on the part of the Commission to reduce the burden-
someness of government regulations and to clarify some common mis-
conceptions that currently exist about Commission regulatory activity.
                                     865

                                                      - 13 -

         It seems in order at this time to make a general comment about
the terminology often used by individuals when discussing this
general area of governmental regulations. This misuse of terminology
alone can often lead to unnecessary misunderstandings when dis-
cussing regulatory reform. First of all, when Congress passed the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, it specifically rejected proposals authoriz-
ing EEOC to issue substantive regulations. Congress only authorized
the Commission to issue procedural regulations to carry out the

                                              1/
provisions of Title VII, and in addition, gave us power to provide

                                                              2/

technical assistance to persons subject to Title VII. Accord-
ingly, the Commission has historically chosen the vehicle of
interpretative guidelines to provide such technical assistance.
This distinction is not a minor one and needs to be kept in mind,
at least by our critics, when discussing the issue of regulatory
reform. Guidelines, unlike regulations, create no legal rights
or obligations, have no binding effect, and do not in and of them-
selves have the force of law. Guidelines instead play the important
role of educating and advising employers about the day-to-day
application of a complex statute that can have far-reaching
consequences for employers. The guidelines are based primarily upon
court rulings regarding the application of the statute to the
specific issue discussed in the guidelines, or if there is little,
if any, legal precedent on the issue, what Courts have held in the
application of general Title VII principles.

        Even though guidelines create no substantive legal obligations
on the part of employers, the Commission is keenly aware of the fact
that the guidelines are regarded very seriously by the Commission,
employers and the courts, because they articulate EEOC's enforcement
position in regard to employers' practices and policies. Because of
this, proposed guidelines are always published in the Federal
Register with an invitation to the public to submit written comments
on the proposed guidelines. The comments are then reviewed by Com-
mission staff, and often addressed in the preamble to any guide-
lines the Commission might issue or used as the basis of revisions
to the proposed guidelines. Sometimes the Commission may also
schedule a public hearing on the subject matter of proposed guidelines.
A recent example is the Guidelines on Discrimination Because of Reli-
gion where the Commission held public hearings in April and May of
1978 in New York City, Los Angeles and Milwaukee.

        As pointed out above, the guidelines create no substantive
legal obligations on the part of the employer. However, the guide-
lines themselves are sensitive to the fact that very rigid criteria
would often be particularly burdensome for employers, especially
                                  867

                                                  - 15 -

those who may wish to voluntarily pattern their employment practices
after those suggested in the Commission guidelines for purposes of
creating equal job opportunities for all workers and for protecting
themselves from possible Title VII liability. For example, the
Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP) include
a less stringent recordkeeping requirement for employers with less
than 100 employees. UGESP also adopted the "bottom line" approach,
meaning that even if certain components of the employer's total
selection process might have an adverse impact on a class pro-
tected by Title VII, the Commission would look only at the final
result, i.e., did the selection process as a whole have an adverse
impact. Alternative methods of test validating are also permitted
by the UGESP so that an employer is free to choose whatever method
of validation it prefers. Like other Commission guidelines, the
UGESP advises employers by what criteria their employee selection
procedures will be evaluated should they be charged with a
violation of Title VII.

          Executive Order 12291 requires that each federal executive agency
publish in April and October of each year a semi-annual agenda of
proposed regulations that the agency has issued or expects to issue,
and currently effective rules that are under agency review pursuant
to the Executive Order.

        In August of 1981 the Vice President's Task Force on Regulatory
Relief announced a list of govenment regulations that would be
subjected to review under Executive Order 12291. This list contains
two of the Commission's guidelines, namely, the Guidelines on Sexual
Harassment and the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.
The Vice President has identified the Sexual Harassment Guidelines
because of public comments criticizing them for failing to provide
adequate guidance to employers on such questions as to what
constitutes unwelcome sexual advances or prohibited verbal sexual
conduct under the statute. As to the Uniform Guidelines on Employee
Selection Procedures, the burdensomeness and the utility of the record-
keeping requirements are the subject of review. The Task Force
requested that we submit workplans for the review of these guidelines
by September 15, 1981. After meeting with the Task Force representa-
tives and under my direction, our proposed workplans were delivered
to the Task Force on September 9, 1981. We expect to begin working
on these reviews in the near future.

        The semi-annual agenda that has been approved by the Commission
for publication in the Federal Register during the month of October
describes current Commission.regulatory activity. Although the
Commission is of the opinion that none of its proposed guidelines
or procedural regulations- fall within the Executive Order's definition
of a "major rule," the Commission, nevertheless, chose to include all
of the items that appear in the October semi-annual regulatory agenda
because of its desire to keep all interested parties fully informed
of Commission activities and to provide parties an early opportunity
                                      869

                                             - 17 -

to comment on proposed Commission policy statements, regulations or
guidelines, as early as possible.

        The first category of guidelines appearing on the October semi-
annual agenda lists the current Guidelines on Sexual Harassment and
the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, both of
which have been targeted for review by the Vice President's Task Force,
as discussed above.

        The second category of Commission regulatory activity
included on the semi-annual agenda as required by E.O. 12291
contains an itemized list of proposed regulations and guidelines
that are currently pending before the Commission. Each of the items
has been published in proposed form at least once in the Federal
Register for the purpose of soliciting written comments from in-
terested parties. Most of the items are procedural regulatibns
governing the processing of Title VII charges or areas of EEOC's
enforcement responsibility, such as the Equal Pay Act and the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, which were transferred to the
Commission under the President's Reorganization Plan of 1978
(43 FR 19807). Five of the items are procedural regulations to
expedite the processing of federal sector Complaints of discrimina-
tion. Included are:

        1. Employment Discrimination; Procedure for Handling
               Complaints
               The EEOC and the Department of Justice jointly issued
               proposed rules (published on April 17, 1981, in
               46 FR 22395) setting forth procedures for the handling
               of complaints of employment discrimination which are
                               870

                                     - 18 -

      filed with Federal fund granting agencies under
      Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX
      of the Education Amendments of 1972 and other pro-
      visions of Federal law which prohibit discrimination
      on the grounds of race, color, religion, age, sex or
      national origin in programs or activities receiving
      Federal financial assistance. The regulations allow
      the fund granting agency to refer complaints to the
      Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). For
      complaints covered both by Title VII of the Civil
      Rights Act of 1964, as amended, or other statutes
      within EEOC's jurisdiction and by Title VI of the
      Civil Rights Act or Title IX, the regulations
      contemplate that most complaints of individual
      acts of discrimination will be referred to EEOC
      for investigation and conciliation, while most
      complaints of systemic discrimination will be
      retained by the fund granting agency. Employment
      discrimination complaints which are not covered
      by Title VI or Title IX will be transferred to
      EEOC. 46 FR 22395 (April '17, 1981). The period
      for submitting written comments ended on June
      16, 1981.

2. Non-Discrimination on the Basis of Handicap Federally
      Assisted Programs

      These proposed regulations (published on November
      29, 1979, at 44 FR 68482) set forth procedures and
      policies to assure non-discrimination on the basis
      of handicap. The regulations define and forbid acts
      of discrimination against qualified handicapped
      individuals in employment and in the operation of
      programs and activities receiving assistance from
      the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. These
      proposed regulations implement Section 504 of the
      Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, in compliance
      with Executive Order 11914, April 29, 1976. The
      proposed regulations have been approved in final
      form by the Commission and are now in inter-agency
      coordination pursuant to E.O. 12067.

3. Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government;
      Complaints of Handicap Discrimination

      The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (pursuant
      to notice published in 45 FR 24130 on April 9, 1980)
      proposes to amend its regulations concerning complaints
                               871

                                     - 19 -

      of handicap discrimination in order to authorize awards
      of back pay to applicants for Federal employment.
      The proposed regulations also make clear that a com-
      plainant has the right to file suit in Federal court
      if dissatisfied with final agency action, or failure
      to act, on a complaint of handicap discrimination.
      These changes are necessary in order to conform to
      the 1978 amendments to the Rehabilitation Act
      of 1973. Final regulations have been approved
      by the Commission and are currently in the
      clearance process under E.O. 12291.

4. Equal Opportunity in the Federal Government;
      Remedial Relief under Section 717

      Interim regulations, effective April 11, 1980,
      were published in 45 FR 24130 on April 9, 1980,
      revising EEOC's regulations on equal opportunity
      in the Federal government (29 CFR 1613) to provide
      that an agency or the Commission may award a com-
      plainant reasonable attorney's fees and costs and
      backpay when a complaint of discrimination under
      Section 717 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
      of 1964, as amended, is resolved in favor of the
      complainant.

5. Procedures; Age Discrimination in Employment

      On January 30, 1981, in 46 FR 9970, the Commission
      published for comment proposed procedural regulations
       (29 CFR 1626) advising the public as to those pro-
      poses to follow in processing charges and issuing
      interpretations and opinions under the Age
      Discrimination in Employment Act. These regulations
      will complement the Commission's existing pro-
      cedural regulations under Title VII of the Civil
      Rights Act of 1964, as amended. The Commission hopes
      to schedule a vote on final regulations before the
      end of 1981.

6. 706 State and Local Agencies

      On July 21, 1981, in 46 FR 37523, the Commission
      published notice of its proposal to revise its pro-
      cedural regulations by the addition of §51601.75, 1601.77,
      1601.78, 1601.79 and 1601.80 to 29 CFR Part 1601. These
      sections set forth procedures whereby the Commission
      and certain State and local fair employment practices
      agencies (706 agencies) are relieved of the present
      Commission individual, case-by-case review of cases
      processed by these agencies under contract with the

                                               - 20 -

               Commission, as provided in Section 709(b) of
               Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
               amended. These sections set forth the procedures
               by which the Commission may certify certain 706
               State and local agencies which meet prescribed
               criteria. These regulations are expected to
               become final in October 1981.

        Four of the items on the semi-annual regulatory agenda required

by E.O. 12291 discuss recordkeeping requirements proposed by the

Commission.

        1. Recordkeeping Regulations

               Pursuant to notice of proposed rulemaking published
               in 43 FR 32280 on July 25, 1978, the Commission
               proposes to revise its recordkeeping regulations
               to require certain employers and labor unions to
               retain lists of applications for employment for 2
               years. This action is taken because the Commission
               has found itself in a position of being unable to
               secure specific relief for the victims of discrim-
               inatory hiring or referral practices. The Commission
               believes that a recordkeeping requirement would
               assure more adequate redress for the victims of
               discrimination. The period for recordkeeping of other
               documents is proposed to be extended. In addition,
               the definition of "employee" for reporting purposes
               is proposed to be modified. 3/

        2. Collection of Applicant Data for Affirmative Action Purposes

               This interim regulation was published in 46 FR 11285 on
               February 6, 1981, effective immediately. This amend-
               ment will permit agencies to collect handicap informa-
               tion from applicants in order to implement and evaluate

V The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 also requires that
     executive agencies publish a semi-annual agenda listing proposed
     regulations that will have an impact on small entities as defined
     in the Act. The only item appearing on EEOC's October semi-
     annual as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 is
     the proposed recordkeeping regulations.

              special recruitment programs undertaken for
              affirmative action purposes. Specifically,
              agencies will be allowed to invite applicants,
              on a voluntary basis, to identify themselves
              as handicapped and specify the nature of their
              disabilities. Agencies will be permitted to
              use this information only for purposes related
              to affirmative action and equal employment
              opportunity.

        3. Privacy Act of 1974; Proposed Privacy Act System
              of Records

              On April 14, 1981, in 46 FR 21819, the Commission
              published notice of its proposal to establish a
              system of records subject to the Privacy Act of
               1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. The proposed system, EEOC-1,
              Age and Equal Pay Act Discrimination Case Files, will
               contain information on individuals who file charges
              or complaints of discrimination under the Age
               Discrimination in Employment Act or the Equal Pay
              Act. 4/

        4. Privacy Act Regulations

               On April 14, 1981, in 46 FR 21784, the Commission
               published notice of its proposal that pursuant to
               subsection (k)(2) of the Privacy Act, the Commission
               is exempting System EEOC-1, Age and Equal Pay Act
               Discrimination Case Files, from certain provisions
               of the Act. The Commission is concerned that the
               lack of this exemption would impede law enforcement
               activities of the Commission.

        The Reorganization Plan of 1978 (43 FR 19807) transferred

to EEOC the responsibility of enforcing the Equal Pay Act and Age

Discrimination in Employment Act. Currently pending before the

the Commission are proposed interpretations of these two acts.

4/ The proposed Privacy Act System of Records and the Privacy Act
    Regulations each require separate Commission action but are related
    matters.

        1. The Equal Pay Act; Interpretations -

               On September 1, 1981, in 46 FR 43848, the Commission
               published its proposed interpretations with respect
               to the enforcement of the Equal Pay Act. These
               interpretations would replace those issued by the
               Department of Labor at 29 CFR Part 800. Comments
               on the proposed regulations must be received on
               or before November 2, 1981. The Commission proposes
               to consider the submissions for a period of at least
               ten days thereafter before adopting any final
               regulations.

        2. Proposed Interpretations of the Age Discrimination
               in Employment Act

               On July 1, 1979, pursuant to Reorganization Plan tlo. 1
               of 1978, 43 FR 19807 (May 9, 1978) responsibility
               and authority for enforcement of the Age Discrimination
               in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 621,
               623, 625, 626-633 and 634 (ADEA) was transferred from
               the Department of Labor to the Equal Employment
               Opportunity Commission. The Commission assumed enforce-
               ment of the ADEA on that date. Prior to the assumption
               of jurisdiction, the Commission commenced an in-depth
               review of all existing interpretations of the ADEA
              which were promulgated by the Department of Labor.
               See 44 FR 37974 (June 29, 1979). On November 30, 1979,
               the Commission published in the Federal Register its
               proposed interpretations of the ADEA. See 44 FR 68858
               (November 30, 1979). On September 29, 1980 in 45 FR
               64212, the Commission rescinded its earlier proposed
               interpretation. In August of 1981 the Commission
               approved the interpretation originally proposed in
               November of 1979 which will rescind the interpretations
               issued by the Department of Labor. Final interpre-
               tations are expected to be published by October of 1981.

        Pursuant to a request of the Office of Management and Budget

(OMB) under the authority of the Federal Reports Act, as amended by

the^Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, EEOC is seeking OMB approval of

the recordkeeping requirements contained in the Uniform Guidelines on

Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP). EEOC's completion of this survey

has been made a condition for OMB clearance. As defined by OMB, this

Survey will focus on the practical utility of the UGESP recordkeeping

requirements.

        In September 1977, EEOC entered into an agreement with NAS
pursuant to which NAS's Committee on Occupational Classification
and Analysis was to thoroughly examine the question of what methods
can be developed to assess the validity of principles used to estab-
lish and apply compensation systems.

        Subsidiary questions that were to be explored by the Committee
included: what systems are currently available or could be envisioned
that would objectively measure the comparability of jobs; to what
extent are systems of job analysis and classification currently
in use biased by traditional stereotypes and by other factors; and
in what ways have other,nations developed approaches to deal with
the structural bias in compensation systems.

        On September 1, 1981, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS)
presented to the Commission its final report on the subject of job
segregation and wage discrimination.

        The report was prepared by NAS's Committee on Occupational
Classification and Analysis and is entitled, "Women, Work and Wages:
Equal Pay for Jobs of Equal Value." The report represents an important
milestone in the EEOC's continuing review of the complex issue of
whether wages for historically segregated jobs have been
                                      876

                                                    - 24 -

discriminatorily depressed because those jobs are held predom-
inantly by minorities and women. This issue is one of the largest
and most complex left unresolved under Title VII today." The final
report of NAS is only one part of the Commission's comprehensive
and systematic review of this issue.

         Public hearings were held before the Commission on this issue
in Washington, 0. C , on April 28, 29 and 30, 1980; and NAS sub-
mitted an interim report on this subject entitled, "Job Evaluation:
An Analytic Review" to the Commission in February 1979.

         Although the report was prepared by NAS under a contract with
EEOC, the report does not necessarily reflect the official opinion
or policy of EEOC. The National Academy of Sciences is solely respon-
sible for the contents of the report which was written by a distin-
guished and balanced group chosen by NAS, and will be carefully
studied by the Commission-.

Office of Interagency Coordination

        The Commission's coordination role, under Section 715 of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12067, has been
extremely active during my tenure.

        On July 1, 1981, we responded to OFCCP's request for pre-
publication consultation pursuant to Executive Order 12067 on
OFCCP's proposed withdrawal of its regulations dealing with pay-
ment by contractors of membership fees to private clubs which
discriminate in their membership policies.

        On previous occasions the Commission had stated its position
that such payments constitute a violation of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act. We noted, however, the Department of Labor's acknowledg-
ment in the proposed preamble that it had authority to address
instances of employment discrimination which may arise from contrac-
tors' use of private clubs in the absence of a specific rule such as
Section 60-1.11.

        The Commission did not object to the withdrawal of the rule,
provided that the following sentence was added to the preamble to
the withdrawal:

        Accordingly, the Department will act upon complaints
        alleging that the payment by contractors of fees to
        private clubs which discriminate in membership has
        resulted in employment discrimination against an employee
        or applicant for employment (individual complaints received
        oy OFCCP normally are forwarded for handling to the EEOC
        pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding between the two
        agencies), and the Department will include an analysis of
        contractors' private club policies and practices as part
        of compliance reviews where appropriate.

                                                      - 26 -

         The purpose of our recommended addition was to affirm that
OPCCP and EEOC will investigate these matters in response to
complaints.

         In the crucial area of review of agency regulatory issuances,
the Commission met and was able to issue a timely response to OFCCP's
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking dealing with its affirmative action
regulations for Federal contractors. While I strongly endorsed
the need for regulatory reform and paperwork reduction, I expressed
concern and a willingness to negotiate a few of the substantive
changes proposed by OFCCP.

          In July I wrote OMB concerning my desire to ensure that
coordination of Federal equal employment programs remain as effective
as possible.

         Shortly thereafter, in August, based on OMB's response,
EEOC and OMB entered into an agreement governing the sequence of
reviews of agency regulatory issuances concerning equal employment
opportunity. The agreement, which strengthens the effectiveness of
Executive Order 12067, requires that EEOC complete its analysis of
agency NPRMs (Notice of Proposed Rulemaking), final rules and informa-
tion collection instruments under Executive Order 12067 prior to their
submittal to OMB for review under Executive Order 12291 and the Paper-
work Reduction Act. On August 26, I sent a memorandum outlining
the new procedures to the Heads of All Federal Agencies. Sub-
missions recently reviewed by OIC staff include proposals from the
Department of Education, the Legal Services Corporation, the Office
of Personnel Management, Office of Revenue Sharing, and the
Environmental Protection Agency.

                                             - 27 -

        Progress was also made in another important area. EEOC and the
Department of Justice have completed review of public comments on and
are moving ahead with a proposed regulation which requires funding
agencies to forward individual complaints of employment discrimination
to EEOC for processing. This regulation, which I personally support/
will eliminate duplication in the handling of complaints and provide
faster service to employers and complainants.

        In order to assist those covered by equal employment laws,
the Commission recently issued a bibliography of Federal agency
publications on that subject. The Commission also has approved for
publication a report covering the last two years' activities of its
Office of Interagency Coordination. That report also contains the
results of the Commission's survey of agency equal employment programs
and its questionnaire survey of a representative sample of private
and public sector employers. In addition, the report describes
present Commission activities designed to resolve the problems of
inefficiency, inconsistency and duplication identified in the two
surveys.

Office of_ Government Employment
        During January 1981,.EEOC issued advanced instructions to all

Federal agencies for the implementation of the multi-year
affirmative action plans through our Management Directive (M.D.
707). This plan will cover the period from FY '82 to FY '86.
                                   880

                                                      - 28-

         After the issuance of M.D. 707, several factors came to
light which forced us to consider alternative immediate action
to effect the Federal Affirmative Action Program. Prominent
among these was the denial of clearance for our reporting re-
quirements by the National Archives and Records Services (NARS).
NARS concluded that the data to be developed by Federal agencies
under M.D. 707 essentially duplicated the data which is reported
to and retrievable from the Central Personnel Data File (CPDF),
maintained by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). However,
the retrieval capability of CPDF, as it presently exists, is too
limited to provide appropriate breakouts of data for affirmative
action purposes. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
cannot fully utilize the CPDF until the system has been
redesigned. However, OPM's Director, Donald J. Devine, notified
us that his agency lacks the necessary resources to permit the
immediate redesigning and use of the CPDF for affirmative action
purposes.

         This complex situation required from us immediate action to
provide guidance to all agencies to continue the development of their
plan. Our Office of Government Employment conferred with
representatives of some thirty agencies to explain the situation
and to seek recommendations for a solution of the problem. Based
on these recommendations, on June 15, 1981, I wrote to all Federal
agencies spelling out a more flexible framework in which they
could continue the development of their plans and reluctantly
                                     881

                                           - 29 -

postponed the date for the initial submission of affirmative
action plans.

        After several meetings with NARS and OPM personnel, NARS
recognized the impossibility of using the CPDF and granted
clearance for our M.D.-707, as amended by a June 15 memorandum.
On August 12, 1981, I once again wrote to all Federal agencies
requesting them to complete their planning at the first possible
moment to meet the operative date of October 1, 1981.

        To obtain NARS clearance and because for the last two years
EEOC has acknowledged the benefits of the CPDF, we made a commit-
ment to find a solution for the better use of CPDF for affirmative
action purposes. We have therefore continued our conversations
and meetings with OPM personnel in an effort to find ways to
support program needs. However, our efforts have just reached a
critical point based on budgetary considerations. For on September
21, 1981, Mr. Devine wrote to me advising that while they are pre-
pared from a management point of view to provide CPDF data
support service to the Commission, the FY '82 budget reductions
directed by OMB have caused OPM to reduce the level of resources
allocated to the CPDF. He therefore requested that EEOC make
whatever arrangements are necessary to allocate to OPM the necessary
fund and ceiling required to support our program. We are pre-
sently preparing a response to Mr. Devine for the purpose of
advising him of our lack of resources to provide these funds and of
our ongoing efforts to obtain the necessary amount from the Office of
                                      882

                                              - 30 -

Management and Budget. OMB, however, has. been conducting a study
of the CPDF on its own and cannot make any money immediately
available to the project at this time.

        Another recent activity of our Federal Affirmative Action
(FAA) division has been the development of our Management
Directive (M.D.)-710 with instructions to Federal agencies on
their affirmative action accomplishment report for minorities
and women for FY '81. These will be the last instructions concern-
ing the two years' transition period which allowed agencies to
"learn" the new planning process as we moved away from the annual
planning concept to the multi-year approach (M.D.-707).
M.D.-710 has just been properly cleared for presentation to the
Commission for approval.

        Handicapped Individuals Program
        The week of October 5, 1981, is National Employ the Handicapped
Week, thus in this, the International Year of Disabled Persons,
we should also take this opportunity to reflect on problems
of the handicapped in all spheres of the republic.
        There are approximately 35 million disabled persons in the
United States, or about 15% of the total population. The
Department of Labor reports that there are 7.2 million severely
disabled persons of working age, or about 6% of the national
work force.
        OPM's Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) indicates that in 1979
there were 134,026 disabled Federal employees, who comprised 6.4%
of the total Federal non-postal work force.

                                             - 31 -

        For the EEOC, this is not just a week to listen to speeches
and then return to business as usual. We have substantive
responsibility for government-wide handicapped efforts. The EEOC
in July 1979, under the Civil Rights Reorganization Plan No. 1
of 1978, became the Federal agency responsible for federal sector
affirmative action planning. The EEOC is also responsible for
hearings, the oversight of the processing of EEO complaints and
appeals of agency decisions on EEO complaints, including handicap
issues.

        Our Office of Government Employment recently issued a
Management Directive (M.D.)-708 transmitting instructions for report-
ing the accomplishments of FY 1980 affirmative action programs and
for preparing affirmative action program plans for the last half of
FY 1981. A proposed management directive, M.D.-709, has also been
drafted, and the document, although not a multi-year, moves to a
longer period of planning. It covers the accomplishment reports for
FY 1981, the affirmative action program plans for FY 1982 and the
accomplishment report covering the same period. M.D.-709 has already
been cleared by SCIP and NARS. We expect to obtain the Commission's
approval next week.

        During the development of M.D.-709, an issue was raised concern-
ing our authority to handle the Disabled Veterans Program (Section 403
of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974)
together with the Handicapped Individuals Program (Section 501 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973). The President's Reorganization Plan
No. 1 of 1978 transferred to EEOC the responsibility for administering
                                      884

                                                      - 32 -

several affirmative action programs, but no mention was made of
Section 403 of the Veterans Assistance Act. Later, when Congress
amended this same Act, it did not substitute EEOC for the Civil
Service Commission as the agency with authority to handle the
program. However, there has been a generally implied understand-
ing of all the parties concerned that EEOC was to also handle
this program. The situation is complicated by the fact that the
Act requires each agency to include in its affirmative action plan
for the hiring, placement, and advancement of handicapped individuals
(Section 501), a separate specification of plans for the disabled
veterans. Once the issue was raised, the Office of Government
Employment met with OPM staff to discuss the problem while the legal
offices of both agencies developed opinions. OPM staff gave us to
understand that they wanted EEOC to continue with the program;
however, Mr. Devine publicly announced that OPM was going to take
charge of the program. Meanwhile, our proposed M.D.-709 has
instructions for the disabled veterans affirmative action program.
Within the last few days we have reached an agreement with OPM by
which EEOC will continue with this program during FY '82 but advising
agencies through our M.D.-709 that thereafter OPM will assume
responsibility for the program. We are currently developing modifi-
cations to M.D.-709 concerning this matter.

         The Office of Government Employment has been in general conducting
other activities such as the development of a staff guide for our
programs and a conference held during September in Dallas with our
Federal Affirmative Action Field Managers, several District Directors
and Headquarters personnel.

BUDGET

        Last, but by no stretch of the imagination least, is the critical
status of our current and future year budget. The fiscal health of
this Commission can be summarized in a few words, uncertain and
desperate. The changes in the federal budget with the resulting
changes in the Commission's budget point to a return of the
mid-seventies without any corresponding reduction in EEOC's
obligation to provide relief/services under its governing status
for Title VII, Age, Equal Pay, Federal Sector Complaints and the
State & Local Grants Program.

        I was scheduled to attend the meeting at OMB on September 22,
1981, to present and defend the Commission's 1983 budget request,
at a time when the base of fiscal year '82 funds have not yet been
postponed for a second time. I was informed that the meeting was
cancelled by OtlB principally because they (OMB) had not formally
presented to us their "new" reduced 1982 Budget for Congressional
approval.

        I have reason to believe, based on my staff discussion with
the OMB Examiner, that OMB plans to reduce EEOC's FY '82 budget by
17 million, from $140 million to approximately $123 million.
The reduction in positions has not been determined. However,
we cannot adequately support the existing staff and/or even the
authorized FY '82 staff years with a $123 million budget. I am pray-
ing and hoping that what appears to be the worst scenario ever will
not prevail and that someone in a position of authority will come to
our aid.

                       - 34 -

Unfortunately, I cannot announce to you or speculate as to

what our 1982 operating budgets will be until the Executive

and Congressional Branches have approved an interim or final

FY '82 budget for EEOC. However, as of now we have been told

that a minimum 12% will be formalized and presented to us. Thus, if

this severe reduction remains firm, it appears fairly evident that if

we are required to operate at the $123,542,000 level instead of the

$140,389,000 as planned, it will result in the immediate following

effect:

.Staff year (SY) will be reduced from 3,376 to 2,971

         a reduction of 405 staff years equalling positions;

.State & local grant funds will most likely be

         reduced from $19,000,000 to $16,720,000; and,

.A reduction in the Salary & Expense funds from

         $121,389,000 to $106,822,000.

We have just been notified that our employment targets for FY "82,

FY '83, and FY '84 are those set forth below, and under certain

circumstances may be even lower.

A reduction of the foregoing magnitude occurring right after

a recently completed agency-wide reduction-in-force of 287 positions

and an absorption of increases in operating support costs, would

seriously weaken the Commission's ability to meet its statutory

and programmatic responsibilities and commitments.

Of the previously approved level of $140 million, $96 million

would have been expended for personnel compensation, $18 million for

Fair Employment Practices Agency grants, $16 million for fixed

operational support expenses, and $10 million for critical program-

related expenses. Having reviewed a number of comprehensive

alternatives modifying this set" of assumptions, the Commission would

be left with limited flexibility. In the area of staff, for example,

our analysis reveals that the $6.8 million severance and unemploy-

ment compensation costs associated with a reduction-in-force

would minimize any net savings. Fair Employment Practice Agencies

program funds are earmarked and, therefore, cannot be used for other

purposes. Operational support costs such as space, telephone and

postage are controlled by the General Services Administration. Thus,

the Commission will be forced to absorb the bulk of its $17 million

reduction through sizable decreases in critical program-related costs

such as case processing, essential travel, litigation support and

data processing services.

The collective impact on operations will be: (1) an inability

to process the Title VII, Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA),

and Equal Pay Act (EPA) complaint inventories within a reasonable
                                     888

                                                      - 36 -

timeframe; (2) a dramatic reduction in the number of cases filed
for litigation; and (3) reduced efficiency in the critical staff
functions of policy direction, program guidance, coordination, and
monitoring and evaluation of the Commission's charge processing
and litigation programs.

         Our ma]or concern is that the Commission's inventory of
Title VII complaints will grow by 65 percent, from 37,000
complaints, or 8-1/2 months of workload, to 62,200 complaints,
or 12 months of workload during FY '82. Similarly, the Fair
Employment Practices Agency inventory will rise from 36,000 com-
plaints to 48,000 complaints. Moreover, without adequate resources,
the Commission will not be able to eliminate the pre-1979 Title
VII backlog by the end of 1983 as planned. In addition, ADEA
complaints will rise by over 50 percent to 10,000 complaints, or
a 13-month inventory by the end of FY '82; EPA complaints will rise
by 40-45 percent to 2700 complaints, or a 15-month inventory by the
end of FY '82.

          In the past, the Commission has been heavily criticized by
Congress and the private and public sectors for not eliminating
its Title VII backlog and thus, stretching out the charge pro*
cessing timeframes. To address this issue, the Commission has already
restructured its organization and has overhauled its charge process-
ing procedures. As a result, charges are now settled on the average
within 115 days. The negotiated settlements success rate is nearly
45 percent nationwide. Individual remedies amounted to over $59
million during the first nine months of FY '81.

                                                  - 37 -
        This rapid charge approach has been applauded and
supported by business and protected classes because swift
processing lessens the burden on employers and provides reasonable
remedies to charging parties. The system has worked so well that
other government agencies which have similar responsibilities have
adopted these procedures. In recognition of the development and
implementation of these workload management and processing systems
and procedures, OMB praised EEOC's overall managerial effectiveness
in its management publication. Further, in its January 1981
report, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) noted a high level
of employer satisfaction with the Commission's expedited charge
processing procedures. Seventy-three percent of the employers were
satisfied with the procedures used by the Commission to investigate
charges; 72 percent overall were satisfied with the way complaints
were resolved.
        While these dramatic improvements have benefited all of the
parties concerned, the Commission would be hard-pressed to effective-
ly deliver its essential services at the proposed reduced level.
Under these constraints, it will take the Commission a year to address
a" charge, as contrasted with the present six month figure. Every
analysis the Commission has conducted shows that without speedy
resolution, there is little likelihood of settlement. Moreover, the
Commission, under law, must investigate a case if it does not settle;
thus, delaying final resolution even further.

         Another concern is that the Commission may have to abolish
a large number of field offices across the country. Many are
located within major cities and, therefore, serve a large
segment of the American people. Such a cutback would further
hinder the Commission's ability to process charges in a timely
manner and will probably result in more independent court suits
being filed by charging parties. This workload will become an
additional burden to an already overloaded court docket thereby
shifting the costs from this agency to the courts which are not
prepared to accept this burden.

         With respect to the Commission's litigation program, additional
cuts will force the Commission to release legal staff and dramatically
reduce litigation support funds. From an original projected need
of $3.4 million to fund current cases pending in federal courts, and
a modest docket of new cases, the current projection would amount
to $2.2 million, or 1/3 less funds for litigation support and a
corresponding reduction in staff. Nearly 1/2 if these funds are needed
immediately to pay for pending litigation support contracts generated
by some of our largest and most complex cases. At the reduction
budget level, the number of cases the Commission could file would be
reduced by 40-45 percent from FY '81.

         Currently, EEOC has more than 800 cases in litigation. They
represent enforcement actions under Title VII, Age Discrimination in
Employment Act and Equal Pay Act. Approximately 1/3 of these cases
are class-action suits. The development of most of these cases will
                                     891

                                                          - 39 -

be seriously underfunded, affecting the relief for those who
are protected by these statutes.

         In conclusion, a budget reduced by the amount being
contemplated for EEOC would significantly impair the Commission's
charge processing and litigation programs and as such, would have
an adverse impact on the business community and on minorities
and women who have filed charges. Employers would have to retain
records and maintain active case files for a prolonged period of
time at great expense. Relief for those charging parties whose
charges have merit would be irreparably delayed and jeopardized.
The court system would become intolerably backlogged with cases
which would otherwise be settled at the administrative level. State
agencies would also be burdened with a huge backlog. If the case
and complaint processing system and enforcement mechanisms are
adversely affected, the ability to obtain voluntary compliance would
be seriously impaired.

         We at EEOC are prepared to assume our fair share of the
economic burden. However, anything that goes beyond a 5% reduction
will be too severe for us to sustain. In the family of agencies, EEOC
is a small unit of the republic. Its mission is to enforce the law
in cases where various forms of discrimination exist in the workplace.
The proposed reduction in the Commission's budget will send a signal
to the American people that EEOC will be unable to enforce the law
whenever the business community violates the prohibitions against
discrimination. We do not believe that this signal should be sent -
however unintentional.

                                  REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS
                     BY ACTING CHAIRMAN, DR. J. CLAY SMITH, JR.

                      EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION
                                           Washington, D.C.
                                           January 13, 1932

         As all of you are aware, I report to you not because it is
required by law or Commission procedure, but because I look upon
this agency as one big family in which you not only work for me and
the Commission, but I work for you, and the many beneficiaries of
the various laws and statutes which we are charged with enforcing.
Thus, if we are to achieve our assigned tasks in a meaningful
manner we must continue to work together as a unit in effectuating
the goals and true spirit and purpose of Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act the Rehabilitation Act, and Executive Order 12067.
The only way I can see this being done is through periodically
informing you as to the things I do and must do in order to pro-
vide the support you need to productively carry out your assign-
ments and responsibilities. When I or anyone else holding this
position cannot communicate with you in an open and above board
fashion as I .seek to do, you may have cause to worry. We may not
always agree on the procedure and techniques utilized, but we
should forever have a commonality of purpose. That commonality
of purpose is not only to uphold the laws of the United States but
it includes carrying out our official duties and the fair enforce-
ment of the established laws. Employers, public and private,
companies and unions mind you, expect no less. If we are to be
understood, we must speak clearly and not with forked tongue or
act with multi-conflicting goals or purposes.
                                     893

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 2

         One thing I learned early in life is that you cannot serve
two masters and expect to go to heaven. No matter what, you must
be true to yourself and whatever cause you serve. Most of you
through your unwavering dedication, proven loyalties and sustained
productivity reflect the high level professionalism that do me
great honor as I attempt in turn to represent yours and the
President's best interest in carrying forth with the mission of
this great agency.

         There is much on a positive note to report since you were
here last. 1 will briefly touch on some but not necessarily in
the chronological order of their importance.

         The first thing I want to say is that the Commission now has
three members, thanks to the President -- Cathie A. Shattuck, was
sworn in by me as a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission on December 21, 1981 after being given a recess appoint-
ment by President Ronald Reagan. He had made known on December 7th
his intention to nominate her for the term expiring July 1, 1985,
that had been previously held by Ethel Bent Walsh.

         Ms. Shattuck, who received a BA degree in 1967 and her J.D.
in 1970 from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, was in the
private practice of law in Boulder where she represented both
employees and employers in labor law and on other matters. She
had several years ago served as a trial attorney for the EEOC in
Denver.
                                     894

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 3

         Ms. Shattuck was also a special hearing officer for the
Colorado State Personnel Board. She was a lecturer and instructor
in employment and employee relations and taught Continuing Legal
Education in Colorado. She was formerly a legislative aide to the
speaker of the Nebraska Unicameral, and assistant law librarian at
the Nebraska University College of Law and a law clerk in the Office
of the Attorney General of the State of Nebraska. Ms. Shattuck is
a native of Salt Lake City, Utah.

         With the swearing in of Ms. Shattuck, the Commission
now has three members on board which terminated the delegation of
authority given to me on October 1, 1981. Thus, the Commission
on yesterday held its first meeting in 107 days at which time
we were able to get into policy issues, approved 30 cases
for litigation, and on motion of Commissioner Rodriguez they
adopted the attached resolution crediting me with certain achieve-
ments during the 81 days the EEOC was without a quorum. Whatever
accomplishments were made during these critical days at EEOC, you
are equally responsible for any of my accomplishments.

         On November 2, 1981, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed
the nomination of Michael J. Connolly, a former corporate labor
counsel with General Motors Corporation in Detroit, to become
general counsel of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
(EEOC). Connolly was nominated for the four-year term position
                                     895

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 4

by President Ronald Reagan on July 7, 1981.
         At his confirmation hearing, Connolly promised committee

members that, if confirmed, he would "continue the momentum that
has been built by previous general counsels," and that "no stone
will be left unturned in the battle to eradicate employment dis-
crimination. "

         Connolly, is the seventh and, at 32, the youngest General
Counsel ever to serve the Commission.

         Now turning our heads to the programmatic side of the agency:

COMPLIANCE ACTIVITY

         Charge processing figures for Fiscal Year 1981 show a con-
tinued climb in the area of production and benefits. In 1981, the
Commission field offices resolved 71,690 cases. This represents a
25% increase over last years's figure of 57,327. The ratio of
charges resolved to charges taken is 134%.

         Just looking at Title VII alone, the Commission took in 42,372
charges and resolved almost 62,000 charges. Frontend inventory is
now down to about 20,000 charges. More importantly, Commission
processes continue to provide substantial relief. Despite the
extraordinary number of resolutions, the Title VII rapid charge
settlement rate is nolding at 43%. The settlement rate for Age
Discrimination charges has risen to 25%. These figures far exceed
benefits obtained through the compliance process in any prior year.
                                     896

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 5

         while our Age and Pay programs are on the upswing, we still
have a few problems in some offices. Specifically, these offices
have been slow to integrate Age and Equal Pay into our management
apparatus. This must be corrected immediately and the Director
of Field Services will be working with you on this problem.

         On October 31, 1981, in 46 FR 50366, the Commission published
notice of final rulemaking of its revisions to procedural regula-
tions by the addition of §§1601.75, 1601.77, 1601.78, 1601.79 and
1601.80 to 29 CFR Part 1601. These sections set for"th procedures
whereby the Commission and certain State and local fair employment
practices agencies (706 agencies) are relieved of the present
Commission individual, case-by-case review of cases processed by
these agencies under contract with the Commission, as provided in
Section 709(b) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as
amended. These sections set forth the procedures by which the
Commission may certify certain 706 State and local agencies which
meet prescribed criteria. These regulations became final last
year and 48 agencies have now been certified.

         With respect to ADEA charges jurisdictional under state law,
on nay 26, 1981, the Commission adopted standards for the process-
ing and funding of charges by FEP agencies filed under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act and under comparable state laws.
The procedures call for dual filing and worksharing, much like
                                      897

REPORT TO THE FIELD DIRECTORS - 6

our Title VII procedures. State agencies are funded on the basis
of charges produced. Contracts were approved for fiscal 1981
committing the state agencies to 2,235 resolutions.

LITIGATION ACTIVITY
         The following summary provides comparision statistics of our

direct litigation activities excluding systemic and the monetary
benefits obtained through its enforcement program for fiscal years
 (FY) 1980 and 1981.

          For the purpose of this report, areas of comparison include:
litigation recommendations, approvals by the Commission, number
of cases filed, settlements and monetary benefits.

          During FY 81, the Commission's district offices recommended
469 litigation actions to the Office of General Counsel. This
represents a 19 percent increase in the numoer of recommended
cases over the prior year's statistic of 393.

          Of the toal number of recommended actions, the Commission
^approved 364 cases. This was a 13 percent increase over the prior
year of 322 cases. The most significant percent change occurred
under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, with an 89 percent
increase in the number of recommended suits and a 68 percent in-
crease in the number of approvals. More Age Act cases were filed
in FY 81 than in any previous 12-miM.li p u i u d of federally initiated
litigation under the Act.

from almost $21 million in FY 80 to slightly more than $16 million

difference is because of substantial FY 80 recovery in the

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 10

OFFICE OF SYSTEMIC PROGRAMS
         During the first quarter of FY 82, OSP continued its progress

in processing Commissioner charges. Two more decisions were cir-
culated to the Commissioners, a number of pre-decision settlements
initiated and several cases moved into the conciliation process.
To assist in this process, guidance on conciliation matters has
been finally prepared for distribution.

         Two major charge settlements were accomplished during the
quarter. One settlement was achieved by the Headquarters unit on
a backlogged multi-facility charge. The settlement provides goals,
back pay and preferential 30b offers at three large manufacturing
facilities. OSP's second field PDS resulted in affirmative relief
plus approximately $250,000 in back pay.

         The technical Services Division continued its revision of the
targetting selection model and prepared its position paper on
Determination of Underutilization. Technical Services Division
continued to provide assistance in a number of cases, and provided
expert witness testimony both in Jurgens v. EEOC and in the Denver
District Office's successful trial in EEOC v. Trailways. TSD staff
were also extremely active in developing position papers in sup-
port of EEOC's position on Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selec-
tion Procedure.

          In the area of litigation OSP concluded negotiation of settle-
ments in two major cases. On December 22, 1981, the Commission
and private plaintiffs obtained preliminary approval of a settle-
ment with the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company. The
                                     902

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 11

settlement, which resolves two private lawsuits in which the
EEOC intervened as well as a nation-wide Commissioner Charge, pro-
vides for payment of $3.5 million in back pay and other relief
valued at several million dollars; it will benefit in excess of
25,000 minority and female employees and rejected applicants
nationwide.

Other aspects of the settlement include:
         1. the establishment of goals for minorities and women
                 in professional positions and for minorities in clerical
                 positions;
         2. development of a ;job posting system for professional and
                 clerical positions;
         3. development of a career counseling program;
         4. development of a supervisory training program including
                 EEO counseling;
         5. development of a new performance appraisal system; and
         6. implementation of a compliance monitoring system includ-
                 ing annual review by the Special Master.

The second major resolution involved the Commission's charge and
a private lawsuit against Dean, Witter, Reynolds, Inc.

         On December 17, 1981, the EEOC reached agreement in principle
on all substantive issues with Dean, Witter, Reynolds, Inc. The
agreement was memorialized in a Memorandum of Understanding signed
that date, a courtesy copy of which was submitted to the Court
on December 22, 1981. The agreement provides for back pay of
                                     903

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 12

$1.8 million to be distributed to female, Black and Hispanic appli-
cants and present and former employees in sales, professional or
managerial positions between January 1, 1976 and December 31, 1981.
As the fund was transferred to an interest bearing escrow account on
December 18, 1981, the amount actually available for distribution will
most likely be in excess of §2 million.

         The agreement also sets forth specific five year hiring goals
for females, Blacks and Hispanics in the Account Executive position,
which accounts for one-third of Dean Witter's approximately 10,000
person workforce. Additionally, the ultimate goal to be achieved
before the expiration of the decree were set for most of the appro-
ximately 900 other positions at Dean Witter.

         In addition to the funds transferred for back pay, Dean Witter
has committed to expend at least §2.88 million for the implementa-
tion of other affirmative action efforts, including:

         1. Advertising and recruitment directed at females, blacks
                 and Hispanics;

          2. Establishment of a Vice President level EEO official;
          3. EEO training for all managers and supervisors, as well

                 as any other employee who is involved in the selection/
                 promotion process;
          4. Implementation of an employees' skills inventory, designed
                 to identify females, blacks, and Hispanics with promotion
                 potential;
         5. Implementation of a method to evaluate supervisors' and
                 managers' contribution to EEO efforts;
                                     904

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 13

         6. Implementation of a 30b evaluation and salary wage
                 program to ensure uniform requirements and salary
                 structure throughout the company's 250 branch offices;

         7. Implementation of posting job vacancies throughout the
                 company and establishment of mechanism for employees to
                 apply for promotions;

         8. Establishment and implementation of policy that persons
                 discharging female, black or Hispanic Account Executives
                 will have to set forth the reason for such discharge in
                 writing.

OFFICE OF POLICY IMPLEMENTATION

         Executive Order 12291 requires that each Federal executive
agency publish in April and October of each year a semi-annual
agenda of proposed regulations that the agency has issued or
expects to issue, and current effective rules that are under
agency review pursuant to the Executive Order.

         Under Executive Order 12291, all notices of proposed and
final rulemaking, interpretive guidelines, and general statements
of policy must be cleared by the Office of Management and Budget
prior to publication. OPI has been assigned the responsibility
of obtaining OMB clearances under Executive Order 12291. During
1981, OPI submitted eight such documents for clearance to OMB,
all of which were cleared by OMB for publication in the Federal
Register.

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 14

         As I mentioned before, in August of 1981 the Vice President's
Task Force on Regulatory Relief announced a list of government
regulations that would be subjected to review under Executive
Order 12291. This list contained two of the Commission's guide-
lines, namely, the Guidelines on Sexual Harassment and the Uniform
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. As to the Uniform
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, the alleged burden-
someness and the utility of the recordkeeping requirements are the
subject of review. The Task Force requested that we submit work-
plans for the review of these guidelines by September 15, 1981.
After meeting with the Task Force representatives and under my
direction, our proposed workplans were delivered to the Task Force
on September 9, 1981.

         As a part of the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection
Procedures review process, OPI has prepared six different survey
questionnaires which are planned to be sent to employers, unions,
att

     orneys, psychologists and public interest groups. These ques-
tionnaires have recently been submitted to the Vice President's
Task Force on Regulatory Relief, the Office of Management and
Budget, the Government Accounting Office, the Census Bureau and
the Federal agencies who co-signed the Uniform Guidelines. Final
approval of the survey questionnaires is expected in early 1982.
After final approval is obta.ned. OPI will send the survey
questionnaires to approximately 4,000 survey respondents. Also,
as a part of this review, the Office of Interagency Coordination
is conducting a survey of all Federal EEO Regulations to determine
                                      906

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 15

the feasibility of initiating uniform EEO recordkeeping require-
ment throughout tne Federal government. If it were feasible,
the adoption of such uniform requirements would further alleviate
burdens on employers and otners.

         The task force of the Vice President identified the Sexual
Harassment Guidelines because of public comments criticizing them
for failing to provide adequate guidance to employers on such
questions as to what constitutes unwelcomed sexual advances or
prohibited verbal sexual conduct under the Guidelines, implement-
ing Title VII. with respect to our review of the Sexual
Harassment Guidelines, OPI has prepared a proposed Federal Register
notice inviting comments on the Guidelines. In October 1981,
informal mteragency coordination under E.O. 12067 was completed
on the proposed notice. Because of the lack of a Commission quorum
in the latter part of 1981, the notice has not yet been approved
by the Commission for publication in the Federal Register.

         As noted in my earlier report to you, on September 1, 1981,
in 46 FR 43848, the Commission published its proposed interpre-
tations with respect to the enforcement of the Equal Pay Act.
These interpretations would replace those issued by the Department
of Labor at 29 CFR Part 800. Comments on the proposed regulations
were to be received by November 2, 1981. The Office of Policy
Implementation and the General Counsel's Office are reviewing
the public comments for the purposes of finalizing these inter-
pretations.
                                     907

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 16

         On July 1, 1979, pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 1 of
1978, 43 FR 19807 (May 9, 1978) the Commission assumed enforce-
ment of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as
amended, 29 U.S.C. 621, 623, 625, 626-633 and 634 (ADEA). Prior
to the assumption of jurisdiction, the Commission commenced an
m-depth review of all existing interpretations of the ADEA
which were promulgated by the Department of Labor. See 44 FR
37974 (June 29, 1979). On November 30, 1979, the Commission
published in the Federal Register its proposed interpretations
of the ADEA. See 44 FR 68858 (November 30, 1979). On September
29, 1980 in 45 FR 64212, the Commission rescinded its earlier
proposed interpretation. In August of 1981 the Commission
approved the interpretation originally proposed in November of
1979 which will rescind the interpretations issued by the
Department of Labor. Final interpretations were published
in the Federal Register on September 29, 1981, (46 FR 47724).

         The transcript of the oral testimony and written testimony
submitted at the Commission's hearings on job segregation and
wage discrimination held in Washington, D.C., in April of 1980,
and tne interim report of the National Academy of Sciences entitled
"Job Evaluation: An Analytic Review," have been placed on micro-
fiche and microfilm. These materials are available in the
Commission library for public reading and Commission use. Copies
of the microfiche and microfilm have also been distributed to
all Commission District and Area Offices.
                                     908

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 17

         In further review of this issue, the Commission prepared an
interpretative memorandum, issued in the form of a ninety-day notice,
specifically addressing the recent Supreme Court decision in County
of Washington v. Gunther, 101 S. Ct. 2242 (1981). This notice,
N915, dated September 30, 1981, which has been continued in effect,
provides interim guidance in processing Title VII and Equal Pay
Act claims of sex-based wage discrimination, including those rais-
ing the issue of comparable worth.

         In October 1981, I testified before the House Subcommittee on
Employment Opportunities, the Committee on Education and Labor.
Under my direction, OPI prepared an extensive report on the subject
of affirmative action which was submitted by me to the Subcommittee.
The report deals with and clarifies certain misconceptions that
surround tnis issue, and also offers some estimates of costs and bene-
fits relating to affirmative action.

         Since July 1965, the Commission has issued almost 10,000
Commission Decisions under Title VII (outside the decisions issued
by the Office of Review and Appeals in the federal sector). Other
than a few hundered of these Decisions that have been published in
the commercial publications, most of these Decisions have been
inaccessible to both the public and the Commission staff. OPI
undertook the mammoth task of collecting, verifying and chronologi-
cally arranging all these Decisions. In early 1981, all Commission
Decisions through fiscal year 1979 had been placed on microfiche.
However, because these Decisions have not been indexed by subject
matter as yet, OPI proposed that these Decisions be placed on
                                     909

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 18

a computerized data base which would enable the Commission to have
efficient access to this large volume of materials. I placed a
very high priority on this project. Therefore, I approved the
proposal to load approximately 10,000 Commission decisions into
the JURIS computerized data base, to produce a decisional index,
and sanitize these decisions. Over a quarter of these materials
have been delivered to the contractor for this purpose. Copies
of the JURIS-produced decisional index, when completed, will be
distributed to each District and Area Office to enable it to have
access to all Commission decisions. When the system is fully
operational, the Commission will have direct access to the JURIS
data base via a terminal located in OPI. This will enable the
Commission and OPI to respond promptly to Freedom of Information
Act and otner such requests for Commission decisions. The exis-
tence of these materials in the JURIS data base will also enable
the Commission staff to do sophisticated research in Commission
decision precedents in evolving areas of the law.

         The Office of Policy Implementation issued 29 decisions during
FY 81. Some of these decisions reiterated prior EEOC policy; how-
ever, most of them set forth new policies in such areas as seniority,
sexual harassment, affirmative action, religious accommodation,
tenure, and speak English-only rules. Further, OPI returned to
field offices 652 charges which originally had been called into
headquarters for a review of non-CDP issues. OPI received 487
charges containing non-CDP issues in FY 81, more than one-half
of which involved the issue of sexual harassment.
                                  910

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 19

         The Office of Policy Implementation began a project to com-
puterize all of the charges it receives. This project should be
completed in the second quarter of FY 82 and will allow OPI to give
the field offices status reports on the charges they have pending
in that office.

         As you know, the Commission's success in investigating and
resolving charges of discrimination depends in large part on the
effectiveness of the EEOC Compliance Manual in providing up-to-
date guidance on charge processing and on Commission policy. As
presently published/ Volume 1 (procedural) and Volume II (inter-
pretative) of the Compliance Manual deal only with Title VII
matters, however, both Volumes are being revised not only to
update Title VII material but, also importantly, to include guidance
on the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA) and the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967, as amended (ADEA).

         The Office of Policy Implementation is currently drafting,
reviewing, and/or editing amendments to the existing Title VII
part of Volume I on an as-needed basis. It is also reviewing,
editing, and finalizing proposed EPA and ADEA sections for Volume I.
Of these, the Commission has already approved revised $15 on Title
VII, SS101 through 184 on EPA, and iS201 through 284 on ADEA.

          In addition, OPI is preparing a completely revised Volume II
which will cover all three statutes. Sections dealing with Title
VII which have been approved by the Commission include: 5601,
Introduction; >bO3, Identifying and Processing Charges Which
Raise Issues Not Covered by a Commission Decision Precedent;
                                     911

5S604, Tneories of Discrimination; 91607, Affirmative Action; $615,
harassment; >619, Grooming Standards; and $622, Citizenship,
Residency Requirements, Aliens, and Undocumented Workers.

OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT
         During my earlier report it was noted that in January 1981,

EEOC issued advance instructions to all Federal agencies for the
implementation of the Multi-Year Affirmative Action Plans through
our Management Directive (tl.D. 707). This plan covers the period
from FY 82 to FY 86. Some problems arose with respect to the
issuance of M.D. 707 but after several meetings with National
Achieves Record Services and OPM personnel, the matter was
temporarily resolved and clearance for our M.D. 707, as amended
by the June 15 Memorandum was finally granted. On August 12, 1981,
I once again wrote to all Federal agencies requesting them to com-
plete their planning at the first possible moment to meet the opera-
tive date of October 1, 1981.

         Another activity of our Office of Government Employment
was the issuance of our Management Directive (M.D. 710) with
Federal Affirmative Action (FAA) instructions to Federal agencies
on their affirmative action accomplishment report for minorities
and women for FY '81. These will be the last instructions con-
cerning the two years' transition period which allowed agencies
to "learn" the new planning process, as we moved away from the
annual planning concept to the multi-year approach (M.D. 707).
Handicapped Week, thus in this, the International Year of Disabled
                                     912

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 21

Persons, we took the opportunity to reflect on problems of
the handicapped in all spheres of the republic.

         The Department of Labor reports that there are 7.2 million
severely disabled persons of working age, or about 6% of the
national work force.

         OPM's Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) indicates that in 1978
only 0.76% of the total Federal non-postal work force were
severely disabled persons. There is gross under-representation of
severely disabled persons throughout the Federal government, in
all occupations and at all levels.

         The Office of Government Employment has also issued
Management Directives (M.D. 708 and 709) dealing with the handi-
capped. The former transmitted instructions for reporting the
accomplishments of FY 80 affirmative action programs and for the
program plans for the last half of FY 81.

         The latter, although not a multi-year plan, moves to a longer
period of planning. It covers the accomplishment reports for
FY 81, the affirmative action program plans for FY 82 and the
accomplishment report covering the same period.

         During the development of M.D. 709, an issue was raised con-
cerning our authority to handle the Disabled Veterans Program
(Section 403 of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance
Act of 1974) together with the Handicapped Individuals Program
(Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973). The President's
Reorganization Plan. No. 1 of 1978 transferred to EEOC the
                                     913

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 22

 responsibility for administering several affirmative action pro-
 grams, but no mention was made of Section 403 of the Veterans
 Assistance Act. Later, when Congress amended this same Act,
 it did not substitute EEOC for the Civil Service Commission as the
 agency with authority to handle the program. However, there has
 been a generally implied understanding of all the parties con-
 cerned that EEOC was to also handle this program. The situation
 was complicated by the fact that the Act requires each agency to
 include in its affirmative action plan for the hiring, placement,
 and advancement of handicapped individuals (Section 5 0 1 ) , a separate
 specification of plans for the disabled veterans. Once the issue
 was raised, the Office of Government Employment met with OPM staff
 to discuss the problem while the legal offices of both agencies
 developed opinions. OPM statf gave us to understand that they
 wanted EEOC to continue with the program; however, the Director
 of OPfl announced that OPM was going to take charge of the program.
 Meanwhile, our proposed M.D. 709 contains instructions for the
'disabled veterans affirmative action program. We finally reached
 an agreement with OPM by which EEOC will continue with this
 program during FY '82 but advising agencies through our M.D. 709
 that thereafter OPM will assume responsibility for the program.

          The Office of Gove ^laaatJfliployment has been conducting other
 activities such as the development of a staff, a system for the
 review of agency plans, Headquarters-Field coordination, desk-
 officer responsibilities for our programs, and a consultation in
                                     914

KEPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 23

September in Dallas with our Federal Affirmative Action Field
tlanagers, the District Directors of the ten Federal Regions and
Headquarters personnel. In the fourth quarter, we initiated on-
site program reviews for the 501 (handicapped) effort. This
will be expanded in 1982 to cover the sex and minority program.

OFFICE OF INTERAGENCY COORDINATION

         The Commission's coordination role, under Section 715 of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12067, has been
extremely active during 1981.

         In the crucial area of review of agency regulatory issuances,
tne Commission met and was able to issue a timely response both
to OFCCP"s Advance Notice and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking deal-
ing with the affirmative action regulations for Federal contractors.
I strongly endorsed the need for regulatory reform and paperwork
reduction, and expressed a desire to negotiate a few of the sub-
stantive changes proposed by OFCCP. OFCCP expects to coordinate
its preliminary proposals on the subject with the Commission in
late January.

         In July 1981, the Commission agreed with a significant stip-
ulation to OFCCP's proposed withdrawal of its broad regulation
dealing with payment by contractors of membership fees to private
clubs which discriminate in their membership policies. The
Commission recommended that OFCCP amend its withdrawal statement
to include a commitment to investigate instances in which pay-
ment of club dues results in illegal discrimination. OFCCP
                                    915

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 24

has yet to submit to the Commission a proposed final decision
on this issue. While the Commission has successfully negotiated
a joint equal employment opportunity poster with OFCCP and DOJ
it has been unable to move forward with the implementation of the
EEOC/OFCCP Memorandum of Understanding because of OFCCP's heavy
program of regulatory reform. I recently wrote to the Secretary
of Labor urging him to accelerate his agencies progress in
designing procedures to fulfill the promise of the Memorandum
of Understanding.

         Regulatory proposals also were received from a large number
of other agencies, including the Department of Education, the
Office of Revenue Sharing, the General Services Administration,
the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Office of Management
and Budget. Several issuances were submitted by the Office of
Personnel Management, the most consequential of w m c h was a
complete revision of its regulations governing the operation
of state merit system programs. In addition, I have written
to the Secretary of Health & Human Services concerning the
failure of that agency to include appropriate equal employment
provisions in the proposed regulations it published to govern
its new block grant programs. In order to further cooperate
among agencies in the design of equal employment regulatory
policy, the Commission will issue a quarterly bulletin of agency
issuances under development.
                                    916

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 25

         As a result of a dialogue I initiated with OMB, an agree-
ment was reacned in August which strengthens the effectiveness
of Executive Order 12067 by requiring that EEOC complete its
analysis of agency Notices of Proposed Rulemaking, final rules
and information collection instruments under Executive Order
12067 prior to their submittal to OMB for review under Executive
Order 12291 and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Shortly thereafter,
I sent a memorandum outlining the new procedures to the heads
of all federal agencies. The Commission is now prepared to
publish final changes to its coordination regulations to con-
form them to the provisions of the agreement. The Commission
worked closely with the Office of Management and Budget on two
other matters. It has reviewed the relevant portions of
agency budget estimates and supporting data to ensure that
they are complete and appear factual, and is in the process of
conducting a detailed assessment of the estimates and data pro-
vided by three major cabinet departments. In conjunction with
OMB, the Commission has investigated charges of duplication of
compliance activity by EEOC, the Office of Revenue Sharing and
the Department of Housing and Urgan Development. As a result
of this analysis, HUD is revising its data collection instruments.

         Important activities now underway include a study of methods
for improving the relationship between state human right agencies
and Federal equal employment activities. In addition, an options
paper outlining various approaches to the need for training of
Federal equal employment officials was circulated to the agencies
                                     917

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 26

for comment. Commission staff also are reviewing the possibility
of revising the equal employment provisions of the regulations
dealing with treatment of the handicapped. This analysis is
being conducted in conjunction with the Department of Justice's
revision of the government wide regulations prohibiting discri-
mination against the handicapped in the provision of Federal
and federally financed services.

BUDGET
         When you were here before we were confronted with the gloomy

prospect of having to operate with the agency on a substantially
reduced budget of $123,542,000 which would have caused major
RIF's and furloughs, and devastating program overhaul. How
things are much better and I am indeed moderately optimistic.
The changes in the federal budget with the resulting changes in
the Commission's budget emphasize the need for planning,
estaDlishing options and alternatives within our priorities
and a total awareness of cost vs charge resolution for Title
VII, Age, Equal Pay, Federal Sector Complaints and the State
and Local Grants Program.

         During the 1st quarter of FY 82, I attended several meetings
at OMB to present and defend the Commission's 1982 and 1983 bud-
get requests. As a result of these meetings, I have reason to
be optimistic and to a large extent pleased, although not com-
pletely satisfied with the end results.
                                918

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 27

I have discussed these concerns with you before and at this
time I am awaiting the President's pronouncement in his budget
to the U.S. Congress sometime this month or in February.

OFFICE OF REVIEW AND APPEALS
         Fiscal 1981 was the second full year of operations for

the Office of Review and Appeals. The principal activity during
FY 81 was to process as many cases as possible within the
severe professional and clerical constraints of the hiring
freeze. The office continued to apply private sector precedent
to federal sector decisions towards the end of FY 81 the
Commission was planning to add ORA decisions to the JURIS system
and to begin a compliance program. Our budgetary posture,
however, may temporarily affect resources for those two areas.

Appeals pending on 9/30/80           1907
Appeals docketed during FY 81        3175
Decisions written during FY 81       2611
Appeals fending on 8/30/81           2471

OFFICE OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
         Our responsiblity to uphold the principles of equal employ-

ment opportunity and to aggressively enforce the anti-discrimina-
tion jurisdictions with which we are charged must begin at home.
We cannot expect the employer community to hold stock in the
Commission's activities if our own employees are left wanting
or their rights not fully protected.
                                     919

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 28

         In our agency that task is particularly exacting since most
of our professional employees could be considered experts in
the jurisdictions which we enforce. A difficult task indeed,
yet one which, as the lead civil rights enforcement agency, we
must meet and lead the way for all employers.

         In Fiscal year 1981 the Office of EEO complaints of dis-
crimination for processing increased. That fact, coupled with
an ever shrinking EEO staff, has led that office to seek al-
ternative methods in processing its caseload. In close consul-
tation with various headquarters offices, the District Directors
EEO Subcommittee and the union, the Office of EEO has developed
a pilot program for processing complaints using rapid charge
processing techniques. The cornerstone of the pilot program will
be a more intensified effort to settle or resolve complaints at
the earliest possible stage. Once underway, the pilot will be
tested on a trial basis in a limited number of offices. If
successful, this program could have a far reaching impact
throughout the Federal community.

         Recently, that office has issued an Agency Directive on
the prevention and elimination of sexual harassment in the
workplace. Although less than 3% of all complaints filed with
the Office of EEO in FY 81 alleged sexual harassment, it is
nonetheless a subject which we as managers must be fully pre-
pared to deal with should the need arise.
                                     920

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 29

         It should be notefl that in several more days we will mark
the anniversary of the late Dr. Martin Luther King's birth,
January 15, 1929, with appropriate observances. Also, next
month the Federal community will commemorate National Black
History Month. You will be receiving appropriate materials
shortly to assist you in planning meaningful observances.

         Finally, the Office of EEO has recently issued instructions
to all field and headquarters offices for the development and
implementation of the agency's multi-year affirmative action
plan which will cover a period from FY 81 thru FY 86. I think
we all realize that, given our present fiscal posture and
staff limitations, new hiring will be extremely limited during
this period. However, affirmative action planning during such
times can present an ideal opportunity for utilizing existing
staff through job enrichment programs, development of bridge
positions, implementing the Commission's upward mobility pro-
gram and taking full advantage of the part-time employment program.

OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS
         This office has been one of the busiest in the agency since

September, we have issued 10 publications and several news
releases. On January 28th and 29th, the Office of Public Affairs
is coordinating a sympoisum for the elderly in Los Angeles at tne
Convention Center. We expect an attendance of 1500. In addi-
tion the 15th Annual Report is at the press, the 16th Annual
Report is being prepared for the first draft. This is signi-
                          921

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 30

ficant when you take in the fact that since May 1981 four
annual reports have been issued and with the production of the
16th Annual Report EEOC will be current in its annual reports
to Congress. The Office of Public Affairs during.this three
month period has produced five training films in addition to
EEOC Highlights which have been distributed to various offices.
I am glad to report that we are current on our in-house publi-
cation MISSION, the staff is currently working on the next
edition to be published on March 1st. The Office of Public
Affairs is responding to mail inquiries within a five day time
frame work while in May there was a 2,000 backlog in the response
to mail inquiries.

LITTLE KNOWN OR RECOGNI2ED FACTS
         The Commission has one of the largest contituancy groups

of any agency in government. Specific data derived from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics publication "Employment and Earnings,

        Based on the above, the total civilian labor force averaged
almost 105 million during 1980. Women, minorities and persons
age 40 to 69 represented more than 74 million of this total. In
particular, there were approximately 45 million women, 18 million
minorities, and 40 million workers age 40 to 69 in the nation's
civilian labor force in 1980.

        A conservative estimate suggests approximately 70% of the
total CLF is employed at employers, both public and private,
covered by Title VII. This factor could therefore be applied
to the above figures to obtain estimates of employment at Title

         Unfortunately, recent generalized references to the
Commission by political, civil rights and business community
voices tend to suggest that critics only view us in a white male
vs black male context. However, it is clear that statistics support
our position that under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act the
Rehabilitation Act, and Executive Order 12067 we touch on the
lives of 100,000,000 voting Americans.

A MATTER OR PRIORITY
         One of the top priorities of this Commission for FY 82 and

FY 83 has to be improvement in our financial management. Early
in m* tenure as Acting Chairman, I began to suspect that the
agency nad serious problems in financial management and pro-
curement activities. These suspicions were verified by both
reviews and audits by our internal audit staff and by GAO
staff which had been requested to review our financial and
accounting operations. The Acting Executive Director, Us. Issie
Jenkins and I have spent an unusual amount of management time
in the financial and budget area. There is no doubt that this
agency has problems, and all of us have contributed to them by
not following proper procedures and paying enough attention to
the administration of this responsibility in each of our offices.
These problems cannot and must not continue, toe are being looked
                                     925

at by oversight committees, by GAO, and others, and will con-
tinue to be looked at until we have corrected our deficiencies.

         The Acting Executive Director has set in motion a number
of corrective actions and controls to correct our problems.
She has my full support. No longer can we tolerate failure to
follow prescribed procurement procedures, failure to properly
document expenditures of funds, failure to timely initiate pay-
ments for vendors, failure to promptly cuff expenditures, and
failure to timely reconcile records. Nor will we tolerate
failure by headquarters operations to provide timely feedback
to office directors on errors and inadequate documentation. We
will provide as much guidance as possible, and training to help
you and your office meet these demands; we will also, however,
take appropriate disciplinary action where procedures are not
followed, or where they are circumvented. Office Directors
are directly responsible for supervision of staff carrying out
these responsibilities, and Office Directors will be held per-
sonally accountable. It can be no other way. As we attempt to
make our financial management and accountability sound, I will
count on your cooperation. You and your staff have shown what
you can do in the compliance and litigation area. It is time
to show our efficiency in the financial management area.

CONCLUSION
          In conclusion, I wish to thank the District Directors and

the Regional Attorneys for your continued support and the dedica-
tion you continue to give to EEOC. Political appointees such as
                                     926

REPORT TO FIELD DIRECTORS - 34

me come -- hopefully to do their job without selling out for
fame or gain -- and then we leave the government to the profes-
sional managers, such as yourselves. You, the professionals of
government remain. You are the government, regardless of your
political persuasion. You are the best friends that the public
have -- regardless of what people or politicians say about you.
You keep the light of freedom burning so that the people can
elect the leadership of a freedom loving society. On behalf of
the Administration, I want to thank you for the job that you are
doing.

         I am but a person like you. But, I respect each one of
you for your dedication to principle and your loyalty to the
mission of EEOC. If you ever lose your commitment to EEOC,
I trust that you will have the courage to leave the agency
rather than to sell out at the expense of millions of restless
hearts and wounded souls for whom the people, through the
Congress enacted, Title VII, and allied statutes.

         Finally, I want to thank Conunissioner Armando Rodriguez for
his counsel and support. He is a man of integrity and depend-
ibility. Commissioner Rodriguez must be given as much credit as
anyone for his cooperation during the period that EEOC was quorum-
less. His daily inquiries and his wit have been exceedingly
important to me.

                                                               J. Clay Smith, Jr.

                                                  COMMISSION RESOLUTION

 From October 1, 1981, to December 21, 1981, the Equal Employment Opportunity
 Commission was without a quorum, as set forth in the statute, and it became
#the responsibility, under a delegation of authority granted September 25, 1981,
 of Acting Chairman J. Clay Smith, Jr., in consultation with Commissioner Armando
 M. Rodriguez, to act upon those matters which would normally have been acted upon
 by the Commission as a collegial body. To the credit of Acting Chairman Smith,
 during this period of absence of a quorum, the first time in the Commission's
 history, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission continued to operate
 smoothly and carry out its compliance and enforcement responsibilities under
 Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Equal Pay Act, the Age Discrimi-
 nation in Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and Executive Order 12067.

 Notable among the accomplishments of the Acting Chairman during this period are:

                 (1) The successful closure of Fiscal Year 1981 in which
                        Commission productivity was at an all-time high.
                        Benefits to charging parties were increased, service
                         to charging parties, employers, and other entities
                        was improved by reducing the time for processing
                        complaints: all of which furthered the public interest
                        in eliminating employment discrimination.

                        Specific accomplishments for Fiscal Year 1981 included
                        the securing of relief for 38,000 persons: a 60%
                        increase in benefits obtained over the previous year:
                        a 25% increase in closure of charges, from 57,000 to
                         72,000 charges closed: a 4% increase in charge
                        receipts from Fiscal Year 1980, up from 56,000 to
                        59,000 charges, filing of 368 cases in federal court,
                        up from 326 in Fiscal Year 1980; and a 23% increase
                        in litigation settlements.

                 (2) The successful defense of the Commission's budget request
                        for Fiscal Year 1982. Through his untiring and relentless
                        efforts at OMB, the White House, and before Congressional
                        Committees, he effectively and repeatedly presented the
                        Commission's need for both budget and staff to adequately
                        carry out its mandate to eliminate employment discrimination.
                        As a direct result of his personal involvement and direction
                        of the preparation of numerous written justification docu-
                        ments, the Commission's budgetary mark was increased from
                        an original OMB mark of $123,000,000 and 3000 staff years,
                        to $140,000,000 and 3376 staff years, alleviating the
                        present need for severe reductions in force and enforcement
                        program cuts.

                        In addition, at his direction, cost reductions in admin-
                        istrative and support costs have been mandated in an effort
                        to save resources for program operations and to save staff
                        necessary to carry out those programs.
                                        928

(3) The effective representation of the Commission's views on
        policy matters before Congressional Oversight Committees
        and in interagency coordination matters. On October 1,
        1981, Acting Chairman Smith submitted a written statement
        to the Subcommittee on Civil Service of the House Committee
        on Post Ofice and Civil Service, providing the Commission's
        views on Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Sector:
        and on October 7, 1981, the Acting Chairman testified before
        the Subcommittee on Employment Opportunities of the House
        Committee on Education and Labor, on Commission Policy with
        respect to Affirmative Action.

During this period he has also forcefully presented the
Commission's position in issues raised by the Office of
Federal Contract Compliance Program's proposed Regulations
and on issues regarding sexual harassment and the Uniform
Selection Procedures Guidelines.

(A) The careful and close attention to Commission financial
        operations to address deficiencies identified by requested
        audits and reviews. As a result, closer supervision,
        accountability, and necessary staff training are being
        implemented.

(5) The expeditious consideration of those matters involving
        statutory deadlines, or involving time frames the lapse of
        which could have been viewed as unreasonable should the
        Commission have failed to act. As a result of his swift
        and prudent actions, he therefore, preserved the rights of
        charging parties and complainants, and lessened the build-up
        of potential monetary liability of employers.

For the efforts and actions described herein, and for all of the activities
necessary to keep the Commission not only operational, but effectively carrying
out its mandate, be it resolved that Acting Chairman J. Clay Smith, Jr., be
commended for his unprecedented effort on behalf of equal employment opportunity.

Be it also resolved that his fellow Commissioners and staff of the agency are
appreciative of the selfless manner in which he has conducted the affairs of
the agency during a period of uncertainty regarding resources and leadership:
seeking always to bring assurances of stability and positive direction. At a
time when circumstances could have led to a decline in morale, and a virtual
standstill in operations and programs, under his leadership there has been no
decline in the Commission's efforts to address the problems of employment
discrimination.

                                            'AN AMERICAN SEAT"

           On August 7, 1991, Richard Barrett asked the United States
Senate Judiciary Committee to be placed on the agenda to speak on
the subject of the Clarence Thomas nomination to the Supreme
Court. On September 19, 1991, permission was given for a state-
ment to be submitted for the record. The following is that state-
ment presented on September 25, 1991 by the Honorable Richard
Barrett in behalf of The Nationalist Movement, PO Box 2000,
Learned, Mississippi.

Mr. Chairman:
           The debate is not just who will occupy a seat on the United

States Supreme Court, but: Who will be the office holders, the
team captains, the shop foremen, of this nation. No, in the
larger sense, the question is: Who will man the trenches, pilot
the space ships and forge the steel of this country. Indeed,
whose days will be long upon this land?

            As I rise in behalf of a better court, a nobler justice, a
greater day, I sheathe the sword of ill-will toward any man.
Cognizant that the course of the nation may as well be set by what
proceeds from my lips as by the didactic of my opponents, I en-
deavor to dust off from my coat any lint of ignorance so that I
may present myself to you clothed entirely in the linen of logic.

                                A SINGLE THREAD BINDS TOGETHER
          Mr. Chairman, it is not meanness to insist that a single
                                      931

thread bind together the fabric of America. Rather, it is upright
to urge that every hole be patched, every rip be sewn, by that
miraculous yarn spun by Puritans and pioneers, Pilgrims and patri-
ots, knitted at beachheads, dyed on battlefields, and handed down
to us as that incomparable strain, the American Way of Life.

          Some looking back on this day will find it strange that the
perfume of Nationalism and democracy fills the air abroad, while
the mold of sectionalism and privilege scents this place. Come
now. Should a Russian present himself as a candidate for, say,
the Lithuanian Supreme Court, what sentiments leap from your lungs
when he is rejected in favor of a Lithuanian? Do you cheer on
popular government? Do you shout that the Spirit of '76 impels
independence and self-government for our friends even as for our
ancestors? Do you fete majority rule as you would a most welcome
guest?

          And well you should.
          Well, then, if Henry Kissinger presented himself for the
Presidency of the United States, would you not remind him that our
own codification of nationality, the Constitution of the United
States, prohibits one foreign-born from serving in the highest
office in the land?

                                LOVE OF AMERICA IS NOT HATRED
          Is it hatred of Mankind to cleave to American nationality?
To love the American Way of Life?
          Of course not.
          For if one foreign-born -- no matter how magnanimous his
                                      932

temperament, no matter how stellar his exploits -- were given sway
over us, a shuddering sense of loss would replace our bubbling
spirit of opportunity. Forbid it, Mr. Chairman; the littlest
American engine must be given to climb not only to this hilltop or
that, but to reach the highest plateau, under its own steam.

           If it is conceded, therefore, that a resident of a row house
may become a denizen of the White House, the Clarence Thomas
nomination begs the question: Why not be considered for a seat on
the Supreme Court, here and now, as well?

           I did not say, at some future time, after the storm of
controversy has passed. I said, now. At the very moment when an
Iowa farmer, looking out over fields plowed by his forbearers,
fenced out by interests far away and beyond, signals his discon-
tent and dispossession. As a Pennsylvania factory worker, survey-
ing stilled engines fueled by his forbearers, padlocked out by
cliques afar and aloof, beckons his displeasure and desperation.

                                              ALIEN IN WORTH
          One need not be foreign in birth to be alien in worth.
          0, mothers of America, nurturing and now presenting your
sons who have never abused a trust, never broken a law, never
shunned a duty: May the tremors of your discontent become the
earthquakes beneath our feet, until every idol of privilege, each
graven image of dispossession, quivers and falls before your own
heroes of the American Way of Life, your own bearers of the Ameri-
can Dream.
          Champions spreading our language and learning. Gladiators
                                      933

contending for our morals and progress. Titans lifting up our
work ethic and freedom.

          What an opportunity, Mr. Chairman, to debunk the notion that
only the few are fit to govern, that only the favored may occupy
this very seat. Spread, instead, the banquet of American opportu-
nity before American farm boy and American factory worker here,
alike, declaring: This land is your land, these jobs are your
jobs, this court is your court, this seat is your seat.

           An unhappy populace did not always have such an enviable
choice as you do. Witness, through tear-filled eyes, the blood,
the rivers of blood, of the Old World in its wars of royalty and
dynasty.

                                  ARISTOCRACY VERSUS CITIZENRY
           Kings draped in purple upon golden thrones who spoke not a
word of the language of the people, in the name of nobility. And
peasants storming castle walls to wrest their country from such
tyranny. Glittering coronations of louts and ignoramuses who
propped up gilded courts, in the name of aristocracy. And the
common people forging moats with fists of fury to carve their name
"citizen" above the inner sanctums where "subjects" could not
tread.
           One would have thought that Providence had spared the New
World such "wars of the roses" when the Spirit of Union accepted
the unconditional surrender of nullification, when the flags of
antebellum "peculiar institutions" were struck down from the
ramparts of power.

                                                         4
                                      934

           Good men were given to hope that America would be one re-
splendent nation, one transcendent people, one incomparable Way of
Life.

           Forward-striding men were given to expect that the pathway
of the common good was swept clean of the rusty nails of privilege
and parochialism, leading upward to the greatest good for the
greatest number.

           Until now.
           For Clarence Thomas presents himself for confirmation to the
highest court in the land.
          Mr. Chairman, the American people is entitled to office
holders Who reflect, in every way, the glistening facets of the
gem of its nationality. Its virtues. Its values. Its justice.
Its morality. Its language. Its religion. Its work. Its fami-
lies. Its hopes.
           Such a nominee is then qualified to serve.

                              QUALIFICATIONS FOR CONFIRMATION
          The nominee must be an American -- not a minority -- for the
American people is the majority of this, a democratic nation.
          He must be a family man -- not a divorcee -- because the
stable home is central to the morality and aspirations of the
majority of the American people.
          He must be a military man -- not a draft shirker -- because
patriotic service at the risk of one's own life is the offering
laid upon the altar of the nation by the majority of the American
people.
                                      935

          He must be of stellar character -- not a marijuana user --
because respect for the law is the hallmark of the majority of the
American people.

          He must be law-upholding -- not a supporter of Malcolm X --
because the majority of the American people reject violence and
hate.

          He must be exemplary -- not a miscegenationist -- because
the majority of the American people practices traditional American
family values.

          He must be a product of the commonweal -- not a quota --
because the majority of the American people achieves by work and
merit.

          He must be honest -- not a hypocrite -- because the majority
of the American people is straight-forward, fair and just in deal-
ings between our countrymen and all mankind.

                                    MINORITY CAN DO NO WRONG?
          Mr. Chairman, any one of these defects would seemingly call
forth the three nails -- social pervert, political misfit or moral
pariah -- which you would drive into the coffin of any other
nominee. But instead of the ghoul of privilege reposing, it
arises, and lifting the crown of favoritism to its own head,
intones: "The minority can do no wrong."
          Such a horrible wail cannot be confined behind these walls.
It echoes out across the land, summoning free men to the proper
armaments of stable and democratic government: the spoken word,
the voice of reason.
                                      936

           The fisherman at his net, the carpenter at his bench, shout
back: "No favors for the few." You can hear them even now -- in
the happy whistles from the trucker joking beside one who speaks
his same American language, who follows his same American work
ethic. Or in the cheery jibes from the mother prattling beside
one who practices her same American morality, who cherishes her
same American family values.

           But they were not invited to speak here, today. So, I must
and I shall raise their voices, too, and, in doing so, I may
surprise you, but I will not deceive you.

                            WHAT DID HE DO; HOW DID HE DO IT?
           May I, therefore, ask the Watergate conundrum, so often
repeated in Congressional hearings nowadays: "What did he know
and when did he know it?"
          What of Clarence Thomas' drug use? When did he do it and
how did he do it? From whom did he make his illegal purchases?
Or, did he grow the unlawful weeds himself? Did he pander his
perversion to others? Who were they and how have their lives been
corrupted, as a consequence?
          What of his blank military record? Why did he not serve in
uniform and what did he do, instead? Was he a pacifist opposed to
all wars or only the Vietnam War? Were his convictions the result
of deeply held religious scruples, cowardice or sympathy for the
Viet Cong? What good works did he undertake as an alternative or
were his motives purely self-serving?
          But, it is said, "The seat of Thurgood Marshall is a minori-
                                      937

ty seat which must be filled at all costs by a minority."
          The nuances of such a premise were placed before the voters

of New York State when it was claimed that the Senate seat of
Jacob Javits was a "Jewish seat," and rejected. The Massachusetts
electorate faced a like decision when the Senate seat of Edward
Brooke was characterized as a "Negro seat," and likewise rejected.

                                            AN AMERICAN SEAT
          A seat on the United States Supreme Court, Mr. Chairman, is
an American seat.
          You say, but "Mr. Barrett, you are in the minority here
today." Then, Mr. Chairman, I appeal directly to the American
people, saying: Arise. Arms embraced. Tongues united. Hands
clasped. Hearts entwined.
          Down with favors.
          Up with freedom.
          Perhaps Clarence Thomas, himself, could add a tail of char-
acter to the comet of his controversy. He could excuse himself
from consideration by renouncing the very inconsistency which
thrust his nomination upon you. Let him candidly say that his
appointment was the result of the very quotas he opposes and that,
consequently, he withdraws.
          School children would immediately be given to candor, not
compromise, on their examinations. Enlivened professors would
increase their instruction on the values of honesty over hypocri-
sy. And Clarence Thomas could join the ranks with Robert Bork,
bidding the American people to weigh his words and judge his

opinions: not as one lording over the citizenry with a gavel, but
as one speaking with integrity to persuade the commonwealth.

           I prepared to persuade you, today, Mr. Chairman, not by
delving in some clammy library, but by walking through the piney
woods, out back of the house in rural Mississippi. Some songbirds
flew overhead, momentarily distracting me, but their melodious
strains perked up my ears and lifted my spirits. 0, to sing the
sweet songs of honesty with the least of our people, rather than
to join the dour chorus of hypocrisy with the most exalted of the
powerful.

                                    THE CAUSE: MAJORITY RULE
          Nonetheless, Mr. Chairman, I choose to inveigh in the fury
of the desert storm for the cause of majority rule, suffering even
some sand in the eye, rather than to calmly contemplate the cir-
cuits of larks in some solitary forest.
          And so, I extend the choice: The ruinous policies of the
past --· to be swept aside, or the inspiring agenda for change --
to be energized.
          The more sluggish will exclaim, "But transformation of the
court cannot be so sudden. Perhaps over time Americanization can
be put in place."
          Wait? Suppose you concede to continuing the "minority seat"
on the grounds that Clarence Thomas says he rejects the "minority
agenda" of increased favors, privileges and largess for the few?
What shall be your response should an atheist be presented: That
he is acceptable if he expresses no objection to Christianity?
                                     939

Or, what if a homosexual is offered? Shall he be confirmed if he
says he is neutral on the subject of men marrying men?

                                       TOWARD A HAPPY PEOPLE
          By voting to reject the Thomas nomination, you debunk the
notion of "group" happiness and you advance the very foundations
of happiness itself: the cleaving together of a kindred people,
the ennobling of a common spirit, the perfecting of a national un-
ion.
          The American people. Tranquil within its borders. Safe
upon its streets. Joyful in its opportunities. Free in its
institutions. Merry in its adventures. Confident in its govern-
ment. Singing on its journey. Bountiful in its livelihood. True
in its justice. Rejoicing in its abundance. Prolific in its
beneficence.
          Mr. Chairman, one generation chafed under the concept that
the state is secure in the hands of royalty, alone. But the crown
of princely privilege was toppled by the common men of the Ameri-
can Revolution. In so doing, they poured their measure into the
chalice of the Universal Rights of Man, overflowing, with the
promise: Not by birth, but by worth.
          The cup was passed. But ardor cooled.
          The next generation grappled with the notion that government
is safe in the hands of businessmen, alone. Then the sand castle
of wealthy privilege was pushed over by the laboring men of the
New Deal. And, thereby, they added still another measure to the
vessel of true equality, brimming, with the pledge: Not by gold,

                                                         10
                                      940

but by goodness.
          The cup was passed, again. And, again, ardor cooled.
          Today, it is suggested that the court is secure in the hands

of a minority, alone. But the shell game of minority privilege is
being knocked aside by the working men of a Nationalist Ressurrec-
tion. And, should you join them, you will add your portion to the
cup of American Opportunity, profuse, with the credo: Not by
status, but by merit.

          May your cup run over.
                                       AN AMERICAN IS ENOUGH

          Two civil servants were passing by a new government office
building one day. One turned to the other and asked: "How many
work there?" His friend guipped back: "About half of them."

          Some, though with decided less felicity, would ask you the
same question, "How many work there?" but expect your reply in
numbers of minorities, with seats reserved for the "Black Caucus",
"Gay Advocates" or "La Raza." Some call it affirmative action.
Or "civil rights." Or quotas.

          The majority calls it oppression.
          So, may you split the sky with the thunder of your vote, by
the lightning of your reply.
           "Who works in that building?" "Who sits on that court?"
           "Americans."
          It is enough.

Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
United States Senate
Russell Senate Office Building
Room 221
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Biden:

                  I write to urge that the Judiciary Committee of the
United States Senate, and the Senate as a whole, vote against the
confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas to be an Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court. While I believe that there are several
grounds for rejection, my principal reason for urging that course
is that Judge Thomas's confirmation could weaken the right to
privacy enjoyed by all Americans and destroy the fundamental right
of every woman to choose whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.

                 The continued vitality of the right to choose is a basic
concern of millions of women and men in this nation. It is also
one of my longstanding concerns. During my tenure as New York's
Attorney General, my office has filed briefs in the Supreme Court
in many of the important abortion cases of the last decade. When
such important rights are at stake, the Senate has the
constitutional obligation carefully to weigh the President's
nominee. And when confirmation threatens to undermine our
cherished liberties, the Senate must withhold its consent.

                  Eighteen years ago, a seven-member majority of the
Supreme Court concluded in Roe v. Wade that the Constitution
protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. It was a
purely legal determination of bipartisan justices appointed by
Presidents Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Johnson, and Nixon. That
decision was in the best tradition of American constitutional
jurisprudence: a truly independent judiciary* acting free of
political influence, building incrementally on a line of cases
stretching back over eighty years. Indeed, even Justice
Rehnquist's dissent praised the majority opinion for its "wealth
                                     942

of legal scholarship."1 It is well to remember the words of the
seven-member majority, which recognized that its task was "to
resolve the issue by constitutional measurement, free of emotion
and of predilection."2

                 The opponents of choice have turned the legal issue of
fundamental rights into a political battle, and have made the
question of where a Supreme Court nominee stands on this issue a
litmus test for appointment. The unfortunate politicization of
this legal issue of fundamental rights makes it necessary for this
Committee to scrutinize closely a nominee's views.

                  The right to privacy, to be let alone, is a cherished
liberty, and it is not of recent origin. For decades, majorities
of the Supreme Court have agreed that it creates a zone of personal
decision-making free from government encroachment in the areas of
marriage, child rearing and education, family relationships,
procreation, and contraception. As the Roe Court stated, the right
to privacy "is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether
or not to terminate her pregnancy." Like the right to speak, to
worship, to face one's accuser, or to be judged by a jury of one's
peers, that right is fundamental. The majority in Roe held that
only a compelling state interest can justify its infringement.

                  We should remember that abortion was not illegal when the
Constitution was adopted. Laws prohibiting abortion did not come
into vogue until the 19th Century. Roe v. Wade ended a period of
harsh regulation by the states, which had devastating effects on
the lives and health of women. After Roe, a state could no longer
use its criminal laws to command a woman to carry to term a
pregnancy, or force her to seek out in desperation the services of
back-alley quacks and butchers. And while no legal issue has
engendered more debate in the last two decades, a majority of the
justices who have served since Roe have thus far declined to
abandon its principles. With the Supreme Court appointments of the
last two administrations, however, the fate of Roe now hangs in the
balance.

                  Judge Thomas has declined to reveal to this committee
whether he considers the right to choose a fundamental right and

has refused even to discuss his views on the constitutional
analysis in Roe, a now eighteen-year old precedent. In contrast,
he has not shown the same reticence when asked to discuss other
constitutional matters which will likely be considered by the
Supreme Court in the coming years, including controversial issues
involving freedom of religion, the participation of crime victims
in criminal sentencing proceedings, protection against sex
discrimination, the imposition of the death penalty, and the right
of habeas corpus. Judge Thomas's carefully orchestrated decision
to remain mute on the critical question of whether a woman has a
fundamental right to choose means that his written record must be
examined to shed light on how he would treat that right on the
Supreme Court. Here, however, Judge Thomas has also tried to elude
the committee's concerns entirely. He has, in effect, asked the
committee to disregard his written views on the right to privacy,
including the entire corpus of his writings and speeches expressing
his legal philosophy that natural or higher law should guide
constitutional adjudication. He has asserted to this Committee
that the views he expressed in the past about natural law were mere
political theorizing and that he would not resort to his natural
law ideas in deciding constitutional cases.

                  Judge Thomas's speeches and writings call those
assertions into question. Those writings specifically commend
Supreme Court opinions which relied on natural law, and criticize
others which did not. Judge Thomas has said, "The higher law
background of the American Constitution, whether explicitly
appealed to or not, provides the only firm basis for a just, wise
and constitutional decision." Only two years ago he wrote in the
Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy that "without recourse to
higher law, we abandon our best defense of judicial review" and
that "higher law is the only alternative to the willfulness of run-
amok majorities and run-amok judges."6 The public domain contains
not merely one Thomas article or speech urging conservatives to
embrace higher law jurisprudence, but at least a half-dozen.

                 Judge Thomas's views about how to interpret the
Constitution radically conflict with modern constitutional
doctrine. He resurrects a natural law theory of constitutional
interpretation that slipped into disrepute a half-century ago.
Central to his approach is the desire to limit the courts" ability
to recognize or vindicate personal rights. In one article, Judge
Thomas warns against the "maximization of rights", admonishing that
the Supreme Court might strike down a law that violates a personal
right, or that Congress might use its power to protect a recognized
right. At the same time, he would enhance protections given to
the economic "rights" of businesses and property owners and, in the
process, undermine health and safety legislation which has
protected our citizens for fifty years.

                 The personal right Thomas has singled out most for attack
is the right to privacy. He has expressed his "misgivings"10 about
the majority and concurring opinions in the Griswold case, which
protects the right to use contraception, and, in an article
appealing to conservatives to use natural law, described Roe v.
Wade as the case "provoking the most protest from conservatives.""

                 Not long ago Judge Thomas made a speech to the Heritage
Foundation praising an article written by Lewis Lehman. That
article, as the committee knows, contends in an elaborate analysis
that natural law accords an unborn fetus an inalienable right to
life, a conclusion that would not merely permit state prohibition
of abortion, but require it. Judge Thomas called it "a splendid
example of applying natural law". Judge Thomas now claims that his
description of the Lehrman article as "splendid" was not an
endorsement, but merely a "throw-away line" intended to win over
his conservative audience to a general natural law approach to

civil rights.15 But the speech did not refer casually to the
article; it praised the very contents of the essay, which Judge
Thomas described as the "meaning of the right to life." Moreover,
the analysis in the Lehrman article, which identifies the
Declaration of Independence as the source for a natural law theory
of constitutional interpretation, is nearly identical to the
analysis of natural law in several of Judge Thomas's writings and
speeches.

                  In fact, the essay is strikingly similar to some of the
writings of Professor Harry V. Jaffa of Claremont Institute's
Center for the Study of the Natural Law, who appears to be a source
for both Judge Thomas' and Mr. Lehrman's views on natural rights
jurisprudence.14 As the Committee may know, two of Professor
Jaffa's former students are credited for their assistance in
preparing Judge Thomas' articles expounding his natural law
interpretation of the Constitution. Like Judge Thomas and Mr.
Lehrman, Professor Jaffa finds in the Declaration of Independence
the source for his species of natural law jurisprudence, and like
Mr. Lehrman, he concludes that natural law contains a command to
bar abortion.15 These views of the Constitution are far more
extreme than those of any modern justice or nominee.

                  The right to privacy and the particular right of a woman
to control her bodily destiny are central concerns of this
nomination. In his testimony, Judge Thomas sought to distance
himself from his past statements about those rights. But, if Judge
Thomas disavows what he said so recently and if he also declines
to answer the committee's guestions on such critical issues, what
is the record that the Senate can review to determine whether he
merits appointment to the highest court in the land? I
respectfully urge this distinguished committee to withhold its

inescapable that his confirmation would put the fundamental rights
of Americans, and especially of women, in grave jeopardy.

        My name is Alfred W. Blumrosen. I am the Thomas A.
Cowan Professor of Law, Rutgers Law School, Newark New
Jersey. My field is employment discrimination law. I
have served every federal administration during the period
of 1965-1980, while a bi-partisan Equal Employment
Opportunity Program was developed and implemented. In the
Johnson administration, from 1965-1967, I was Chief of
Conciliations for the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. During that time I organized the conciliation
process under Title VII. In 1968, I was a Special
Attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of
Justice. During the Nixon-Ford administration, I served
as consultant to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for
Employment Standards, Arthur Fletcher, conducted a
research program to improve state fair employment practice
agency performance and organized a conference at Rutgers
Law School on the first ten years of Title VII in 1975
with the support of the EEOC. During the Carter
administration, I was a consultant to EEOC Chair Norton.
I assisted in the reorganization of the EEOC, the
development of new procedures, and the development of
Guidelines on Affirmative Action. I was the EEOC's
representative to the committee which developed the
Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures-1978.

                                                     -3

Both of these Guidelines are still in force.
        I have lectured and written extensively in the EEO

field. Several of my articles have been cited by the
Supreme Court. I have litigated concerning EEO matters on
behalf of the Federal government, and on behalf of
workers, unions and employers.

        I appeared before you last year, questioning the
qualification of Judge Thomas to serve on the Court of
Appeals. My concern was that, as Chair of the EEOC, he
had privately directed his acting general counsel to
disregard the agency's own guidelines on Affirmative
Action. I was concerned that Chair Thomas, as a judge,
would be likely to permit agencies to disregard their own
rules, because he had done so. Agencies must comply with
their own regulations, or change them through appropriate
procedures, if there is to be effective oversight of their
activities. This is a fundamental rule of administrative
law. I will not repeat the details of my analysis. I
have attached a copy for your convenience. It is
important to your consideration of his nomination to the
Supreme Court. Today, however, I wish to make a different
point.

        Your task is to assess how Judge Thomas will respond
if confirmed, to the most important issues which will come
                                   951

                                                -4

before the Supreme Court during the next generation. Let
me state what one of these issue is, and how I think Judge
Thomas will respond to it.

        At stake is the basic economic and social
configuration of American society. Will the outrageous
concentration of wealth and income which took place during
the 1980's be preserved and perpetuated-- or will the
principle of an expanding middle class be restored as the
basic organizing structure of the nation?

        The massive--and obscene-- concentration of wealth
and income during the Reagan era has been eloquently
documented by the leading conservative political theorist
Kevin Phillips, in The Politics of Rich and Poor: Wealth
and the American Electorate in the Reagan Aftermath.
(Random House, 1990). Even Mr. Phillips is disgusted
with the decline from what he views as the realistic
assertion of conservative values in the 70's, into the
swamp of greed and glitz of the 1980's.1

        Legislation which favors the poor and lower middle
classes cannot now be enacted. President Bush has used
his veto on these matters so as to avoid the majority rule

principle. A two-thirds vote is now required to pass
civil rights, family leave, workers rights or unemployment
compensation legislation. so long as his supporters
command 1/3 of the votes in the Senate, the will of the
Congress is disregarded.

        But the people will ultimately refuse to support a
society so crudely operated for the benefit of the rich,
and will insist that we reinvigorate the principle of an
expanding middle class, in part so that the poor may
realistically look forward to a better future. The people
will either replace the President, or elect more senators
who share their vision. When either event happens,
legislation will be passed to revive and expand the middle
class. This will be done partly at the expense of the
very rich--probably by increased taxation of income and
wealth--and partly through other measures which will
enhance the ability of the less wealthy to influence
social and economic matters.

        These laws will then be challenged in the last legal
bastion in which the rich will seek to preserve their
positions--the Supreme Court. The Court will be asked to
declare these new acts unconstitutional, or to interpret
                                   953

                                                             -6

them so narrowly that the obligations which Congress
intends to impose will be minimized.

         The older technique which the Court once used to
protect the wealthy-- declaring that the constitution
protects the advantage which wealth g i v e s -- i s now out of
fashion. Less than 100 years ago the Court said that due
process prohibits a legislature from altering the economic
relations between rich and poor.2 There are some who
would have the court return to that view. But the more
recent history suggests that the Court will take a
different tack.

         The newer method of frustrating the will of Congress
was tested by the Supreme Court with great success in 1989
in cases involving the Civil Rights to equal employment
opportunity of minorities, women and older workers.3 That
technique is to interpret legislation in a narrow and
technical way so as to frustrate the legislative will.
These decisions are then defended as "merely technical" or

on the grounds that Congress was not clear enough about
its intention. The Court adopted the narrowest view of the
law, and ignored both p-Ccedcnt and legislative history.
The citizenry did not get exercised about "technical"
decisions, and the Presidential veto of the 19-90 Civil
Rights Act, done under the banner of opposing "quotas,"
was sustained in the Senate. The media never asked the
President what he meant by that term. The net result is
that the impact of the equal employment laws has been
reduced, in a manner inconsistent with its original
interpretation.

         This is a methodology which the Court will use to
preserve the new structure of wealth and influence.4 It
is more subtle, more difficult to address than a blunt
holding that laws are unconstitutional.

         When laws which try to revive the middle class, and
open opportunities for the poor come before the Supreme
Court, how will Judge Thomas react? Does he have deep

       4 . For an example in 1991, see Litton Financial
Printing v. NLRB, 111 S. Ct. 2215 (1991) in which the
Court rejected, 5-4, the presumption of arbitrability of
disputes under a collective bargaining agreement which has
been built into Labor Law over the last thirty years.

sympathy for the poor and disadvantaged because he
struggled with poverty and discrimination himself? Or has
he so far identified himself with the interests of the
wealthy that he will join the Court in frustrating the
efforts of Congress to restore the American dream of an
expanding middle class?

        Let us look at his record as Chair of the EEOC to
help answer this question. This record does not
demonstrate sympathy for the disadvantaged.5 The EEOC was
established by Congress in the 1964 Civil Rights Act to
conciliate claims of employment discrimination where there
was "reasonable cause" to credit those claims. Judge
Thomas reduced by half the chances for a minority or woman
to secure assistance from the EEOC in settling their
discrimination claims. In FY 1981 and 1982, EEOC settled
35,000 of the 88,000 claims filed, for $ 133.6 million
dollars. In FY 1987 and 88, after Judge Thomas had been

      5. He surrendered the government wide policy-making
function of the EEOC, created in President Carter's
executive order and reorganization plan, to William
Reynolds, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, who
was a staunch advocate of restricting the scope of civil
rights law--without any overt objection, or insistence on
formalizing the loss of influence by the EEOC. Reynolds
then conducted the Reagan program to narrow the bi
partisan program of the previous 15 years.

                                                     -9

managing the EEOC for several years, it settled 12,800 of
the 90,000 claims filed, for a total of $72 million
dollars. In those two years alone, his agency refused to
assist 23,000 people and saved employers 61 million
dollars. In short, after Judge Thomas took over the EEOC,
it settled one third of the number of claims for half the
amount of money in that two year period. Between 1983 and
1988 he withheld such relief from 80,000 people.6

        The EEOC's own statistics tell the story.7 The
chances that a minority or female complainant would be
helped by EEOC conciliation if they brought a claim to the
EEOC declined from 40% in 1980-81 to 20% in 1987-88.
Two out of five such claims filed in 1980 and 1981 were
conciliated with benefits to the complainants. By the
time Judge Thomas' term was nearly over, that figure was
down to one out of five, and the amounts recovered were
reduced by 61 million dollars.8 This is the most telling

       6. See appendix, note 1, infra.

those statistics.

figures cannot be explained by extrinsic circumstances.
The proportion of Age Discrimination claims settled did
not change during the period, and the settlement rates for
race and sex cases in the state agencies were higher than

point in connection with the question of where his
sympathies lie.

         Race and sex cases are more likely to involve poor
and lower middle class people--minorities and w o m e n -- than
are age discrimination cases.9 Age discrimination cases
are more likely to involve middle class and sometimes even
upper income class white males. 1 0 The chances that a
person bringing an age discrimination claim would be
benefited by EEOC conciliations remained constant during
his term, in contrast to these race and sex cases,. It
was 20% in 1980 and 20% in 1988. (This is not to say
that those concerned about age discrimination were happy
with his work. They speak for themselves.) This

       1 0 . Discharge cases constituted nearly 50% of all
claims filed with the EEOC in 1988. EEOC Ann. Rep. 1988,
p. 20. Age discrimination claimants are apt to be
discharged from higher paying jobs than are Race/sex
discrimination claimants, so their monetary losses will be
greater. The average settlement in an age case in 1981-82
was $15,398 and in 1987-88 was 19,422.

claimed discrimination was caused by policy changes
adopted by the EEOC.11

        The technique by which this was accomplished was
procedural. Technical changes were made in EEOC
regulations in 1984 which gave more deference to employer
arguments. Congress had decreed that the EEOC should try
to settle discrimination claims if it found "reasonable
cause" to believe there had been discrimination. Judge
Thomas' EEOC in 1984 redefined "reasonable cause" to mean
only those cases where it thought the complainant would
win in court. Thus it denied conciliation efforts to the
thousands who had reasonable grounds to complain. That is
a much stricter standards than had previously been used,
and resulted in the denial of EEOC conciliation assistance
to thousands of complainants who would have received it in
earlier years.12 The technique used by Judge Thomas at

       11. The reduction settlements in sex and race
discrimination matters by the EEOC did not take place with
resepct to age discrimination claims, nor with claims
filed with state fair employment agencies. See Appendix,
note 2. Therefore the statistics cannot be explained on
the basis of increased hostility of employers to settling
discrimination claims in general. The EEOC conducted
training programs to assure that agency personnel would
follow the more restrictive procedures. See, e.g., EEOC
Annual Report for 1986-1988, p. 5.

       12. Congress did not intend that EEOC conciliate only
                                   959

                                                     -12

the EEOC is the very same techniques that the Supreme
Court used in 1989 to narrow the scope of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Laws.13 From this history, it is
clear that Judge Thomas will not be sympathetic to
Congressional efforts to aid the poor and middle class.

        Judge Thomas held the Chairmanship of the EEOC for
seven years. The net effect of his performance in that
job has been to reduce the chances that minorities or
women would get the assistance of the EEOC in trying to
settle their claims of discrimination. A person with that
record should not be placed on the Supreme Court.

        Finally, there is his position concerning affirmative
action. He personally benefited from the helping hands
given him by the Nuns, Holy Cross, Yale Law School and

where complainants would win in court. The basis for
conciliation in the statute in "reasonable cause" to
believe there was discrimination, not proof by a
preponderence of the evidence, which is the standard used
in court. The EEOC is not a court, and does not have the
power to hold adjudicatory hearings.

      13. Compare the judicial technique for narrowing the
scope of the equal employment laws in Wards Cove Packing
Co. V. Atonio, 109 S. Ct. 2115 (1989) with the narrowing
of the definition of "reasonable cause" by the EEOC during
the Thomas administration.

Sen. Danforth, while he developed his talents and
abilities. I applaud all of those efforts. They
demonstrate how affirmative action should work.
Affirmative action seeks to counter the lasting legacy of
discrimination--the tendency to ignore or underestimate
the talents of minorities and women. Affirmative action
does seek out those minorities and women with talent and
ability, and tries to further their development.
Decisions as to who to choose from among the large pool of
qualified persons, have traditionally been made using race
or sex stereotypes. "Goals" are a mechanism to assure
that these talented and able women and minorities are in
fact sought out, and that the employer does not simply
give lip service to the idea of equality. It is a fine
tribute to all of those institutions and individuals--and
to the work which Judge Thomas has done-- that his career
has brought him to this hearing room.

        Judge Thomas does not buy this analysis. He appears
to believe that people "make it" alone, based on hard work
and talent. In this, of course, he is in fundamental
error. Demonstrating abilities or talent by hard work is
necessary, but it only gets you into the pool from which
961

   -14

those who will be advanced are identified. None of us

have "made it on our own." All of us--all of you and

myself--have had helping hands along the way.  Judge

Thomas was assisted by such programs to develop and

demonstrate his abilities. But he does not believe that

affirmative action is a part of the way the world works.

He wishes to believe in a world in which people "make it
on their own.1* As a consequence, he is likely to be tough

on the poor, because they did not work hard enough to get

out of poverty, and to look skeptically at programs

designed to open middle class opportunities.

You may test this thesis by asking his views on the

merits of Hards Cove Packing Co. V. Atonio, Patterson v.

McLean Credit Union, Lorance v. AT & T, Martin v. Wilks,

Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins and Betts v. Ohio, the 1989

cases in which the Supreme Court cut back on the scope of

the Civil Rights Acts. In these cases, and others, the

Court said it would ignore what Senators and Congressmen

write in reports, and what they say in the floor debates

on legislation, and even what its predecessors have said.

Where does he stand on the question of taking legislative
                              962

                                                     -15

history, including committee reports and legislative
debate into account? Restricting the use of these
materials is a fundamental element of the new Supreme
Court technique. The "new" Supreme Court will ignore what
Congress said and did in the course of developing
legislation. This is the way the Court will try to
mutilate efforts of Congress to help the poor and middle
classes. Judge Thomas has already demonstrated that he
can interpret a statute so as to reduce the help it will
give to workers. That is what he did when he
reinterpreted the concept of "reasonable cause" under
Title VII. On this record, he is likely to join the group
on the court who are hostile to Congressional efforts to
restore the middle class and give hope to the poor.

         Of course, it is appropriate for the Senate to
inquire into his views on any issue which is likely to
come before the Court. The Court is a policy making body,
operating within a loose framework of the Constitution and
statutes. The Senate is entitled to examine the policy
views of nominees. That is different from asking a
prospective justice to decide whether A or B should win a
particular law suit. These policy issues concerning
                                 963

                                                    -16

constitutional and statutory intexpretation are the
lifeblood of the work of the court, and any effort to
evade discussion of them should result in rejection of the
nominee.

        Unless his answers convince you that he will honor
the judgment of Congress, not only as found in the so
called "plain meaning" of the words, but in the sense of
the will of the majority derived from all appropriate and
relevant sources, his record of lack of sympathy for the
poor should lead you to reject his nomination.

NOTE 1. The settlement rate for 1981-82 in race, sex,
national origin and religion cases was 40%. Between 1983
and 1988, EEOC received 290,663 complaints concerning these
types of discrimination. If it had settled 40% of those
cases, it would have settled 116,265. In fact, it settled
29,777, or 86,488 fewer than it would have resolved under
the earlier standards. This is the basis for the estimate
that the Thomas administration at EEOC denied settlement
assistance to 80,000 people.

NOTE 2: in 1985-86, State Fair Employment Practice Agencies
settled 26% of the race, sex, national origin and religion
cases which came before them, and 16% of the age
discrimination cases. In 1987-88, the state agencies

cases. The settlement rates in the race, sex, etc. cases
for the state agencies were higher than the settlement rates
for similar cases at the EEOC.

Dear Senator Biden:

                  Enclosed is my statement for insertion in the record of
the proceedings dealing with the nomination of the Hon. Clarence
Thomas as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme
Court. I have taken the liberty of enclosing 13 copies for
distribution to the other members of the Committee.

                  I further note with interest that you plan to hold
hearings on the procedures involved in future confirmation
proceedings. I would appreciate the opportunity of appearing as
a witness in that regard.

                 I wish to acknowledge my appreciation to the
Committee for its kindness in permitting me to make a
written statement for insertion in the record of the
proceedings dealing with the nomination of the Hon. Clarence
Thomas as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme
Court. This statement will consist of observations not
related solely to the hearings which have just been
concluded but also to some study of hearings in the past
decade and the history of the process before that. To the
extent that any of my observations contain any criticism it
is meant to be constructive only and for the future use and
benefit of the Legislative and Executive branches as well as
future nominees. Furthermore, the observations made and the
opinions expressed are solely my own and are not to reflect
any official opinion - nor could they - of the Court of
which I am a member. And lastly, I have stated no opinion -
as it may be inappropriate to do so - as to whether Judge
Thomas should be confirmed or not. My purpose in the making
of this statement is to set forth my observations and
concerns with regard to the confirmation process with a view
toward ensuring that the most qualified persons are
nominated and confirmed as Justices of the United States
Supreme Court.

                 A Judge, regardless of the manner by which chosen
or the Court for which chosen, must possess the following
                                     968

qualities: Integrity, judicial temperament, an open mind and
the willingness to listen, a background of diversified
experience, extensive contact with people and an
appreciation of the human consequences of his or her
decisions, the discipline necessary to decide issues on the
facts presented and an interpretation of the law as they
apply to those facts, scholarly qualities and a sense of
humor.

                 The first quality, integrity, is the most
important for without it all of the others are of little
value. The last, a sense of humor, often spoken of but
never made a criterion, should be made one. A Judge
possesses enormous authority and power and must deal every
day with the most serious of issues affecting other human
beings. A sense of humor will guarantee that these issues
are put into proper perspective. It will further show the
necessary ingredient of humanity in all*of the decisions.
And lastly a sense of humor will cause the Judge to realize
that no matter how serious the issues may be that he or she
must never take himself or herself too seriously.

                 It is readily acknowledged that both the President
and the Senate have serious and important roles in the
process of selecting Supreme Court Justices which should not
be ignored or diminished. It is further acknowledged that
both the Executive and Legislative branches are political in

                                                       -2-
                                     969

nature and respond accordingly to their respective
constituencies. That is altogether proper under our Law and
our system of Government. But the Judicial branch is and
should remain non-political. It is, by its nature, a
non-democratic body responsible only to interpret the
constitutional mandates and duly enacted legislation. It is
not a body answerable to the will of the People expressed by
a majority vote. Its loyalty is and must remain to the Law.

                 In recent years the proceedings involving
nomination and confirmation of Supreme Court Justices have
taken on features which are of concern to me. And this is
so regardless of the political environment that may have
motivated the appointment or its connection, if any, to the
"direction" the Executive branch may wish the Court to go.

                 Every citizen expects that their Judges will view
a legal dispute with an open mind, listen to all of the
evidence in an impartial manner and after hearing all of the
arguments, make a decision based on the facts as determined
and an interpretation of the applicable law. No one wants a
Judge to prejudge the matter and decide the case before it
is heard.

                 As Senators you have the solemn responsibility of
deciding whether or not to consent to the nomination after
hearing all of the testimony of the nominee and the various
witnesses. Yet in recent years, on some occasions, some

                                                       -3-
                                     970

members of the Judiciary Committee and of the Senate as a
whole, following the nomination and at the beginning of the
hearings have publicly stated their opinion of the nominee
and how they intend to vote. This should not be taken as
meaning that a Senator does not have a right to express an
opinion and vote as they see fit. They clearly have those
rights which must not be diminished. It is the timing with
which they exercise those rights which is of concern to me.

                 They are taking part in a procedure by which a
judicial nominee will or will not be confirmed. They are
properly concerned that the judicial nominee, if confirmed,
will be impartial and render legal decisions only after
hearing the case. Yet some Committee members, by announcing
their decisions before hearing the "case", both for and
against the nominee, are exhibiting an appearance of
partiality and consequently diminishing the integrity of the
Committee and the Senate as a whole. It may well be that
such announcements are engaged in as a result of some
tradition with respect to such hearings or without any
in-depth thought as to the consequences but nonetheless they
leave an impression on the public at large of a prejudgment
by such Senators.

                 There are both valid and inappropriate areas of
inquiry by the Committee of a judicial nominee. The
personal background of the nominee, education, employment,

                                                       -4-
                                     971

any judicial or litigation experience, the published
writings, and, if already a Judge, the opinions of the
nominee, as they are now, should be examined.

                 The general legal philosophy of the nominee may
also be explored to the extent that it reveals the knowledge
the nominee has of the areas of law Which may come before
the Court. More importantly, it will reveal and the nominee
should be asked about the method by which he or she will go
about studying the issues and reaching a decision. This
should be asked regardless of whether a nominee is already a
Judge or not.

                 The questioning of the nominee by the Committee as
to his or her prior writings and opinions in connection with
their general legal philosophy is entirely proper for
another reason. It will assist the Committee in determining
the integrity of the nominee. The Committee must be aware,
however, of the capacity in which the nbminee wrote or
spoke. It is one thing to express your own personal views.
It is quite another to advocate a position on behalf of an
employer or client. And it must not be forgotten that the
personal views of a nominee, published or otherwise,
although given on research by the nominee, are without the
benefit of a pending lawsuit and the input of opposing
counsel for the parties. Other than this reasonable
distinction little else will justify a nominee in his or her
                                  972

explanation of contradictory opinions or statements except a
sincere and acknowledged change of mind or opinion. This
may come about from the intellectual growth of the nominee.
No nominee should be concerned about honestly changing their
opinion about a subject. It is a sign of maturity and
growth - not otherwise. What is not acceptable is an
attempt to reconcile or to deny that various statements are
contradictory when, in fact, no other reasonable conclusion
could be drawn.

                 The most difficult area of inquiry for the
Committee is where they inquire as to those issues which are
likely to be before or are before the Court.

                 It is a clear violation of the Canons of Judicial
Conduct for a nominee, whether already a Judge or not, to
express an opinion on a matter in dispute or likely to be
before the Court. And the members of the Committee - who
are lawyers - should know that better than anyone else. For
a nominee to answer such a question not only violates the
Canons but also establishes a basis upon which he or she may
rightfully be asked to recuse himself or herself from a
matter which is or comes before the Court. In so doing the
nominee deprives the Court and the Country of both a vote
and a voice on a matter, no matter what the outcome.

                While the nominee must be the judge of when to
draw the line it does little good for the members of the

                                                       -6-
                                     973

Committee to continually ask questions which they must
realize cannot be answered by any nominee who wants to abide
by the Canons.

                 Let us theorize a future situation: the
composition of this Committee were Republican by majority,
Roe v. Wade had been reversed some 10 years before, the
White House was occupied by a Democrat perceived to be
liberal and the nominee to the Supreme Court was perceived
to be a liberal with a "pro-choice" paper trail. Would that
entitle the "conservatives" on the Committee to demand to
know how the nominee would vote on a pending case likely to
reinstate Roe v.Wade? The answer is clearly: No. Neither
the Canons nor basic common sense should change dependent on
the political makeup of the Executive or Legislative
branches or the political climate of the country. These
questions must not be asked by the Committee but if asked
must not be answered by the nominee. And this theoretical
example with regard to Roe v. Wade can also be applied to
other "landmark" decisions, Miranda v. Arizona, Mapp v.
Ohio, New York Times v. Sullivan and Texas v. Johnson to
name just a few.

                 The nominees should also be aware that their
conduct before the Committee may also raise serious
concerns. With the present day emphasis on the "paper
trail" of a nominee, some nominees may possess a minimal

                                                       -7-
                                   974

trail or none at all. If such a nominee were still to come
before the Committee claiming no opinions, published or
otherwise, on any of the landmark decisions of the Supreme
Court, that position could reasonably cause Committee
members to conclude a number of things about the nominee:
(1) he or she has too little life experience to be a member
of the Supreme Court; (2) the nominee is lacking in
truthfulness and basic integrity; or (3) the nominee does
not possess the intellectual capacity to be a member of the
Court.

                The nominees ought to be aware that they should
not appear to choose among the areas likely to be before the
Court as to which they will speak about and which they will
not. They should decline to answer all in that category
lest they violate the Canons on Judicial Conduct and give an
appearance, if not an actuality, of seeking to curry favor
with certain Committee members on a matter in which the
latter have a known interest and view.

                 It also seems apparent that it is almost expected
of a nominee that he or she must disavow all of their
previously held personal views. Judges do not ask that of
jurors at trials. Jurors are asked to put aside their
personal views on the law and other subjects for the purpose
of the matter before them but not otherwise. Judges should
not be asked to do more than that. To ask Judges to do so

                                                       -8-
                                     975

is to strip them of their intellectual abilities and their
independence of thought.

                Any forthright Judge will tell you that they
approach cases with a considerable number of thoughts in
mind because they have read the court file beforehand. But
if asked what their decision is going to be at that point
they have none. And though they will have tentative
reactions during the case they will never know what their
decision will be until after all of the evidence is in, the
briefs re-read and the arguments heard. And this is so
whether a Judge has strongly held personal beliefs or not.
Qualified Judges possess a discipline by which they
instinctively put their personal views aside and decide the
case on its merit or lack of merit as determined by the
applicable law.

                 The Executive branch, as part of its role in the
process, has taken to extensive preparation of the nominees.
There is nothing inherently wrong with that. There is much
to be learned from such sessions as to the procedures of the
Committee so long as the "handlers" do not "spoon feed" the
nominee resulting in repetition of that information to the
Committee. The nominee should be as tactfully courteous as
possible with the "handlers", listen politely, do his or her
own homework as well and then speak frankly to the
Committee.

                                                       -9-
                                  976

                 It has been reported that in some circles that
every question asked must be answered by the nominee in some
fashion. It is hoped that this does not mean that a nominee
must attempt an answer in areas with which he or she is not
familiar. Any such advice, if it is being given, should
cease. Anyone with any common sense knows that there will
be areas of the law about which a nominee will be
unfamiliar. There is no shame or disqualification for a
nominee to admit such unfamiliarity. The public expects no
different and any other approach will only court disaster.

                While the Executive branch has every right to
nominate whomever they want they must be mindful of the
reason why they nominate an individual. While it may be to
pursue a certain philosophy or change the direction of the
Court it may not "sell" as being "too obvious". And history
nevertheless tells us that there is no predictability as to
the decisions which will be made by the* Judges no matter
what the Executive branch may hope or expect. Associate
Justice Hugo Black, who once had a minor association with
the Klu Klux Klan, established himself as a renowned Justice
with his opinions on the breadth of various Constitutional
freedoms. Earl Warren, a California prosecutor, who urged
the incarceration of Japanese-Americans after the attack on
Pearl Harbor, wrote the unanimous opinion in Brown v. Board
of Education and the majority opinion Miranda v. Arizona.

                                                      -10-
                                     977

Felix Frankfurther, regarded as liberal by some, dissented
in the Mapp v. Ohio decision which mandated the exlusionary
rule on state courts in criminal cases. If nothing else
this shows that if perchance confirmed nominees who may have
had no apparent feel for independence when they arrived on
the Court gained it by growing on the Court.

                 These are but a few of my observations. But I
believe them to be significant and worthy of consideration
by the Committee, the Executive branch and future nominees
not only to the Supreme Court but to other Federal Courts as
well. Once again I appreciate the opportunity given me by
the Committee to submit this statement on a very important
matter - ensuring that the most qualified persons are
nominated and confirmed as Justices of the United States

                                    t

Dear Senator Biden:
        I regret that my letter of July 18, 1991, requesting the

opportunity to speak before your committee for the
Confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas was not accepted,
probably due to the large number of requests. Nevertheless,
I had the opportunity to listen to the full hearing by
television. Therefore, I am listing below the presentation
I would have made as if I was appearing in person, before
your committee.

MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE JUDICIARY

        MR. CHAIRMAN, I CAME TO PHILADELPHIA OVER 70 YEARS AGO.
HOWEVER, YOU CAN TELL BY MY VOICE AND DIALECT THAT I STILL
CARRY THE VOICE OF THE "DEEP SOUTH". MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE IS
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOUND OF THE SOUTHERN VOICE THAT
EXPRESSES CONFIDENCE AND TRUST (VOID OF HYPOCRISY), THAT "A
MAN'S WORD IS HIS BOND". MR. CHAIRMAN, FOR OVER 60 YEARS, I
HAVE LIVED AND WORKED ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF A MULTITUDE OF
AMERICAN ACTIVITIES ON THE COMMUNITY, STATE AND NATIONAL

        MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH A PEOPLE WHO
SELECT TO MAKE, AS THEIR PRIORITY, A CAMPAIGN TO STOP A POOR
BLACK BOY, WHO PULLED HIMSELF UP WITHOUT EVEN A "BOOT STRAP";
A BOY WHO SUFFERED, DURING HIS EARLY LIFE, FROM RACE AND
RELIGIOUS BIGOTRY. MR. CHAIRMAN, THESE LEADERS CAME BY
PLANES, BUSES AND "STRETCH" LIMOUSINES, AND LODGING AT LUXURY
HOTELS, LIKE VULTURES -- "BIRDS OF PREY" THAT SITS ON HIGH
PEAKS OF MOUNTAINS; LIMBS OF TREES, WAITING TO ATTACK THEIR
VICTIMS AT THEIR WEAKEST MOMENT. MR. CHAIRMAN, I WATCHED
JUDGE THOMAS SIT IN THE CHAMBER BEFORE THE COMMITTEE AND
LISTEN TO: THE MANY DEGRADING REMARKS, THE ANGER AND THE
EXPRESSED DETERMINATION TO "GET HIM" AND DRAG HIM DOWN AT
ANY COST. INDEED THIS WAS IN ITSELF, AN AWESOME BURDEN FOR
JUDGE THOMAS TO BEAR FROM HIS OWN RACE. YET, HE SAT THERE
WITH DIGNITY, NOR DID HE REFLECT ANGER, HATE OR REGRET...HE
SEEMS, MR. CHAIRMAN, TO HAVE BEEN INSULATED BY A "HIGHER
ORDER"; INSULATED WITH A FEELING THAT HIS CONSCIOUS WAS CLEAR
AND HIS SPIRIT, SATISFIED.

        MR. CHAIRMAN, I AM NOT HERE TO TAKE EXCEPTION TO THE
MANY CHARGES AND STATEMENTS MADE AGAINST JUDGE THOMAS BY
CIVIC AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS REGARDING THE POSITION HE HAS
TAKEN IN THE PAST...HOWEVER, I AM HERE TO TAKE EXCEPTION TO
THE ABILITIES OF THESE LEADERS TO DETERMINE WHAT JUDGE THOMAS

WILL DO IN THE FUTURE...INDEED, MR. CHAIRMAN, I LISTENED WITH
SHARP ATTENTION AS THESE LEADERS INTRODUCED THEMSELVES,
CLAIMING THEIR MILLIONS OF MEMBERS AND THE ORGANIZATIONS THEY
REPRESENTED. INDEED, MR. CHAIRMAN, ORGANIZATIONS AND LEADERS
WITH SUCH POWER AND STATURE COMPELLED ME TO RAISE A POINT OF
PERSONAL INQUIRY...

        1) I ASK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND THE PEOPLES OF AMERICA...
               "WOULDN'T IT BE MORE BENEFICIAL TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS
               AND TO THE IMAGE OF OUR NATION IF THESE LEADERS
               WOULD DEMONSTRATE AN EQUAL COMPASSION AND CONCERN
               FOR SETTING-UP THE ESSENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL
               STRUCTURE TO HARNESS THE OVER THREE HUNDRED BILLION
               DOLLARS ($300,000.000,000) A YEAR THAT THIS COUNTRY
               PROVIDES FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS?"...

        2) "WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF THESE LEADERS, WITH
               THEIR MILLIONS OF MEMBERS, WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE
               SAME COMPASSION AND ZEAL TO SET-UP A NATIONAL CASKET
               COMPANY TO BURY THEIR OWN DEAD OF THREE HUNDRED
               FIFTY THOUSAND (350,000) AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO DIE
               EACH YEAR, AND TO OWN THEIR CEMETERY TO BURY THEM
               IN?"

        3) "WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL, MR. CHAIRMAN, IF THESE
               LEADERS WOULD GET TOGETHER AND DEMONSTRATE THE SAME

               INTEREST TO ORGANIZE A NATIONAL CATERING COMPANY
               TO SERVICE THE 105 BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES,
               WHO SPEND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
               ($350,000,000) A YEAR IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD TO
               STUDENTS AND STAFF?...NOT COUNTING, MR. CHAIRMAN,
               THE CATERING NEEDS OF 30 MILLION AFRICAN AMERICANS."

        4) "FURTHER, MR. CHAIRMAN, WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF
               THESE LEADERS WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE SAME COMPASSION
               AND ZEAL TO AID THE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS, MANY OF
               THEM FROM THE "BOWELS OF POVERTY" TO OBTAIN
               PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION...WOULD IT NOT BE WONDERFUL
               IF THESE LEADERS WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE SAME ZEAL AND
               COMPASSION TO AID STUDENTS TO MEET THEIR COLLEGE AND
               UNIVERSITY TUITION, WHICH IS $10,000 - $18,000

               WHO ARE AFFLICTED WITH AIDS, AND THE THOUSANDS OF
               SINGLE PARENTS...INDEED, ONE WONDERS HOW THESE
               SUPPOSEDLY INTELLIGENT LEADERS COULD HAVE SELECTED
               THE DESTROYING OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS AS THEIR
               SINGLE PRIORITY.

        LET ME SAY HERE, MR. CHAIRMAN, THAT I BELIEVE IN THE
CHURCH; I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THE CHURCH...MY FATHER WAS A
MINISTER AND MY UNCLE, GEORGE LONDON, AND HIS SON ORGANIZED
CHURCHES THROUGHOUT GEORGIA AND FLORIDA...MY BROTHER, THE
REVEREND PERRY E. EVANS, IS FOUNDER AND PASTOR OF THE FAITH
BAPTIST CHURCH AND FORMER TREASURER OF THE NATIONAL BAPTIST
CONVENTION...AND, MAY I ADD, MR. CHAIRMAN, I AM A TRUSTEE IN
HIS CHURCH; I MAKE ANNUALLY, THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR IN
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE BLACK CHURCH. BUT, MR. CHAIRMAN, THE
PREACHERS WHO TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WERE NOT
DEMONSTRATING THE KIND OF RELIGION OF WHICH MY FATHER
PREACHED, MY BROTHER PREACHED, NOR THE KIND THAT THE GREAT
BELIEVERS IN THE PAST PREACHED.

        MR. CHAIRMAN, THESE PREACHERS, SEEMS TO ME, ARE
FOSTERING "AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH"
PHILOSOPHY. THIS IS INDEED CONTRARY TO THE OLD TIME
RELIGION, WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS TAUGHT US. WE WERE TAUGHT
THE RELIGIOUS PHILOSOPHY ~ "PROP ME UP ON EVER LEANING
SIDES". SO, IF JUDGE THOMAS HAS A "LEANING SIDE", WHICH I
DOUBT, WE SHOULD PROP HIM UP...NOT CUT HIM DOWN. THESE
PREACHERS AND LEADERS SEEMED TO BE CONCERNED MORE BECAUSE
CLARENCE THOMAS HAS VIOLATED A SACRED LAW, LAID DOWN BY THEM,
AS THE UNANOINTED LEADERS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS, THAT THEY
MUST MAKE AN EXAMPLE OUT OF THOMAS AS A LESSON THAT WHAT THEY
                                     984

BELIEVE AND SPONSOR MUST BE SUPPORTED BY BLACK PEOPLE. YOU
SEE, MR. CHAIRMAN, JUDGE THOMAS'S ACTIONS WAS DISMANTLING THE
POWER OF A SELECT GROUP, THAT THREATENED THEIR MIDDLE CLASS
LIVING.

        THE PREACHERS AND LEADERS EXPRESSED FEAR THAT MR. THOMAS
HAD LEFT THE BLACK RACE; THAT HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM. MR.
CHAIRMAN, FOR MR. THOMAS TO WALK AWAY FROM HIS RACE, WOULD BE
IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF TWO SUPERNATURAL PHENOMENON? ND AN
ACHIEVEMENT, NEVER ACCOMPLISHED BY LIVING CREATURES ON PLANET
EARTH...

        1) "BIRDS OF A FEATHER SHALL FLOCK TOGETHER". THIS IS
                 A SUPERNATURAL LAW OF WHICH NO LIVING CREATURE HAS
                 BEEN ABLE TO ESCAPE.

        2) THE OTHER SUPERNATURAL PHENOMENON IS SELF
               PRESERVATION. MR. CHAIRMAN, IT IS NATURAL FOR EACH
               GROUP TO STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL AND PROTECT
               THEMSELVES, BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE AT THE EXPENSE OF
               OTHERS.

MR. CHAIRMAN, IN MY OPINION, JUDGE THOMAS HAS NOT LEFT HIS
RACE, BUT RATHER, THROUGH HIS PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR, THOUGHTS,
ACTIONS, BELIEFS AND PHILOSOPHY, HE HAS RAISED HIMSELF ON

THAT HIGH RAREFIED PLATFORM. THAT HOLDS ONLY GREAT AMERICANS,
AND HAS SHED HIS "RACIAL BLINDERS", THEREBY BELIEVING IN ONE
GOD AND ONE HUMANITY.

        MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU KNOW, I KNOW AND THE MANY LEADERS WHO
TESTIFIED AGAINST HIM AND FOR HIM KNOW THAT THE FIGHT TO KEEP
JUDGE THOMAS OFF THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT THE MAJOR ISSUE.
THE MAJOR ISSUE IS "POWER" TO SUSTAIN A DEGRADING "HAT IN
HAND" PHILOSOPHY THAT HAS DONE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE TO
MAKE AFRICAN AMERICANS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS, AND TO
PROPAGATE DIS-INFORMATION OVER THE WORLD, REGARDING BLACK
AMERICANS. MR. CHAIRMAN, THE IDEA OF FIGHTING FOR CIVIL
RIGHTS AND SPECIAL PRIVILEDGES HAS BECOME A MAJOR PROFIT
INDUSTRY, WHERE 16% OF AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE LIVING OFF 84%
OF THOSE LIVING ON THE LEVEL OF POVERTY; STRUGGLING FOR FOOD,
SHELTER AND CLOTHING. THIS GROUP SEE THEIR MIDDLE CLASS
KINGDOM THREATENED WITH DESTRUCTION. THEY ARE MAKING A STAND
HERE, TO PROTECT THEIR PRIVATE AND PERSONAL INTEREST.
MR. CHAIRMAN, THIS GROUP KNOWS OF THE STORY OF JUDGE HUGO
BLACK, PRESIDENT JOHNSON, AND GEORGE WALLACE...THEY KNOW WHAT
THEY DID OR SAID BEFORE AND WHAT THEY DID OR SAID AFTER. SO,
MR. CHAIRMAN, SO THAT THEIR NAMES WILL NEVER DIE AND REMAIN
ON THE LIPS OF AMERICANS EVERYWHERE AS TO THE UNKNOWN EXTENT

OF HUMAN ACTIONS, BUT FOR ONLY THE FUTURE DOUBTERS, LET US
REPEAT AGAIN AND AGAIN...

        WHEN JUSTICE HUGO BLACK, ALLEGED TO BE A KU KLUX KLAN
        LEADER WAS SWORN INTO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT,
        THE BLACK PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ROSE UP AS ONE
        AGAINST HIM. THE BLACK PRESS PRINTED HIS PICTURE WITH
        THE KU KLUX KLAN HOOD ON...AND YET, MR. CHAIRMAN, TO THE
        GLORY OF GOD, HUGO BLACK CONTRIBUTED MORE TO THE
        ADVANCEMENT, EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL AMERICANS THAN
        ANY OTHER JUSTICE THAT EVER HELD THAT OFFICE.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE, MR. CHAIRMAN...
        IN HIS BOOK, "VANTAGE POINT", PRESIDENT LYNDON
        JOHNSON, THEN A U.S. SENATOR, SAID HE HAD A BLACK MAN
        AND HIS WIFE WORKING FOR HIM FOR 25 YEARS. HE SAID THAT
        THEY WERE GETTING READY TO DRIVE BACK TO TEXAS FROM
        WASHINGTON, AND WHEN THEY WERE LOADING THE CARS, HE
        WENT TO THE BLACK MAN AND SAID, "YOU TAKE THE DOG WITH
        YOU THIS TIME." THE BLACK MAN LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID,
        "DO I HAVE TO, BOSS?"...AND SENATOR JOHNSON SAID, "YES,
        THE DOG LIKES YOU AS WELL AS HE DOES ME". JOHNSON SAID,
        "DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT?"...AND THE MAN SAID,
        "YES SIR, IT'S BAD ENOUGH FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO TRAVEL

        HAVE TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY AND GO BACK INTO THE BLACK

                       Clarence Thomas: An Appraisal

Overview

        The United States Supreme Court has a profound impact on the quality of
public education and the lives of America's educators. Fundamental
constitutional principles, as spelled out by the Court, have helped shape the open
academic inquiry and broad rights of access that have made free, universal,
public education a central element in our nation's success.

        The National Education Association has a longstanding commitment to
these values. We have worked to maintain and expand free speech, preserve
religious liberty through separation of church and state, and protect the human
and civil rights of all Americans.

        The nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court
causes NEA members grave concern. His reliance on a concept of "natural law"
opens the doors to radical shifts in interpretations of the U.S. Constitution. His
avowed support for tuition tax credits and vouchers indicates a willingness to
undermine the constitutional separation of church and state. His antipathy to
group remedies to compensate for prior discrimination could undo substantial
progress made over the past half century in the area of civil rights. His
disparaging views of a constitutional right to privacy could lead to a marked
preference for the rights of the State over the rights of individuals.

        Based on his abysmal record as chair of the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, NEA opposed Thomas's nomination to the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1990. His record, his writings, and his
rulings offer no basis to reverse that opposition. Therefore, NEA opposes the
nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.

Disdain for the Rule of Law

        In July 1989, 14 key Congressional committee chairs and members who
had long experience working with him as EEOC chair, wrote to President Bush
urging him not to nominate Thomas to the U.S. Court of Appeals, concluding that
he has "an overall disdain for the rule of law."

        Thomas has exhibited that disdain time and again throughout his career.
Thomas demonstrated a contempt for Congressional authority in his tenure at the
EEOC, both in his defiance of its oversight and his praise of Oliver North - who
also claimed a higher authority than the law. Noted Thomas in a 1987 speech
before the Cato Institute: "as Ollie North made it perfectly clear last summer, it is
Congress that is out of control."
                                       992

        Thomas showed blatant disregard for judicial authority while at the
Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, as NEA knows through first-hand
experience.

        NEA was one of the parties to litigation, WEAL and Adams v. Bell, in which
various organizations sued the federal government over its failure to process civil
rights complaints against educational institutions in a timely fashion. Initiated in
1970, the lawsuit charged that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
engaged in a "deliberate policy of nonenforcement" of Title VI, which prohibits
racial discrimination. The suit was later expanded to include challenges to the
nonenforcement of discrimination on the basis of gender (Title IX) and disability
(section 504) and to add the Departments of Education and Labor as defendants.

        In 1977, the Carter Administration settled the lawsuit by agreeing to a
consent order that established specific timelines for processing civil rights
complaints. In 1982, while Thomas was head of the Department of Education's
Office of Civil Rights, the Reagan Administration asked the court to vacate the
order.

        At a hearing conducted to investigate the Department of Education's failure
to meet the court-established timelines in processing and enforcing discrimination
claims, Thomas was asked, "So arent you, in effect, substituting your judgment
as to what the policy should be for what the court order requires?" Thomas
answered, "That's right."

        Even the Reagan Justice Department, which had sought to vacate the
order, took steps to urge Thomas to expedite processing of discrimination claims,
and yet he took no action to rectify the situation.

Age Discrimination

        In 1988, the Government Accounting Office found that from one-half to
four-fifths of all discrimination charges filed with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission or state and local agencies were closed without full
investigations. Thomas first attempted to blame one of the regional offices, then
complained of insufficient funds, and finally dismissed the GAO report as a
"hatchet job."

        But the most blatant example of Thomas's insensitivity to equal rights
protection is his conduct, while at EEOC, on age discrimination claims. Thomas
allowed more than 13,000 age discrimination claims to lapse because of foot-
dragging on investigation. Even after Congress took action to extend the statute
of limitations, EEOC allowed those timelines to expire.

        Thomas's conduct during Congressional investigation into the matter
raises questions about his judgment and candor. In a hearing held in 1987 before
the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Thomas first reported that 78 age
discrimination cases had lapsed, even though the EEOC's own information
                                       993

revealed that more than 1,000 cases had lapsed. Eventually, the Senate Aging
Committee subpoenaed EEOC's records to find that 13,000 cases had been
allowed to expire.

         In a number of age discrimination cases on early retirement plans that
were, in fact, programs designed to coerce older workers into taking early
retirement, EEOC sided with the employer. In 1987, EEOC issued new rules that
shifted the burden of showing coercion to the employee and allowed employees
to waive rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act without
supervision by the EEOC.

         The National Council on Aging, in its statement opposing Thomas's
nomination to the Court of Appeals, stated "people cannot properly take an oath
to enforce certain laws and, once in office, work consistently to undermine them."

Experience

         Having served as an appellate judge since only February 1990, Thomas's
experience as a judge is extremely limited. More than half his professional career
has been as chair of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC),
where his tenure was marked by laxity of enforcement and blatant disregard for
statutory and regulatory law.

         Thomas's other experience includes a stint as assistant attorney general in
Missouri where he handled tax and finance matters. He worked for the Monsanto
chemical company in St. Louis for two years. In 1979, Thomas moved to
Washington, D.C., to serve as an aide to Sen. John Danforth (R-MO) on energy
and environmental matters. He joined the Reagan Administration in 1981 as
assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Education's civil rights division.
Shortly thereafter, he was named chair of the EEOC where he served for eight
years. In 1990, he was nominated and confirmed as a judge on the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia.

         On August 28, the American Bar Association, by a vote of 13-2, determined
Thomas "qualified" for the Supreme Court. Virtually all Supreme Court nominees
have been determined "well qualified," the highest ABA ranking; the two
dissenting votes for Thomas's nomination deemed him "not qualified."

         As longtime Supreme Court observer and former Solicitor General Erwin
Griswold has stated: This is a time when (President) Bush should have come up
with a first-class lawyer, of wide reputation and broad experience, whether white,
black, male or female. And that, it seems to me obvious, he did not do."

Affirmative Action

         Judge Thomas has expressed the strongest disapproval of any kind of
group remedies to discrimination, in particular affirmative action goals and
timetables adopted by public or private employers. As EEOC chair, he was in a

     56-273 0--93-
                                       994

unique position to implement goals and timetables to remedy previous
discrimination. Instead, Thomas prevented the adoption of these necessary
steps.

        Thomas argued that goals and timetables had been rendered unlawful by
the 1984 Supreme Court decision in Firefighters v. Stotts. 467 U.S. 561 (1984). In
1985, he ordered EEOC regional attorneys not to seek such remedies in
proposed settlements. However, after the Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that such
remedies were lawful, and when pressed by members of the Senate at his
reconfirmation hearings, Thomas promised to reinstate the policy.

        Thomas's views on affirmative action are articulated in a 1987 article in the
Yale Law and Policy Review where he advocates pursuing individual
discrimination cases that seek as a remedy hiring, reinstatement, back pay,
and/or fines and other penalties for discriminatory employers as an alternative to
affirmative action goals. In the article he states, "I continue to believe that
distributing opportunities on the basis of race or gender, whoever the
beneficiaries, turns the law against employment discrimination on its head."

        Moreover, Thomas attempted to revise the Uniform Guidelines on
Employee Selection Procedures, which had been in use since 1978 to help
employers comply with federal antidiscrimination laws. Thomas was not
successful in efforts to dismantle the Guidelines - against resistance of
employers, the civil rights community, and even the Reagan Administration -- but
he continued to discourage EEOC enforcement of them.

        Employers, the Congress, and federal courts, including the Supreme
Court, have maintained that affirmative action goals are still an effective means of
addressing the employment discrimination. While individual discrimination cases
must be advanced, employment discrimination remains far too pervasive an
element of American society to be pursued solely on a case-by-case basis.

Church and State

        Thomas has given strong indication that he does not hold with a strict
definition of the First Amendment requirement for a separation of church and
state. Speaking before the Heritage Foundation in 1985, Thomas said, "My
mother says that when they took God out of the schools, the schools went to hell.
She may be right. Religion is certainly a source of positive values, and we need
as many positive values in the schools as we can get."

        In various writings, Thomas has bemoaned the absence of a religious
element in education and in the law. Any person who characterizes the Supreme
Court ruling on prayer and religious instruction in public schools as "taking God
out of the schools" is likely to look favorably on efforts to restore sectarian
elements in public education.
                                       995

        Moreover, Thomas has expressed support for tuition tax credits and
school vouchers that would provide unconstitutional public funding of religious
instruction and worship. In a 1980 profile in the Washington Post, Thomas
expressed support for vouchers and was quoted as saying that he sends his son
to a private school because "the public schools don't educate people -- they teach
them they can get by without working." In a 1984 interview in the Washington
Times, Thomas was asked his opinion on President Reagan's tuition tax credit
proposals. Thomas said, "I think it's excellent...They can send their kids to a
parochial school for several hundred dollars a year and they can get a tax break
of a few hundred bucks. Take it!"

        In other words, Thomas has not hesitated to assert that public funding of
sectarian schools would be legal under the Constitution.

Privacy Rights

        For many years, Thomas has held that the Supreme Court "invented" the
right to privacy in Griswold v. Connecticut through a misleading interpretation of
the Ninth Amendment ('The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights,
shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.").

        Perhaps his strongest statement against reproductive freedom itself was
an endorsement of the argument advanced by Lewis Lehrman in an 1987 article
published in the American Spectator. Lehrman asserted that because the
Declaration of Independence assures the right to life, abortion must be
constitutionally prohibited.

        Said Thomas, speaking before the Heritage Foundation, "Lewis Lehrman's
recent essay...on the Declaration of Independence and the meaning of the right to
life is a splendid example of applying natural law."

"Natural Law"

        It has been 80 years since natural law-universal moral principles that are
external to the text of the Constitution-was relied on as an authority by the
Supreme Court. It was cited as an argument supporting the economic rights of
employers to be free of minimum wage laws and health and safety regulations. In
1873, the Court denied women the right to practice law on the grounds that the
"paramount destiny and mission of woman is to fulfill the noble and benign offices
of wife and mother. That is the law of the Creator." (Bradwell v. Illinois. 83 U.S.
130 (1873))

        Thomas has argued in speeches and articles for a return to the authority of
natural law. In a speech before the Heritage Foundation in 1987, Thomas stated,
"The need to reexamine nature law is as current as last month's issue of Time on
ethics. Yet it is more venerable than St. Thomas Aquinas. It both transcends and
underlies time and place, race and custom. And, until recently, it has been an
integral part of the American political tradition."
                                       996

        On the other hand, according to Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law
School, "The philosophy that fundamental liberties are to be implied from one's
personal reading of religious sources and the Declaration of Independence
represents a departure from both liberal and conservative thought that has
characterized the past half-century."

        The value of living with the rule of law, a Western tradition going back to
King Hammurabi, circa 1750 B.C., is that the law is there for all to know.
Individuals should be guided by high moral principles, but a pluralistic society
cannot allow a particular religious doctrine to supplant or supersede
democratically established law.

The Doctrine of Stare Decisis

        Over the past 20 terms, the Court overruled 33 of its earlier constitutional
decisions - an average of 1.65 per term. In the 1990-91 term, the Court overruled
five precedents. Thurgood Marshall warned the nation, just hours before his
retirement, "The implications of this radical new exception to the doctrine of stare
decisis are staggering. The majority today sends a clear signal that scores of
established constitutional liberties are now ripe for consideration."

        Many court observers have noted that the Rehnquist Court will not hesitate
to reexamine the validity of earlier precedent. Indeed, recent Supreme Court
decisions indicate a willingness to "legislate from the bench," particularly in the
area of criminal law. Many fear that dramatic changes are possible in other areas
such as abortion, school prayer, affirmative action and free speech.

        Throughout his career, Thomas has given indications that he would be a
willing participant in efforts to overrule a broad array of critical decisions affecting
every aspect of our national life. Conservatism, in judicial terms, describes a
tendency to favor the rights of the state over the rights of individuals and to refrain
from acting on matters that are properly the province of legislative bodies.

        According to that standard, recent actions on the Court to overrule
precedents and to invite litigation that will address particular issues, such as rules
of evidence, abortion rights, and church-state issues, could be described as more
radical than conservative. Until now, the activist elements of the Court,
particularly Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia, have had
to moderate some of their ruling in order to gain a 5-4 or 6-3 ruling. With Thomas
on the bench, Rehnquist and Scalia would have greater leeway to make dramatic
reversals of established law, and go much further than they might with a more
moderate justice.

Separation of Powers

        The Constitution invests the Congress with the power To make all laws
which shall be necessary and proper..." And yet, with an activist Court and a
                                        997

trend on the Court to ignore legislative intent, the protections established by the
separation of powers is sharply eroded.

        In Thomas's short time in the federal judiciary, he has rejected the use of
speeches, committee reports, and other materials that would illuminate legislative
intent, relying instead on the Administration's interpretation as the final authority.
He has criticized the Congressional investigations into the EEOC handling of age
discrimination complaints as "overreaching" and praised Oliver North, who
violated laws prohibiting U.S. aid to Nicaraguan contras, saying that "North did a
most effective job of exposing congressional irresponsibility."

        This tendency to undermine Congressional authority is disturbing in itself,
but it is also inconsistent with Thomas's stated adherence to the principle of
"original intent," which interprets the Constitution on the basis of other writings by
the framers, i.e. their legislative intent.

Conclusion

        The Thomas nomination comes at a critical juncture in the direction of the
Supreme Court. No one expected President Bush to nominate an individual with
the stature or views of Thurgood Marshall. And, admittedly, a solid Reagan-Bush
appointed conservative majority on the Court has already demonstrated its
willingness and ability to change the direction of the Court - and the nation.

        The issue before the Senate in the nomination of Clarence Thomas is what
liberty will the Rehnquist Court feel it has to overturn cases dealing with such
essential issues as whether public school teachers are entitled to due process in
termination decisions or whether school employees can be fired for engaging in
free speech activities - such as criticizing the school administration, joining a
union, or belonging to a particular political party. Other questions are equally
pressing: can states spend grossly disproportionate amounts to educate children
in different school districts within a state? Can the government subsidize religious
worship and instruction in sectarian schools?

        Thomas's views on these questions raise serious doubts as to whether he
can be an impartial jurist and give primacy to stated law, rather than his personal
views. He has supported abolition of the minimum wage, claiming that it is "too
high for black teenagers." He led efforts at the EEOC to rule that federal law does
not require employers to give men and women equal pay for different jobs of
comparable worth, and agreed with the assertion of Thomas Sowed that women
tend to choose lower paying jobs. His advocacy of a case-by-case approach to
addressing employment discrimination is similar to the "all deliberate speed" that
has kept school integration a goal, rather than a reality, for almost 40 years.

        The President has appointment power, but the framers of the Constitution
gave the Senate confirmation power for a reason. The Senate should exercise its
authority to preserve a balance on the Court and vote against the confirmation of
Judge Thomas.

Hie National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW), the nation's oldest Jewish women's
organization, represents 100,000 volunteers In 300 communities. Our members are active in a
combined program of community service, education and advocacy serving the needs of women
and their families.

Last year, NCJW testified before the Judiciary Committee in opposition to the confirmation of
then-Judge David Souter, expressing our concern about the dangers of destroying the traditional
balance on the Court-a balance that had served to foster healthy and creative debate among the
Justices. This resulted in, for the most part, the protection of the constitutional rights and
individual liberties so vital to our democratic way of life.

Now, a year later, we return again to submit this written testimony explaining our opposition to
Judge Clarence Thomas' confirmation. The balance on the court has indeed shifted. Confirmation
by the Senate of Judge Thomas would tilt the scales so much further that we fear that our
constitutional rights would be seriously jeopardized.

Of all of the rights we prize, perhaps the most fragile is the fundamental right to privacy as it
relates to reproductive rights. Recent Supreme Court decisions, most notably in Rial v. Sullivan
nave indicated to us that the Court is on the brink of overturning Roe v. Wade and, perhaps,
rethinking other related cases. Therefore, Judge Thomas' writings opposing Rfifi and abortion
rights were alarming to us. Despite his efforts during the hearings to distance himself from his
past record on this issue and his incredible assertion that he has never discussed or formed an
opinion on Roe, we were not reassured that he would respect precedent in respect to these
rights. NCJW, as a strong advocate of women's reproductive rights, cannot take the risk of
supporting a nominee with a record which repudiates these crucial rights.

With regard to other rights, during Judge Thomas' eight-year tenure as Chair of the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, there was extensive erosion of anti-discrimination
protection, especially in the area of age discrimination. NCJW has a long history of community
service and advocacy on behalf of the aging ranging from its pioneering Golden Age Clubs,
launched in 1946, to its current work with employers in the area of eldercare. Given this on-going
concern, NCJW is deeply distressed that, under Judge Thomas's Chairmanship, 13,000 aging
discrimination claims were allowed to lapse. During that same period, inaction on the part of the
EEOC in the area of pension accruals cost elderly employees millions in benefits per year.

In addition to this, Judge Thomas' opposition to affirmative action in both word and deed as
EEOC Chairman call into question his willingness to continue efforts the Supreme Court has
made to eliminate and compensate for discrimination. We were not reassured by his testimony
before the Committee which did little to explain his past actions at the EEOC or elucidate his
views on affirmative action.

We are grateful to the Committee for the opportunity to share this explanation of the National
Council of Jewish Women's opposition to the confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas.

Hon. Joseph Biden, Jr.
Chair
Senate Judiciary Committee
SR-221
Washington, D.C. 20510

Dear Senator Biden:

        At the suggestion of Committee counsel, I am writing
to oppose the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas as an
Associate Justice to the United States Supreme Court and
to oppose the Judiciary Committee's forwarding this
nomination to the Senate.

        There are a number of reasons to reject Judge
Thomas's nomination to the Supreme Court. I would like
to focus only on a few of the more salient ones.

        Although Judge Thomas said he believed in a right to
privacy, he did not explain what he believed a right to
privacy encompasses. The right to privacy is a
fundamental right of all Americans. It protects people
from forced sterilization (Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S.
535 (1942)), assures that married and unmarried couples
can use contraception (Griswold v. Connecticut. 381 U.S.
479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird. 405 U.S. 438 (1972)),
and guarantees a woman's right to choice (Roe v. Wade.
410 U.S. 113 (1973)). The right to privacy creates a
zone of personal freedom surrounding such personal
decisions as child bearing and protects individuals from
governmental and political interference with those
decisions. If Judge Thomas had said he would not protect
that right, that alone would have been grounds for
rejecting him. His failure to answer clearly merits the
same response.

        Judge Thomas refused to state his view, or even his
understanding, of Roe v. Wade. He claimed that would be
inappropriate since cases concerning abortion will come

before the Court. So will the death penalty, religion
and the state, and other subjects, which the Judge
discussed in considerable detail.

        Further, Judge Thomas asserted that he has not
thought about or had conversations about Roe v. Wade in
the past eighteen years. This statement is incredible.
Moreover, Judge Thomas has referred to Roe v. Wade on
several occasions. A justice of the Supreme Court should
have the highest integrity. Judge Thomas's lack of
candor is insulting to the Committee and to the American
people, and provides sufficient grounds to reject his
nomination.

        Forwarding this nomination to the Senate creates an
unfortunate precedent. Future nominees will know that
there are no consequences if they are silent or -vasive
about such fundamental issues as the right to privacy.
The American people, and the Senate, have a right to know
the answers to a nominee's views on central
constitutional questions, as well as issues relating to
character, intellect, financial probity and personal
integrity.

        I appreciate the opportunity to share these views
with you.

serve the regime. Mere it not so, judges could have
long ago awarded damages in effective deterrent amount
against one or two major age discriminators, but they
did n o t . He also know froiii the personal e x p e r i e n c e of
several of our registrants that judges who appear to be
sympathetic to the plight of age discrimination victims
are simply not a s s i g n e d &ny m o r e age d i s c r i m i n a t i o n
c a s e s . It d o e s n ' t m a t t e r m u c h , r e a l l y , b e c a u s e any p r o -
victim decision, judgment or order is sure to be over-
turned by appellate patronage judges, whicn brings us
to the nominee at hand. Having bared his teetn on
numerous occasions on the public record, his patrons
can now trust him to uphold the absolute right of age
discriminators to violate the civil and human rights
laws witn impunity.

Since patronage nominees are politically selected and
utilized, it is not only proper but imperative to ask
them the most probing and specific questions on issues
that will or may come before the Supreme Court, although
here we sh'ould make an exception because Clarence
Thomas's age discrimination record is only too well
known to the nation and mankind from his chairmanship
at the counterproductive U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission. Others have and will detail tne chamber of
horrors into which the nominee converted the EtOC and
the 145 state and local agencies EEOC finances to
emotionally batter and to discourage the few complaining
victims from pursueing their c a s e s . In his opposition
to the Thomas nomination, Congressman Edward Roybal,
chair of the House Select Committee on Aging, summarized
the nominee's misdeeds just in the field of age discri-
mination, under five headings:

1.Judge Thomas allowed thousands of age discrimination
   complaints to expire and to run afoul of the statute
   of 1i mitati o n s ;

2.Judge Thomas issued unsupervised waiver regulations
   to enable age violators to coerce or to trick older
   workers into signing away tneir basic rights and
   nominal protections under the Age Discrimination in
   Employment Act of 1967;

   forced early retirement programs that were age discrimi-
   natory; and

5.Judge Thomas supported the use of age limits in appren-
   ticeship and job training programs that exclude older workers,

Detached viewers could say tndt Clarence Tnomas was the
answer to tne prayers of human rignts violators, and he
was. But those prayers were directed to Reagan and Bush and
not to heavens. Verbal contortions, pretenses and mendacity
n o t w i t h s t a n d i n g , we hope it is o b v i o u s to all that Thomas
is a Big Business front man serving his masters for a patronage
judgeship. The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, Inc.,
study (N.Y.Times, 8/14/91 p.A14) even pinpoints wnen ne
became this way: in 19&6, when he began assailing Supreme
Court decisions upholding affirmative action. Tnus he
sealed his Faustian bargain with the Reagan regime.

Of all his achievements in protecting and encouraging civil
and human rights violators, Supreme Court nominee Clarence
Thomas has achieved greater results in age discrimination
than in any other f i e l d , becduse that is by far tne most
profitable of all forms of job discrimination. You cannot
replace a alack or Hispanic or woman by a comparably quali-
fied white male at half pay. But you can replace a 50 or
60-year old managerial or professional employee with a young-
ster at naif as much pay and less than half as costly

frankly, he is a hypocrite who is selling himself as a
racism victim to cover for nis " c o n s e r v a t i v e " misdeeas in
violating the civil rights laws he swore to enforce. Directly
and indirectly, Thomas is responsiole for an estimated 10
million victimizations by age discrimination alone.

Since everybody in tnis room knows everything that I have
said so far, only decorum prevents me from calling these
hearings a charade. On second thought some people take
offense when someone belabors the obvious.

At the risk of restating the obvious, it is essential to
defeat not only Thomas but also the wnole farm system of
future judges and politicians subservient to the human rights
v i o l a t o r s and e x p l o i t e r s of t h e A m e r i c a n p e o p l e . It is
true that the President has the right to nominate anyone ne
c h o o s e s but it is e q u a l l y true that the S e n a t e nas the
obligation to confirm only sucn nominees as will serve tne
public interest, not just the wealthy and the powerful.
With Thurgood Marshall gone, we now have eight injustices
just on the Supreme Court, and we cannot afford another
injustice. We expect tne Senate to muster the courage to
send Judge Thomas to join Juage Robert liork. We believe
firmly that the Supreme Court needs to be purged of conser-
vatives, not packed further with tne likes of Clarence
Thomas.

And nere is another thing to c o n s i d e r . So far the Bush
regime has vetoed 21 pieces of major social legislation,
that were not overridden. For this, we believe the Senate
owes Bush a rejection and should bend Judge Thomas scurrying
to join Judge Robert Bork.

As for America's age victims, our claims are fully documen-
ted beyond dispute in the Social Security database and
should not require litigation in pacronage courts. The
monies taken from us illegally and wrongfully have Deen

retained earnings accounts together with profit and interest
tney earned on our m o n e y , and thus available immediately
for the payment of r e p a r a t i o n s at no p u b l i c e x p e n s e . In
contrast to Willy Lohman, we will not relent nor rest until
we collect our due. Thank you.

    TESTIMONY BEFORE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OF THE UNITED STATES
SENATE IN OPPOSITION TO THE CONFIRMATION OF CLARENCE THOMAS

   AS ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
          BY THE ASIAN AMERICAN LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND

INTRODUCTION

         The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund (AALDEF),
founded in 1974, protects the rights of Asian Americans through
impact litigation, legal advocacy, and community education.
Current priorities include voting rights, anti-Asian violence,
immigrants' rights, employment/labor rights, and redress for
Japanese Americans incarcerated during World War II. AALDEF
conducts year-round student internship training and counsels
thousands of Asian Americans each year at free legal advice
clinics.

         Based on an analysis of Clarence Thomas's writings, court
decisions (as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit), and record at two administrative agencies
(Chairperson at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from
1982 to 1990 and Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the
Department of Education from 1981 to 1982), AALDEF finds that the
interests of the Asian American community will not be served by his
confirmation as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the
United States, and therefore respectfully requests that this
Committee and the entire Senate vote to deny his confirmation.

THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY

         The 1990 census shows over seven million Asian Americans
living in the United States, with a variety of occupations and
lifestyles as widely different as the language, culture, diet and
other differences they bring from their homelands (where their
relatives constitute almost two-thirds of the world's total
population). More than 20 Asian and Pacific Islander subgroups
were identified in the 1990 census, compared to just five in 1970,
when they were broken out of the "other" category for the first
time. Also significant is that just 1.5 million Asian Americans
were reported by the census in 1970, so there has been more than a
400 percent increase in population in just twenty years. Looking
towards the future, while Asian Americans represent only three
percent of the United States population today, by the year 2000,
projections show them representing almost four percent of the U.S.
population, or 9.9 million. By the year 2050, the Population
Reference Bureau estimates that they will represent 6.4 percent of
Americans-- the same proportion that Hispanics represented in 1980.

        Asian Americans, like all people, suffer from poverty,
substance abuse, homelessness, mental illness, domestic violence,
and other problems. Unfounded media misperceptions about their
                1007

                AALDEF TESTIMONY ON JUDGE THOMAS, page 3

wealth, education and opportunities, however, have created the twin
problems of inter-minority group resentment and denial of access to
needed social services, which disproportionately affect the Asian
American poor. In times of economic contraction, like those we see
today, resentment and racial hostility frequently flares up into
physical violence, and denial of access to needed resources becomes
a sentence of death or unending misery to those already on the
brink of disaster.

         1990 census figures indicate that the poverty rate for all
Asian Americans is between 14 and 17 percent, double that of the
eight percent figure for non-Hispanic whites. Compounding the
difficulties of the poorest Asian Americans are problems that also
plague the poor of other communities: 1) racially-motivated
violence at the hands of individual bigots, youth gangs, and
insensitive police officers; 2) harassment by immigration officials
based on appearance or accent, even if legal papers are in order;
and 3) for the many who become naturalized Americans,
disenfranchisement based on lack of bilingual ballots or
redistricting processes that include little or no Asian Pacific
American representation.

While individual Asian Americans have been part of the

American scene since the mid-1700's, most scholars view the large

influx of Chinese gold miners to California after 1848 as the

beginning of today's Asian American community. In successive

waves, shaped by restrictive immigration laws, market forces, the

needs of individual laborers, and other factors, large Chinese,

Japanese, and Filipino communities were formed on the West Coast,

and smaller communities of Indian, Korean and other immigrants were

also present.   Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian and other

communities are more recent in derivation, coming to these shores

as a result of refugee policies stemming from the Vietnam War and

its aftermath.

         For reasons beyond the scope of this testimony, Asian
Americans have suffered from institutional and individual
discrimination from the time we arrived here until the present day.
For example, discriminatory laws, such as the federal Chinese
Exclusion Act of 1882, were passed on federal, state and local
levels soon after the first large wave of immigration in the late
1840's and early 1850's. A half century later, in 1942, the
federal government participated in the mass removal and detention
of all mainland Japanese Americans, a civil liberties nightmare
that was not remedied until a successful redress movement in the
late 1980's resulted in passage of appropriate remedial legislation
and individual money damage awards to former internees.
The California Foreign Miner's Tax of 1850 and Alien Land Law of
1913 restricted employment opportunities and land ownership
opportunities, respectively. Similar laws were passed in most
                                    1008

                                           AALDEF TESTIMONY ON JUDGE THOMAS, page 4

 Western states. San Francisco, like other West Coast cities,
 passed a number of oppressive ordinances, such as those aimed at
 Chinese laundries in the 1850's. These were challenged in Yick Wo
 versus Hopkins (1886) and other landmark Supreme Court vindications
 of equal protection rights for all Americans. After 1965, when
 immigration law changes brought in both more professional and more
 unskilled Asian Pacific Americans, the discrimination suffered by
 all Asian Pacific Americans took on new forms. Physical violence
 in response to perceived economic threats continued unabated.
 Burning of Chinatowns, lynchings, massacres and other brutalities
 were well-documented realities of nineteenth and early twentieth
 century American life. Recent pistol-whippings, baseball bat
 clubbings, and shots fired by the Klan at Vietnamese fishermen in
 the Gulf of Mexico continue the American tradition of beating up
 Asians in times of economic downturns.

 CLARENCE THOMAS'S NEGATIVE IMPACT
 ON THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY

          Confirmation of Clarence Thomas as Associate Justice on the
 Supreme Court of the United States will negatively impact Asian
^Americans in three ways: 1) denial of access to affirmative action
 and other equal justice remedies won by the civil rights movement
 over the years, 2) denial of access to privacy rights and
 abortions, and 3) creation of a false spokesperson for the legal
 needs of people of color in this country. Each of these three
 impacts will be explored individually.

         Despite the fact that he is himself African American, Judge
 Thomas has proven by his words and actions in public life that he
 is no friend of affirmative action and other equal justice remedies
 won by the civil rights movement, including Asian Americans, over
 the years. When he served as Chairperson of the Equal Employment
 Opportunity Commission from 1982 to 1990, Thomas refused to
 litigate class-based, industry-wide cases of discrimination, which
 had proved to be a more effective tool for ending discrimination
 than waiting for individual complainants. He also let 13,000 age
 discrimination claims expire by not processing them before the end
 of a two-year statute of limitations. Only special Congressional
 legislation saved those claims, which is why the National Council
 of Senior Citizens, the Older Women's League, and similar groups
 oppose his candidacy. In addition, a General Accounting Office
 investigation in 1988 found that the EEOC had refused to
 aggressively follow its mandate by allowing from 40 to 87 percent
 of its cases to close due to lack of investigation.

         While benefitting from affirmative action himself at schools
 such as Yale Law School and jobs such as the Chairpersonship of the
 EEOC, Judge Thomas wants to close the door of opportunity behind
                                   1009

                                          AALDEF TESTIMONY ON JUDGE THOMAS, page 5

him. While he acknowledges that racial barriers persist in this
country, he refuses to support the one policy that has led to real
change in education, employment, and other arenas. He believes
that race should not be a factor in interpreting the "color-blind"
Constitution, but fails to suggest alternate ways to overcome the
effects of past and continuing discrimination such as that suffered
by Asian Americans.

         In the area of abortion rights, privacy rights and family
issues. Judge Thomas maintains that natural law and the Declaration
of Independence inform the interpretation of Constitutional rights.
He has maintained that natural law protects the unborn and usurps
the woman's right to choose an abortion to terminate a pregnancy.
These views, when extrapolated, can be seen in the 1987 report of
President Reagan's Working Group on the Family, of which Judge
Thomas was a member. The report called for traditional nuclear
families, divorce that is harder to obtain, restriction of teen
sexuality, and encouragement of women staying home to care for
children. This moralism and imposition of one set of values on all
people was mirrored in Thomas's article in a book assessing the
Reagan years, where he expressed unease even about Griswold versus
Connecticut. the pathbreaking 1965 decision that gave married
couples the right to obtain legal contraceptives.

         Judge Thomas' s views are of concern to Asian Americans for two
reasons. First, the imposition of natural law and moralistic
rationalizations for laws have been at the heart of anti-Asian
American and other xenophobic sentiments for 150 years.
Restrictions on our ability to immigrate to this country and our
ability to live where and how we chose were rationalized because we
were considered dirty or less than human. It was not "natural" to
look like us, worship our non-Christian gods, or eat our Asian-
derived foods. Second, the right to an abortion has given Asian
American women the freedom to plan their family lives and, when
necessary, make the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy.
Overturning Roe versus Wade. which Judge Thomas almost certainly
will vote to do if elevated to the High Court, will be a major set-
back for these women.

        Aside from having concerns about his views on legal issues,
Asian Americans have deep concerns about Judge Thomas's candidacy
because of the fact that, if he ascends to the High Court, he will
become the highest ranking judicial spokesperson for all people of
color in this country the way Justice Thurgood Marshall was over
the last several decades. Through lectures, articles, and court
decisions, he most certainly will undermine affirmative action and
other programs that have opened the door to opportunity in this
country, and will provide the appearance of African American and
other minority community support for the regressive opinions the
High Court is certain to write on the rights of criminal

defendants, employees facing discrimination, and women seeking
abortions.

CONCLUSION

         As an organization devoted to the rights of Asian Americans,
it is very difficult for us to express reservations about a fellow
person of color. The Supreme Court most certainly needs the
insights that a jurist of color could bring to it and, because
President Bush seems to be embracing affirmative action in his
decision to nominate a candidate of African American ancestry, his
next candidate should be another of the thousands of experienced
African American lawyers and judges presently working in this
country. However, to accept a person whose actions and views have
been and continue to be harmful to one's interests just because
that person is of a particular racial heritage is to be patronizing
and wrong. Judge Thomas has gotten where he has because he has
betrayed the interests of Asian Americans and other people of
color, so to honor him by this elevated post is to dishonor others
who continue to struggle for the privileges Judge Thomas now
enjoys.

         On behalf of the Asian American community, therefore, AALDEF
respectfully recommends that the Judiciary Committee and full
Senate vote to reject the nomination of Judge Thomas to serve as an
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Thank
you for this opportunity to address you.

 Iruin J. Askow                          THE RECORD OF JUDGE CLARENCE THOMAS
 Stuart Bernstein
 G*orgt T. Bogert        1. Civil Rights.
 John N. Boley
 Nelson A. Broun, Jr.             Judge Thomas1 record in seven and one-half years
 Fay Clayton             as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunities
 Shawn N. Collina        Commission (EEOC) and his views expressed in numerous
 Leon N. Onpraa          speeches and articles demonstrate an extreme hostility
 Al«x Elson              to civil rights laws and the remedies to correct
 Prof. Dabra Evenaon     discrimination based on race, sex, age and
 Prof. Diane Geraghty    disabilities. His record is replete with his stated
 Prof. Elmer Gertz       position, and action as head of the EEOC, in opposition
 Cheryl N. Graves        to affirmative action, minority set-asides, goals and
 Suaan R. Gzesh          time tables. He has opposed the use of statistical
 Prof. Cheryl I. Harris  proof as evidence of discrimination. Dr. William F.
 John G. Jacob*          Gibson, chairman of the National Board of Directors of
 Robert E. Lehrer        the NAACP has stated that "it is particularly
 Rotlyn C. Lieb          disturbing that one who has himself so benefitted from
 Jerome B. Meitea        affirmative action now denigrates it and would deny
 Paula J. Norency        these opportunities to other Blacks." Arthur Kropp,
 Roger Pascal            president of -he People for the American Way Action
 Alexander Polikoff      Fund has stated that their evaluation and review of
 N. NeviUe Reid          Judge Thomas' record shows "a man with a singular
 Edwin A. RothschiId     disrespect for the rule of law, an apparent
 Lowell E. Sachnoff      indifference to fundamental civil liberties, contempt
 Edward T. Stein         for Congress and the judiciary and a painfully cramped
                         view of government's role in repairing the damage of
                         discrimination." While Judge Thomas was chairman of
                         the EEOC, the commission failed to act on more than
                         13,000 cases charging violations of the Age
                         Discrimination in Employment Act. Judge Thomas was
                         less than candid in admitting this lapse. When Judge
                         Thomas was nominated for the Court of Appeals for the
                         District of Columbia, fourteen members of Congress who
                         had served on committees with oversight
                         responsibilities for the EEOC wrote to President Bush,
                         asking that Judge Thomas not be nominated to the
                         federal bench. The letter stated that Judge Thomas'
                         "questionable enforcement record" at the EEOC
                         "frustrates the intent and purpose" of the Civil Rights
                         Act of 1964. The letter further referred to Judge
                         Thomas' lack of candor in dealing with the oversight

                               -1-
                                1012

committees, and concluded that Judge Thomas "has demonstrated an
overall disdain for the rule of law." Judge Thomas has criticized
many of the leading Supreme Court cases upholding enforcement
remedies for violations of civil rights such as Green vs. County
Board of Education 391 U.S. 430 (1968) and what he called "a
disastrous series of cases [after Green 1 requiring busing and other
policies that were irrelevant to parents' concern for a decent
education."

         2. Civil Liberties.

         Based on his writings and speeches it is extremely doubtful
that Judge Thomas would recognize a constitutional right of
privacy. He has strongly criticized both Griswold vs. Connecticut.
381 U.S. 479 (1965) and Roe vs. Wade. 410 U.S. 113 (1973). He has
praised a speech by anti-abortion activist Lewis Lehrman that
states not only that Roe vs. Wade was wrongly decided and should be
overruled, but that abortion is in fact prohibited by the
Constitution and cannot be legally permitted by either Congress or
the states. Judge Thomas' position on abortion rights would appear
to be more restrictive than that of any present member of the
United States Supreme Court (See discussion under "Judicial
Philosophy" infra).

         Judge Thomas has also suggested disagreement with Supreme
Court decisions on school prayer. In the Fall 1985 issue of Policy
Review. Judge Thomas stated, in response to a question as to
whether he favored President Reagan's initiatives on school prayer,
that "as for prayer, my mother says that when they took God out of
the schools, the schools went to hell. She may be right. Religion
is certainly a source of positive values, and we need as many
positive values in the Constitution as we can get."

3. Judicial Philosophy.
         Judge Thomas has on many occasions expressed his belief in

natural law as a judicial philosophy. Constitutional law expert,
Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, has said that Judge
Thomas "is the first Supreme Court nominee in 50 years to maintain
that natural law should be readily consulted in constitutional
interpretation." Commenting on Judge Thomas' belief in natural law
as appropriate in constitutional interpretation, Geoffrey Stone,
dean of the University of Chicago Law School said "I think, in all
candor, he fairly could be labeled strange... not in terms of right
or wrong, but in being further outside the mainstream of
constitutional interpretation than Bork is." Judge Thomas has
praised as a "splendid example of applying natural law" the
argument by Lewis Lehrman that abortion violates the "right to
life" guaranteed by the law of God in the Declaration of
Independence and therefore is not permitted by the Constitution.

         Judge Thomas has a record of challenging congressional
authority both as chairman of the EEOC and as director of the

                                                          -2-
                                1013

Office of Civil Rights (OCR) at the Department of Education. (See
discussion under "Civil Rights" supra.) He has admitted violating
a court order in the Adams vs. Bell litigation while he was
director of the OCR. The order directed the Department of
Education to speed up enforcement action on complaints of
discrimination.

4. Legal Qualifications and Experience.

         Judge Thomas has very little experience as a practicing
attorney and less than a year and one-half as a Federal Court of
Appeals judge. Professor Derrick Bell of Harvard Law School called
President Bush's claim that Judge Thomas was "the bast person for
the job on the merits" laughable. Congressman John Conyers of
Michigan, a leader of the Black Caucus, listed five black Federal
Court of Appeals judges that he said were more experienced and
better qualified. Twenty-four of the 25 members of the Black
Caucus have voted to oppose the confirmation of Judge Thomas. With
respect to the appointment, former Harvard Law School Dean and
former Solicitor General of the United States Erwin Griswold (who
has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other
person) recently said: "this is a time when [President] Bush
should have come up with a first-class lawyer, of wide reputation
and broad experience, whether white, black, male or female. And
that, it seems to me obvious, he did not do."

         When Judge Thomas was nominated for the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia, the American Bar Association Judicial
Evaluation Committee gave him its lowest approval rating--
"qualified." He did not receive the highest rating of "well
qualified." The committee has recently released its report on its
evaluation of Judge Thomas as a nominee to sit as an Associate
Justice of the United States Supreme Court. A majority of the
committee found Judge Thomas "qualified" and two members found him
"not qualified." No member of the committee found him to be "well
qualified." A New York Times story commented on this lukewarm
endorsement by noting that "of the last nine justices confirmed
going back to 1969, there were no votes of unqualified." The last
two Supreme Court Justices confirmed, Justices Anthony Kennedy and
David Souter, received unanimous "well qualified" ratings from the
committee. It would seem clear that persons proposed for the
Supreme Court should receive the highest rating of
"well qualified."

5. Character

         While Judge Thomas' rise from poverty is admirable and should
give him a perspective and experience which would be an asset on
the Supreme Court, it does not make him qualified to be an
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court at this time in view of his
record on constitutional issues involving civil rights and civil

                                                          -3-
                                 1014

liberties, his "natural law" judicial philosophy and his meager
legal experience as a lawyer and judge.

         There are also troubling questions raised by some of his past
actions and the Senate Judiciary Committee should question him
thoroughly on these. Judge Thomas failed to list one of his most
controversial articles in responding to the Department of Justice
questionnaire at the time the Senate was considering his nomination
to the Court of Appeals. The omitted writing was a chapter titled
"Civil Rights as a Principle Versus Civil Rights as an Interest" in
Assessing the Reagan Years, a book published by the Cato Institute
in 1988. In the article, Judge Thomas strongly criticizes the
Supreme Court's decisions approving affirmative action.

         Judge Thomas also failed to list in the questionnaire his
participation as a member of the 1986 White House Working Group on
the Family which issued a report stating, among other things, that
Roe vs. Wade and Planned Parenthood vs. Danforth 428 U.S. 52
(1976), holding invalid a Missouri law which provided that a
husband's consent was necessary before a woman could obtain an
abortion, were wrongly decided. Judge Thomas also failed to list
on the questionnaire the fact that he has served since 1981 as a
member of the Editorial Advisory Board of the Lincoln Review, a
conservative journal offering an African-American perspective on
public policy issues. The Lincoln Review has published anti-choice
articles opposing Roe vs. Wade during the time Judge Thomas has
been on the Editorial Advisory Board.

         As noted above ("Civil Rights" supra), Judge Thomas was not
candid and cooperative with the congressional oversight committees
seeking to ascertain the facts on alleged age discrimination claims
that had lapsed while Judge Thomas was chairman of the EEOC.
Initially, Judge Thomas claimed there were only 78 cases which had
expired. This figure was later revised upward to over 13,000 cases
in which the EEOC had permitted the statute of limitations to run.

                                                                                             August 30, 1991

                       TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THE NOMINATION OF THE HONORABLE
                          CLARENCE THOMAS TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

Tana* a. flnni         Judge CLARENCE THOMAS, presently sitting on the UNITED STATES
                       CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS for the District of Columbia, was born
WHoaM Ore*;            June 23, 1948, in Pin Point, Georgia, a small, at that time
  CMK Gatftn*          rundown, rural community South of Savannah, Georgia, in a house
                       without electricity or plumbing. His mother was then eighteen
MaJ Can. Jr., EM       (18) years old and was eking out a living by picking crabs for
                       five (5) cents a pound. Judge THOMAS1 father abandoned Judge
  C M «·*««. A M *     THOMAS, his mother, and his sister while his mother was pregnant
                       with a third child. The family then moved in with an aunt in a
                 PC    wooden shack surrounded by live oaks and water snakes. Judge
         , Nr» rant    THOMAS and his brother, MYER THOMAS, moved to Savannah, Georgia
         s./*<r rot    when the Judge was seven (7) years old. Though barely literate,
         aitaa*        their grandfather put together the money to send them to a local
         ill./*»!··»«  Catholic elementary school, where Judge THOMAS learned a
                       lifelong lesson of self-reliance and pride.

                       That lesson followed Judge THOMAS through seminary, college, and
                       law school, during which he was the victim of racial prejudice
                       and the recipient of, arguably, the rewards of reverse
                       discrimination. It is undenied that Judge THOMAS is a shining
                       example of someone who, despite racism and poverty, has
                       "bootstrapped" himself into the forefront of American legal
                       circles.

                       Those opposing the nomination of Judge THOMAS to the UNITED
                       STATES SUPREME COURT have cited a number of purported reasons
                       for their opposition.

                       One of those reasons is his claimed lack of sufficient legal
                       experience. I would point out that twenty-five (25) of the
                       forty-eight (48) Justices who have served on the UNITED STATES
                       SUPREME COURT since 1900 have arrived with little or no judicial
                       experience. LOUIS BRANDEIS, ABE FORTAS, and LEWIS POWELL had no
                       judicial experience at all. HUGO BLACK had almost no judicial
                       experience. FELIX FRANKFURTER was a high ranking government
                       bureaucrat. WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS was Chairman of the SECURITIES
                       AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. EARL WARREN had been the Governor of
                       the State of California. Yet, depending on your political
                       perspective, these are widely admired jurists.
                              1016

Judge THOMAS' nomination has also been opposed on the grounds that
he is, allegedly, nothing more than a "lackey" for white racists,
with the inference being that those white racists are embodied in
the administrations of Presidents REAGAN and BUSH. However, this
position ignores reality. Judge THOMAS, while head of the EQUAL
EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION, opposed attempts by the United
States Justice Department, under President REAGAN, to overturn
local Court-ordered quota plans. He criticized the White House for
supporting the tax-exempt status of a racially separatist
university. He fought to uphold civil rights laws so much that
there was talk of dumping him at the end of President REAGAN'S
first term. To quote DEBRA G. SAUNDERS, a columnist for the LOS
ANGELES DAILY NEWS, "Those who insinuate that Thomas has made a
career of slavish servitude to white oppressors are wrong: He has
been independent from all factions...but his views are not of the
mainstream. His views are too independent. He thinks for
himself."

Opposition to the nomination of Judge THOMAS has also been based
upon his refusal to discuss issues that may come before him sitting
as a Justice on the UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. However, to quote
United States Senator TED KENNEDY, "We will have to respect that
any nominee...will have to defer any comments on any matters which
are either before the Court or is very likely to appear before the
Court. This has been a procedure which has been followed in the
past and is one which I think is based on sound legal precedent."
Of course, those remarks were made by Senator KENNEDY during the
nomination hearings on UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT Justice THURGOOD
MARSHALL, a black liberal, whereas Judge THOMAS is a black
conservative.

The nomination of Judge THOMAS has also been opposed due to his
opposition to reverse discrimination in the form of racial quotas.
Such quotas are part of the "liberal agenda" to which opposition
is considered treason when that opposition is from a black or
hispanic. "Left-wing interest groups are uncomfortable with blacks
like Judge Thomas who refuse to bend the knee to the transient gods
of liberalism. They will attack his nomination and they will fail.
They will fail because this man's independence and refusal to stay
in his place on the Liberal Plantation will capture the hearts of
the American people." These, the words of RICHARD F. DUNCAN,
Professor of Constitutional Law at the UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA
COLLEGE OF LAW.

The opponents to Judge THOMAS have also claimed that he will be
nothing more than a follower of the so-called conservative bloc on
the UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. However, the record speaks
otherwise. While on the UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS,
Judge THOMAS joined with RUTH BADER GINSBURG seven (7) of seven
 (7) times in her opinions, PATRICIA WALD six (6) of six (6) times,
HARRY EDWARDS three (3) of three (3) times, and ABNER MIKVA five
 (5) of six (6) times. All of these were President CARTER'S
appointees. This hardly indicates that Judge THOMAS will "fall
into line" behind whatever the conservative Justices on the UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT desire.
                             1017

What appears to most gall those in opposition to the nomination of
Judge THOMAS is not that he is a conservative, but that he is a
black conservative! With the exception of Judge ROBERT BORK, who
became a "cause celebre" for the left, the nominees to the UNITED
STATES SUPREME COURT for the past eleven (11) years have "sailed"
through their nominations with little or no trouble. These
individuals have, without exception, been as conservative as, or
more conservative than. Judge THOMAS. Judge THOMAS flies in the
face of the liberal position that all blacks must blindly follow
the liberal agenda put forward by the ACLU, the NEW YORK TIMES,
etc., thereby destroying the liberal charade that all conservatives
are white males. According to Professor DUNCAN, "Thomas is a new
kind of a role model for young people from all racial backgrounds.
His message to these youngsters is: 'Don't look to government
preferences and handouts to solve your problem; look to self-
reliance, personal effort and equal opportunity as the best path
to success in contemporary America.'" However, of course, this
type of thinking, if widely promulgated, will destroy the welfare
state, reduce the need for the bureaucracy that supports it, reduce
the need for our ever-increasing burden of taxes, and result in the
destruction of the liberal mythology as to what is necessary to
"save" the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

According to BESTY HART of the HERITAGE FOUNDATION, "Thomas...will
challenge the 'moral monopoly1 the Left has exercised over blacks,
other minorities, and women. The monopoly views to classify people
according to their alleged group 'victimization' status and then
present each group as a monolith in its thinking. The problem for
the left is that Clarence Thomas stands to expose such follies."

Despite attacks by the liberal media, including the NEW YORK TIMES,
that Judge THOMAS is "out-of-step" with other black leaders
 concerning the issue of quotas and of reverse discrimination, he
 is in step with black leaders such as W.E.B. DuBOIS, BOOKER T.
WASHINGTON, T. THOMAS FORTUNE, and others who have emphasized the
need for blacks and other minorities to help themselves, as opposed
 to looking for handouts such as the liberal agenda would foster.

 Despite her apparent opposition to the nomination, CYNTHIA TUCKER,
Associate Editor of the ATLANTIC CONSTITUTION'S Editorial Pages
 said, "His qualifications are obvious. Though his politics during
 his tenure in the Reagan White House left much to be desired, there
 is nothing to suggest that his stewardship of the Equal Employment
 Opportunity Commission displayed incompetence. Nor is there
 evidence that he lacks the profound and learned grasp of the legal
 theory necessary to serve on the High Court. In scholarly
 articles, his reasoning is lucid and often persuasive."

 For these reasons, and more, I would urge you to join with GUIDO
 CALABRESI (Dean of the YALE LAW SCHOOL), the Compton, California
 branch of the NAACP, Georgia State Representative TYRONE BROOKS of
 Atlanta (State Director of JESSE JACKSON'S presidential campaigns) ,
 Georgia Labor Commissioner AL SCOTT (the highest ranging black in
 the Georgia State Executive Branch), ARTHUR A. FLETCHCR, chairman

                               Re: Professor Anita Hill

Dear Senator Biden:

                 I write to correct an unfair and false impression of
Professor Anita Hill's performance at the law firm of Wald,
Harkrader and Ross created by the affidavit of John Burke,
Esquire, a former Wald, Harkrader and Ross partner, filed with
the Committee on October 13, 1991.

                 During Professor Hill's tenure at Wald, Harkrader and
Ross in 1980-1981, I was chairman of the firm's Associate
Development Committee, which was responsible for associate
evaluation. I accordingly have direct knowledge of Professor
Hill's performance evaluation. On October 14, 1991, I learned
through inquiries from the press, that Senator Danforth had
released a statement to the effect that a former partner of Wald,
Harkrader and Ross had told the Committee on the Judiciary that
Professor Hill's performance had not been satisfactory and that
she had been asked to leave the firm. I immediately prepared and
sent to you my own affidavit which stated that Professor Hill's
performance at the firm had not been unsatisfactory, that she was
not asked to leave the firm, and that she had left of her own
volition to pursue an alternative professional path. I said that
my memory of the events was clear and that I had contacted the
other two members of the Associate Development Committee and they
concurred in my recollection. My interest in submitting the
affidavit was not to oppose the nomination of Judge Thomas but to
assure that in the Committee's consideration of the nomination

   Professor Hill received fair treatment. A copy of my affidavit
    is enclosed for your convenience.

                    At the time I submitted my affidavit, I had not seen
   the affidavit of Mr. Burke. I have now obtained a copy which I
   enclose. I have also had an opportunity to examine further the
   remaining files of Wald, Harkrader and Ross, which merged with my
   present firm in 1987.

                    The firm's records show that:

                     1) Contrary to Mr. Burke's affidavit,
                             there is no indication that
                             Professor Hill ever worked on any
                             legal matter with Mr. Burke or
                             under his direct or indirect
                             supervision or on assignment for
                             him.

                     2) Professor Hill did perform a brief
                             assignment for another partner more
                             senior to Mr. Burke in the field of
                             law in which Mr. Burke practices.
                             Professor Hill's work was favorably
                             reviewed by that partner.

                     3) There was another first-year
                             African-American woman associate
                             who did work with Mr. Burke during
                             the time described in his
                             affidavit, who was given an
                             unsatisfactory evaluation and who
                             was asked to seek other employment.

                    At the time set forth in his affidavit, Mr. Burke was a
   new, quite junior partner in the firm. My recollection is that
   he had joined the firm only two or three months before Professor
   Hill. He was not then, or at any time prior to his withdrawal
    from the firm in 1985, a member of the Associate Development
   Committee nor was he at any time given authority to act on the
    firm's behalf to terminate associates.

                     I consider Mr. Burke a friend and regret the necessity
   of disputing his affidavit. An effort has been made to bring the
    information from the firm's records to his attention. I hope
   that he will correct his affidavit but, in any event, I wanted
   the Committee to have this additional information. If you

Dear Senators,

I worked as a Special Assistant to Clarence Thomas at the EEOC from 1985 to 1986. I am
writing because I am amazed and outraged at the "fatherly ambience" that he is getting away with
projecting as an image of his office. Let me make it clear: I am not claiming that I was the
victim of sexual harassment.

Clarence Thomas pretends that his only behavior toward those who worked as his special
assistants was as a father to children, and a mentor to proteges. That simply isn't true. If ) ou
were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being
inspected and auditioned as a female. You knew when you were in favor because you were
always at his beck and call, being summoned constantly, tracked down wherever you were in the
agency and given special deference by others because of his interest. And you knew when you
had ceased to be an object of sexual interest -- because you were barred from entering his office
and treated as an outcast, or worse, a leper with whom contact was taboo. For my own part, I
found his attention unpleasant, sought a transfer, was told one "just doesn't do that," insisted
nonetheless and paid the price as an outcast for the remainder of my employment at EEOC.

I can understand why some of his special assistants are coming forward to his defense: he is the
most powerful black man they know and possibly, the most influential they will ever know. They
want to retain contact because they will need it to survive and to advance in a very tough world.
But the atmosphere of absolute sterile propriety permeated by loving, nurturing but asexual
concern is simply a lie. Women know when there are sexual dimensions to the attention they are
receiving. And there was never any doubt about that dimension in Clarence Thomas' office. I
have told all of this to Senate staff including the Chairman's staff in the weeks following the
nomination. But in light of the importance which both ambience (in his office) and credibility
have now assumed in these hearings, I felt obliged to communicate this in writing in order to put
this on the record publicly.

District of)

Sukari Hardnett, having been duly sworn, make the following
statement:

1. I worked as a Special Assistant to Clarence Thomas at the EEOC
from 1985 to 1986.

2. I am amazed and outraged at the "fatherly ambience" that he is
getting away with projecting as an image of his office.

3. I am not claiming that I was the victim of sexual harassment.

4. Clarence Thomas and those who have tested on his behalf would
have us believe that his only behavior toward those who worked as
his special assistants was as a father to children, and a mentor to
proteges. That simply isn't true.

5. If you were young, black, female, reasonably attractive and
worked directly for Clarence Thomas, you knew full well you were
being inspected and auditioned as a female.

6. You knew when you were in favor because you were always at his
beck and call, being summoned constantly, tracked down wherever you
were in the agency and given special deference by others because of
his interest.

7. You knew when you had ceased to be an object of sexual interest
-- because you were barred from entering his office and treated as
an outcast, or worse, a leper with whom contact was taboo.

8. For my own part, I found his attention unpleasant, sought a
transfer, was told one "just doesn't do that," insisted
nonetheless and paid the price as an outcast for the remainder of
my employment at EEOC. That is why I resigned and left the EEOC.

9. Statements made under oath by Clarence Thomas' staff were simply
untrue. They asserted I had been dismissed because of failure to
pass the bar. Untrue. They characterized my position as a kind of
law student internship. Untrue. I held the position of Special
Assistant and my desk was located in the Chairman's suite.

10. I believe I understand why some of his special assistants are
coming forward to his defense: he is the most powerful black man
they know and possibly, the most influential they will ever know.
They want to retain contact because they will need it to survive
and to advance in a very tough world.

11. But as respects the atmosphere of absolute propriety, they were
                                   1024

either totally unaware of the reality or they engaged in active
misrepresentation. It is certainly possible that some were in fact
accorded the genuine respect they described.

12. To maintain that Clarence Thomas' office was untainted by any
sexuality and permeated by loving, nurturing but asexual concern is
simply a lie.

13. Women know when there are sexual dimensions to the attention
they are receiving. And there was never any doubt about that
dimension in Clarence Thomas' office. I know it. Clarence Thomas
knows it. And I know he knows it because he discussed some of the
females in his office with me.

14. I have told all of this to Senate staff including the
Chairman's staff in the weeks following the nomination. In light of
the importance which both ambience (in his office) and credibility
have assumed, I felt obliged to communicate this in writing in
order to put this on the record publicly.
