    OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN STROM THURMOND

  The CHAIRMAN. The Judiciary Committee will come to order.
  It is a privilege to welcome each of you to the opening session of
the Committee on the Judiciary to consider the nomination of
Judge Sandra Day O'Connor of Arizona to serve as an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. This is truly a
historic occasion, as it is the first time in the history of our Nation
that a President has nominated a woman to serve on this august
body. Today we begin the consideration of this nomination.
  Under the Constitution, the Senate is charged with the responsi-
bility of deciding whether to grant consent to the nomination.
While the entire Senate will participate in the ultimate decision,
the members of this committee have an initial and solemn duty to
conduct an indepth inquiry into the qualifications of Judge O'Con-
nor.
  In response to the trust placed in this committee both by our
colleagues in the Senate and by the American people, we will
conduct this proceeding in a full, fair, and orderly manner. In a
spirit of nonpartisanship, we have made arrangements to receive
both the testimony of the nominee and that of many persons
representing the views of various constituencies.
  As we begin our deliberations, we are keenly aware that a Su-
preme Court appointment is unique, not only because it grants life
tenure but, more significantly, because it vests great power in an
individual not held accountable by popular election. Accordingly,
on behalf of the people it is our responsibility to reflect upon the
qualifications necessary for one to be an outstanding jurist. We
then must satisfy ourselves that this nominee possesses those quali-
fications.

                                                          (l)
  Many believe that the courts of our Nation, over the past dec-
ades, have lost the confidence of the American people. This, we are
told, results from far-reaching and sometimes burdensome deci-
sions which have affected virtually every aspect of our lives.

   As one of three coequal branches of our Federal Government, the
judiciary plays a crucial role in interpreting the Constitution and
in applying the laws of Congress. The ability of the Supreme Court
to carry out effectively these responsibilities depends upon the
perception of the people that the Court is worthy of such esteem. It
is absolutely essential that the President nominate and the Senate
confirm only individuals who will contribute to the restoration of
public confidence.

   We seek, first, a person of unquestioned integrity--honest, incor-
ruptible, and fair.

   We seek a person of courage--one who has the fortitude to stand
firm and render decisions based not on personal beliefs but, in-
stead, in accordance with the Constitution and the will of the
people as expressed in the laws of Congress.

   We seek a person learned in the law--for law in an advanced
civilization is the most expansive product of the human mind and
is, of necessity, extensive and complex.

   We seek a person of compassion--compassion which tempers
with mercy the judgment of the criminal, yet recognizes the sorrow
and suffering of the victim; compassion for the individual but also
compassion for society in its quest for the overriding goal of equal
justice under law.

   We seek a person of proper judicial temperament--one who will
never allow the pressures of the moment to overcome the compo-
sure and self-discipline of a well-ordered mind; one who will never
permit temper or temperament to impair judgment or demeanor.

   We seek a person who understands and appreciates the majesty
of our system of government--a person who understands that Fed-
eral law is changed by Congress, not by the Court; who under-
stands that the Constitution is changed by amendment, not by the
Court; and who understands that powers not expressly given to the
Federal Government by the Constitution are reserved to the States
and to the people, not to the Court.

   Judge O'Connor is the first nominee to the Supreme Court in 42
years who has served in a legislative body. It is my belief that her
experience as majority leader in the Arizona Senate will help her
and, through her, the other members of the Court in recognizing
and observing the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial
powers mandated by the Constitution.

  Judge O'Connor is also the first nominee to the Supreme Court
in the past 24 years who has served previously on a State court.
That experience gives us hope that she will bring to the Court, if
confirmed, a greater appreciation of the division of powers between
the Federal Government and the governments of the respective
States.

  Judge O'Connor, we welcome you to the committee and to the
Senate. I know you share our anticipation as we begin the process
which allows us the opportunity to renew the essence of the Ameri-
can experiment in government.
  Before calling upon the distinguished Attorney General for his
presentation of President Reagan's nominee, each member of the
committee will be recognized for brief opening remarks. The Chair
now recognizes the ranking minority member, Senator Joseph R.
Biden of Delaware, after which the other members of the commit-
tee will be recognized.

  Senator Biden?

    OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.

  Senator BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Welcome, Judge O'Connor, Senator Goldwater, Senator DeCon-
cini, Congressman Rudd.
  It is a very formidable task, I know, to sit there and react to the
varying views of the Senators on this committee. There is no other
committee in the U.S. Senate that reflects as widely and as thor-
oughly the views of the entire Senate. I wish you luck in your
forthcoming efforts to answer all the questions that will be put to
you.
  There is no more important responsibility for the Senators who
serve on this committee, in my opinion, Judge, than the one we
will exercise today--that is, reviewing the qualifications of a nomi-
nee for the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has a pro-
found impact on the shape of our Government and the well-being
of our people.
  Accordingly, I believe it is necessary at the outset of these hear-
ings on your nomination to define the nature and scope of our
responsibilities in the confirmation process, at least as I under-
stand them.
  First, as a Member of the U.S. Senate, I am not choosing a
nominee for the Court. That is the prerogative of the President of
the United States, and we Members of the U.S. Senate are simply
reviewing the decision that he has made.
  Second, our review, I believe, must operate within certain limits.
We are attempting to answer some of the following questions:
First, does the nominee have the intellectual capacity, competence,
and temperament to be a Supreme Court Justice? Second, is the
nominee of good moral character and free of conflict of interest
that would compromise her ability to faithfully and objectively
perform her role as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court? Third,
will the nominee faithfully uphold the laws and Constitution of the
United States of America?
  We are not attempting to determine whether or not the nominee
agrees with all of us on each and every pressing social or legal
issue of the day. Indeed, if that were the test no one would ever
pass by this committee, much less the full Senate.
  However, your views on social and legal issues and how these
views will offset your interpretation of the Constitution of the
United States are important. Indeed, in your case, Judge, I believe
it is essential that the committee in these hearings make a thor-
ough effort through intensive questioning on various issues, to
better determine your judicial philosophy--not necessarily your
precise position on an issue but what your philosophy of the law is.
  I say this because if there is one aspect of this nomination that
concerns me--and I must acknowledge it does not concern me very
much at this point--it is your lack of extensive constitutional
experience. Despite the intensive investigations into your back-
ground by the committee, both minority and majority, it is frankly
difficult to determine from your record your depth of understand-
ing and your precise views of American jurisprudence, and how
you will apply that if you sit as a Supreme Court Justice.

  It is my sincere hope that you will be able to demonstrate to us
in these hearings that you do possess this competence, and I be-
lieve that in every other respect you are on the record an impres-
sive nominee who is highly qualified to take a place on the Su-
preme Court of the United States.

  You may find yourself in the position, Judge, where you have to
make a determination of whether or not your response to a ques-
tion would be in violation of the judicial canons of ethics. They
seem, on their face, to preclude statements by nominees in any
areas of the law that they might rule on in the future. However,
for the purposes of legal scholarship and determinations of fitness
for office, it is obviously necessary for nominees to state their views
on matters of law and social policy.

  The danger a nominee faces in making statements is that at
some point in the future, a case that raises a particular issue may
be presented for a ruling and the judge would have to disqualify
herself based upon having prejudiced the issue in the past by
testifying to it before the Senate committee.

   However, I believe nominees should be required to answer all
questions except for those questions that would necessitate an opin-
ion as it applies to a specific set of facts that is likely to come
before the judge for decision. In other words, a nominee can speak
in general terms about the law but should not be forced to state
opinions on controversies likely to come before her, for example,
the constitutionality of a bill now pending before the U.S. Con-
gress.

  Therefore, you have a difficult task before you, one on which
there is a great deal of dictum, if you will, but not any firm
opinions. I wish you well in your effort to tread the path between
complying with your view of the judicial canons of ethics and being
forthright with this committee.

  Last, I would like to say that there has been a good deal of
discussion and there will be much more discussion about your
being the first woman nominee to the Supreme Court. I think
probably everyone in this body feels that it is high time and it is
long overdue.

  They often refer to the Senate as an exclusive club but there is
no more exclusive club in the world than the one that you are
attempting to join. There have been only 102 Supreme Court Jus-
tices during the history of this country, and I suspect that you will
be a very worthy addition to that, making it number 103.

   I welcome you again to the committee, look forward to hearing
your answers, and wish you luck.

  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Mathias of Maryland, the ranking ma-
jority member.
         OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES McC.
                                  MATHIAS, JR.

  Senator MATHIAS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The chairman of the committee has called this a historic occa-
sion. It surely is that. It is historic among other things because it
culminates the effort to insure that women have full citizenship in
this country.
  Just 334 years ago, in 1647, Margaret Brent was denied the right
to vote in the General Assembly of Maryland. She had all of the
legal qualifications except one--she was a woman, so she was
denied the right to vote. Now today, 334 years later, a woman will
attain the ultimate right to vote, the right to vote on the Supreme
Court of the United States.

  Of course, I would say to Judge O'Connor that Mrs. Brent made
one mistake in her attempt to get a vote. She thought she ought to
have two votes, one as a representative of Governor Leonard Cal-
vert's estate and one for herself: so I would learn from the lesson of
history and only seek at this time a single vote on the Court.

  However, I think it is important that we savor this moment
because it is a milestone in the history of the Court itself, and
there have been only a few of these moments. We should pause and
realize that we are at the end of an era and at the beginning of an
era. Sixteen years ago, President Johnson nominated Thurgood
Marshall to the Court, and that was clearly a similar moment.
President Johnson said on that occasion, "I believe it is the right
thing to do, the right time to do it, the right man and the right
place." By changing one word, I think that those words of Presi-
dent Johnson would be just as appropriate today.

  I think President Reagan has demonstrated great vision and a
fine sense of history in nominating Judge O'Connor for the seat
that Justice Potter Stewart has held with such distinction for such
a long time. Reference has been made here this morning to the fact
that she comes from the State courts. But, in that, she follows in
the footsteps of some of the most distinguished Justices who have
ever served on the Court--Justice Cardozo, Justice Holmes, Justice
Brennan--so she will serve in a good tradition.

  Shortly after Judge O'Connor was nominated, I had an opportu-
nity to meet with her and to discuss at length a variety of legal
issues. During that conversation, I got a clear sense that when she
is confirmed--I do not say if she is confirmed but when she is
confirmed--that she will come to the Court as an interpreter of the
law rather than as one who writes original law. That is a view with
which I wholeheartedly concur, and so I shall look forward to the
exchange between Judge O'Connor and the committee in these
hearings.

  I think it will be important to go beyond the symbolism which is
so obvious to all of us today and to get to know her as a person and
as a potential justice. I think consistent with our constitutional
responsibility to grant or deny consent to the President's nomina-
tion we must review Judge O'Connor's qualifications to sit in the
highest court in the land, and we will perform that duty, but I
have no doubt as to the outcome of these hearings.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
                                           6

  Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY

   Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I, too, want to welcome the nominee to this committee, and say
to Judge O'Conner that since the time that you recieved the Presi-
dent's endorsement, I think that you have seen both the worst of
this city and the best of it--the worst in being the target of some of
the single-issue constituencies who are going to urge your defeat,
and the best in the fact that you have had the strong and unyield-
ing support of a President of the United States, and strong biparti-
san support from Members of the U.S. Senate who have been
unflinching in support of your candidacy.

   As a matter of fact, I have finally found an issue on which I can
agree with Senator Goldwater. I am sure, as has been stated here,
that the outcome for your confirmation is well understood. Howev-
er, I am extremely pleased with President Reagan's decision to
nominate Judge O'Connor to the Supreme Court. I am proud to
join in the widespread acclaim for your nomination, and look for-
ward to your confirmation and to your service on the Court.

  As has been pointed out, for many years there have been women
with the highest qualifications for the Nation's highest Court.
Every American can take pride in President Reagan's commitment
to select such a woman for this critical office but the broad support
for Judge O'Connor in this hearing must not become a pretext to
ignore the need for greater representation of women, not only on
the Supreme Court but at every other level of the Federal judiciary
and Federal Government.

  Women hold less than 7 percent of all the Federal judgeships. In
two centuries of Federal judicial history, only 50 women have been
appointed to the lower Federal courts, and 44 of them are still
serving there today. In fact, 33 of them were approved by this
committee during the past Congress. All of us who care about this
issue look forward to the day when appointments to the Federal
bench and to the other high public offices will not stand out as an
historic event simply because the appointees are women.

  By some, Judge O'Connor has been termed a judicial conserv-
ative. However, simplistic labels are inadequate to define a com-
plex concept like judicial philosophy, let alone predict a vote in a
future case. What we seek in the Federal courts are judges who
will display legal excellence and personal integrity and sensitivity
to individual rights.

  It is offensive to suggest that a potential Justice of the Supreme
Court must pass some presumed test of judicial philosophy. It is
even more offensive to suggest that a potential Justice must pass
the litmus test of any single-issue interest group. The disturbing
tactics of division and distortion and discrimination practiced by
the extremists of the "New Right" have no place in these hearings
and no place in our Nation's democracy.

  I look forward to Judge O'Connor's testimony and her response
to the questions. Based on what I know today, I intend to support
her nomination. I take pride in the opportunity to participate in
these historic hearings.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Laxalt of Nevada.
         OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PAUL LAXALT

  Senator LAXALT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Chairman, it is with great pleasure that I join with you and
my colleagues in welcoming Judge Sandra O'Connor on this occa-
sion of her confirmation hearings.
  Although Judge O'Connor is no stranger to public life, she has
received the full glare of the national attention given to a nominee
for the U.S. Supreme Court, to say the least. In that spotlight, it is
apparent that she enjoys overwhelming popular support from the
varied and diverse people of our great Nation. This support must
be heartening as you prepare for what we will all appreciate might
be a necessarily grueling ordeal.
  Judge O'Connor brings to this office a wealth of experience in
the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of State govern-
ment. However, it is not on one issue or one political question that
the support of the American people is to turn. Rather, I think the
people have expressed their confidence in Judge O'Connor's legal
background, her professional record, and her personal abilities and
integrity. I think that is an important distinction to make. I think
you are here, Judge O'Connor, because you have been a fine judge
and you have been a fine lawyer ahead of that, not a political
activist.
  On this committee we have Senators representing the entire
spectrum of political thought in this country. However, we can all
agree that the person chosen to fill the current vacancy on our
Nation's Supreme Court must meet the highest standards of judi-
cial temperament and integrity.
  The purpose of these hearings is to inquire into these areas so
that we and the American people can be assured that this lifetime
appointment is filled by a person with the requisite character and
skill to meet the challenges the Court will face in the decades
ahead.
  Therefore, Judge O'Connor and your very justifiably proud
family, I welcome you to Washington and I look forward to the
opportunity to join in the questioning. I wish you well, not only in
the hours ahead but in the many distinguished years you will enjoy
on our highest Court.
   I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Byrd of West Virginia.
   I do not believe he is here.
   Senator Hatch of Utah.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ORRIN HATCH

   Senator HATCH. Judge O'Connor, we are very happy to have you
and your good husband here today. I am very pleased to support
President Reagan in your nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. I
am proud of a President who, whether you agree fully with his
campaign promises or not, is at least trying to live up to them, and
I think it is long overdue to have a woman on the Supreme Court
of the United States of America.

   Having spent over an hour with you and in other conversations
with you, I am convinced that you meet many of the highest
qualifications and standards that are essential to serve on the
Supreme Court of the United States of America. I look forward to
the questions and look forward to getting to know you better
throughout this process.

  Mr. Chairman, rather than take any more time, I would ask
unanimous consent that the balance of my remarks be placed in
the record at this point.

       OPENING STATEMENT FOR SANDRA O'CONNOR NOMINATION
                        SEPTEMBER 9, J981

        ARTICLE II, SECTION 2 OF THE CONSTITUTION STATES THAT THE
PRESIDENT "SHALL NOMINATE, AND BY AND WITH THE ADVICE AND CONSENT
OF THE SENATE, SHALL APPOINT . . . JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT."
ACCORDINGLY, WE SHARE WITH THE PRESIDENT THE VITAL CONSTITUTIONAL
FUNCTION OF SHAPING THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE.

        WE WOULD PROFIT BY RECALLING THE REASONS THE FRAMERS OF THE
CONSTITUTION SPLIT THE NOMINATION PROCESS FOR SUPREME COURT JUDGES
BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES. TLHE FRAMERS
UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUPREME COURT TO THE NEW REPUBLIC.
WHEN MOVING TO ELIMINATE INFERIOR FEDERAL COURTS FROM THE CONSTITU-

TIONAL PLAN, DELEGATE JOHN RuTLEDGE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA STATED

THAT:
              /T/HE RIGHT OF APPEAL TO THE SUPREME NATIONAL TRIBUNAL
              /WILL/ BE SUFFICIENT TO SECURE THE NATIONAL RIGHTS AND
              UNIFORMITY OF JUDGMENTS. (J FARRAND 129)

THROUGHOUT THE SUBSEQUENT DEBATE IN WHICH INFERIOR COURTS WERE EX-

CLUDED BY VOTE AND THEN RESTORED BY A COMPROMISE THAT ALLOWED CON~

GRESS TO ESTABLISH THEM, THE DELEGATES REPEATEDLY AFFIRMED THEIR
CONFIDENCE IN THE SUPREME COURT'S ABILITY TO PROTECT CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS AND SUSTAIN LAWS AND POLICIES DECREED BY CONGRESS.

         THE FRAMERS, HOWEVER, KNEW THAT WORDS OF LAW COULD BE SLIPPERY.
THEY HAD EXPERIENCED SUCH INDIGNITIES AT THE HANDS OF THE KING'S
MAGISTRATES. RECOGNIZING THAT THE INTEGRITY OF THE CONSTITUTION'S
WORDS WERE AT STAKE, THEREFORE, THEY WOULD NOT LEAVE THE FORMATION
OF THE SUPREME COURT TO ONE MAN. IF ENFORCEMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION
WERE TO BE COMMITTED TO THE HANDS OF THE JUSTICES, THE FRAMERS WANTED
                                    10

TO BE SURE, IN THE WORDS OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON, THAT THEY DESIGNED
"THE PLAN BEST CALCULATED . . . TO PROMOTE A JUDICIOUS CHOICE OF
MEN (INCIDENTALLY, 1 THINK ALEXANDER WOULD EXTEND HIS LANGUAGE TO
 INCLUDE WOMEN IN THIS INSTANCE,) FOR FILLING THE OFFICES OF THE
UNION." IN SHORT, THIS PLAN WOULD PROVIDE A DOUBLE CHECK ON NOMI-

NATIONS TO INSURE THAT THE CONSTITUTION AND SUCH WORDS AS "DUE PRO-

CESS" OR "EQUAL PROTECTION" MEAN WHAT THE AUTHORS INTENDED NOT
SIMPLY WHAT FIVE APPOINTEES MIGHT CUMULATIVELY CONCOCT. HAMILTON
CONTINUED TO STATE WHY ONE MAN COULD NOT BE GIVEN THIS VITAL TASK:

              /ADVICE AND CONSENT/ WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT CHECK UPON
              A SPIRIT OF FAVORITISM IN THE PRESIDENT, AND WOULD TEND
              GREATLY TO PREVENT THE APPOINTMENT OF UNFIT CHARACTERS
               FROM STATE PREJUDICE, FROM FAMILY CONNECTION, FROM PER-

           SONAL CONNECTION, OR FROM A VIEW TO POPULARITY. AND,

               IN ADDITION TO THIS, IT WOULD BE AN EFFICACIOUS SOURCE

           OF STABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION. (FEDERALIST #76)

THUS THE FRAMERS UNDERSTOOD THE PIVOTAL ROLE OF THE NATION'S HIGH-

EST JUDICIAL FORUM AND SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED A TWO-STEP SELECTION

PROCESS FOR ITS JUDGES.
         WE HAVE ALL HEARD THE ENTHUSIASTIC BOAST OF FORMER CHIEF JUS-

TICE CHARLES EVANS HUGHES THAT "WE ARE UNDER A CONSTITUTION, BUT
THE CONSTITUTION IS WHAT THE JUDGES SAY IT IS." THIS IS THE UNIN-

HIBITED SPIRIT THE FRAMERS MEANT TO CHECK BY INVOLVING THE SENATE

 IN THE SELECTION OF JUDGES. THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION FORE-
SAW THAT THE SUPREME LOURT WOULD HAVE EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY TO INSURE
THAT THEIR DOCUMENT WOULD BE PROPERLY ENFORCED. PRECISELY FOR THIS
REASON, THEY OBLIGATED THE BENATE TO PROTECT THE LONSTITUTION IN
THE NOMINATION PROCESS.

         THIS PLACES UPON US A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY. THIS RESPONSIBILITY
WITH REGARD TO JUDGE SANDRA O'CONNOR IS ONE THAT I PERSONALLY AM
DELIGHTED TO PARTICIPATE IN, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPLICATIONS
FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF THF. CONSTITUTION, BUT BECAUSE I FEEL
THAT JUDGE O'CONNOR'S SENSE OF CONSTITUTIONAL JUSTICE WILL BE
WORTHY OF THE TRUST PLACED IN THE SUPREME COURT BY THE FOUNDING
FATHERS. AS WE EMBARK UPON THIS INVESTIGATION, HOWEVER, I WOULD
LIKE TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES AND MYSELF THAT THE STAKES ARE HIGH.
WE ARE DECIDING TODAY THE FUTURE OF OUR MOST SACRED DOCUMENT.
                                          11

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum of Ohio.

OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HOWARD M. METZENBAUM
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge O'Connor, I look forward to this hearing with an open

mind and with a deep sense of inward gratification. I am open-
minded with respect to the confirmation process but I would be less
than frank if I did not admit a high degree of enthusiasm over the
fact that President Reagan has seen fit to appoint the first woman
to the U.S. Supreme Court.

  I come to this hearing with no preconceived notions. If I happen
to disagree with you on any specific issues, it will in no way affect
my judgment of your abilities to serve on the Court. It is a matter
of concern to me, however, that there are certain groups who have
spoken adversely about this appointment by reason of some of your
votes or actions as a State legislator.

  I have some very strong feelings about judicial appointments.
Basically, I think that the appointee must be a person of integrity;
a person strong enough to stand up for his or her point of view; a
person who has been shown to be a highly qualified legal scholar;
and a person who will have the kind of character that reflects well
on the judiciary in general.

  Your being a woman appointee would not, in and of itself, be
sufficient reason for me to vote to confirm. However, your being a
qualified and able woman of character and ability would provide
me with a great amount of satisfaction in knowing that I had a
part in the historic process of your confirmation to the Supreme
Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Dole of Kansas.

        OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROBERT DOLE
  Senator DOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I, like everyone else in this committee, welcome Judge O'Connor
to the committee. I want to commend the chairman for the fine
attendance we have this morning, an indication of strong leader-
ship. We appreciate that.
  However, as I think has been said, we are all aware of the
uniquely historic occasion that we are participating in, particularly
those of us who are privileged to serve on this committee. What-
ever else these hearings may tell us, I have a sense already of your
own feeling for the institution to which you have been nominated
by President Reagan.
  The Supreme Court stands at the very center of American life.
Its decisions define public policy for decades to come. The words
used to explain its reasoning shape the law and its practice for
thousands of practitioners and millions of citizens.
  Not least of all, the Court in recent times has been called upon
to render judgments in cases of almost bewildering complexity,
fraught with delicate moral or social implications. Should you be
confirmed and take your place alongside our other brethren, you
will undoubtedly find yourself confronted with issues Solomon him-
self might agonize over.
  It is not my job, nor does it fall within the realm of senatorial
prerogative as I understand it, to nail down precisely your views on

      87-101 O--81 2
                                          12

a host of controversial questions you may face on the bench. How-
ever, it is useful I think to call to mind the words and the example
of Oliver Wendell Holmes.

   Mr. Justice Holmes was a legal interpreter, not an independent
policymaker. When a young friend seized the opportunity to urge
him to, as he put it, "Do justice," Holmes replied: "That is not my
job. My job is to play the game according to the rules."

   The Judiciary Committee is faced with the job of examining your
prior record and assessing your present qualifications to perform a
role with profound impact on American society. Most of all, howev-
er, we are here to learn if you, like Mr. Justice Holmes, intend to
play the game according to the rules.

   In this regard, I find it encouraging that you bring to these
hearings a rich and varied background. Some Justices come to
Washington known chiefly as legal educators. Others are Washing-
ton lawyers, leaders of the bar, or prominent figures from State
and national politics.

  Justices may pursue many paths to the Court but few have won
separate reputations, as you have, on the campus, in the legisla-
ture, in the practice of law, and on the State bench. Few have
arrived in this city with a better insight into the legislative and
judicial dichotomy.

   Having helped to write laws, I expect you have come to appreci-
ate the limitations of statutes alone. Haying interpreted laws, I
expect you have come to value the continuity of precedent and the
wisdom of plain commonsense. Of course, as your presence here
demonstrates, it is sometimes plain commonsense to break with
precedent. I might add, better 190 years late than never.

   No single act by a President reverberates with greater historical
force than his nominations to the Supreme Court. No senatorial
function ranks higher in importance than deciding the qualifica-
tions of would-be Justices. In that spirit, and cognizant of the
special interest that surrounds this nomination, I look foward to
exploring in detail your judicial philosophy.

  I would add, Judge O'Connor--and I think I can summon the
ghosts of Roger Taney and Louis Brandeis to my side in saying
this--you are among friends.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator DeConcini is next but he will be heard
from later.

   Senator Simpson of Wyoming.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ALAN K. SIMPSON

   Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   "Historic" is overused here this morning but very appropriate. I
have a special feeling about the situation since I happen to repre-
sent the State of high altitude and low multitude, where we had
the first woman justice of the peace, we had the first woman
Governor, and we also were the first State in the Union to give
women the right to vote, an interesting thing at that time of our
rather robust history.
  Therefore, it is a historic occasion, the confirmation of a Su-
preme Court Justice. I think it achieves our very fullest and most
solemn task in the constitutional advise and consent function of
the Senate.
                                          13

  I have a fascinating footnote. Less than half of the Members of
the Senate were serving in this body when we confirmed the last
Justice of the Supreme Court, as recently as December of 1975.
Now that either says a lot about the tenure stability of judges, or I
have a hunch it actually says a great deal more about the realities
of the job security enjoyed by your inquisitors who are here ar-
rayed today. [Laughter.]

  Therefore, it is an extraordinary position, life tenure. The pur-
pose of it, of course, was to allow the judiciary to operate freely
without political tampering that so weighted down previous judicial
systems. The judiciary then was to transcend the politics so proper-
ly part and parcel of the other two branches.

   That marvelous check and balance that has proven so very work-
able and so very flexible in over 200 years also requires that
members of the Federal judiciary submit themselves to the scruti-
ny and the searching inquiry of the executive and the legislative
branches, and the latter is what we are up to today.

   Really, seldom does the constitutional process offer such a very
direct participation and observation. This proceeding I think would
be perceived with great favor by the Founding Fathers. I think it is
just exactly what they had in mind.

  Just a final personal note, Mr. Chairman. I am very impressed
by this lady. I greatly enjoyed my first visit with her. She is an
observant, bright, lucid, articulate, thoughtful, sharp, curious
person. She has a nice touch of wit and a warm sense of humor
which one sorely needs when the brittle, cold winds of ridicule and
harsh judgment whistle around this place, I can tell you, and the
place east of us across the pasture there.

   Therefore, I think we need more legislators as judges, just as we
have come to enjoy on this panel that remarkable judge from
Alabama, Senator Heflin, who adds so much to our deliberations
here. I do feel an extra special form of kinship with Judge O'Con-
nor. My path that led me here is very similar to the one that she
took, both serving as attorneys and assistant attorney general, and
in the general practice of law and civic work, and legislators in the
State legislature where you never become known as a statesman.
You are just the guy or the gal that voted against the "red fox
bill," and I know how tough that gets. The judge was also majority
floor leader, and that is something I enjoyed so much, much better
than being minority floor leader.

   Therefore, you have a diverse and lively background and you are
an involved and committed woman in both your public and your
personal life. I commend you, who have served as attorney and
judge and legislator, involved citizen, wife, mother.

   Then to find one final tidbit of accord, your son Brian O'Connor
and my son Colin MacKenzie Simpson are classmates and seniors
together at Colorado College and enjoy each other's company very
much, out in the West we both enjoy. That must be an Irish and
Scots situation beyond belief.

   Enough: My time runs. However, I do feel that here is a person
who brings a real touch of class to this office, this Government,
this city, and this place. I think that we will all perceive that at
the conclusion of the hearings. I shall be listening with great
interest, and I welcome you, Judge.
                                          14

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Leahy of Vermont.

      OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK J. LEAHY

   Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   If I had to choose one moment to explain the most about the way
the American system of government worked, it would probably be
the moment when we choose a Justice of the Supreme Court. It is a
moment when the interests of all three branches of Government
join, also when the guardianship of the Constitution has to be
safely conveyed.

  The Supreme Court has succeeded as the interpreter of the Con-
stitution, arbiter of great conflicts, not only because of wisdom and
a sense of history but because even in the most divided times in
this country, the American people have kept the sense and feeling
of respect that the Court has earned. Above all, this has been a
Court of fairness and a Court of competence. It is these qualities
that must characterize any nominee to that Court.

   I believe that Judge O'Connor comes to this committee with
impressive credentials, and I praise President Reagan in making
this appointment. I also praise his wisdom in picking somebody
who has historical ties to the State of Vermont, and I am sure that
that must have had something to do with the position you find
yourself in today.

  Her tenure on the appellate division bench has not been long in
years but I think, to go back to some of the history that Senator
Dole referred to earlier, we should realize that only 60 of the 101
Justices sitting now or in the past have had any prior judicial
experience. Only 41 of these had over 5 years of service when
confirmed, and among those who had no prior experience were
included John Marshall and Joseph Story, Roger Taney and Louis
Brandeis, and if you do not count his service as police judge, Hugo
Black.

  Our examination of Judge O'Connor's judicial philosophy, that is
relevant and important, but we should not condition our confirma-
tion on her agreement with any opinions of ours, so long as her
philosophy is within the norms set down by the Constitution itself.
We are a pluralist republic, no less on the bench than in a Ver-
mont town meeting or a national election.

  I enjoyed my own visit with Judge O'Connor. I told her at that
time I really did not care whether she was a Republican or a
Democrat, a conservative or a liberal. That is not the issue. The
issue is one of competence and whether she has a sense of fairness.
I am convinced on both counts.

  No one can now safely forecast the issues that will dominate the
coming years on the Court, but certain questions never will and
never should go away--how to balance the powers among the
branches of Government and how to maintain the Court's coequal
status while serving as the ultimate forum on the actions of other
branches and States, will always be perplexing. The right answers
have never been obvious, and they will not be during the time you
serve on that Court. So far in our history there has been a remark-
able acceptance of judicial interpretations, a willingness to make
the necessary changes to conform to judicial mandate.
                                          15

  Federalism is another issue that will never be settled for all
time. However, Judge O'Connor's background as a jurist, a legisla-
tive leader, and a legal writer convinces me that she would bring
to the Court a bounty of practical experience in dealing with these
sensitive issues.

  However, in the end the Court's highest duty is liberty. In the
United States there is no national dogma, no unvarying platform,
no orthodoxy save the notion that all other rights proceed from the
right of free expression. Not every Supreme Court decision will be
popular, and decisions upholding nonconformist expression will be
particularly unpopular.

  John Chipman Gray once wrote that "A court generally decides
in accordance with custom because a community generally thinks
its customs right.* * * The custom and the ethical creed are usual-
ly identical. But which of the two is the real source of the law is
shown in the cases where they differ."

  There may come times when the modern electronic revolution--
television, political polls, and computer-armed direct mail experts
on the right or the left--may demand instant consensus. However,
one institution that must survive such times is the Supreme Court,
where instant consensus must never result in instant justice.

  In conclusion, as Justice Brandeis once said, "If we would guide
by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold." I think you
have a mind that is and will be bold, Judge O'Connor. I welcome
you here today, and I look forward to these hearings.

  Thank you.

                THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR TO BE

                   AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

                IF I HAD TO CHOOSE ONE MOMENT THAT EXPLAINED THE MOST ABOUT
THE WAY THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT WORKED, IT WOULD PROBABLY

BE THE MOMENT WHEN WE CHOOSE A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT. IT IS

A MOMENT WHEN THE INTERESTS OF ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT JOIN
AND A MOMENT WHEN THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE CONSTITUTION MUST BE
SAFELY CONVEYED.

                THE SUPREME COURT HAS SUCCEEDED AS THE INTERPRETER OF THE
CONSTITUTION AND THE ARBITER OF GREAT CONFLICTS NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF
WISDOM AND SENSE OF HISTORY, BUT BECAUSE EVEN IN THE MOST DIVIDED
OF TIMES THE C.OURT HAS EARNED AND KEPT THE RESPECT OF ALL AMERICANS,
ABOVE ALL, THIS HAS BEEN A COURT OF FAIRNESS AND COMPETENCE. IT
IS THESE QUALITIES THAT MUST CHARACTERIZE ANY NOMINEE TO THE COURT.

                JUDGE O'CONNOR COMES TO THIS COMMITTEE WITH IMPRESSIVE
CREDENTIALS, HAVING BEEN ACTIVE IN THE PRACTICE OF LAW, IN THE
LEADERSHIP OF THE ARIZONA SENATE, AS A TRIAL JUDGE, AND THEREAFTER
A STATE APPELLATE JUDGE. WHILE HER TENURE ON THE APPELLATE DIVISION
BENCH HAS NOT BEEN LONG IN YEARS, IT IS EASY TO FORGET THAT THE
SUPREME COURT DEMANDS A DIVERSITY OF TALENT AND EXPERIENCE, MORE THAN
LENGTH OF SERVICE IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. ONLY 60 OF THE 101 JUSTICES
SITTING NOW OR IN THE PAST HAVE HAD ANY PRIOR JUDICIAL EXPERIENCE,
AND ONLY ^1 OF THESE HAD OVER FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE WHEN CONFIRMED.
AND AMONG THOSE WITH NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE WHATSOEVER WERE JOHN MARSHALL,
JOSEPH STORY, ROGER B. TANEY, LOUIS n, BRANDEIS, AND MUGO L. BLACK
(IF YOU EXCLUDE HIS SERVICE AS A POLICE JUDGE).

          THESE NEXT DAYS WILL GIVE US A CHANCE TO HEAR JUDGE O'CONNOR'S
 VIEWS ON A WIDE KANGE OF LEGAL TOPICS. BUT WHILE OUR EXAMINATION
 OF HER JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY IS RELEVANT AND IMPORTANT, WE SHOULD NOT
 CONDITION HER CONFIRMATION ON HER AGREEMENT WITH ANY OPINIONS OF
 OURS, SO LONG AS HER PHILOSOPHY IS WITHIN THE NORMS SET DOWN BY
 THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF. OURS IS A PLURALIST REPUBLIC, NO LESS ON
 THE BENCH THAN IN A VERMONT TOWN MEETING OR A NATIONAL ELECTION.
                                     17

       IT MAY BE SAID THAT EVERY NEW JUSTICE COMES TO THE SUPREME
COURT AT A PARTICULAR CONSTITUTIONAL MOMENT. IF THE WISDOM OF THE
CONSTITUTION IS ETERNAL, THE TASK OF DISCOVERING THAT WISDOM IS
NEVER-ENDING. NO ONE CAN NOW SAFELY DESCRIBE THE PRESENT CONSTITUTIONAL
MOMENT OR FORECAST THE ISSUES THAT WILL DOMINATE THE COMING YEARS ON
THE COURT. BUT CERTAIN QUESTIONS NEVER WILL AND NEVER SHOULD GO AWAY,
ONE IS HOW TO BALANCE THE POWERS AMONG THE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT.
THE SUPREME COURT ULTIMATELY DECIDES IF THE WILL OF CONGRESS HAS
BEEN FOLLOWED WHEN LAWS ARE APPLIED OR, IN SOME INSTANCES, IF
CONGRESS HAS FAITHFULLY FOLLOWED THE CONSTITUTION.

       ALL WILL AGREE THAT THE POWER TO DECLARE THE ACTS OR RESOLVES
OF OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT INVALID HAS NEVER RAISED THE COURT
OVER THE OTHER BRANCHES OR OVER THE STATES. MAINTAINING THE COURT'S
CO-EQUAL STATUS WHILE SERVING AS THE ULTIMATE FORUM ON THE ACTIONS
OF OTHER BRANCHES AND THE STATES WILL ALWAYS BE PERPLEXING. THE
RIGHT ANSWERS HAVE NEVER BEEN OBVIOUS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHO WOULD
HAVE QUIBBLED WITH THE WORDS OF THE COURT WHEN IT SAID IN 1946,
"IT IS HOSTILE TO A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM TO INVOLVE THE JUDICIARY IN
THE POLITICS OF THE PEOPLE." YET I QUOTE FROM A CASE THAT DECLINED
SUPREME COURT REVIEW OF STATE APPORTIONMENT DECISIONS, A CASE
OVERRULED IN 1962 BY BAKER V. CARR. AND WHO WOULD ARGUE TODAY THAT
FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS SINCE RAKER THE CAUSE OF EQUAL REPRESENTATION
HAS DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED BECAUSE THE COURT"DECIDED, RELUCTANTLY,
THAT THERE ARE MOMENTS TO BECOME INVOLVED IN CONTROVERSIES GENERALLY
LEFT TO THE STATES?

        SO FAR IN OUR HISTORY THERE HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE ACCEPTANCE
OF JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS AND A WILLINGNESS TO MAKE THE NECESSARY
CHANGES TO CONFORM TO JUDICIAL MANDATE. THE WILLINGNESS COMES FROM
A RESPECT FOR THE COURT AS AN INSTITUTION THAT PLACES JUSTICE OVER
PERSONALITY AND PRESSURES OF THE MOMENT. THAT WILLINGNESS WILL BE
RENEWED AND THE COURT'S READINGS OF THE CONSTITUTION WILL BE ACCEPTED
AS THE LAST WORD SO LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO MERIT WHAT LINCOLN ONCE
REFERRED TO AS "CLAIMS TO THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE." THAT CONFIDENCE
MUST ENDURE, IF THE UNIQUENESS OF THE COURT IS TO ENDURE.

        FEDERALISM IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WILL NEVER BE SETTLED FOR
 ALL TIME. CHIEF JUSTICE CHASE SAID MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
                                      18

THAT "THE CONSTITUTION, IN ALL OF ITS PROVISIONS LOOKS TO AN
INDESTRUCTIBLE UNION, COMPOSED OF INDESTRUCTIBLE STATES." TLME,
CHANGE, AND THE MOBILITY OF OUR SOCIETY HAVE PUT TERRIBLE PRESSURES
ON OUR UNION, AND THE GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT WEIGHS HEAVILY ON THE
FABRIC OF FEDERALISM. JUDGE O'CONNOR'S BACKGROUND AS A JURIST,
LEGISLATIVE LEADER, AND LEGAL WRITER CONVINCES ME THAT SHE WOULD BRING
TO THE COURT A BOUNTY OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH THESE
SENSITIVE ISSUES.

         BUT IN THE END, THE COURT'S HIGHEST DUTY IS LIBERTY. IN THE
UNITED STATES THERE IS NO NATIONAL DOGMA, NO UNVARYING PLATFORM,
NO ORTHODOXY, SAVE THE NOTION THAT ALL OTHER RIGHTS PROCEED FROM THE
RIGHT OF FREE EXPRESSION. NOT EVERY SUPREME COURT DECISION WILL BE
POPULAR, AND DECISIONS UPHOLDING NONCONFORMIST EXPRESSION WILL BE
PARTICULARLY UNPOPULAR. JOHN CHIPMAN GRAY ONCE WROTE:

                "A COURT GENERALLY DECIDES IN ACCORDANCE WITH
                CUSTOM BECAUSE A COMMUNITY GENERALLY THINKS
                 ITS CUSTOMS RIGHT...THE CUSTOM AND THE
                ETHICAL CREED ARE USUALLY IDENTICAL. BUT
                WHICH OF THE TWO IS THE REAL SOURCE OF THE
                LAW IS SHOWN IN THE CASES WHERE THEY DIFFER."

         THERE MAY COME TIMES WHEN THE MODERN ELECTRONIC REVOLUTION --
TELEVISION, POLITICAL POLLS, AND COMPUTER-ARMED DIRECT MAIL
EXPERTS -- MAY DEMAND INSTANT CONSENSUS. ONE INSTITUTION THAT
MUST SURVIVE SUCH TIMES IS THE SUPREME COURT, WHERE INSTANT CONSENSUS
MUST NEVER RESULT IN INSTANT JUSTICE.

         TODAY IS A TIME FOR THE COURT TO EXAMINE MORE DEEPLY THAN
EVER THE LIMITATIONS ON ITS POWER AND ITS ROLE IN THE SCHEME OF
OUR GOVERNMENT. BUT THE PRESSURES ON THE COURT TO YIELD UP THE
GAINS OF THE PAST GENERATIONS IN LIBERTY AND EQUALITY MAY
BE SUBSTANTIAL,AND IT IS THEREFORE ALSO A TIME TO BE WATCHFUL AND
STRONG.

         As JUSTICE BRANDEIS ONCE SAID, "IF WE WOULD GUIDE BY THE
LIGHT OF REASON, WE MUST LET OUR MINDS BE BOLD."

         WE WELCOME JUDGE O'CONNOR AND LOOK FORWARD TO BEING WITH
HER DURING THESE IMPORTANT HEARINGS.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator East of North Carolina.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN P. EAST

  Senator EAST. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mrs. O'Connor, I welcome you this morning and congratulate you
on your nomination. Senator Simpson is absolutely right in imply-
ing that every Member of the Senate has somewhat of an envy of
those who may be going on to the Supreme Court for that lifetime
appointment. We live in that very imperfect and unsettled world of
having to run for reelection, and grappling with high interest rates
and related matters, so we do envy you down deep in our heart of
hearts, no question about that.
  It is an honor, as a freshman Senator, to be a part of this very
important process of confirming a Justice to the U.S. Supreme
Court. This is a historic occasion, not only because you are the first
woman nominee but because this, of course, represents the first
great opportunity of this administration to change the general
course and direction of the U.S. Supreme Court, one of the three
great, vital institutions of the American system of government.
  Therefore, I look forward to being a part of this. I hope that our
questions can be questions of substance and depth so that we can
fulfill our constitutional obligation as a part of the confirmation
process.
  Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time I would like the balance of
my remarks to be entered into the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, so ordered.
  Senator EAST. Again, my congratulations to you for your nomina-
tion, and I welcome you here to the Senate Judiciary Committee
this morning.

 STATEMENT OF SENATOR EAST ON CONFIRMATION OF SANDRA O'CONNOR

       Mr. Chairman, I thank you for this opportunity to
 make a few opening remarks on this very important
 nomination.

      Perhaps the most important question before the
 Committee today is not whether Judge O'Connor is
 to be confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice, but what
 the role of the United States Senate ought to be in
 the process of selecting a Justice of the Supreme
 Court. The Constitution imposes on the Senate the
 duty to exercise an advice and consent function.
 In my view, this duty includes a responsibility to
scrutinize carefully all of the nominee's qualifications
to sit on the High Court. Among the most important of
these qualifications is that the nominee have a
profound respect for the Constitution. Such respect
for the Constitution can only be evidenced by a
determination to interpret that document according
to its true meaning, and to abjure the law-making
function that the Supreme Court has taken unto itself
in recent years.

     If I am correct in thinking that the Senate must
scrutinize the degree to which a nominee respects the
Constitution as a document to be interpreted according
to its true meaning, then the question arises how
                                       21

                                            -2-

  Senat'ors are to inform themselves in this area. Unlike
  education and experience, a nominee's constitutional
  philosophy cannot be reduced to lines on a resume. Nor
  is a nominee's own self-description as a "strict
  constructionist" or a "judicial conservative" likely
  to be helpful, since such labels mean different things
  to different people. Unless a nominee has a long record
 of prior judicial decisions on constitutional law, or
 other writings on the Constitution and what it means, the
 only way for a Senator to find out whether the nominee
 will interpret the Constitution according to the intentions
 of its framers is to ask specific questions about
 constitutional law.

      There is, of course, a significant limitation on a
 Senator's right to receive candid answers from a nominee
 on questions of constitutional law: It would be wrong

                                                                                                                                                                        ,,·

 to expect promises of certain votes in particular future
cases. But this is no bar to full discussion of past
cases and competing doctrines. Such discussion does not
amount to a promise because the Senators and the nominees
ought to understand that no judge can decide how to rule
on a case without having read the briefs, heard the oral
arguments, and conferred with the other members of the
court.

     With the understanding that no promises will be requested
or received, I fervently hope that Judge O'Connor will be
willing to share with us her views on constitutional law,
including her reactions to the Supreme Court's past cases.

Only with the benefit of such information will the

Senate be able to exercise its constitutional advice

and consent function in an informed and intelligent

fashion.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Baucus of Montana.

         OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR MAX BAUCUS
  Senator BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like to take this opportunity to address the nominee
directly.
  Judge O'Connor, this is a special occasion for each of us. It is our
first Supreme Court nomination hearing, and I thought it would be
fitting to use this short time to tell you how I personally feel about
this nomination.
  For you, as a judge, as a lawyer, as a citizen, as a woman, as a
human being, it is a great personal tribute and a high honor to be
nominated by the President of the United States to be an Associate
Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
  For me, this is a moment of special responsibility under the
advise and consent powers given the Senate by article 2 of the
Constitution, to determine whether your nomination should be con-
firmed. I view it as an important obligation to assure the American
people that you are a nominee of the highest integrity and compe-
tence; that your view of the Constitution, your view of our form of
government, and your view of the role of the Supreme Court are
consistent with the best interests of our Nation.
  For our country, it is our brief and only opportunity to examine
an individual who will have profound impact on us, our children,
and our grandchildren. Once confirmed, life tenure will give you
the requisite independence to decide cases fairly and wisely, yet
that tenure will also forever foreclose any opportunity to review
your performance.
  As a former State legislator who faced several moments of truth
with Arizona voters, I am sure you appreciate the value of that
kind of public accountability. In a sense, these hearings will be
your last opportunity for public accountability. I hope you ap-
proach them in that light.
  Finally, for our Nation this is one of those rare opportunities to
examine the role of the Supreme Court and try to determine its
proper relationship to the Congress, to the President, and to indi-
vidual citizens.
  I therefore believe that it is incumbent upon us, each of us, to be
thoughtful, candid, and forthright, and to take the time to fully
and completely exercise our obligations.
  I will ask you about general principles you believe a judge should
follow in deciding cases. I will ask you how you, as a member of the
Court, would go about increasing our citizens' respect for the Su-
                                                    23

preme Court and the Federal judiciary. I will ask you whether
Congress should respond to decisions of the Supreme Court by
limiting Supreme Court review of constitutional questions. Finally,
I will ask you how you, Justice Sandra O'Connor, hope to be
remembered in history. I look forward to our discussion of these
issues.

  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Grassley of Iowa.

   OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E. GRASSLEY

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge O'Connor, I once again extend my con-
gratulations to you on your nomination for Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court.

  Your nomination is important in and of itself and because it will
hopefully set the stage for fulfillment of President Reagan's prom-
ise to reverse a current trend in the Federal courts. We hope that
this nomination will be the first of several appointments to the
Supreme Court by this President and that it will signal a dramatic
return by Federal court appointees at all levels who are committed
to the preservation of our greatest constitutional principles.

  Through the strict observation of both the separation of powers
by restraining from legislating from the bench, as well as vigorous
enforcement of the division of powers by acting when necessary to
prevent the Congress from usurping powers reserved to the States,
will start the Court back down the road in the right direction. We
also pray that these Reagan appointees will differ from many
recent appointees by showing at least as much compassion for
society's innocent victims as its criminal wrongdoers. These are the
qualities of individuals the President promised to appoint when he
was campaigning, and indeed that was the explicit pledge of the
platform upon which he ran.

  It is already apparent that you, Judge O'Connor, exhibit some of
those qualities, just by the mere fact that you are sitting before us
today. I have the utmost respect for President Reagan's judgment,
and I received the impression through our meeting a few weeks ago
that you are a warm, perceptive, and articulate person. I also can
see from your judicial opinions, published comments, and record in
the State legislature, that you are a master of the law as well.

  I debated with myself about approaching the subject of the fact
that you are a woman but I think it is necessary to recognize that
that fact alone may indicate more about your character and compe-
tence than anything which appears on your resume. That is be-
cause the profession of law was closed to women for a long time
both legally and figuratively. Your presence here today indicates to
me that you had the stamina to succeed in what was and still is a
male-dominated arena. I just want to let you know that I admire
you for your success.

  However, we must not forget that your selection by the President
is made only with the advice and the consent of this Senate. This
constitutional role is not one to be taken lightly. Our questioning of
you and other nominees must be thorough and direct, and we must
insist upon at least as much clarity and candor in your answers to
our questioning as has been given by other recent nominees to the
Supreme Court. At the conclusion of these hearings, we must be
                                                    24

able to report not only to the full Senate but also to the President,
and indirectly to the citizenry who elected him, that your nomina-
tion represents a campaign promise kept.

   Hopefully our report will be that you are the perfect model for
future Reagan Court appointees--that you, Judge O'Connor, as an
individual are first committed, without apology and uncompromis-
ingly, to protecting the role of the States within the constitutional
concept of division of powers within our Federal system of govern-
ment; that you, Judge O'Connor, are secondly an individual com-
mitted personally and professionally to limiting your role in the
judicial branch to adjudication rather than legislation; and that
you as an individual are lastly committed to opposing the permis-
siveness which has fostered disrespect for society's laws and disre-
spect for the sanctity of life.

  Your responses to these questions posed by myself and my col-
leagues will contribute to the outcome of this report; be it favorable
or otherwise, and I hope that they will clear up some of the
conflicting contentions that have been raised since the announce-
ment of your nomination.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Heflin of Alabama.

       OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN

  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that a
prepared statement appear in the record as if read in full but I will
attempt to limit myself to the requested time of 3 minutes and will
abbreviate my statement.

  Mr. Chairman and Judge O'Connor, the task that brings us here
today is a most important one. It is the process by which a branch
of Government renews itself, of regeneration, of pumping new
blood into the life of a great and vital institution.

  In my opinion--and I say this, Mr. Chairman, only after careful
reflection--there are only two institutions absolutely indispensable
to the independence, health, and maintenance of our republic: a
free, fair, vigorous press, and a strong and independent judiciary.
While Presidents may come and go, their faithful execution of the
law is subject to an ultimate check. While a great many men and
women may deliberate and legislate in these very Halls, the laws
they pass do not interpret themselves.

  The Federal judiciary--the highest court in particular--not only
has the last word as to what our laws say but also as to whether
they may permissibly say it. The Court to which this capable jurist
has been nominated is the ultimate arbiter of our most sacred
freedoms, the guardian of our most cherished liberties.

  In fulfilling our constitutional duty to advise and consent, the
men and women of this body will cast no more important vote in
this session of Congress, for we are voting not so much to confirm
Sandra Day O'Connor but to reaffirm our belief in the very concept
of justice and its preeminence among values in a free and thriving
republic.

  As our first President told his Attorney General, Edmund Ran-
dolph, some two centuries ago, "The administration of justice is the
firmest pillar of government." If justice is both the ultimate goal
and indispensable for the survival of a free republic, we best insure
                                                    25

it by the people we select as its custodians. That is what we are
about today--selecting a custodian for our most precious commod-
ity, a trustee for our most valuable resource.

  I am one of the few Senators who have had the privilege of
knowing the nominee personally before her nomination. Having
participated with her under the leadership of the Chief Justice of
the United States in the recent Anglo-American legal exchange on
criminal justice, I learned firsthand of her exceptional intelligence,
her hard-working preparation of the issues at hand, and her un-
swerving adherence to integrity.

  Further, knowing of her deep devotion to the American judicial
system, I can safely venture that President Reagan's appointment
to the Supreme Court will reflect great credit on his administra-
tion, the Court itself, and indeed the Nation at large.

  Judge O'Connor, if I could leave you with but one guiding
thought, it would be to carry indelibly etched in your conscience
and follow as religiously as is humanly possible, the admonition of
one of our greatest jurists, Learned Hand, who wrote, "If we are to
keep our democracy, there must be one commandment: Thou shalt
not ration justice."

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the Senator's entire state-
ment will be placed in the record.

              STATEMENT OF SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN

              NOMINATION OF JUDGE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR

ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT /

              THE U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

         "The task which brings us here today is a most important one. It
is the process by which a branch of government renews itself--of regen-
eration, of pumping new blood into the life of a great and vital

         In my opinion, and I say this, Mr. Chairman, only after careful

         The federal judiciary-- the high Court in particular--not only has
the last word as to what our laws say, but also as to whether they may
permissibly say it. The court to which this capable jurist has been
nominated is the ultimate arbiter of our most sacred freedoms, guardian

         In fulfilling our constitutional duty to advise and consent, the

session of Congress. For we are voting not so much to confirm Sandra
Day O'Connor, but to reaffirm our belief in the very concept of justice,
and its preeminence among values in a free and thriving republic.
As our first President told his Attorney General, Edmund Randolph,
some two centuries ago, "The administration of justice is the firmest
pillar of government."

         If justice is both the ultimate goal, and indispensable for the
survival, of a free republic, we best insure it by the people we
select as its custodians. And that is what we are about today--
selecting a custodian for our most previous commodity, a trustee for
our most valuable resource.

         And yet nowhere is there to be found a set of standards for
selecting these custodians of justice. Since Chief Justice John Jay
took the oath of office in 1789, 101 justices have sat on the Supreme
Court. While this record should provide some guidance for us, it is
of limited assistance, for they have differed as much in their
judicial philosophies as in their passion for the law. Greatness on
the Court is neither measurable nor clearly definable. It may derive
from a coherent philosophy expressed with unequalled brilliance, as
was the case with Justice Holmes, or from a vast currency of experience
by the creative mind of a Justice Brandeis. It may stem from an
unrelenting effort to restrain judicial activism by a Justice
Rehnquist, an unquenchable thirst for liberty, as with Justice Douglas,
or the passionate love of free expression of my fellow Alabamian,
Hugo Black.

         When asked to catalogue the criteria for judicial selection,
we normally-- and somewhat automatIcally--1ist legal ability, character,
and judicial temperment. To these qualities, I would respectfully
add three perhaps more fundamental: (1) an understanding of the proper
role of the judiciary in our constitutional and federal scheme; (2) a
deep belief in, and unfaltering support of, an independent judiciary;
and (3) an abiding love of justice.

         If I might elaborate ever so briefly:

          (1) Regarding the proper role of the judiciary: It is the
constant struggle of all federal judges, and the ultimate issue (they
must confront, to preserve the balance between the powers of the'
federal government and those of the states --while at the same time
protecting the constitutional guarantees of all Americans. It is the
supreme test of judicial acumen to preserve that balance, to which an
understanding of the proper role of the federal judiciary is indis-
pensable .
                                      27

         (2) The framers of the Constitution were painfully aware of
encroachments on judicial independence. Indeed, denial to the colonies
of the benefits of an independent judiciary was one of the grievances
against King George III enumerated in the Declaration of Independence.
If the judgment of our highest custodians of justice is at all compro-
mised, if it is based on timidity or hesitation arising from public
or political pressure, our legacy of judicial independence will be
undermined. Justice compromised is justice aborted.

          (3) There must be a passionate love of justice, the great cement
of a civilized society, the guardian of all life and liberty. If
injustice can divide us--pitting black against white, old against
young, have-nots against haves --justice can bring us together as a
people, and as a Nation.

         Mr. Chairman, against these highest and noblest of standards,
I have examined this nominee, and find that she meets them, every one.
Judge O'Connor's record of accomplishment, both in public and private
life, is exemplary--a seasoned private practitioner; a vigorous
prosecutor; skillful legislator; respected jurist; legal scholar;
bar, civic and political leader; faithful wife; and devoted mother.
The breadth of her service is surpassed only by the excellence with
which it was rendered. More importantly, it enables Judge O'Connor
to bring unique qualities to the Court: an abiding respect for the
law; a deep understanding of our economic and political institutions;
a clear view of the proper role of the judiciary; and a rare appre-
ciation of the values of Americans as a people. I dare say these
qualities, and her record to date, are a harbinger of judicial greatness.

         So I join my colleagues in welcoming Judge O'Connor. Having
participated with her, under the leadership of the Chief Justice, in
the recent Anglo-American legal exchange on criminal justice, I learned
first hand of her exceptional intelligence, her hard working preparation
of the issues at hand and her unswerving adherence to integrity. Further,
knowing of her deep devotion to the American judicial system, I can
safely venture that President Reagan's appointment to the Supreme Court
will reflect great credit on his Administration, the Court itself, and,
indeed, the Nation at large.

         Judge O'Connor, as of this moment, I expect you to be confirmed.
But in a way I do not envy you--your job, should you be confirmed, and
that of your colleagues on the Court, will be the most difficult in the
free world. As you know--or will undoubtedly soon learn, cases reaching
the Supreme Court are not the "who ran the red light" variety. The
most fundamental questions of liberty, and life itself, will reach you;
the most intractable and emotional problems of a complex and diverse
society.

          I began by saying we are involved in the process of institutional
renewal. As Justice Cardoza put it, "The process of justice is never
finished, (it) reproduces itself, generation after generation, in
ever-changing forms. Today, as in the past, it calls for the bravest
and the best."

         Mr. Chairman, I believe his words ring just as true today, and
in Sandra Day O'Connor I believe we have "the bravest and the best."
Judge O'Connor, I wish you well. If I could leave you with but one
guiding thought, it would be to carry indelibly etched in your
conscience, and follow as religiously as is humanly possible, the
admonition of one of our greatest jurists, Learned Hand, who wrote,
"If we are to keep our democracy there must be one commandment:
Thou shalt not ration justice."

         Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Denton of Alabama.

     OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR JEREMIAH DENTON

  Senator DENTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Welcome, Judge O'Connor.
  As I remarked at our meeting in July, I am personally delighted
that President Reagan has nominated a lady to be Associate Jus-
tice of the Supreme Court. For an attorney, this is the highest
tribute which the Government can bestow, and by his choice the
President has reposed the highest trust in you as an American, an
attorney, and as a jurist. I congratulate you on that nomination. I
respect you. I like you.

  Although many of my colleagues have previously and publicly
indicated their approval of your nomination, and your appointment
seems highly likely, I am obliged by conscience--the only one I
have--to raise certain issues. First, it has been brought to my
attention that President Reagan may have been misled by a July 7,
1981 report prepared by a senior Justice Department official, a
report which purported to represent your record and your attitude
on matters, some of which were subjects specifically established in
the 1980 Republican platform, and one of which has been reported
to have been verbally established by our President as a criterion
for filling the first Supreme Court vacancy.

  It appears from some analyses that there is a substantial differ-
ence between your record and the Justice Department official's
report of your record, and that there may be reason for the concern
in the minds of many regarding these differences on such issues as
abortion and women in combat, among others. I hope we can clear
up that matter.

  While I realize that people of good conscience can be in favor of
abortion under certain circumstances, I firmly believe that this
Government is founded upon respect for the dignity of humankind.
While respecting the differing views of others, I would consider the
establishment by our Government of a disposition amounting to a
permanent decision not to protect the life of an unborn human
being to be a point of no return in a recently accelerated, alarming
trend away from the principles upon which our Government was
founded and by which this Nation achieved greatness.

  In my understanding, that greatness derives from the consentual
definition of humankind as possessing infinite dignity and worth by
virtue of being a form of life created in the image and likeness of
God, with the inalienable rights of man, the prerogatives for those
rights, being endowed by that same Creator. By that concept, the
revolutionary conclusion was reached that governmental direction
did not repose in the overriding divine right of a single king but in
the consent of the governed, each one of which was considered
equal to all others in this respect of dignity.

  Granting that abortion is a single issue but counting it funda-
mental to our democratic form of Government, I regard legalized
abortion as a denial of the most fundamental and efficacious na-
tional principle of this Nation. My judgment on voting on your
confirmation or on the confirmation of any other nominee--male
or female--to the Supreme Court will be affected by that belief of
mine.
                                          29

  Your answers at this hearing, not your previous record, will
determine my estimate of your position on this and other issues
because I trust you and because I know you, like many others I
have known, can have changed your mind and still be changing
your mind on this issue. I believe the Congress has been changing
its collective mind, as evidenced by the recent passage by the
Senate of the Hyde amendment.

  Each of us Senators on this committee must fulfill, according to
his own conscience, his role as set forth in article 2, section 2 of our
Constitution, and my vote will be a reflection not of my respect for
you or President Reagan, but will reflect my best estimate of how
your appointment would tend to affect the general welfare of this
country.

  It is my earnest hope that your responses will be neither broad
nor bland, because I will base my single vote on those responses.
Since I am not a lawyer, I would request, Mr. Chairman, that a
statement by a constitutional lawyer, Mr. William Bentley Ball--
which differs with some of the opening statements made today--be
placed in the record. I ask unanimous consent that that be done.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the balance of the statement
by the distinguished Senator from Alabama will be placed in the
record.

   Senator DENTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   [Material follows:]

                        PREPARED STATEMENT BY SENATOR JEREMIAH DENTON

   Welcome Mrs. O'Connor: As I told you at our meeting in July, I am personally
delighted that President Reagan has nominated a woman to be Associate Justice of
the United States Supreme Court. For an attorney this is the highest tribute which
the government can bestow, and by his choice the President has reposed the highest
trust in you, as an American, an attorney and as a jurist.

   As you are very much aware, your nomination was greeted with what might be
called mixed reviews, and quite frankly from information which has come to my
attention it appears that President Reagan may have been misled by a July 7, 1981,
report prepared by a senior Justice Department official. The report to which I refer
has been thoroughly dissected by those in opposition to your nomination and while
perhaps not dispositive of the issue, these analyses raise legitimate concerns in the
minds of many with respect to your attitudes on such issues as abortion, the
proposed Equal Rights Amendment, and your record while in the Arizona Senate.
Moreover, if the memorandum is to be accepted at full value, then certain questions
with respect to your credibility are apparent.

   While I realize that people of good conscience can be in favor of abortion under
certain circumstances, I firmly believe that this government is founded upon respect
for the dignity of human kind, and that in my view those Americans who favor
what has come to be known as "Pro-choice" abortion undermine this basic concept.

   In my previous conversation with you I told you that I had not made a decision as
to how I would vote on your nomination. I have still not made a decision. My
judgment will be based on information which I have developed prior to these
hearings together with my evaluation of your responses to questions put to you at
the hearings. After all, the purpose of these hearings is not merely to confirm you,
but to find out who you really are and what convictions you possess on great issues.
The fact that you are a woman must not, in and of itself, dictate the result. We as
Senators must fulfill our role of advising and consenting to the nomination of judges
of the Supreme Court as set forth in Art. II, Section 2 of the Constitution. We
cannot merely acquiese in the selection of President Reagan no matter how highly
we regard him and the quality of his leadership.

   In closing let me say that it is my earnest hope that your responses will be
neither broad nor bland, as a lack of knowledge or lack of specificity in answers
could easily be perceived as a lack of qualification or of candor.

       THE O'CONNOR SUPREME COURT NOMINATION, A CONSTITUTIONAL LAWYER
                                                        COMMENTS

                                   (By William Bentley Ball)1

  As one whose practice is in the field of constitutional law, one thing stands out
supremely when a vacancy on the Supreme Court occurs: the replacement should be
deliberate, not impulsive. The public interest is not served by a fait accompli,
however politically brilliant. The most careful probing and the most measured
deliberation are what are called for. Confirm in haste, and we may repent at
leisure.

  Unhappily, the atmosphere surrounding the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor
to the Supreme Court is one almost of panic. Considering that the liberties of the
American people can ride on a single vote in the Supreme Court, any politically or
ideologically motivated impatience should be thrust aside and time taken to do the
job right. Plainly, there is no need for instanteous confirmation hearings, and the
most painstaking effort should be made to fully know the qualifications--including
philosophy--of the candidate. My first plea would be, therefore: Don't rush this
nomination through.

  My second relates indeed to the matter of "philosophy". Some zealous supporters
of the O'Connor nomination (who themselves have notoriety as ideologues) have
made the astonishing statement that, on the Supreme Court of the United States,
ideology doesn't count. They say, in other words, that it should be of no significance
that a candidate would have an actual and proved record of having voted or acted
on behalf of racism or anti-Semitism or any other philosophic point of view pro-
foundly opposed by millions of Americans. These concerns are not dispelled by a
recital that the candidate is "personally" opposed to such a point of view. Why the
qualifying adverb? Does that not imply that, while the candidate may harbor
private disgust over certain practices, he or she does not intend to forego support of
those practices?

  Philosophy is everything in dealing with the spacious provisions of the First
Amendment, the Due Process Clauses, equal protection and much else in the Consti-
tution. It is perfect nonsense to praise a candidate as a "strict constructionist"
when, in these vital areas of the Constitution, there is really very little language to
"strictly" construe. As to other areas of the constitution (e.g., Article 1, Sect. 4--
"The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year . . ."), to speak of "strict
construction" is also absurd, since everything is already "constructed".

  It is likewise meaningless to advance a given candidate as a "conservative" (or as
a "liberal"). In the matter of Mrs. O'Connor, the label "conservative" has unfortu-
nately been so employed as to obfuscate a very real issue. The scenario goes like
this:

  Comment: "Mrs. O'Connor is said to be pro-abortion."
  Response: "Really? But she is a staunch conservative."
  Just as meaningful would be:
  Comment: "John Smith is said to be a mathematician."
  Response: "Really? But he is from Chicago."
  Whether Mrs. O'Connor is labeled a "conservative" is irrelevant to the question
respecting her views on abortion. So would it be on many another subject.
  The New York Times editorialized July 12 on "What To Ask Judge O'Connor".
The four questions it posed (all "philosophical", by the way) were good. To these
many another question need be added. For example:
  What are the candidate's views on:
  The proper role of administrative agencies and the assumption by them of powers
not clearly delegated?
  The use by IRS of the tax power in order to mold social views and practices?
  The allowable reach of governmental control respecting family life?
  Busing for desegregation?
  The proper role of government with respect to non-tax supported, private reli-
gious schools?
  Sex differentiation in private employments?
   Freedon of religion and church-state separation?
   Broad and bland answers could of course be given to each of these questions, but
lack of knowledge or lack of specificity in answers would obviously be useful indices
of the capabilities or candor of the candidate. Fair, too--and important--would be
questions to the candidate calling for agreement with, disagreement with, and

discussion of, major prior decisions of the Supreme Court. Not the slightest impro-
priety would be involved in, and much could be gained by, public exposition of the
candidate's fund of information on these cases, interest in the problems they have
posed, and reaction to the judgments made.

  Even these few considerations make it clear that the Senate's next job is not to
confirm Mrs. O'Connor but instead to find out who she really is--that is, what
convictions she possesses on great issues. I thus return to my theme that delibera-
tiveness, not haste, should be the watchword respecting the confirmation inquiry.
The fact that a woman is the present candidate must not (as Justice Stewart
indicated) be dispositive of choice. It should certainly not jackknife basic and normal
processes of selection. At this point, no prejudgment--either way--is thinkable.

  Other vacancies may soon arise. The precedent of lightning-fast decisions in the
matter of choosing our Supreme Court Justices would be a bad precedent indeed.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter of Pennsylvania.

       OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER

  Senator SPECTER. In exercising the Senate's prerogative to advise
and consent, I think we should evaluate Judge O'Connor on her
capacity to interpret the Constitution with respect to the legal
issues that will confront the next generation as well as this genera-
tion.

  Among the many difficult matters facing our society, none is
more important than bridging the "generation gap." The genius of
our Constitution is that it provides a framework for government
spanning generations, eras, centuries--which depends on the qual-
ity of judicial construction that is up to this tough task.

  Judge O'Connor, if confirmed at age 51, is likely to have a
pivotal part in applying the Constitution 10 years from now in
1991, 20 years from now in 2001, and perhaps even 30 years from
now in 2011.

   No one said it better than Justice Holmes in Abrams v. United
States, in 1919, when he wrote: "Time has upset many fighting
faiths." As highly charged and important as the issues of today are,
and there are many which fit that description, there will be totally
unpredictable matters which could confront this prospective Jus-
tice in the next two decades and beyond into the 21st century.
Accordingly, as I see it, our task is to confirm a Justice who has
the intelligence, training, temperament, and judgment to span that
generation gap.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   The President of the United States has designated the distin-
guished Attorney General of the United States, William French
Smith, to present his nominee, Sandra Day O'Connor, to the Senate
Judiciary Committee. I now request the Attorney General to pres-
ent the nominee to the Judiciary Committee.

   STATEMENT OF HON. WILLIAM FRENCH SMITH, ATTORNEY
                    GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES

   Attorney General SMITH. Mr. Chairman and members of the
committee, I am very pleased on behalf of the President to present
Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to this committee and to the Senate,
his nominee for the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States.

   In assisting the President with this nomination, in the weeks
before and the weeks after he made his decision, I had the occasion
                                              32

to become quite well acquainted with Judge O'Connor as a jurist,
as a scholar, as a person, and as a friend. I can certainly say that I
consider her to be highly qualified for this most important post.

   Throughout her career she has exemplified the quality of judicial
restraint which is most essential to the functioning of our form of
government. She has also demonstrated a very strong commitment
to the critical role that the States play in our Federal system.

   This is a very proud day for me personally, as it is for the
President and for the administration. We went out to find the very
best and, as I am confident you will see, we think we have done
just that with Judge Sandra Day O'Connor.

   Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   We will now hear from the distinguished Senator from Arizona,
the senior Senator, Senator Barry Goldwater.

   STATEMENT OF HON. BARRY GOLDWATER, A U.S. SENATOR
                      FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA

   Senator GOLDWATER. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I
am delighted and honored to have this opportunity to introduce to
you Judge Sandra O'Connor and to declare my unqualified endorse-
ment of her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.

   Mrs. O'Connor is a very fine judge. She has a legal and political
background, and is extremely well-admired in Arizona. Judge
O'Connor has done far more for the community than most women
or most men, and has received many awards from civic and reli-
gious groups. She has been married for 29 years, raised three sons,
and you could not find a more family-oriented person than she is.

   During these hearings, I think you will find Judge O'Connor to
have a deep love of our Constitution and a strong attachment to
the first principles that secure our liberties and form our unique
contribution to the science of government. Judge O'Connor's bal-
anced background enables her, more than most people, to appreci-
ate and understand the concepts and values which underlie both
the law and constitutional government.

   As a former trial judge, Mrs. O'Connor has the technical ability
to know what a civil or criminal proceeding is all about. In her
present position as a judge on the appeals court, she has demon-
strated proven competence in reviewing lower court decisions. As a
State court judge, Mrs. O'Connor brings a perspective to the U.S.
Supreme Court that is important to our federal system; and as a
former legislator, she comprehends the full meaning of representa-
tive government.

   Mr. Chairman, I have been acquainted with the O'Connor family
for many, many years. I know the Nation will be well-served if
your committee votes favorably on her nomination.

   Mr. Chairman, because Congressman John Rhodes has been de-
tained in Arizona, he has asked me to ask you to insert in the
record his statement relative to Judge O'Connor, and I thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the statement will be inserted
in the record.

                          Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court

        Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I want to thank you for this
opportunity to voice my support of the nomination of Mrs. Sandra Day O'Connor
to serve as an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court.

        It is fitting that an individual of Judge O'Connor's high standards
and eminent qualifications was nominated for this critically important position.
Having served as Arizona's Assistant Attorney General; in the State Senate; as
a Superior Court Judge; and as a presiding judge on the Arizona Court of
Appeals, she is, indeed, as the President so aptly noted, a person for all
seasons.

        It is Important to note that during these years of public service, Judge
O'Connor has served with distinction in a number of responsible positions outside
of government. She has been a member of Stanford University's Board of Trustees
and is currently President of the Board of Directors of the Heard Museum and a
member of the Board of Directors of the Phoenix Historical Society.

        Judge O'Connor's supporters represent a wide spectrum of political and
philosophical viewpoints -- a living testimony to her capabilities and to her
equitable approach to jurisprudence.

         As the first woman to be nominated to serve on the Supreme Court, it is a
historic occasion and one of immense satisfaction to all who applaud the President's
action. The Senate now has an opportunity to participate in this auspicious event.

         Our country has experienced many significant changes during its 200-year history,
and ratification of this nomination will join the list of exceptional milestones.
 I urge the Committee to act favorably on this matter.

  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished junior Senator from Arizona,
Mr. DeConcini.

    STATEMENT OF HON. DENNIS DeCONCINI, A U.S. SENATOR
                      FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA

   Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, my fellow colleagues of the
Judiciary Committee, it is a great pleasure to join with you and to
join Senator Goldwater today in introducing Sandra Day O'Connor
to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee for confirmation as an
Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is with a sense of
history that I find myself presenting to this committee Judge
O'Connor, who I believe is about to become the first woman Justice
on the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Judge O'Connor's qualifications are not that she is a woman,
although it is certainly long past due that the Supreme Court has
its first woman. In fact, the Supreme Court should have more than
just one woman.

   Judge O'Connor's qualifications are many. She has distinguished
herself as a judge both at the trial court level and at the appeals
court level; as a legislator, where she served as majority leader of
the Arizona State Senate and as chairman of one of the major
committees; as an attorney, both in private practice and in public
service; and as an active private citizen who is willing to devote her
time for the benefit of the public as a member of the National
Board of the Smithsonian Associates and as president of the board
of trustees of the Herd Museum in Phoenix, as well as a long list of
public and private service organizations too lengthy to go into
today.

   It should be noted that she has served in the executive, legisla-
tive, and judicial branches of Government with distinction. She has
gained from those experiences an invaluable insight of how each of
those branches of Government work, which will serve her in good
stead as a member of the Supreme Court. In addition, her public
service and private legal experience gives her an extremely broad-
based foundation for a truly outstanding career on the Supreme
Court.

   I have had the unique benefit of knowing of Judge O'Connor's
qualifications firsthand but I am certain that by the termination of
these hearings you, my fellow members of the Judiciary Commit-
tee, will be as convinced as I am that Judge O'Connor will make a
superb Supreme Court Justice and should be confirmed.

   At this time I would like to congratulate President Reagan for
nominating an outstanding candidate and for recognizing after all
the many, many years that there certainly should be a woman
sitting on the Supreme Court, and there will be.

   My personal experience with Judge O'Connor's legal ability oc-
curred when she was the assistant attorney general assigned to
advise the Governor of the State of Arizona, and I at the time was
the Governor's administrative assistant during the period 1965-66.
She was a Republican legal counsel for a Democratic Governor.
That situation many times creates problems that are frequently
unsolvable and that make relations unworkable but not with
Sandra O'Connor.
                                                   35

  To her credit, she was always hard-working, fair, intelligent,
conscientious, and I have to admit, correct. Her reputation was
outstanding. Her friends admired her for her ability and her hard
work. Her foes, although in disagreement with her sometimes,
always admitted that she was a true professional. Any criticism of
her today will not be directed toward her reputation, simply be-
cause that reputation is beyond reproach. She exhibits consummate
traits that are necessary for a professional, traits that will stand
her in good stead when she is sworn into and becomes a member of
the U.S. Supreme Court.

  When Justice Potter Stuart resigned from the Supreme Court, I
recommended that Judge O'Connor be considered for that very
important appointment. Again, even though we are of different
political parties it is necessary that we overcome any political,
partisan differences when appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court
are concerned. Therefore, as a Democrat I heartily commend a
Republican appointment and the superb Justice that Sandra
O'Connor will make. At a time like this, partisanship should be
shelved. I think you will see by the wholehearted support of the
Arizona delegation that certainly is not a question.

  A gage of her reputation is contained in a document entitled
"House Concurrent Memorial 2001" commending President Reagan
on his nomination of the Honorable Sandra Day O'Connor to the
U.S. Supreme Court and urging the U.S. Senate to swiftly confirm
her nomination.

  The memorial was passed with only three negative votes in the
two bodies of the Arizona Legislature, which consists of 90 men and
women. The memorial was passed with the almost total support of
Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, pro-life and
pro-choice proponents. These are the people that have worked with
her and know her integrity and her ability. I am inserting in the
record a copy of that memorial for the committee's consideration.

   Sandra is not just an outstanding professional, however. She is
accompanied here today by her husband, John O'Connor, a promi-
nent Phoenix lawyer; her three sons, Scott, Brian, and Jay; as well
as her sister, Ann Alexander and her brother-in-law, former State
Senator Scott Alexander, along with many friends from across the
country.

   Her record as a wife and a mother is commendable. The number
and quality of people who are here today from Arizona to testify in
Sandra's behalf are equally impressive: In addition to Senator
Goldwater, Congressman Morris K. Udall, chairman of the Interior
Committee; Congressman Bob Stump, who will have a statement
before these hearings are over; Congressman Eldon Rudd; Governor
Bruce Babbitt; Arizona State Senate President Leo Corbet, who
served in the State senate with Judge O'Connor; Mayor Margaret
Hance of Phoenix, the largest city having a woman mayor in the
United States; Senator Stan Turley, Arizona State senator who
served with Judge O'Connor in the State senate, and who has been
a leader in the pro-life movement; Senator Alfredo Gutierrez,
former Democratic majority leader of the Arizona State Senate;
Representative Donna Carlson West, Arizona House of Representa-
tives member, distinguished, who is a strong pro-life leader; Repre-
sentative Art Hamilton, the minority leader of the Arizona House
                                                    36

of Representatives, who has served with Sandra O'Connor; Repre-
sentative Tony West, a distinguished member of the Arizona House
of Representatives, who is also a strong pro-life leader; Jim
McNulty, former State senator who served with Judge O'Connor
and is one of the most prominent members of the Arizona Bar
Association, and now serves on the board of regents.

  In presenting Judge O'Connor to you today, my fellow colleagues,
I can only add that she has the extraordinary mix of intelligence,
industry, imagination, ingenuity, and integrity that will cause
those that are here 50 years from now to comment that Sandra
O'Connor was not only the first woman Justice of the U.S. Su-
preme Court but she was, more importantly, one of the best Jus-
tices. May I present Judge O'Connor.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. A Senator from West Virginia has made a re-
quest to make some remarks. We shall ask the distinguished Sena-
tor from West Virginia, Jennings Randolph, to come around at this
time.

  STATEMENT OF HON. JENNINGS RANDOLPH, A U.S. SENATOR
                 FROM THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA

  Senator RANDOLPH. Chairman Thurmond and members of the
committee, I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the com-
mittee on this historic occasion.

  For the first time in the 205 years of our Republic's existence,
the Senate is called on to judge the qualifications of a nominee to
the U.S. Supreme Court who is a woman. I regret that it has taken
more than two centuries to acknowledge through this nomination
that just as justice should be symbolically blindfolded when deter-
mining the facts, we should be oblivious to sex when selecting
those who administer justice.

  Mrs. Sandra O'Connor appears before you today as the choice of
the President of the United States, not solely because she is a
woman but because her record appears to qualify her to serve on
our Nation's highest tribunal. It would be naive to believe that if
Mrs. O'Connor is confirmed as an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court, that her sex will cease to be a factor in her decisions. She
will be urged to have feminist rulings; she will be criticized if she
makes them or if she resists this pressure.

  I look forward to the time when Justices of the Supreme Court
are selected and evaluated solely on their experience, their knowl-
edge of the law, and their dedication to the United States as a
nation governed by the laws the people impose on themselves.

  Mr. Chairman, when Mrs. O'Connor becomes a member of the
Supreme Court, she will have succeeded at long last in having a
woman occupy virtually every high office our country has to offer.
The most notable exception is the White House, and I anticipate
the day when the highest office in our land is not exclusively a
male preserve.

  A breakthrough occurred during the first week in March of 1933.
That was the time when I came first to Washington to serve as a
Member of the House of Representatives. It was on March 4 of that
year that President Franklin D. Roosevelt--I remind you of the
day he took office--that he broke another precedent by appointing
                                                    37

Frances Perkins as the first female Cabinet member during the
history of our country.

  She served for 12 years as Secretary of Labor. She repeatedly--
and I speak from experience--demonstrated the wisdom of Presi-
dent Roosevelt's action. Her constructive career made it easier for
other women who have subsequently served in the Cabinet.

  Mrs. O'Connor, I wish you well, not only during these hearings
and the Senate confirmation vote but during the challenging, per-
plexing years ahead. You will be called on to make many difficult
decisions but I am confident you will approach them with a spirit
of fairness, justice, and equity.

  I thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee.
  The CHAIRMAN. The U.S. House delegation in the Congress is
represented today by two of its Members. I shall now call upon
them: the first, Congressman Udall.

     STATEMENT OF HON. MORRIS K. UDALL, A MEMBER OF
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA

  Congressman UDALL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I have a short statement to which I have attached a newspaper
column that I wrote expressing my strong support for this nomi-
nee, and I would ask that it be put in the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, that will be done.
  Congressman UDALL. I will be very brief.
  Those arranging for Judge O'Connor's hearings today asked me
if I would testify and I said--the old cloakroom cliche--"I will
testify for or against, whichever would do the most good." [Laugh-
ter.]
  Apparently, it was decided that my appearance might help, and I
hope that is correct. I will try to get Senator Kennedy and Senator
Metzenbaum and some of my old allies in the proper frame of mind
to vote on this nomination. [Laughter.]
  There is an old story about Woodrow Wilson, the last year of his
life. Nobody had seen him; it was rumored that he was dead;
arguments were made that his wife was really running the coun-
try. A group of old Senators demanded to see for themselves his
condition. They had opposed Wilson on most things, including the
League of Nations.
  They were shown to the sickroom, and the leader of the delega-
tion said, "Mr. President, we want you to know that the entire
Senate is praying for you," and he said, "Which way, Senator,
which way?" [Laughter.]
  Therefore, all of us in Arizona are praying for Judge O'Connor.
We think it is a good appointment. She has a great judicial tem-
perament. She can be tough but she is gentle. She clearly is
conservative but she never has placed partisan political values
before justice, and those who practice in her court describe her as a
practical, conscientious, fair, open-minded judge.
  Mr. Chairman, you will make no mistake in confirming the
President's nomination of Judge O'Connor, and I strongly urge that
course upon you.
  [Material to be supplied follows:]
                                         [From the Washington Post, July 13, 1981]

                                                    A MASTER STROKE

   "Arizona Judge Sandra O'Connor, Nominated for Supreme Court, Will Be First
Woman Justice," the headlines say, and my phone rings a little more these days.
"Who is she, what is she like, and what does this mean for the court and for the
political future of Ronald Reagan?"

  I'll try to shed some light.
  I'm a lawyer and a fellow Arizonan, and while I'm not a close friend of the
nominee, we are acquaintances. I know her through her reputation and her very
successful career in public service and as a community leader.
  When people as politically diverse as Barry Goldwater, John Rhodes, Ted Kenne-
dy and I can all support a Supreme Court nominee, it's got to be remarkable. But
she will be opposed. The New Right, the Moral Majority and Phyllis Schlafly will go
after her with a vengence that is their particular trademark.
  Nevertheless, I expect Mrs. O'Connor will, and ought to be, confirmed.
  To understand some of what I have to say, you must understand some basic
things about the Arizona Republican Party. A moderate Republican friend of mine
told me in Tucson not long ago that the party had split into two camps: conservative
and very conservative. "The very conservative believe nothing should be done for
the first time," he said, "and the conservatives believe that a few things should be
done for the first time, but not now."
  The point of this is that Sandra O'Connor is a conservative Arizona Republican,
but she is a sensible conservative, and in her career in the Arizona Legislature she
is said to have had a vote or two that could have been deemed pro-abortion. And she
is said to have supported the Equal Rights Amendment early on.
  She has a good judicial temperament. She can be tough. She clearly is a conserv-
ative, but she has never placed partisan political values before justice. Those who
practice in her court describe her as practical, conscientious, fair and open-minded.
  Justice Rehnquist, on the other hand, is one of the brightest men I have ever met,
but he is an ideologue who brings a passionate point of view to every case before
him, and that point of view is always conservative. O'Connor has a reputation for
treating the law in a businesslike way. She may be a kind of balance-wheel when
the "brethren" lock the doors and begin to argue the disposition of important cases.
  Arizona, a small state, has produced an amazing number of national candidates,
congressional leaders and national spokesmen. I think part of the explanation is
that Arizona always has enjoyed a civilized kind of politics. Washington is often
confounded at the contrasts, but in Arizona, it's taken for granted. The first woman
chief justice of a state supreme court was Lorna Lockwood of Arizona. Sandra
O'Connor was the first woman majority leader in a state legislature. Margaret
Hance, the mayor of Phoenix, was perhaps the first female big city mayor in the
country, or certainly one of the first.
  Sandra O'Connor and the Arizona Republicans in the conservative group are not
Moral Majority types, but they are conservative when it comes to social and eco-
nomic issues.
  My Democratic friends ought to be grateful for this appointment. It's almost
inconceivable to me that they could do any better. Ronald Reagan isn't going to
appoint liberal Democrats. He's going to appoint people to the right of center
wherever he can.
  The appointment of O'Connor is a master stroke, comparable to Richard Nixon's
going to China. It shows a flexibility, a bigness, that the Ronald Reagan sterotype
doesn't recognize. It shows a political savvy on the part of the president that I had
assumed was not there. I'm certain that women political activists also doubted it
was there.
  Lyndon Johnson had an opportunity to appoint a woman and didn't. Kennedy had
the same opportunity and passed it by. So did Nixon. So did Ford. But Ronald
Reagan said he would appoint a woman, and he did.
  John East and Jerry Falwell will never say yes to Sandra O'Connor. But that
won't matter, because they'll make up with Reagan eventually anyway. Where else
would they go?
  On the other hand, the president, in one stroke, has deflected criticism from
liberals and from women, two of his principal antagonists. Their silence won't last
forever, but the edge has been dulled.
  Does the appointment of Sandra O'Connor bother me? No, it doesn't. My liberal
friends who might be upset fail, I think, to make a distinction between the electoral
process and the judicial process. Electing someone who is conservative is one thing,
but the process of deciding the controversies that come before the Supreme Court is
                                              39

quite another. In the latter case, it's the ability to understand and apply the law
that counts. Sandra O'Connor's competence in this respect is not questioned.

  Jerry Falwell and crew are demanding some guarantee that O'Connor will decide
cases to their liking, and that's not what the system is all about. Barry Goldwater
was right when he said, "I don't buy this idea that a justice of the Supreme Court
has to stand for this, that or the other thing." Goldwater understands the constitu-
tional job of the court. I wish Falwell could grasp Barry's meaning.

  You can tell a lot about people and even draw a profile by the company they keep
and the affiliations they make. Her resume has these kinds of entries: prosecutor,
legislator and state senate leader, civilian employee with the U.S. Army in Ger-
many, juvenile judge, Republican Party official, board of Smithsonian Associates,
Salvation Army, Soroptomists Club, Arizona Academy, Junior League, board of Blue
Cross-Blue Shield, board of directors of the First National Bank, elected Woman of
the Year and recipient of the annual award from the Phoenix Conference of Chris-
tians and Jews. And there is much more.

   It may be a cliche, but in the case of Sandra O'Connor, she really is a pillar of the
community. A consistent, decent, hard-working lawmaker, politician, mother, wife,
lawyer, public servant and judge.

  When one looks at Sandra O'Connor, studies her brand of Republicanism and
knows the Republican friends she keeps, it was little wonder that someone in the
White House called her "too good to be true."

   Like I said earlier, Washington may have been a bit surprised, but out in Arizona,
we take the Sandra O'Connors for granted.

  The CHAIRMAN. Congressman Rudd of Arizona.

      STATEMENT OF HON. ELDON D. RUDD, A MEMBER OF
              CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA

   Congressman RUDD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the committee, I am
very pleased to have this opportunity to appear before this commit-
tee today, and also pleased to see you in that seat, Mr. Chairman.
   I am glad to express my wholehearted support for the nomina-
tion of my constituent, Sandra O'Connor, to be Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I have known
Judge O'Connor for a number of years, as a political campaigner,
as a distinguished legislator in the State of Arizona, and as a
distinguished jurist in the Arizona court system. I have supported
her in her actions in all of these positions.
   She has excelled in every task that she has undertaken: as
assistant State attorney general, as leader of the State legislature,
and as an outstanding jurist in the court of appeals. In all of these
positions she has shown devotion to the constitutional processes
which govern this Nation, and I am certain that Judge O'Connor
will bring the same integrity and the same wisdom to the high
court that she did to all branches of the State government of
Arizona.
   Judge O'Connor is a serious student of the law and her record
gives evidence of her strict interpretation of the role of the judici-
ary. Her varied experiences in government have given depth to her
views, and I believe this makes her especially well-qualified for the
position. Her nomination is indeed a testimonial to President Rea-
gan's commitment to a stable and responsive government. I urge
her confirmation as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The CHAIRMAN. The Judiciary Committee has received a number
of resolutions from various groups, and without objection, they will
be placed in the record. Among those are a few I hold in my hand
at this time: One by the board of governors of the State Bar of
Arizona; one by the board of directors of the Maricopa County Bar

Dear Sandra:

                   The Arizona Judges Association would like to send
a resolution in support of your nomination to the United
States Supreme Court if you believe it would be helpful and
agree that it should be sent. Enclosed please find a proposed
form of Resolution which we tried to keep short enough to be
read but long enough to touch upon the important points.

                   Our purpose is to help. If you believe no resolution
should be sent we understand. Likewise, if you believe the
language should be altered in any particular that can be done.

                   Also, the Resolution can be signed by me as
President of the Association or left unsigned with a covering
transmittal letter, whichever you prefer.

                   If you agree that the Resolution should be sent we
would anticipate sending it to Senator Strom Thurmond as
Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary with copies
to Senators Goldwater and DeConcini and the Attorney General.
If a different form of transmittal is appropriate or other
persons should be sent copies, such as the President, we would
certainly be guided by your wishes.

                   If timing is also a consideration, please let me know.

                                                        Sincerely,

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, the time has now come for you
to testify. Will you stand and be sworn?

  Raise your right hand.
  Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?
  Judge O'CONNOR. I do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, we will now give you the oppor-
tunity to present an opening statement if you care to do so.

TESTIMONY OF HON. SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR, NOMINATED TO
      BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to do
so, with your leave and permission.

  Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
I would like to begin my brief opening remarks by expressing my
gratitude to the President for nominating me to be an Associate
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, and my appreciation and
thanks to you and to all the members of this committee for your
courtesy and for the privilege of meeting with you.

  As the first woman to be nominated as a Supreme Court Justice,
I am particularly honored, and I happily share the honor with
millions of American women of yesterday and of today whose abili-
ties and whose conduct have given me this opportunity for service.
As a citizen and as a lawyer and as a judge, I have from afar
always regarded the Court with the reverence and with the respect
to which it is so clearly entitled because of the function it serves. It
is the institution which is charged with the final responsibility of
insuring that basic constitutional doctrines will always be honored
and enforced. It is the body to which all Americans look for the
ultimate protection of their rights. It is to the U.S. Supreme Court
that we all turn when we seek that which we want most from our
Government: equal justice under the law.

  If confirmed by the Senate, I will apply all my abilities to insure
that our Government is preserved; that justice under our Constitu-
tion and the laws of this land will always be the foundation of that
Government.

  I want to make only one substantive statement to you at this
time. My experience as a State court judge and as a State legislator
has given me a greater appreciation of the important role the
States play in our federal system, and also a greater appreciation
of the separate and distinct roles of the three branches of govern-
ment at both the State and the Federal levels. Those experiences
have strengthened my view that the proper role of the judiciary is
one of interpreting and applying the law, not making it.

  If confirmed, I face an awesome responsibility ahead. So, too,
does this committee face a heavy responsibility with respect to my
nomination. I hope to be as helpful to you as possible in responding
to your questions on my background and my beliefs and my views.
There is, however, a limitation on my responses which I am com-
pelled to recognize. I do not believe that as a nominee I can tell
you how I might vote on a particular issue which may come before
the Court, or endorse or criticize specific Supremv Court decisions
presenting issues which may well come before the Court again. To
                                          58

do so would mean that I have prejudged the matter or have moral-
ly committed myself to a certain position. Such a statement by me
as to how I might resolve a particular issue or what I might do in a
future Court action might make it necessary for me to disqualify
myself on the matter. This would result in my inability to do my
sworn duty; namely, to decide cases that come before the Court.
Finally, neither you nor I know today the precise way in which any
issue will present itself in the future, or what the facts or argu-
ments may be at that time, or how the statute being interpreted
may read. Until those crucial factors become known, I suggest that
none of us really know how we would resolve any particular issue.
At the very least, we would reserve judgment at that time.

  On a personal note, if the chairman will permit it, I would now
like to say something to you about my family and introduce them
to you.

  The CHAIRMAN. I would be very pleased to have you introduce
the members of your family at this time, Judge O'Connor.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  By way of preamble, I would note that some of the media have
reported correctly that I have performed some marriage ceremo-
nies in my capacity as a judge. I would like to read to you an
extract from a part of the form of marriage ceremony which I
prepared:

  Marriage is far more than an exchange of vows. It is the foundation of the family,
mankind's basic unit of society, the hope of the world and the strength of our
country. It is the relationship between ourselves and the generations which follow.

  This statement, Mr. Chairman, represents not only advice I give
to the couples who have stood before me but my view of all families
and the importance of families in our lives and in our country. My
nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court has brought my own very
close family even closer together, and I would like to introduce
them to you, if I may.

  My oldest son, Scott, if you would stand, please.
  The CHAIRMAN. Stand as your names are called.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Scott graduated from Stanford two years ago.
He was our State swimming champion. He is now a young busi-
nessman, a pilot, and a budding gourmet cook.
  Now my second son, Brian, is a senior at Colorado College. He is
our adventurer. He is a skydiver with over 400 jumps, including a
dive off El Capitan at Yosemite last summer. I look forward to his
retirement from that activity [laughter] so he can spend more time
in his other status as a pilot.
  Now my youngest son, Jay, is a sophomore at Stanford. He is our
writer, and he acted as my assistant press secretary after the news
of the nomination surfaced and did a very good job keeping all of
us quiet. If I could promise you that I could decide cases as well as
Jay can ski or swing a golf club, I think that we would have no
further problem in the hearing.
  Finally, I would like to introduce my dear husband, John. We
met on a law review assignment at Stanford University Law School
and will celebrate our 29th wedding anniversary in December.
John has been totally and unreservedly and enthusiastically sup-
portive of this whole nomination and this endeavor, and for that I
am very grateful. Without it, it would not have been possible.
                                          59

  I would like to introduce my sister, Ann Alexander, and her
husband, Scott Alexander. They live in Tucson, and are the repre-
sentatives of my close family at this hearing.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I
would like to thank you for allowing me this time and this opportu-
nity. I would now be happy to respond to your questions.

  The CHAIRMAN. We will now have questioning of the nominee by
members of the committee. I presume before we go into this, the
members of the committee who accompany you there will prefer to
return to their seats or elsewhere.

  There will be two rounds of questions of 15 minutes each by the
respective members of the committee; then, possibly it may be
necessary to go a little further.

  Judge O'Connor, the chairman will begin by propounding certain
questions to you. We have a timing light system here, which will
confine each member to 15 minutes. When the light turns yellow,
it means we have 1 minute left; when it turns red, it means the
time is up and the gavel will fall at that time.

           EXPERIENCE IN ALL THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT

  Judge O'Connor, you have been nominated to serve on the high-
est court in our country. What experience qualifies you to be a
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, I suppose I can say that noth-
ing in my experience has adequately prepared me for this appear-
ance before the distinguished committee or for the extent of the
media attention to the nomination. However, I hope that if I am
confirmed by the Senate, and when the marble doors of the Su-
preme Court close following that procedure, that my experience in
all three branches of State government will provide some very
useful background for assuming the awesome responsibility of an
Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

   My experience as an assistant attorney general in the executive
branch of State government and my experience as a State legisla-
tor in the Arizona State Senate and as senate majority leader of
that body, my experience as a trial court judge in the Superior
Court of Maricopa County and my experience as a judge in the
Arizona Court of Appeals in the appellate process, have given me a
greater appreciation for the concept and the reality of the checks
and balances of the three branches of government. I appreciate
those very keenly.

  My experience in State government has also given me a greater
appreciation, as I have indicated, for the strengths and the needs of
our federal system of government, which envisions, of course, an
important role for the States in that process.

   My experience on the trial court bench dealing with the realities
of criminal felony cases and with domestic relations cases and with
general civil litigation has taught me how our system of justice
works at its most basic level.

  I hope and I trust that those experiences are valuable ones in
relation to the work of the U.S. Supreme Court as the final arbiter
of Federal and constitutional law as it is applied in both the State
and the Federal courts throughout the Nation.

   The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, the phrase "judicial activism"
refers to the practice of the judicial branch substituting its own
policy preferences for those of elected Representatives. Would you
comment on this practice in the Federal courts and state your
views on the proper role of the Supreme Court in our system of
government?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, I have of course made some
written comments about this in the committee's questionnaire, and
in addition to those comments I would like to say that I believe in
the doctrine and philosophy of the separation of powers. It is part
of the genius of our system.

   The balance of powers concept and the checks and balances
provided by each of the three branches of Government in relation
to each other is really crucial to our system. In order for the
system to work, it seems to me that each branch of Government
has a great responsibility in striving to carry out its own role and
not to usurp the role of the other branches of Government.

   Certainly each branch has a very significant role in upholding
the Constitution. It is not just the judicial branch of Government
that has work to do in upholding the Constitution. It is indeed the
Congress and the executive branch as well.

   It is the role and function, it seems to me, of the legislative
branch to determine public policy; and it is the role and function of
the judicial branch, in my view, to interpret the enactments of the
legislative branch and to apply them, and insofar as possible to
determine any challenges to the constitutionality of those legisla-
tive enactments.

   In carrying out the judicial function, I believe in the exercise of
judicial restraint. For example, cases should be decided on grounds
other than constitutional grounds where that is possible. In gener-
al, Mr. Chairman, I believe in the importance of the limited role of
Government generally, and in the institutional restraints on the
judiciary in particular.

              PERSONAL AND JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY ON ABORTION

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, there has been much discussion
regarding your views on the subject of abortion. Would you discuss
your philosophy on abortion, both personal and judicial, and ex-
plain your actions as a State senator in Arizona on certain specific
matters: First, your 1970 committee vote in favor of House bill No.
20, which would have repealed Arizona's felony statutes on abor-
tion. Then I have three other instances I will inquire about.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Very well. May I preface my response by
saying that the personal views and philosophies, in my view, of a
Supreme Court Justice and indeed any judge should be set aside
insofar as it is possible to do that in resolving matters that come
before the Court.

  Issues that come before the Court should be resolved based on
the facts of that particular case or matter and on the law applica-
ble to those facts, and any constitutional principles applicable to
those facts. They should not be based on the personal views and
ideology of the judge with regard to that particular matter or issue.
                                          61

  Now, having explained that, I would like to say that my own
view in the area of abortion is that I am opposed to it as a matter
of birth control or otherwise. The subject of abortion is a valid one,
in my view, for legislative action subject to any constitutional
restraints or limitations.

  I think a great deal has been written about my vote in a Senate
Judiciary Committee in 1970 on a bill called House bill No. 20,
which would have repealed Arizona's abortion statutes. Now in
reviewing that, I would like to state first of all that that vote
occurred some 11 years ago, to be exact, and was one which was
not easily recalled by me, Mr. Chairman. In fact, the committee
records when I looked them up did not reflect my vote nor that of
other members, with one exception.

   It was necessary for me, then, to eventually take time to look at
news media accounts and determine from a contemporary article a
reflection of the vote on that particular occasion. The bill did not
go to the floor of the Senate for a vote; it was held in the Senate
Caucus and the committee vote was a vote which would have taken
it out of that committee with a recommendation to the full Senate.

   The bill is one which concerned a repeal of Arizona's then stat-
utes which made it a felony, punishable by from 2 to 5 years in
prison, for anyone providing any substance or means to procure a
miscarriage unless it was necessary to save the life of the mother.
It would have, for example, subjected anyone who assisted a young
woman who, for instance, was a rape victim in securing a D. & C.
procedure within hours or even days of that rape.

   At that time I believed that some change in Arizona statutes was
appropriate, and had a bill been presented to me that was less
sweeping than House bill No. 20, I would have supported that. It
was not, and the news accounts reflect that I supported the com-
mittee action in putting the bill out of committee, where it then
died in the caucus.

   I would say that my own knowledge and awareness of the issues
and concerns that many people have about the question of abortion
has increased since those days. It was not the subject of a great
deal of public attention or concern at the time it came before the
committee in 1970. I would not have voted, I think, Mr. Chairman,
for a simple repealer thereafter.

   The CHAIRMAN. NOW the second instance was your cosponsorship
in 1973 of Senate bill No. 1190, which would have provided family
planning services, including surgical procedures, even for minors
without parental consent.

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senate bill No. 1190 in 1973 was a bill in which
the prime sponsor was from the city of Tucson, and it had nine
other cosigners on the bill. I was one of those cosigners.

   I viewed the bill as a bill which did not deal with abortion but
which would have established as a State policy in Arizona, a policy
of encouraging the availability of contraceptive information to
people generally. The bill at the time, I think, was rather loosely
drafted, and I can understand why some might read it and say,
"What does this mean?"

   That did not particularly concern me at the time because I knew
that the bill would go through the committee process and be
amended substantially before we would see it again. That was a
                                              62

rather typical practice, at least in the Arizona legislature. Indeed,
the bill was assigned to a public health and welfare committee
where it was amended in a number of respects.

  It did not provide for any surgical procedure for an abortion, as
has been reported inaccurately by some. The only reference in the
bill to a surgical procedure was the following. It was one that said:

  A physician may perform appropriate surgical procedures for the prevention of
conception upon any adult who requests such procedure in writing.

  That particular provision, I believe, was subsequently amended
out in committee but, be that as it may, it was in the bill on
introduction.

  Mr. Chairman, I supported the availability of contraceptive infor-
mation to the public generally. Arizona had a statute or statutes
on the books at that time, in 1973, which did restrict rather dra-
matically the availability of information about contraception to the
public generally. It seemed to me that perhaps the best way to
avoid having people who were seeking abortions was to enable
people not to become pregnant unwittingly or without the inten-
tion of doing so.

  The CHAIRMAN. The third instance, your 1974 vote against House
Concurrent Memorial No. 2002, which urged Congress to pass a
constitutional amendment against abortion.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, as you perhaps recall, the Rowe
v. Wade decision was handed down in 1973. I would like to mention
that in that year following that decision, when concerns began to
be expressed, I requested the preparation in 1973 of Senate bill No.
1333 which gave hospitals and physicians and employees the right
not to participate in or contribute to any abortion proceeding if
they chose not to do so and objected, notwithstanding their employ-
ment. That bill did pass the State Senate and became law.

  The following year, in 1974, less than a year following the Rowe
v. Wade decision, a House Memorial was introduced in the Arizona
House of Representatives. It would have urged Congress to amend
the Constitution to provide that the word person in the 5th and
14th amendments applies to the unborn at every stage of develop-
ment, except in an emergency when there is a reasonable medical
certainty that continuation of the pregnancy would cause the death
of the mother. The amendment was further amended in the Senate
Judiciary Committee.

   I did not support the memorial at that time, either in committee
or in the caucus.

  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me. My time is up, but you are right in
the midst of your question. We will finish abortion, one more
instance, and we will give the other members the same additional
time, if you will proceed.

  Judge O'CONNOR. I voted against it, Mr. Chairman, because I was
not sure at that time that we had given the proper amount of
reflection or consideration to what action, if any, was appropriate
by way of a constitutional amendment in connection with the Rowe
v. Wade decision.

  It seems to me, at least, that amendments to the Constitution are
very serious matters and should be undertaken after a great deal
of study and thought, and not hastily. I think a tremendous
amount of work needs to go into the text and the concept being
                                                    63

expressed in any proposed amendment. I did not feel at that time
that that kind of consideration had been given to the measure. I
understand that the Congress is still wrestling with that issue after
some years from that date, which was in 1974.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW the last instance is concerning a vote in
1974 against a successful amendment to a stadium construction bill
which limited the availability of abortions.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Also in 1974, which was an active year in the
Arizona Legislature with regard to the issue of abortion, the
Senate had originated a bill that allowed the University of Arizona
to issue bonds to expand its football stadium. That bill passed the
State Senate and went to the House of Representatives.
   In the House it was amended to add a nongermane rider which
would have prohibited the performance of abortions in any facility
under the jurisdiction of the Arizona Board of Regents. When the
measure returned to the Senate, at that time I was the Senate
majority leader and I was very concerned because the whole sub-
ject had become one that was controversial within our own mem-
bership.
   I was concerned as majority leader that we not encourage a
practice of the addition of nongermane riders to Senate bills which
we had passed without that kind of a provision. Indeed, Arizona's
constitution has a provision which prohibits the putting together of
bills or measures or riders dealing with more than one subject. I
did oppose the addition by the House of the nongermane rider
when it came back.
   It might be of interest, though, to know, Mr. Chairman, that also
in 1974 there was another Senate bill which would have provided
for a medical assistance program for the medically needy. That was
Senate bill No. 1165. It contained a provision that no benefits
would be provided for abortions except when deemed medically
necessary to save the life of the mother, or where the pregnancy
had resulted from rape, incest, or criminal action. I supported that
bill together with that provision and the measure did pass and
become law.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. My time is up. We will now call
upon Senator Biden.
   Senator BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                                       JUDICIAL ACTIVISM

  Judge, it is somewhat in vogue these days to talk about judicial
activism and judicial intervention, usurpation of legislative respon-
sibility and authority, et cetera.

   When those terms are used, and they are--although the chair-
man did define his meaning of judicial activism--I suspect you
would get different definitions of judicial activism from different
members of the committee and the academic and judicial profes-
sions. One of the things I would just like to point out as this
questioning proceeds is that judicial activism is a two-edged sword.

  There is the instance where the judiciary determines that al-
though there is no law that the Congress or a State legislature has
passed on a particular issue, that there in fact should be one, and
                                                    64

the judge decides to take it upon himself or herself to, through the
process of a judicial decision, in effect institute a legislative prac-
tice.

  There is also the circumstance where there are laws on the books
that the judiciary has, in a very creative vein, in varying jurisdic-
tions and on the Federal bench, constructed rationales for avoiding.
However, today when we talk about judicial activism what comes
to mind in almost everyone's mind is the Warren Court and liberal
activists.

  You are about to be confronted, I would humbly submit, by what
I would characterize as conservative activists who do not believe
they are being activists; who do not believe that they are in fact
suggesting that judges should usurp the power of the Congress;
who do not believe that they are suggesting that there should be a
usurpation of legislative authority when in fact, I would respectful-
ly submit, you will soon find that that is exactly what they are
suggesting.

  For example, in your William & Mary Law Review article you
discussed the role of the State courts relative to the Federal courts
and you believe, if I can oversimplify it, that Federal courts should
give more credence, in effect, to State court decisions interpreting
the Federal Constitution. You seem somewhat worried about the
expansion by the Congress of litigation in the Federal courts under
42 United States Code, section 1983, the civil rights statute.

  Then you go on to say, "Unless Congress decides to limit the
availability of relief under that statute . . .," and you go from
there. I am wondering whether or not you would consider yourself
as a judicial activist if on the Court you followed through with your
belief--as I understand the article--that there is in fact too wide
an expansion of access to the Federal courts under the civil rights
statute, whether or not you would implement that belief, absent
the amendment by Congress of the civil rights statute to which you
referred. Would you be an activist in that circumstance, if you
limited access to the Federal courts under the civil rights statutes
absent a congressional change in the law?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Biden, as a judge I would not feel that
it was my role or function to in effect amend the statute to achieve
a goal which I may feel is desirable in the sense or terms of public
policy.

  Senator BIDEN. Right.
  Judge O'CONNOR. I would not feel that that was my appropriate
function. If I have suggested that Congress might want to consider
doing something, then I would feel that it is indeed Congress which
should make that decision and I would not feel free as a judge to,
in effect, expand or restrict a particular statute to reflect my own
views of what the goals of sound public policy should be.
  Senator BIDEN. I thank you for that answer because I fear that--
although it probably would be clarified in subsequent questioning--
my fear as this hearing began was that we would confuse the
substantive issue of judicial activism, usurpation which should be
addressed, and which I think has occurred in many instances, with
a rigid view of an ideological disposition of a particular judge. A
conservative judge can be a judicial activist. A conservative can be
a judicial activist, just as a liberal judge could be a judicial activist.
                                                    65

  In trying to examine the criteria which should be useds in terms
of fulfilling our responsibility as U.S. Senators in this committee
under the Constitution, performing our role of advice and consent,
a professor at the University of Virginia Law School summarized
what he considered to be some of the criteria. Let me just cite to
you what his criteria are:

  He says first, the professional qualifications are integrity, profes-
sional competence, judicial temperament and legal, intellectual,
and professional credentials. Second, he mentions the nominee
being a public person, one whose experience and outlook enables
her to mediate between tradition and change and preserve the best
of the social law and social heritage while accommodating law for
the change in need and change in perception. Third, she would in
some ways provide a mirror of the American people to whom
people with submerged aspirations and suppressed rights can look
with confidence and hope.

  In a general sense, do you agree with those criteria as set out?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I agree that it is important for the
American people to have confidence in the judiciary. It appears to
me that at times in recent decades some of that confidence has
been lacking. I think it is important that we have people on the
bench at all levels whom the public generally can respect and
accept and who are regarded as being ultimately fair in their
determination of the issues to come before the courts. For that
reason, judicial selection is a terribly important function at the
Federal as well as the State levels.

   Senator BIDEN. Judge, in response to the questionnaire you
stated--and I think you essentially restated it to the chairman a
moment ago--that judges are "required to avoid substituting their
own view of what is desirable in a particular case for that of the
legislature, the branch of government appropriately charged with
making decisions of public policy."

   I assume from that you do not mean to suggest that you as a
Supreme Court judge would shrink from declaring unconstitutional
a law passed by the Congress that you felt did not comport with
the Constitution.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, that is the underlying obligation of
the U.S. Supreme Court. If indeed the case presents that issue, if
there are no other grounds or means for resolving it other than the
constitutional issue, then the Court is faced squarely with making
that decision.

   I am sure that such a decision, namely to invalidate an enact-
ment of this body, is never one undertaken by the Court lightly. It
is not anything that I believe any member of that Court would
want to do unless the constitutional requirements were such that it
was necessary, in their view. I think there have been only, perhaps,
100 instances in our Nation's history, indeed, when the Court has
invalidated particular Acts of Congress.

   Senator BIDEN. There have been many more instances where
they have invalidated acts of State legislatures.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes, that is true.
   Senator BIDEN. The second concern I have with your view of
what constitutes activism on the Court and of what your role as a
Supreme Court Justice would be is that it seems, from the com-
                                                66

ments by many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle over the
past several years and the comments in the press, that the Su-
preme Court should not have a right to change public policy absent
a statutory dictate to do so.

  I wonder whether or not there are not times when the Supreme
Court would find it appropriate--in spite of the fact that there
have been no intervening legislative actions--to reverse a decision,
a public policy decision, that it had 5, 10, 20, or 100 years previous-
ly confirmed as being in line with the Constitution.

  A case in point: In 1954, after about 60 years and with no major
intervening Federal statute, to the best of my knowledge, the Su-
preme Court said in Brown v. The Board of Education of Topeka
that the "separate but equal" doctrine adopted in the Plessy v.
Ferguson case has no place in the field of public education.

  Here is a case where, as I understand it, there was no interven-
ing statutory requirement suggesting that "separate but equal" be
disbanded, and where the Court up to that very moment--with a
single exception involving a law student and where that law stu-
dent could sit, to the best of my knowledge--where the Court had
up to that time held consistently that "separate but equal" was
equal and did comport with the constitutional guarantees of the
14th amendment, then decided that that is no longer right.

  They changed social policy; a fundamental change in the view of
civil rights and civil liberties in this country was initiated by a
court. It was not initiated by a court, it was brought by plaintiffs,
but the action of changing the policy was almost totally at the
hands of the Supreme Court of the United States.

  I wonder, first, whether or not you would characterize that as
judicial activism and if so, was it right? If not, if it was not judicial
activism, how would you characterize it, in order for me to have a
better perception of what your view of the role of the Court is
under what circumstances, so that you do not get caught up in the
self-proclaimed definitions of what is activism and what is not that
are being bandied about by me and others in the U.S. Senate and
many of the legal scholars writing on this subject?

  Judge O'CONNOR. The Brown v. Board of Education cases in 1954
involved a determination, as I understand it, by the Supreme Court
that its previous interpretation of the meaning of the 14th amend-
ment, insofar as the equal protection clause was concerned, had
been erroneously decided previously in Plessy v. Ferguson so many
years before.

  I do not know that the Court believed that it was engaged in
judicial activism in the sense of attempting to change social or
public policy but rather I assume that it believed it was exercising
its constitutional function to determine the meaning, if you will, of
the Constitution and in this instance an amendment to the Consti-
tution. That, I assume, is the basis upon which the case was decid-
ed.

  Some have characterized it as you have stated, as judicial activ-
ism. The plain fact of the matter is that it was a virtually unani-
mous decision, as I recall, by Justices who became convinced on the
basis of their research into the history of the 14th amendment that
indeed separate facilities were inherently unequal in the field of
                                                      67

public education. For that reason it rendered the decision that it
did.

  This has occurred in other instances throughout the Court's his-
tory. I am sure many examples come to mind, and I think by
actual count they may approach about 150 instances in which the
Court has reversed itself on some constitutional doctrine over the
years, or in some instances doctrine or holdings that were not
those of constitutional dimension.

  Senator BIDEN. If I can interrupt you just for a moment, I think
you are making the distinction with a difference, and I think it is
an important distinction to be made. I just want to make sure that
I understand what you are saying, and that is that, as I understand
what you are saying, social changes--the postulates that Roscoe
Pound spoke of--those societal changes that occur regarding social
mores must in some way, at some point, be reflected in the law. If
they are not, the law will no longer reflect the view of the people.

  It seems as though we should understand that when in fact the
legislative bodies of this country have failed in their responibili-
ties--as they did in the civil rights area--to react to the change,
the change in the mores of the times, and see to it that that is
reflected in the law, on those rare occasions it is proper for the
Court to step in.

  As Judge Colin Sites of the third circuit said, "It is understand-
ably difficult to maintain rigid judicial restraint when presented
with a citizen's grievance crying out for redress after prolonged
inaction for inappropriate reasons by other branches of Govern-
ment."

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, Senator, with all due respect I do not
believe that it is the function of the judiciary to step in and change
the law because the times have changed or the social mores have
changed, and I did not intend to suggest that by my answer but
rather to indicate that I believe that on occasion the Court has
reached changed results interpreting a given provision of the Con-
stitution based on its research of what the true meaning of that
provision is--based on the intent of the framers, its research on the
history of that particular provision. I was not intending to suggest
that those changes were being made because some other branch
had failed to make the change as a matter of social policy.

   Senator BIDEN. Yes, I am suggesting that. My time is up. Maybe
on my second round we can come back and explore that a little
more.

  Thank you very much, Judge.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Senator Mathias.

                         IMPACT OF LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND

  Senator MATHIAS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Taking up, Judge O'Connor, where Senator Biden left off, I seem
to recall that Blackstone--if it is not too conservative to quote
Blackstone--once said that the law is the highest expression of the
ethic of the Nation. Determining exactly what that law is or what
that ethic is is, of course, the job that you will face.
   One of the frequent tasks of the Supreme Court is to define the
intent of Congress, to define the will of Congress in a given legisla-
tive expression. Senator Thurmond has pointed out that you will be
the first nominee to the Court in 43 years to have had legislative
experience. How do you think your legislative background is going
to impact on your approach to this particular aspect of the job of a
Justice?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, I think, Senator Mathias, it would impact
in much the same way it has in my role as a State court judge. I do
well understand, I think, the difference between legislating and
judging.

  As a legislator it was my task to vote on public policy issues and
to try to translate into statutory form certain precepts that were
developed as a matter of social or public policy in ways which
would then govern the residents of our State.

   As a judge it is not my function to continue to try to develop
public policy by means of making the law. It is simply my role to
interpret the laws which the legislature has passed, to try to do
that in accordance with the intent of the framers.

   I have discovered that that is not always easy and that some-
times legislators fail to express their intention as clearly as one
might like. Sometimes legislators--because all of us are human--
fail to think about another situation that might arise that would be
impacted by the legislation. Then the judge is left with the duty of
trying to interpret the intent as best he or she can in carrying out
the apparent intent of the legislature.

  Senator MATHIAS. Well, of course, you are right that legislators--
and I bear my full share of the responsibility for this--legislators
do not always express in their drafting the precise intent of a given
statutory enactment, and that casts upon the court an extra
burden, a burden both in volume and in the quality of interpreta-
tion of law.

  However, beyond that question of draftsmanship there is often
some doubt in the minds of legislators as to the constitutionality of
an enactment. I am sure this never happens in the Arizona legisla-
ture but it does occasionally happen around here, that people will
say:

  Well, I am not sure whether this is constitutional or not but I think it is a good
idea, and therefore I am going to vote for it because there is always the Supreme
Court who will make the ultimate decision about the constitutionality.

  Now Chief Justice Burger has written that:

  In the performance of assigned constitutional duties, each branch of Government
must initially interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of its power by any
branch is due great respect from the others.

  Having in mind the fact that we, as legislators, know that some-
times we make a jump in the dark on the constitutional question,
how do you feel about Chief Justice Burger's statement?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I appreciate the problem that you are
talking about. Indeed, in the Arizona Legislature it was not uncom-
mon that legislators would say, "Well, we have no idea if it is
constitutional. Maybe it is not but we are going to pass it anyway."
That, indeed, does then move the question along to the judicial
branch ultimately.
                                          69

  I agree with what I understand Justice Berger to be saying, to
wit, that each branch of Government including the legislative
branch has a responsibility and a role in upholding and under-
standing the Constitution and in attempting to pass laws, if you
will, in compliance with the intent of our Constitution. I referred
to that earlier in some remarks I made. I think it is very important
that each branch of Government carry out its function in preserv-
ing and complying and living within the dictates of the Constitu-
tion.

  Senator MATHIAS. However, that would not prevent you from
functioning with too great a respect for the views of the legislative
branch if in fact you clearly felt the legislative branch had acted in
either ignorance or in error?

  Judge O'CONNOR. That is correct, Senator Mathias. If I were
convinced, based on research that I did and the briefs and the
arguments in a given case, that a particular enactment was uncon-
stitutional, I would so hold.

                               CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION

   Senator MATHIAS. Let me ask you a question that may be a little
bit unfair because it is very difficult to recall all the votes that you
may have cast in your legislative career. I know I would find it
very difficult. However, to the best of your recollection, do you
recall any votes in which you called for a constitutional convention
to revise the U.S. Constitution in any particular?

   Judge O'CONNOR. I am not sure that I do. We dealt over the 5-
year interval in the Arizona Legislature with literally thousands of
measures, and I have learned to do two things in my public life:
One is to have a short memory, and the other is to have a thick
skin, and they have stood me in good stead on some occasions.
[Laughter.]

   However, I cannot recall. I do believe, however, that we have had
memorials presented during my time in the legislature which did
on occasion call for a constitutional convention to address a partic-
ular measure, and I may or may not have had occasion to vote on
that. At that time I think it was not generally perceived by people
to present the kinds of problems that subsequent analysis by schol-
ars has indicated might be the case if that method were pursued.

   Senator MATHIAS. I appreciate that answer. Let me say that I am
not so much interested in how you may have voted on any particu-
lar such memorial or resolution, as I am in whether or not you
have considered that question because it seems to me that that
question is one of the great unknowns that faces us today.

   We are within a few States of a call for a constitutional conven-
tion. There is a great void in constitutional law as to exactly how a
constitutional convention would be called, would be assembled, or
would operate. Now would it be your view, if a constitutional
convention were to be called--the closest call right now is on the
question of a balanced budget--whether the convention would be
limited to just the subject which was the occasion for the call, or
could it become a general constitutional convention as happened in
1787 and look to a general revision of the entire Constitution?
                                                    70

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Mathias, this is one of the intriguing
and great questions of contemporary concern, I would say, because
indeed as you have pointed out we are quite close to having a
sufficient number of requests for a convention to consider an
amendment, that consideration of these matters is now important,
I think, to the Congress and to people generally.

   As you are no doubt aware, in our Nation's history we have not
heretofore used the convention method as a method of amending
the Constitution. Therefore, we have absolutely no experience to
draw upon other than that convention in which our Constitution
was originally drafted.

   There are a number of scholarly articles which have been writ-
ten about the question, and as might be expected, the scholars
differ greatly in their view of precisely the question you have
asked, to wit, whether the scope of the constitutional convention
can be limited or not. I think the American Bar Association did a
rather thorough study on the question and reached one conclusion.
Professors Gunther and van Alstein and others who have written
on the subject have reached differing conclusions.

   I think it simply is one of the unanswered questions. Indeed, it is
even uncertain, I suppose, whether those questions raise political
questions which the Supreme Court would ultimately decide or
whether they do not.

   Senator MATHIAS. In many respects I think that we could all
hope that it will remain an unanswered question, and that you will
not have to, in your days in the Court, help to provide an answer
because the dangers are very real. However, I really wanted to
raise the subject with you and to find out if you were troubled as I
am by the possibility of a runaway convention that would go far
beyond the mandate of its call.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, Senator, it does of course pose concerns
to many people, and as I have indicated, to the best of my knowl-
edge we have no answers.

                          INDEPENDENCE OF FEDERAL COURTS

   Senator MATHIAS. The power of the Federal judiciary has been a
very controversial subject since the founding of the Republic.
Thomas Jefferson, among others, was very critical of the authority
granted to the Federal courts, and so throughout our history there
have been periods of attempts to curb the courts, to limit the
jurisdiction of the courts.

   It has been suggested that Congress should have the power to
overrule the constitutional decisions of the Supreme Court, and
various devices to dilute or limit the power of Federal judges,
attempts to limit jurisdictions of courts.

   What impact do you think that proposals of this sort would have
on our system of Federal Government as we have known it in our
lifetime?

  Judge O'CONNOR. If some of the pending proposals were adopted
and jurisdiction were limited, Senator, over a given subject matter.

   Senator MATHIAS. Well, let me be a little more specific: What
impact on the doctrine of judicial independence would be--what do
you think would flow from such decisions?
                                          71

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, article 3 of the Constitution dealing with
the judicial branch provides, of course, that we will have one
Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress shall from
time to time establish. That contemplates, I suppose, the capacity
of Congress to determine the extent to which we will have lower
Federal courts.

  I am sure you are aware, also, that it has been held, I believe in
the Palmore case, that Congress has power to withhold giving all of
the jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts that it has authority to
give. Congress has traditionally, I think, acted in the field of deter-
mining, for instance, statutes of limitations and length of time
within which appeals may be filed, and other procedures which do
impact directly on the jurisdiction of the Federal courts in one way
or another. These have been traditional exercises of that power.

   In section 2 of article 3 dealing with the appellate jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court, again the Constitution at least refers to such
exceptions and regulations as the Congress may impose, and that
has not been tested often in the Nation's history. As you know, I
think we have the ex parte McCardle case in about 1868, and I am
not sure that we have much else in the way of case law defining
exactly the contemplated power of Congress in that area.

   Senator MATHIAS. That is exactly, of course, the point of my
question, that there is a certain constitutional grant of specific
authority to Congress to erect the Federal courts and generally to
provide the guidelines for their jurisdiction. However, does that
grant of constitutional power have to be viewed in context with the
other provisions of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights included?

   Again to be specific, Justice Brandeis referred to separation of
powers, and he said that the doctrine of the separation of powers
was adopted not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise
of arbitrary power. The purpose was not to avoid friction but, by
the means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of
the governmental powers among three departments, to save the
people from autocracy.

   How do you view the independence of the Federal courts as a
part of that fabric of constitutional government which has to be
respected?

   Judge O'CONNOR. I do view the independence of the judiciary as
an important aspect of our system of checks and balances. I also
believe that it was at least contemplated by the framers of the
Constitution, perhaps, that the judicial branch would ultimately be
in a position to determine what is the supreme law of the land in
the sense of interpreting, if you will, the meaning of the Constitu-
tion and interpreting, as needed, enactments of Congress.

   Now to the extent that that jurisdiction is removed, that function
of the judicial branch, I suppose, is no longer performed, or per-
haps it freezes into place previous determinations and they simply
remain on the books as the last pronouncements. These are issues,
of course, that we have not faced directly.

   Senator MATHIAS. I would like to pursue this with you a little
but we cannot do it at the present time.

   Thank you, Judge.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
                                              72

  We had planned to recess at 12:30 until 2:30. We will still come
back at 2:30. However, Senator Simpson has an emergency and he
has to catch a plane, so the chairman is going to run on beyond
12:30 in order to accommodate Senator Simpson to propound his
questions.

  Senator Simpson, we will call upon you at this time. In that way,
we do not discommode anybody of his regular place. In other
words, we are taking that much time out of our lunch hour.

  Senator SIMPSON. I do not think I will take the full 15 minutes.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is all right. You go right ahead. We are
glad to accommodate you.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you very much. You certainly have
always done that, Mr. Chairman, and I am deeply appreciative of
it.
  I am not going to get into issues about abortion, which is an
anguishing personal decision, and those of us who have made
public statements on that issue I think at least consistently try to
stay with those public statements. I know that when I explained
my position on it, it had very seriously been thought through by
me with counsel with my remarkable family of a wife and three
children too, so I will not delve into that because it is so critically
personal.
  I certainly recall very well in my legislative experience dealing
with riders on bills. That is quite a process in itself, and especially
as a majority floor leader in trying to keep a clean bill floating if
one could without getting weighted down with riders, so I under-
stand that one.
  The issues of the Constitution are so critical to us all as legisla-
tors, and I remember so well so many discussions as we legislated,
how someone would rise and say, "You cannot do that. That is
unconstitutional." This always used to test us on the floor, and
then we would say, "Pass it anyway and let the judge decide." I
remember that ploy so well.
  I was also interested, as Senator Biden was, in your article in the
William & Mary Law Journal. There are, I think, 30 opinions of
yours that have been reviewed by the examining authorities. Cer-
tainly your public commentaries in that article might be the fresh-
est.

                  NO FINALITY IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE FIELD

  Now in that there is one thing that I honed in on because it is of
great interest to me, and that is trying to reach what I refer to as
the "finality of judgment" in this land. I think your comment was
that:

  It is a step in the right direction to defer to the State courts and give finality to
their judgments on Federal constitutional questions where a full and fair adjudica-
tion has been given in the State court.

  I think that that is one of the things that has caused us to have
such a general reflection of negativism about Federal and State
courts, is a lack of finality in judgment, especially perhaps in the
criminal field. I mean, how many times can one go on to exhaust
due process. We also find this in an area in which I now have come
to have a great interest, in immigration and naturalization mat-
                                                    73

ters, where we have procedures which, when you are through with
them all, you can start over, procedures which do not really give
confidence in the judicial system.

  Anyway, on this issue of finality of judgment, how do we--given
the concept that you state and this need for a determination of full
and fair adjudication having been provided in the State courts--my
question is, I guess, who would then make that determination?
Would that then be a determination made by the Supreme Court?
Would that be a request for certiorari upon an already burdened
court? What might you share with me as to your view on that and
how that might be carried out?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, Senator Simpson, first of all I think it is
a serious concern to a lot of people that there is no finality in the
criminal justice field to a given decision, even after an appeal has
been heard and resolved, long after the conviction in question, and
even after one series of post-conviction petitions for relief, there
are others that can be followed in an unending series. I think that
is one thing that has caused the public to have some concern about
the proper function of the judicial system in that area.

   Now how we can attack the problem is something that I think
has to be considered by both the courts and the Congress in this
field because we are talking about the interrelationship between
the State court system and the Federal court system as it relates to
Federal constitutional issues. Both the State courts and the Federal
courts have a role in determining Federal constitutional issues.
State court judges take an oath to support the U.S. Constitution
just as Federal court judges do, and there is a reason for that,
because many of these issues are first raised at the State court
level.

   To the extent that we want to permit State court judgments to
become final on the question, it then becomes a matter in part of
how the Federal courts view the question and in part how Congress
views it because each can play a role in saying, "Enough is
enough." To the extent that a State court has given a full and fair
adjudication on a given issue, even though it may involve a Federal
constitutional issue, then perhaps we should be more willing at
some point to give finality to that State court determination.

   I have seen at least evidence in Supreme Court decisions that
would indicate a move in that direction, the cases that have said,
"All right, in the 4th amendment area, if there has been a full and
fair hearing at the State level we will not grant a Federal habeas
corpus to review it." Now that was a holding of the U.S. Supreme
Court, in effect.

   In addition, Congress could review it. Certainly the present struc-
ture requires the Supreme Court to take appellate jurisdiction of
certain holdings, and perhaps the Congress would consider making
that not mandatory in the future but consider at least whether
that should be handled much like other petitions for certiorari are
handled. Therefore, I think in response really that both the courts
and the Congress could have a role.

   Senator SIMPSON. That is of interest to me, I guess because it has
piqued my interest as to how we might go about it legislatively,
and I guess we will try to look into--and this does not have
anything to do with your new duties--but whether there are other
                                                    74

methods short of an appeal to the Supreme Court to do this, other
than bringing us back virtually to the same position we are in
right now with regard to the ready access to the Federal courts
through the one instance of the section 1983. Therefore, that is
that, and I can visit with you later on that, and I shall.

  There was a second point about your article which was thought-
provoking to me, and that was a suggestion of a repeal of the
Federal statute which would allow attorneys costs to be paid to
successful plaintiffs in civil rights cases. In dealing with that, I
have I guess a concern as to whether that might not deny access to
the courts for some individuals with valid complaints but with, of
course, the financial inability to proceed or obtain legal assistance.

  Is there any middle ground, in your mind, short of total repeal of
that provision that might be acceptable, some modification that
would address that issue without cutting off the rights of a poten-
tial litigant?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Simpson, yes, and I think the point is
well-taken. Obviously there are people whose rights have been
abused or deprived in some fashion who are entitled to bring suit,
and who if they do not have the means to do it need a provision
whereby they can recover attorneys fees, else they are not likely to
get the kind of legal advice that would be required to get them
relief. Therefore, it is understandable that some provision be there.

  I think in the article I mentioned that other avenues could be
explored short of a total repealer, and so it is not inappropriate
then for Congress to look at those provisions in section 1988 and
see whether some limitations are appropriate, whether a different
set of guidelines to the courts in allowing for attorneys fees would
be helpful, something that might discourage the specious claim and
the unwarranted one but not ever preclude the valid claim that
might be made by the indigent claimant.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, certainly those are some of the problems
with any type of public defender system or public prosecutor
system, and that is an unfortunate opportunity viewed in some of
the minds of my brethren--in my other life I was an attorney--
who view that as an ability to raid the treasury of a State or the
Federal Treasury.

  Finally, just one other question that has to do with what Senator
Mathias was referring to, and I guess just a wrap-up in that area
with regard to your extensive experience at the State level. I think
you bring to the bench or will bring to the Supreme Court Bench a
fresh perspective on Federal and State relations which I think has
been shunted somewhat in the last two or three decades because
simply there is no information to be put into the Supreme Court by
those who sit on the Supreme Court, a States' voice issue, if you
would.

  If I might just ask for you to give me a brief summary as to what
general improvements you might see in Federal-State judiciary
relationships, what do you see as desirable, and do you see yourself
as having a role in bringing that about and bringing it to fruition?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, Senator, speaking to the last first, I am
interested in judicial administration. I have not, of course, had
experience in the Federal system, and I have a great deal to learn
with regard to the Federal bench and its system.
                                              75

  Certainly I hope that we can always recognize the very great
importance that the State court system has in our overall system
of justice in this country. Indeed, the vast number of all criminal
cases and all other cases, for that matter, are handled in the State
court system. That is the system that is doing the bulk of the work,
even though I know that you here in the Senate are hearing a
great deal about the great pressures that are being experienced in
the Federal courts due to their increase in business. However, if
you look at it overall it is the State courts that are handling such
great bulk of our work.

  It is important that those courts function well, that they have
capable jurists, that they have an opportunity for training, and I
believe in good training of judges. It is possible to go to school and
learn something about being a judge, and we have programs like
that that are available. They are good programs and merit support.

  We have to be mindful of the interrelationship of the State and
Federal courts, and I hope give some finality where it is possible to
State court decisions, even in the Federal area. That is one of the
points that we just discussed, so I think there are ways to improve
it. Indeed, the occasion for that issue of the William & Mary Law
Review to which you refer was an interesting one which brought
together representatives of both the State and the Federal court
systems to give an overall view of the problems of the interrela-
tionships and to make some suggestions.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, to me it is an exciting prospect that you
bring that additional dimension, which is not really discussed
greatly but I think is very important.

  Mr. Chairman, thank you for being very gracious to me in recog-
nizing a special problem I have, and I appreciate that very much.

  Thank you, Judge.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will now stand in recess until 2:30.
  [Whereupon, at 1:55 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 2:30 p.m. the same day.]

                                     AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order.
  After the gavel raps, the press and photographers will withdraw.
   Senator Kennedy?

                                DISCRIMINATION EXPERIENCE

   Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge O'Connor, I do not think that there is any question in the
minds of millions of Americans that your nomination represents a
great victory for equality in our society, and millions of Americans
obviously are looking to you with a rightful sense of pride. You
have had a long and distinguished legal career.
  I would like to ask you whether you have experienced discrimi-
nation as a woman over the period of that career and, if so, what
shape or form that has taken.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Kennedy, I do not know that I have
experienced much in the way of discrimination. When I was ad-
mitted to law school I was very happy that I was admitted to law
school at a fine institution. My only disappointment I think came

  87-101 O--81 6
                                                      76

when I graduated from law school at Stanford in 1952 and looked
for a position in a law firm in the private sector. I was not success-
ful in finding employment at that time in any of the major firms
with whom I had interviewed.

  However, I did then find employment in the public sector. I
became a deputy county attorney in San Mateo County, Calif. It
was my experience at that time that in the public sector it was
much easier for young women lawyers to get a start. It was a
happy resolution for me in the sense that I really spent the bulk of
my life in the public sector. Therefore, that start turned out to be
very beneficial.

                                       DISCREPANCY IN PAY

  Senator KENNEDY. YOU were active in several efforts in Arizona
in the State senate to revise employment, domestic relations, and
property laws which discriminated against women. I think at that
time you pointed out the sharp discrepancies between the pay
which men and women often receive for similar work.

  As you may have seen, recently there was a report by the EOC
about the continued aspects of job discrimination on the basis of
sex, and the pay discrepancy is still widespread. Do you find that it
is still widespread? Is this a matter of concern to you?

  Judge O'CONNOR. It has always been a matter of concern to me. I
have spoken about it in the past and have addressed the fact that
there does seem to be a wide disparity in the earnings of women
compared to that of men.

  We know that perhaps a portion of that is attributed to the fact
that women have traditionally at least accepted jobs in lower
paying positions than has been true for men, and that may be a
factor.

  When I went to the legislature in Arizona we still had on the
books a number of statutes that in my view did discriminate
against women. Arizona is a community property State, and the
management of the community personal property was placed with
the husband, for example. These were things that had been in
place for some years. I did take an active role in the legislature in
seeking to remove those barriers and to correct those provisions.

  Senator KENNEDY. From your own knowledge and perception,
how would you characterize the level of discrimination on the basis
of sex today?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Presently?
  Senator KENNEDY. Yes.
  Judge O'CONNOR. I suppose that we still have areas from State to
State where there remain some types of problems. We know that
statistically the earnings are still less than for men. I am sure that
in some cases and some instances attitudes still have not followed
along with some of the changes in legal provisions.
  However, it is greatly improved. It has been very heartening to
me as a woman in the legal profession to see the large numbers of
women who now are enrolled in the Nation's law schools, who are
coming out and beginning to practice law, and who are serving on
the bench. We are making enormous changes. I think these
changes are very welcome.
                                                    77

  Senator KENNEDY. In your response to the committee's question-
naire--I think it is question No. 2--you gave an extensive answer
that mentions your concern and involvement in efforts to provide
greater equality for women and for many other groups. You specifi-
cally mention the legal aid for the poor. You mention the rights of
institutionalized persons. You refer to religious nondiscrimination.
You mention native Americans. You mention the mentally ill.

  However, you do not mention two of the most obvious groups
who also have suffered from injustice and inequality; that is, black
Americans and Hispanic Americans. I wonder if you briefly would
discuss your perception of the degree to which black Americans or
Hispanic Americans are denied equality in our society.

  Judge O'CONNOR. A great deal of the concern that has been
expressed through the courts and in legislation and otherwise in
our Nation has been obviously over the situation of blacks. This
perhaps has been the worst chapter in our history and one in
which great effort has been undertaken to try to correct it.

   In our community in Phoenix the black population is basically
small, relatively speaking. On the other hand, the Hispanic popula-
tion in our community is rather large, and it is one which of course
is a concern to all of us.

   I frankly feel that Arizona has been greatly blessed, Senator
Kennedy, with a cultural diversity that we have in that State. I
have regarded the Hispanic heritage which we have enjoyed and
the Indian American population which we have in Arizona as
being one of the great blessings of that State. I think our State at
least seems to be working well in relation to trying to eliminate
vestiges of discrimination.

   Senator KENNEDY. IS it your sense that as a result of continuing
discrimination that exists in our society that one of the important
priorities is a vigorous enforcement of the civil rights laws that
prohibit discrimination?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes. I think that enforcement of those laws
which the Congress has seen fit to enact is a very necessary part of
the obligation of both the executive and the judicial branches inso-
far as those things come before them.

   I am sure you recognize that in the case of the judicial branch it
does not reach out to seek matters; rather, it receives those cases
and controversies that come before it.

   Senator KENNEDY. IS there anything special in your background
that would indicate a special commitment to equal justice for these
two groups? I know that you received some civic awards and have
been involved in various societies.

   Judge O'CONNOR. Yes.
   Senator KENNEDY. I am interested in whether there is anything
you would like to mention for the record that would show involve-
ment and personal commitment in these areas.
   Judge O'CONNOR. In response to the question I have listed a
number of activities in which I personally have been concerned and
which are addressed to the attention of the disadvantaged in our
society. It has been my effort as a legislator and as a citizen to give
my attention to these things. I would expect to always have that
concern.
                                          78

  Senator KENNEDY. AS you can tell, we are moving from area to
area quite quickly in order to cover as much ground as possible.
Hopefully, we will be able to come back to some of these questions.

  However, in this first round of questions I want to come back to
an area which some of my colleagues have talked about. That is
the issue of judicial activism. There was some exchange about that
during the course of the questioning earlier today.

  Some years ago at Justice Stevens' confirmation hearing when I
asked him about his view about judicial activism, he commented on
the issue. I would like to read it very briefly and then perhaps get
your reaction. Perhaps it summarizes or states your view or maybe
you would like to make some additional comment.

  I quote:

  I think as a judge of course one must decide the cases as they come. One does not
really get the opportunity to address the problem in society at large. In a particular
case if he has a particular violation of a serious magnitude that gives rise to an
extreme remedy, a district judge at his discretion may feel that the way to solve this
particular problem is to take some extreme remedial action which would not nor-
mally be appropriate, and then the question on appeal is whether he has abused his
discretion. Normally one does not find an abuse of discretion. There are many,
many cases in which such affirmative remedies are found to be appropriate and
would be sustained on appeal.

  This is what effectively Justice Stevens told us at his confirma-
tion hearing. I wonder whether you agree with his observation that
there are cases where judicial activism in that sense is appropriate
as part of a judge's duty.

  Judge O'CONNOR. I think we are all aware of school desegrega-
tion cases, for example, in which it has become the role and func-
tion of the Federal district courts to review the factual situation,
and where it has found an intentional or purposeful policy of
segregation within the public schools to direct appropriate remedi-
al action if that action is not forthcoming from the school districts
or school district itself.

  In that connection, the court has on occasion entered a variety of
orders for corrective action. I think Justice Stevens has observed
correctly that it then becomes the function ultimately of the Su-
preme Court if an appeal or review is sought to review the action
of the Federal district court to see whether any of those orders of
the court have amounted to an abuse of discretion.

  In that particular area, as you are aware, the Supreme Court has
upheld, for example, in the Swan v. County Board of Mecklenberg
case a variety of remedial actions as being possible in the case of
the purposeful or intentional policy of segregation.

  Senator KENNEDY. That might also include reapportionment
cases where there is State or local prison or hospital discrimination
as well?

  Judge O'CONNOR. There is a variety of cases in which the Feder-
al district court enters orders that might be regarded as affirma-
tive in nature.

  Senator KENNEDY. That is effectively to vindicate constitutional
rights of the individuals or inmates or patients? That would be, I
imagine, the justification for such intervention, would it not?

  Judge O'CONNOR. This has occurred.
  Senator KENNEDY. In some earlier questions--I think by the
chairman--you were asked your position on birth control and abor-
                                          79

tion. Have your positions changed at all over the years or are they
the same as indicated in your votes and statements or comments?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I have never personally favored abortion as a
means of birth control or other remedy, although I think that my
perceptions and my knowledge of the problems and the developing
medical knowledge, if you will, has increased with the general
explosion of knowledge over the past 10 years. I would say that I
believe public perceptions generally about this particular area and
problem have increased greatly over the past 10 years. I would
have to say that I think my own perceptions and awareness have
increased likewise in that interval of time.

  Senator KENNEDY. Does that mean your position has altered or
changed or just that you have developed a greater understanding
and awareness of the problem?

  Judge O'CONNOR. The latter I think, Senator, is what I was
trying to express.

   Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Laxalt?

                                        EXCLUSIONARY RULE

   Senator LAXALT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  You have discussed at length judicial activism, social philosophy,
and so forth. I think I will spare you that for the next several
moments and inquire into something that I deem to be very rele-
vant for any judicial position, particularly the highest court--that
is your legal philosophy.

  We deal from time to time in this committee in the whole area of
criminal law. I have been struck by the broad range of experience
that you have had in this area as a judge, and most particularly
with some of your rulings.

   I would like to ask you about the exclusionary rule, if I may. You
have touched on that in a couple of the cases that you have had.

   Of course, with a dramatically increasing crime rate and an even
greater rise in the number of violent crimes, increasing attention
has been given to the laws governing law enforcement. Many of us
on this committee happen to believe that perhaps some of the
problems we have in connection with crime are procedural.

   On that particular matter, in State v. Morgan--and I am sure
you remember that--you ruled that the defendant had waived her
right to appeal on the failure to exclude as "fruits of the poisoned
tree evidence alleged to have been procured illegally." I agree
totally with that result.

   As a matter of policy, do you believe that the exclusionary rule
may be too narrow, overprotecting the rights of defendants while
impeding the ability of the law enforcement people to enforce the
law? I am talking about as a matter of general legal philosophy.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Laxalt, the exclusionary rule, of
course, is one that has caused general public discontent on occasion
with the function of the criminal justice system, to the extent that
perfectly valid, relevant evidence is excluded solely on the basis
that it was obtained in violation of some occasionally technical
requirement.
                                          80

  I am sure that none of us would feel that a policy of encouraging
the gathering of evidence by peace officers by the use of force,
threats, or conduct of that kind is one which the courts would want
to condone. On the other hand, we are seeing a number of cases
today where the lower Federal courts are beginning to look at the
exclusionary rule and the specific factual situation in that case--
for example, in the case of evidence obtained by a peace officer in
the mistaken belief that he held a valid warrant or evidence ob-
tained in the mistaken belief that a particular case that had been
previously decided was still valid law and it is subsequently over-
turned. We have seen examples in the Federal courts where under
those circumstances the exclusionary rule is no longer being ap-
plied.

  Senator LAXALT. DO you agree with that result? Do you agree
with that construction?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Let me say, first of all, that some of those
things are going to come before the Supreme Court, Senator
Laxalt. I certainly would not want to be accused of prejudging an
issue that will come before the Court, as indeed I think that this
one will.

  I simply would like, if I may, to point out what I see as some
trends and make some other observations about it.

  There are other instances where peace officers who are acting in
good faith, but in a mistaken belief as to the existence of certain
facts, have taken evidence. We have instances, for example, in the
fifth circuit where the fifth circuit has taken the position that that
kind of a good faith mistake will not give rise to the application of
the exclusionary rule to exclude the evidence. That has not been
either approved or disapproved I believe by the U.S. Supreme
Court. It is very likely to come before the Court.

  As you point out, I have had a good deal of experience at the
trial court level and some at the appellate court level with the
application of the rule. It is in fact I think a judge-made rule as
opposed to one of constitutional dimensions, as I understand it. As
a result, the Supreme Court presumably could alter that judge-
made rule without doing violence to some constitutional provision
or principle.

  There have been expressions by several of the sitting Justices
that they would like to reexamine that. I think that the rule may
well come before the Court and could well be the subject of a
reexamination.

  Senator LAXALT. DO you think then that there may be a solution
in this general area within the judicial system rather than our
having to deal with it here legislatively?

  Judge O'CONNOR. May I say in response that I had perhaps one
of the most unfortunate cases that I had in my years on the trial
bench that involved a necessity to apply an exclusionary rule that
was the result solely of congressional action, not court action at all.
That was an application of one of the provisions of the Uniform
Crime Control and Safe Streets Act that required the exclusion in
court of evidence obtained that had been overheard on a telephone
exchange. In the particular case I had it involved a murder which
happened to be overheard by a telephone operator, and that evi-
dence could not be entered. Now that ruling was mandated not by
                                          81

any court action because we were not dealing with peace officers
but private individuals. This was something imposed by Congress.

  Yes, I think Congress already has enacted laws that affect this
and it might want to consider itself some of those aspects.

                               FEDERAL COURT JURISDICTION

   Senator LAXALT. Thank you very much.
   Let's talk for a moment or two about Federal court jurisdiction.
As you know, we have many social areas in which there is deep
division in connection with the principle and certainly in connec-
tion with its application.
   I think due in great part to the excesses of this Congress in
conferring jurisdiction we now have a lot of judges actively en-
gaged in operating prisons, school systems, and the rest, to their
chagrin. I communicate with them frequently, and they would
rather not be in the business. They would rather be in the business
purely of being good judges sitting in their courtrooms or in their
chambers rather than having to bother with these other institu-
tions.
   Added to all that, of course, we have the problem of our so-called
social reforms traditionally enacted in which many feel that the
courts did not belong to begin with, but that is the fact. I speak
particularly of items such as right to life, abortion, and busing. We
deal with that day in and day out. We are going to have a cloture
vote on busing tomorrow on the floor.
   In order to "obviate" or "circumvent," if that is the proper word,
the judicial decision emanating from the highest Court, in the
constitutional nature, of course, logically you approach it by way of
constitutional amendment, which is a very, very difficult process,
first of all, in getting it through the Halls of Congress and then
securing ratification out beyond.
   Recently there has been some thinking, shared by some of my
colleagues on this very committee, that perhaps the way to attack
that problem would be to utilize the general power of the Congress
constitutionally to limit the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, so
that by statute this Congress could define guidelines to exclude the
Federal courts from acting in certain areas such as abortion and
busing.
   May I have from you, if you have had any opportunity to focus
on this, your thinking as to what constitutional limits there are
upon us as a Congress to limit Federal court jurisdiction?
   Judge O'CONNOR. I touched on that briefly this morning, Senator
Laxalt.
   Senator LAXALT. I know you did.
   Judge O'CONNOR. I would review briefly some of those thoughts
with you.
   You have two separate questions. One is the jurisdiction of the
lower Federal courts. That, of course, invokes article 3, section 1.
Then we have the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court with
article 3, section 2, powers of Congress to regulate, if you will, the
appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
   In neither instance do we have much in the way of case law to
examine to guide us with respect to the role of the Congress in this
area. Certainly to the extent that the judicial branch of Govern-
ment is supposed to be the ultimate source of determining what is
the supreme law of the land, if you will, and the source of resolving
conflict among the several Federal courts of the land, and indeed
the State courts insofar as their addressing Federal questions is
concerned, then we look to the Supreme Court for the capacity to
resolve those issues.

  To the extent that that capacity were to be withdrawn by the
Congress, then it might result in a greater diversity of holdings at
the Federal lower court levels or among the State courts. This
raises certain policy considerations that I am sure would be of
concern to the Congress.

   To the extent that a jurisdiction were to be removed, assuming
that it can validly be removed, it would leave in place, I suppose,
those holdings and doctrines that had already been established by
the Supreme Court prior to any removal of jurisdiction of that
area.

   Now, as I indicated earlier, I think that some of the constitution-
al scholars who have examined this question are in doubt as to
whether indeed it is valid constitutionally for Congress to remove
jurisdiction, for instance, of a particular subject matter as opposed
to the type of limitation that has heretofore been utilized.

  Therefore, to a degree these questions are not answered, al-
though with respect to the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court the Ex parte McCardle case in the 1800's upheld as valid a
removal by the Congress of the appellate jurisdiction of the Su-
preme Court in habeas corpus appeals. That affected a pending
case before the Court, as a matter of fact.

   Not much more is known really about the possibilities. I would
say there are some unanswered questions pertaining to these pro-
posals.

   Senator LAXALT. What you are saying in effect is, as you indicat-
ed, that there really are not any precedents to guide us casewise. If
this Congress should see fit in its wisdom, or lack thereof, to move
forward in these areas, it is pretty much an open question for later
resolution, probably by the Supreme Court itself.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Possibly; other than in Ex parte McCardle and
the Klein case, and so forth.

   Senator LAXALT. Yes.
   How are we doing on time, Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have a little time left.

                                             STARE DECISIS

   Senator LAXALT. All right. I will get into one other area if I may
then, Judge. That is the area of stare decisis.

   I feel--and I think most lawyers do--the stability of the judicial
system rests principally on adhering to precedent. You are going to
be presented with that sitting on the Supreme Court I suppose in a
greater proportion than you have even been presented with it in
the trial court and the appellate court.

  Justice Brandeis wrote: "Stare decisis is usually the wise policy
because in most matters it is more important that the applicable
rule of law be settled than it be settled right."
  May I have your views on this very important principle? I am
sure you are familiar with the Justice's observation on stare deci-
sis.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes, I am, Senator Laxalt.
  Senator LAXALT. May I have your views.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Stare decisis of course is a crucial question
with respect to any discussion of the Supreme Court and its work. I
think most people would agree that stability of the law and predic-
tability of the law are vitally important concepts.

  Justice Cordozo pointed out the chaos that would result if we
decided every case on a case-by-case basis without regard to prece-
dent. It would make administration of justice virtually impossible.
Therefore, it plays a very significant role in our legal system.

  We are guided, indeed, at the Supreme Court level and in other
courts by the concept that we will follow previously decided cases
which are in point. Now at the level of the Supreme Court where
we are dealing with a matter of constitutional law as opposed to a
matter of interpretation of a congressional statute, there has been
some suggestion made that the role of stare decisis is a little bit
different in the sense that if the Court is deciding a case concern-
ing the interpretation, for example, of a congressional act and the
Court renders a decision, and if Congress feels that decision was
wrong, then Congress itself can enact further amendments to make
adjustments. Therefore, we are not without remedies in that situa-
tion.

  Whereas, if what the Court decided is a matter of constitutional
interpretation and that is the last word, then the only remedy, as
you have already indicated, is either for an amendment to the
Constitution to be offered or for the Court itself to either distin-
guish its holdings or somehow change them.

  We have seen this process occur throughout the Court's history.
There are instances in which the Justices of the Supreme Court
have decided after examining a problem or a given situation that
their previous decision or the previous decisions of the Court in
that particular matter were based on faulty reasoning or faulty
analysis or otherwise a flawed interpretation of the law. In that
instance they have the power, and indeed the obligation if they so
believe, to overturn that previous decision and issue a decision that
they feel correctly reflects the appropriate constitutional interpre-
tation.

   What I am saying in effect is, it is not cast in stone but it is very
important.

   Senator LAXALT. It is still a highly persuasive consideration as a
matter of principle.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Very.
   Senator LAXALT. That is all I have for now, Judge. Thank you
very much.
  Mr. Chairman, I waive the balance of my time, whatever it is.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
   Senator Byrd is next. I do not believe he is here.
   Senator Hatch?
   Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge O'Connor, I have appreciated the answers you have given
here today. I think you have acquitted yourself very well up until
                                                84

now. I fully expect that you will do so not only the remainder of
these hearings, but also as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Let me just ask one question following up on Senator Laxalt's
questioning. I think he asked some very intelligent questions per-
taining to judicial philosophy and some of your beliefs.

  To pursue his question briefly, how should judges resolve con-
flicts between precedent or stare decisis and what they perceive to
be the intent of the framers of the Constitution?

  Judge O'CONNOR. These are very difficult issues for the Court.
Obviously the Constitution is the basic document to which the
Justices must refer in rendering decisions on constitutional law. In
analyzing a question the intent of the framers of that document is
vitally important.

  Now what does one do as a Justice on that Court faced with a
situation in which the Supreme Court itself previously has deter-
mined that the Constitution in a given area means a certain thing
and that was the intent of the framers and that is the holding of
the Court; yet a subsequent Justice believes that interpretation was
erroneous and, indeed, that was not the intent of the framers at all
but something else was intended? What does that Justice do?

  I think we have an example of that kind of situation in the
Brown v. Board of Education case where the then-sitting Justices
in 1954 became persuaded that their brethren years previously
when Plushy v. Fergusen and its progeny were decided had incor-
rectly interpreted the 14th amendment and the intent of the fram-
ers of the 14th amendment. They cast their vote and decision to
alter that interpretation.

  Therefore, it can occur and that is the process that unfolds,
although I am sure that in each instance it is a very significant
thing for a Justice to overturn precedent, particularly that of long
standing.

  Senator HATCH. In his famous dissent in Plushy v. Fergusen,
which you mentioned, in 1893 Justice Harlan referred to our Con-
stitution as a colorblind constitution. Would you agree with this
characterization?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I am aware that Justice Harlan has taken that
view, and several other Justices have likewise so characterized it.

  On the other hand, we have decisions outstanding of course in
the affirmative action area which would indicate that it is not in
the view of at least some of the decisions a purely colorblind
decision, but that indeed some form of affirmative action is possible
in certain areas. Therefore, it is difficult for me to characterize
what the Court has done in that respect. I think in some areas it
has not applied Justice Harlan's view at this point anyway.

  Senator HATCH. Where would you stand on that issue?
  Judge O'CONNOR. I am sure that these questions, Senator Hatch,
are going to come back before the Court in a variety of forms. I do
believe that litigation in the area of affirmative action is far from
resolved, as I see it, and that we will continue to have cases in this
area. I think it would be inappropriate for me to indicate my
specific holding should that matter come before the Court, which I
think it will.

                                 FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT

  Senator HATCH. I may come back to that issue.
  Recent scholarly works with regard to the doctrine of incorpora-
tion, including Raoul Berger's famous work, "Government by Judi-
ciary," soundly refute the notion that the authors of the 14th
amendment intended to make the Bill of Rights applicable to the
States.
  Do the Constitution's words and phrases require the first eight
amendments to be applied to the States themselves? Is there any
justification for that in the legislative history of the 14th amend-
ment?
  Judge O'CONNOR. I have not made an indepth study at this point
of that legislative history such as you would want to do before
casting a deciding vote on a case. I am aware of Raoul Berger's
article. In fact, I have read it, and I have read other scholarly
works that address themselves to the intent of the drafters of the
14th amendment.
  In fact, I think probably there is some difference of opinion
which was expressed by the drafters of that 14th amendment at
the time. I think Justice Black placed his reliance, for example, on
the comments of one or two of those drafters. Mr. Raoul Berger
would have felt that those comments were not particularly appro-
priate.
  I am aware of the controversy about the question. We do know,
of course, that at this point the Court has held that many of the
first 10 amendments are indeed incorporated into the 14th amend-
ment by virtue of its provisions.

                                      TENTH AMENDMENT

  Senator HATCH. In regard to the 10th amendment, it discusses
"reserved powers." In your opinion what is still reserved to the
States?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I suppose the 10th amendment was thought by
many for some time to be of virtually no further application. We
heard very little about it for a long time.

  Then I think it gained a lot of notoriety at the time that the
Supreme Court handed down its decision in the Ussury case, in
which basically the Court said that the 10th amendment prohibited
the Congress from applying its powers and wage standards to that
of State and local employees and held that in that instance it was a
violation of the 10th amendment because it affected the States in
their role as States.

  The attention given the 10th amendment did not last too long I
guess because in a succeeding case or two, the Hodell case for one,
we had occasion to look at some additional enactments of Congress,
specifically pertaining to surface mining I believe. The Court did
not apply the 10th amendment to invalidate those as they applied
to the States, but indeed determined that in those instances Con-
gress really was addressing its attention to private business rather
than the States as States.

  Therefore, the 10th amendment has had perhaps not a great deal
of attention, if you will, in the cases. While we have isolated
                                                    86

holdings that have relied on it, we cannot point to any great bulk
of authority.

  Certainly this has been a great concern to the States because
States feel that it is out of the States that the Federal Government
grew; that the Federal Government did not create the States but
the States formed together to create the Federal Government, and
indeed that they did maintain and retain very significant rights.

  I could only conclude that perhaps we have not seen the last of
the litigation concerning the 10th amendment.

  Senator HATCH. YOU are correct that the Court in the Usery case
cited the 10th amendment with the proposition that State govern-
ment employees are beyond Federal Government control for some
purposes. I think that was a landmark decision.

  Do you think that this is a reinvigoration of the 10th amend-
ment, and really should Usery be used as a precedent for future
rulings by the Court in your opinion?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I am sure that will be cited by many as prece-
dent for future holdings and already has been cited. The extent to
which the Court will continue along that path I would say is
somewhat uncertain.

                                       STATUTORY INTENT

  Senator HATCH. I have been concerned, as you know, about the
doctrine of preemption. Under that particular doctrine I think too
often the Federal courts have been willing to imply that Congress
intended to preempt the whole field of regulation when Congress
has not conclusively spoken at all.

  Where Congress is silent, when should courts imply a Federal
preemption? What limits are there on the use of this doctrine,
which I believe is an insidious doctrine?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I suppose this involves basically questions of
interpretation of statutory intent--the intent of Congress, if you
will. There are a number of cases on the books, as you have
correctly pointed out, where the courts have determined in essence
that Congress has occupied the field fully and therefore the States
may no longer exercise any jurisdiction in that particular area.

  This, of course, is a matter that has to be addressed on a case-by-
case basis. I think quite properly the Court would want to look in
each instance at the particular enactment or enactments of Con-
gress that are being said to have occupied the field.

                              USURPATION OF STATES POWER

  Senator HATCH. AS you know, I believe the Supreme Court has
continually usurped the power of the States and, frankly, has
continually invaded the power of the States. It seems to me this is
a question you are going to have to be faced with many times in
the future as a Supreme Court Justice.

  Judge O'CONNOR. I would assume that is true. In approaching
problems of statutory interpretation and intent, it has been at least
my practice until now, to examine very carefully the legislative
history and the language of the particular statute in determining
what Congress does intend.
                                                   87

  Of course, Congress can be very helpful in that regard by making
clear expressions of what it intends. Perhaps it could be therapeu-
tic to consider an expression in the congressional enactment itself
that Congress does not intend that this be regarded as occupying
the entire field that otherwise States could occupy themselves, or
something of that sort.

  Senator HATCH. Of course, you know Congress has almost always
been necessarily vague. We are not known for legislative drafts-
manship in Congress although we should be.

  Let me say this to you: During the legislative debate concerning
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 many of the proponents said that act
would never be used to establish quotas. Yet, in fact, there are
many in our society today who feel that is exactly what we have
done through the Office of Federal Contract Compliance and the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Maybe we will get
into that in the next round of questions.

  Let me ask you this: The Supreme Court recently upheld a Utah
statute requiring parental consent for abortions performed on
minors. How would you draw the line between the role of a parent,
and a family, and the right to an abortion? If parents have the
right to give consent, how about the father of the child? Do you see
any inconsistency in giving parents the right to consent but deny-
ing the similar protection or privilege to the father of the child?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, my recollection of the Utah statute is
that it was not one that provided for parental consent but rather
for notification to the parents without a consent aspect. In fact, I
think that the Supreme Court in an earlier decision had held that
a statute from another State which required parental consent for a
minor to obtain an abortion was invalid.

  I think the more recent case from Utah involved notification to
the parents and involved a minor who had not alleged that she was
of sufficient maturity, or whatever it was, to make up her own
mind or to decide. The Court upheld that particular Utah statute
and has drawn a distinction between that and its earlier holdings. I
think the Court also has invalidated a requirement in State law
that the natural father consent as well.

                     EXEMPTING WOMEN FROM COMBAT DUTY

  Senator HATCH. Let me ask one more question.
  You served on DACOWITS, which was the Defense Advisory
Committee on Women in the Services, a committee formed by
former Secretary of Defense George Marshall in the 1950's to make
recommendations on the role of women in the military. One of the
recommendations was the right to go into combat ought to be
granted to women or at least the law should be removed exempting
women from combat duty.
  As I understand it, the records in fact show that you exercised
leadership in attempting to remove all barriers to the assignment
of women to combat vessels. I do not know whether you would be
influenced by that fact in reviewing congressional statutes on this
subject and the principles the Supreme Court has laid down recent-
ly. Do you have any position on that particular matter at this
time?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, if I could correct some of the state-
ments on that

  Senator HATCH. Yes.
  Judge O'CONNOR. I did, indeed, serve on the Defense Advisory
Committee on Women in the Service for an interval of time by
Presidential appointment. That commission did have occasion to
consider a variety of the statutes and regulations governing women
in the service.

  As you know, the Defense Department had established as a
policy that a certain number of women would be admitted in the
military service and would serve in the various branches of that
service. The DACOWITS commission really was asked then to look
into the role of these women and make appropriate recommenda-
tion.

  During my service on it I did offer suggestions which were adopt-
ed by the group and which subsequently were adopted by Congress
asking that the statutory definitions, if you will, of combat be
reexamined so that we could be more specific as to what jobs and
tasks it is that women may appropriately perform and what they
may not.

  Let me give you an example. At the time that my motion was
made women were totally prohibited from serving on ships other
than hospital or transport ships. It made no difference whether it
was a ship that was in a peacetime mission during peacetime or
some other task that did not involve combat at all in the sense that
we knew it. It simply was a total prohibition of service by these
women on anything but a hospital and transport ship at the same
time that the Navy was admitting women to the service and
making promotions on the basis of any service that they could have
on a ship at sea, so their opportunities were being restricted.

  It was suggested that Congress reexamine this prohibition and
look instead at the particular mission to be performed and the
particular capability of the person to be assigned. That was done.
The total prohibition was removed.

  I also recommended that the Defense Department and Congress
reexamine some of the definitions of combat to make sure that
women were not being unnecessarily precluded from appropriate
tasks. For example, if we live in an age where we have missile
warfare and the task to be performed is one of being engaged in a
missile silo in plugging in certain equipment, is that combat--far
from the jungles of Vietnam, but rather in the safety of the missile
silo? Some of the existing definitions had that effect. It was our
suggestion that they be reexamined on a more specific basis.
Indeed, that process occurred.

  I did not serve on DEACWIS at the time when any recommenda-
tion was made to remove totally the prohibition against combat for
women.

  Senator HATCH. I notice my time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man.

                                   ANTITRUST EXPERIENCE

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum?
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge O'Connor, I wonder if you would be
good enough to tell the committee if you have had any involvement
with antitrust issues in your public career.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Very little; let me tell you the extent of it, if I
may.

  When I was in the State legislature I did sponsor and succeed in
having passed in Arizona a State antitrust act which was patterned
after the Sherman Act. I had occasion as a trial court judge to hear
one or two actions, or at least portions of them, which were
brought under that act. That is pretty much the extent of it, which
is not great experience.

   Senator METZENBAUM. AS you know, the Supreme Court does
become the final arbiter of what the antitrust laws of our country
are.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Right.
   Senator METZENBAUM. In the landmark Alcoa case, Judge
Learned Hand wrote a decision that really set out what I believe to
be crucial: The whole question of small business and small business
being vital to the free enterprise system's being able to operate.

   He stated:

   Throughout the history of these antitrust statutes it has been constantly assumed
that one of their purposes was to perpetuate and preserve for its own sake and in
spite of possible cost an organization of industry in small units which can effectively
compete with each other.

   That Judge Hand decision has often been quoted by the Supreme
Court. Do you have any difficulty in sharing that view?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, I really do not know
what current decisions are pending in the Federal courts in this
area. Certainly I recognize that the object of the Sherman Act was
to reduce or eliminate monopolies. To that extent, of course it has
the effect of encouraging competition and encouraging smaller
units to be in operation.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Let me change to another subject for a
moment.

   During the last session of Congress we removed impediments to
Federal court consideration of all Federal questions regardless of
the amount in controversy. That was my bill, as a matter of fact.

   In your William and Mary article, at page 810, you seem to think
that was a bad idea. I just want to get a reading from you as to
whether my reading of your writings is correct in view of the fact
that repeal of the $10,000 requirement was predicated on the as-
sumption that the smallest litigant was every bit as much entitled
to have his or her day in court as the largest litigant, and that the
$10,000 requirement no longer made good sense.

   On the other hand, you in your article seemed to be criticizing
the repeal. You say, "In fact, however, Congress appears to have
moved recently to open further the Federal jurisdictional doors."
Then you talk about the limitation of the $10,000 amount in con-
troversy.

   That concerns me because to me access to the courts, regardless
of the economic status of the individual or the size of the case, is a
matter of great moment. I would like to be certain that I am
interpreting your writings correctly.
                                          90

  Judge O'CONNOR. I agree with you that access to the courts is
vitally important to people regardless of their economic status. The
point I was making I think in the article was simply that we have
two sets of courts extant in our country. We have State courts and
we have Federal courts.

  It is my belief that we have certain problems in trying to
manage the interrelationship between these two court systems. In
fact, I think we are the only country in the world that operates
parallel court systems, the Federal court system and a State court
system. Of necessity, we have certain problems inherent in the
maintenance of these two systems.

  People have access now to the State courts for resolution of
Federal constitutional issues. That is the point. The Federal issues
can be resolved and are being resolved at the State level.

  What I was examining here in the article are the trends that I
saw in the extension of jurisdiction, if you will, at the Federal
level. With all of the problems we have of crowded Federal courts,
the need for more judges, and the great problems we have, then
what is the trend to expand jurisdiction when these same problems
can be heard at the State level?

  If they are not satisfactorily resolved at the State level, of course
there is a right to go forward and have them resolved at the
Federal level if they involve Federal questions. However, if we can
have a strong State court system, I would assume that these rights
can be properly and fairly addressed at that level. That was the
thrust of my concern.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Notwithstanding the faCt that the Judicial
Conference of the United States supported Federal court jurisdic-
tion for all cases arising under a Federal statute or the Constitu-
tion, you still feel that it would be more advisable to deny jurisdic-
tion to those who want to use the Federal court system for cases
involving amounts less than $10,000?

  I should say that there is obvious discrimination between the
rich and the poor. For example, if an individual is claiming rights
under the Federal Social Security Act, isn't he entitled to a Federal
forum regardless of the size of his claim?

  What would the average citizen conclude about the fairness of
our judicial system if, as Prof. Charles Alan Wright put it, they are
denied access to the Federal courthouse because they "cannot pro-
duce the $10,000 ticket of admission"?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, of course that is a concern, but I think
it needs to be viewed in the context of having a strong and capable
State court system that can hear and resolve many of these same
problems. That was simply the thrust of my comments.

  Obviously it is a matter for this Congress to debate and consider.
There are opposing policy considerations in place. However, to the
extent that you truly feel that a litigant can and does obtain a fair
and full resolution of a problem within the State court system,
then perhaps to that extent you would feel that we have provided
an appropriate remedy and resolution.

  It simply is a matter of whether you want in all aspects both
systems to be handling every problem or whether you want the
Federal courts to exercise more limited jurisdiction, if you will.

                             ALLOWANCE OF ATTORNEYS' FEES

  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge, you suggested congressional action
to limit the use of section 1983, which could be accomplished by
directly or indirectly limiting or disallowing recovery of attorneys'
fees. Would you expand upon that?

  It seems to me that if either the court inherently has that right
to grant attorneys' fees or if the Congress has given it that right,
and if the litigant has no other way of providing himself or herself
with access to the courts, that is a very discriminatory kind of
approach to the law. It concerns me very much. It concerns me
that that would be the position of a member of the Supreme Court.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I am not suggesting that the Court
itself should draw those distinctions. Indeed, I think it is a subject
of appropriate congressional inquiry. We are dealing here with an
act of Congress in section 1983 and in section 1988.

  Obviously someone who is poor, who has no other right of access
to the Court, who cannot afford an attorney, and who has a valid
claim should be entitled to pursue that claim and should have
some avenue of relief ultimately in recovery of attorneys' fees.
That is not inappropriate.

  However, to the extent that the act is being used, if you will, in
ways in which you and Congress did not originally envision, if that
be the situation, and if you feel that the act in fact is being abused
in some areas, then obviously it is within the prerogative of Con-
gress to affect the extent of the use of it by altering or changing
the extent to which recovery is going to be allowed for attorneys'
fees.

  Certainly the expansion of the use of section 1983 has been very
great. Perhaps it is being used today in a manner which originally
was not envisioned by those who drafted it. I do not know that and
I would want to do more extensive research, but that is entirely
possible.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Certainly it is used more extensively than
it was when originally drafted. It is an act of 1871. It is the basic
civil rights act. It is the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871.

  Certainly in changing times it is being used more extensively.
However, the fact is that the attorneys' fees that are being allowed
do not reflect any abuse because they were actually allowed by a
court. The Court would not have allowed them presumably if there
were no merit to the allowance of those fees.

  Yet you suggest in the William and Mary article that there be a
legislative proscription with respect to the allowance of attorneys'
fees in civil rights cases.

  I have difficulty following that line of thinking. Even though it is
used far more extensively and would of course be more extensive
than in 1871, if you disallow that you do two things: You deny the
litigant in a civil rights case the right to recover legal fees when he
or she has no other place to turn to, and you also deny by your
suggestion of the $10,000 limit the litigant access to the Court.

  I find that the convergence of these two creates a situation that I
think would, at least on its face, appear to be discriminatory
against civil rights litigants as well as the poor and those who have
difficulty in providing for themselves with attorneys.

  87-101 O--81 7
                                          92

  Judge O'CONNOR. Indeed, Senator, if the Congress felt that the
civil rights litigation were the appropriate role and function for
section 1983 cases it could restrict the application accordingly.

  I think you are aware that, in fact, what has happened is that
the Court has extended it far beyond civil rights cases and has
applied it to virtually any violation of any Federal law. This is a
far cry, I assume, from what was intended perhaps at the time that
it was drafted. At least that is arguable.

  Certainly what was being suggested in the article is that Con-
gress take a look at this and, in fact, determine if that is the intent
of the Congress and if it is being used in the manner that Congress
feels is appropriate and proper.

  To the extent that it is, then allowance of attorney's fees seems
eminently appropriate. To the extent that it is not, of course Con-
gress in its wisdom might see fit to make changes.

  Senator METZENBAUM. AS a matter of fact, the article indicates a
conclusive point of view; and that is that such a move would be
welcomed by State courts as well as State legislatures and execu-
tive officers and then goes on to refer to the fact that the Congress
indeed has moved in the opposite direction to open the courts to
more access.
' I am frank to say that that attitude is a matter of concern to
me--denial of access to the courts and denial of an opportunity to
be represented by counsel who in turn would be paid, provided that
the litigant was awarded fees by the court. It provides some con-
cern for this Senator.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Again, Senator, I would like to point out that
that article in no way suggested that anyone should be deprived of
a judicial forum for airing his or her grievance.

  I think the thrust of the article was that we have two parallel
court systems and it is really a question of choice: Should the
litigants be encouraged to direct their inquiries and their remedies
be sought initially through the State court system, or do we want
to channel everything to the Federal courts?

  Speaking as a State court judge, it was my view that perhaps we
could safely encourage wider use of the State court system--that it
was not necessary at every level and in every instance to have the
choice, if you will.

  That was simply a point of view being suggested from the per-
spective of one who has been involved in a State court system. That
of course is a matter for Congress in its wisdom to debate.

  Senator METZENBAUM. They have the choice, and they would lose
the choice under your article. I hope they do not.

  Judge O'CONNOR. But not their remedy or a forum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Not their remedy, but no choice of forum.
  I think my time has expired, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Dole?

                                   DIVERSITY JURISDICTION

  Senator DOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I have one or two followup questions, one based on the same
article on diversity that was alluded to by the distinguished Sena-
                                          93

tor from Ohio, Senator Metzenbaum, in which you did indicate, as I
understand it, that you favor the elimination of restriction of diver-
sity jurisdiction as a ground for bringing a suit in Federal court.

  My only question in that regard would be: What would you
recommend to States to accommodate their increased caseloads if
that in fact were done?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Dole, I do not think that my sugges-
tion was conclusive in that regard. I simply offered that again as
something which I think is appropriate for Congress to consider as
it considers how to deal with the increasing caseload of the Federal
district courts.

   Obviously, to the extent that the diversity jurisdiction is reduced
or eliminated, it will impact upon the State courts.

  We do have some jurisdictions--and I think perhaps Los Angeles
County is one--where there is a shorter time to get to trial in the
Federal courts than there is in the State courts. Lawyers and
litigants in that community would be particularly unhappy with
that kind of a change.

   So these raise very serious questions obviously, and that is prob-
ably why so little action has been taken over so long a time.

   There are diverse views on it, and it is a very thorny issue, but I
do think it legitimately is one of the things that Congress should be
considering as it addresses this whole problem of State and Federal
courts.

   Senator DOLE. I have another question with reference to the
same comment:

   One of the traditional arguments for retaining diversity as a
basis for Federal jurisdiction has been the fact that the State
courts might have a bias in the favor of litigants who are also
citizens of that State. Do you have any recommendations as to how
we might address that problem if we abolish diversity?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I certainly have not had experience in
other States, but in our State it has not been my experience that
that is the case--that a litigant need to be concerned about how
long he or she has been a resident of that State or in fact whether
he is a resident at all. In fact, I believe that justice is being
administered very evenhandedly with regard to that, so I am not
sure that that continues to be a valid concern in today's world.

                          APPLICATION OF EXCLUSIONARY RULE

   Senator DOLE. Senator Laxalt and maybe others earlier today
discussed the exclusionary rule. I want to follow up.

   What is your opinion of whether or not the exclusionary rule
should be applied to cases where law enforcement officers have
committed technical violations of law which do not affect an indi-
vidual's constitutional rights?

   Judge O'CONNOR. These are among the examples that I referred
to when I said a number of courts around the country within the
federal system are beginning to approach the exclusionary rule in
a different way and to eliminate, if you will, from the application
of the rule the so-called technical violation.
                                          94

  We have not seen a full resolution of that approach yet by the
U.S. Supreme Court, but there is every indication that perhaps
some of those issues will again be addressed by that Court.

  Senator DOLE. It would seem to me that, as you have indicated,
based on maybe an invalid warrant or a misunderstanding of the
facts, if it does not violate one's constitutional rights then I think
we need to take a look at that aspect of it.

  We used to talk about strict constructionists around here--it has
been some time. I do not quite remember when that was, come to
think of it, but what does that term mean to you? It was one that
was widely discussed. I think it is well understood by those on the
judiciary. Do you have any definition of that term?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, I suppose, Senator Dole, to me it might
mean someone who appreciates the difference between the policy-
making functions of the legislative body and the judicial role of
interpreting and applying the law as made by the legislative body;
in other words, the difference between making the law and inter-
preting it.

   Senator DOLE. YOU come down on the side of the interpreters, as
I recall your statement and other statements that have been made?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I have expressed the position that I know well
the difference between the role of the legislator and the judge, and
I understand the proper role of the judge as being one of interpret-
ing the law and not making it, if you will, in very simplistic terms.

   Senator DOLE. I agree with that. We supposedly make the law.
We wonder sometimes if we do it effectively, but we have seen the
Court also make law, and I think that has been the concern of
many. I know it has been a concern of many on this committee
when they talked about judicial restraint or judicial activism. Your
view of that term would be in accord with the one I believe is the
correct one.

   Senator Mathias in his first round of questions asked about your
views on the power of the Federal judiciary. Of course, we do limit
judicial independence in many ways in Congress, whether it is
through the appropriation process, the appointment of judges, over-
sight on appointments, or impeachment.

   As Congress employs these powers granted to it under the Con-
stitution, it frequently has an impact upon Court decisions.

   My question would be: To what extent, in your view, should the
Court as it sits be cognizant of public and congressional sentiment
on issues before the Court?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, it seems to me that properly the
Court would have to be considering really only the facts of the
particular case and the law applicable to those facts.

   It would seem to me rather a dangerous process in general, if
you will, to go outside the record and outside the law for guidance
in determining how a given matter should be handled or addressed.

   I suppose that is why we strive to have judicial independence--so
that cases are not based on current perception of outside activity
but rather on the matters that appropriately come to the attention
of the courts.

   Senator DOLE. Rather than what may be the issue of the day
before the Congress, whether it is busing or whether it might be
some other issue. I think busing has been discussed. That is only
                                          95

one of the issues where Congress, I think, sometimes felt that the
Court had a hearing problem. We sometimes believe in this branch
that the Court--maybe properly so--is oblivious to what happens
in the outside world.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I am sure that through the arguments
of counsel and through the brief-writing process and the citation of
appropriate authority the Court is never totally oblivious to what
is going on. I have to assume that the litigants themselves are
making known to the Court through the briefs and the arguments
the realities of life.

  It is just that I do not think the Justices on their own--or judges
anywhere for that matter--should be in the process of going out-
side that judicial process for guidance in reaching decisions.

  Senator DOLE. Senator Thurmond in his questions asked you
three specific questions with reference to votes on abortion while a
member of the Senate in the State of Arizona. You also mentioned
your sponsorship of Senate bill 1165.

  Is it fair to ask whether or not that particular legislation accu-
rately represents your view on abortion? As I recall, in summariz-
ing what Senate bill 1165 entailed, it was that no payment benefits
be made unless the mother's life was threatened.

  Judge O'CONNOR. In Senate bill 1165 I was not the drafter of the
bill; it was the State medicaid bill.

  The leadership had assigned the subject of Arizona's role in the
field of medical care to the poor to a citizens' committee.

   As I recall, Dr. Merlin Duvall headed up that committee at the'
time. He later became the dean of Arizona's medical school.

   The committee, in any event, recommended the adoption of this
particular bill; and it included that provision in it concerning the
use of public funds; and I supported the bill and its provisions.

   Senator DOLE. And that bill did become law?
   Judge O'CONNOR. Yes, it did. It was never funded thereafter for
the medicaid function. It is still on the books today.
   Senator DOLE. But is it fair to conclude that that might reflect
your views on that issue?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes, Senator, it reflected my views on that
subject when I voted for that measure.
   Senator DOLE. What about today?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes--in general substance, yes.
   Senator DOLE. Senator Metzenbaum also discussed the question
of disallowing attorney's fees in certain areas brought under 42
U.S.C. 1983. I think you have addressed that question.
   If the legislative reforms which were mentioned in the William
& Mary article in civil rights suits are heard in State as opposed to
Federal courts, would there be any danger of plaintiffs being vic-
tims of bias or prejudice--if they are limited to State courts rather
than Federal courts? Is that a problem as you see it?
  Judge O'CONNOR. It is a potential problem; and to the extent
that it is there has to be a means for eventually removing the
issue, if that occurs, to an appropriate forum where it would not be
a problem.
   Senator DOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Thank you, Judge.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.

  Senator DeConcini?

                                          EXCLUSIONARY RULE

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge O'Connor, we have had some discussion today on the
exclusionary rule--something that is being focused on by this com-
mittee. I wonder if you could comment on a decision that has
already been handed down by the Supreme Court in 1971--the
Bivins decision?
  I do not expect you to give us any insight--because I do not
think you could fairly do that--on how you would vote on it, and I
am not asking that question, but I want to quote from that deci-
sion.
  Chief Justice Burger declared:

  I see no insurmountable obstacle to the elimination of the suppression doctrine--
the exclusionary rule--if Congress would provide some meaningful and effective
remedy against unlawful conduct by governmental officials.

  My question is, Do you generally agree that it is an area that
Congress properly, or any legislative body, could delve into and
make changes as far as the suppression doctrine is concerned?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator DeConcini, if I understand what you
were reading correctly from Justice Burger, it was the suggestion
that indeed Congress could appropriately provide a remedy to a
citizen from whom evidence had been illegally taken by way of a
civil damage action, for example, against that individual.

  As I recall, the Bivins versus six unknown agents case actually
held that indeed there is a cause of action against the peace officer
who unlawfully violates someone's fourth amendment rights.

  So I understand that that cause of action exists today by virtue
of that decision, and I think the Justice was perhaps talking about
Congress implementing some kind of remedy. I do not know that
he was talking about an enactment to eliminate the doctrine, and I
would hesitate to express a view on that.

  Senator DECONCINI. DO you think it is a proper area, Judge
O'Connor, for Congress to delve into and consider; and maybe if
they come to the conclusion, do you have any problem with Con-
gress altering the present Supreme Court decision on the exclusion-
ary rule? That is really my question.

  Judge O'CONNOR. I do not know, Senator DeConcini, whether it
would be valid for Congress to simply by congressional enactment
eliminate this judge-made rule--I cannot say--but I can, I think,
safely say that I understand it is not a constitutional doctrine
which has been invoked; it has really been a judge-made rule.

  Certainly the study of Congress about the problem, and the
consideration of it, and the factfinding process that goes on are of
great benefit, I would say, to all of us including the courts as the
courts reexamine the problem.

  It cannot hurt, and it could certainly help to have a great deal of
examination of the problems that have ensued and from factfind-
ing.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge O'Connor, my research indicates that
probably the paramount reason for the exclusionary rule to exist
                                          97

and to be handed down by the Supreme Court was for the purpose
of deterrence.

  It is also interesting to note that six out of seven extensive
studies that have been conducted in the last several years have all
come to an easy conclusion, I might say, that it has not deterred
the police or other law enforcement officials of abusive or illegal
searches and seizures, which draws me to the conclusion that per-
haps it is a proper time for Congress to consider some other
remedy and provide some statutory area where the exclusionary
rule might at least be modified.

  Be that as it may, I believe we will address that problem here.
  Your article that is constantly referred to in the William & Mary
Law Review is one of the finest works that I have had the pleasure
of reading.
  I gather from it--obviously--that you feel the State courts ought
to play a greater role in the whole judicial area, perhaps providing
a little less pressure on the Federal judiciary.
  Let me ask you this: What do you think is the proper role for the
Federal Government as far as encouraging the State court system
to conduct and accept a greater role? In addition to limiting some
of the jurisdictional areas that you touch on in your article, do you
feel that financial assistance, or educational programs, or training
for judges or prosecutors or law enforcement officials; or do you
have any thoughts on that subject?

                              JUDICIAL TRAINING PROGRAMS

  Judge O'CONNOR. I do, Senator. In addition to the adjustments,
as you mentioned, of any jurisdictional aspects that would encour-
age the State court systems to operate, it seems to me that judicial
training programs are really of enormous benefit to State court
judges, as I am sure they are to Federal judges. I am a believer and
a supporter of those programs.

   Naturally, they cost money; and for the judges to attend them
some help is needed, whether it be at the State level or with other
assistance.

   Likewise, training programs are vitally important in the crimi-
nal justice system for the prosecutors and defense counsel.

   Our legal system works at the trial level and the appellate level
only to the extent that we have capable lawyers representing both
sides of the questions. It does not work or function very well if one
side is poorly represented in the case before the court.

   Certainly, to the extent that we want the criminal justice system
to operate well, I think it is vitally important that we have skilled
prosecutors as well as skilled defense counsel, and that takes train-
ing.

   These are young people for the most part, and you have to give
them training as a substitute, if you will, for years of experience.

   Senator DECONCINI. Judge O'Connor, can I take it that you do
not have any philosophical problem with the Federal Government
participating in some educational program, obviously subject to the
ability of the Government to pay its bills--which has not been very
outstanding in the past number of years--but it does not trouble
you if there is assistance, from the standpoint of education and
                                          98

training, offered by Federal programs--if there happen to be some
good ones left?

  Judge O'CONNOR. NO, I cannot say that it does.

                         PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY OF ABORTION

  Senator DECONCINI. Returning to the subject--and I am sure it
probably will never end--of abortion, you have expressed your
views a number of times here today and just now with Senator
Dole. I wonder if you could share with us for just a few minutes
not the voting record--I know you have had no judicial decisions
on the subject matter that we could find--but your personal philos-
ophy or feeling as to abortion so the record would be clear today?

  Judge O'CONNOR. OK, Senator. Again let me preface a comment
by saying that my personal views and beliefs in this area and in
other areas have no place in the resolution of any legal issues that
will come before the Court. I think these are matters that of
necessity a judge must attempt to set aside in resolving the cases
that come before the Court.

  I have indicated to you the position that I have held for a long
time--my own abhorrence of abortion as a remedy. It is a practice
in which I would not have engaged, and I am not trying to criticize
others in that process. There are many who have very different
feelings on this issue. I recognize that, and I am sensitive to it.

  But my view is the product, I suppose, merely of my own up-
bringing and my religious training, my background, my sense of
family values, and my sense of how I should lead my own life.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge O'Connor, along that line I have one
last comment about it. This is not something that has come upon
you in the last year or two or the last 6 or 7 weeks; this is a
commitment and a feeling that you have had for a long period of
time, I assume from the answer to the question.

  Judge O'CONNOR. I have had my own personal views on the
subject for many years. It is just an outgrowth of what I am, if you
will.

  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. I appreciate that response in
depth regarding your own personal background.

  I regret to some extent that it is necessary to delve into that, but
I believe--as you can appreciate here--it is a sensitive subject
among many Members on the many sides of this issue. I think it is
very important that it be laid out clearly and precisely, and I think
you have done just that.

                                      JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE

  To turn to another subject, one of great concern to me, Judge--
many references today have been stated about the uniqueness of
the status of a Federal judge, including a Supreme Court Justice,
mainly that you will serve on the Court for your life.

  The Constitution provides a mechanism by which the Legislative
branch of Government may remove Federal judges, and I refer of
course to the impeachment process.

  As a practical matter, impeachment has been used only infre-
quently because of its cumbersome nature; plus, there has been
                                          99

virtually total lack of supervision over Federal judges and the
Federal bench.

  A number of highly respected constitutional scholars has argued
that the impeachment mechanism is a corollary to the separation
of powers in the sense that the extraordinary procedure must be
established when one branch of Government seeks to remove mem-
bers of another branch of Government.

  However, this formulation leaves open the issue of whether or
not it is constitutionally tolerable to allow for some sort of mecha-
nism wholly within the judicial branch itself that would enable
Federal judges to discipline and maybe even remove errant or
mentally disabled colleagues.

   It is manifestly unfair to the citizens of this country, it seems to
this Senator, to allow incompetent or alcoholic judges to continue
to hear cases.

   Do you believe, Judge O'Connor, that there would be a proper
procedure or mechanism that could be set up constitutionally?

   I might add that some of your soon-to-be colleagues on the Bench
have expressed positive views in this regard and one or two of
them some negative views.

   I am interested in your overall position regarding judicial disci-
pline and whether or not a mechanism, in your judgment, might be
created within the Judiciary.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Let me speak from my experience at the State
level. Of course, as a State court judge I have been subject to
periodic review by the electorate; and that is a process that has
certainly not distressed me at all. I think it has been satisfactory
and indeed helpful to know how you are viewed by the citizens for
your performance.

   In our State we also have a system that incorporates a commis-
sion which is charged under our State constitution with review of
the capacity of any judge who is alleged to be incapacitated from
service and who should be removed or disciplined in some fashion.

   I think that that commission has worked well within our State,
and I think it is appropriate and useful.

  Whether it would work equally well at the Federal level I am not
in a position to say because of course I have not been involved at
that level.

  Whether it raises constitutional problems is a matter that would
have to be reviewed from the standpoint of reviewing a particular
proposal, listening to the arguments, and so forth.

   But speaking just in terms of my own personal experience, that
kind of a system has worked satisfactorily in Arizona.

   Senator DECONCINI. Most States have adopted such a system in
some manner or another, and Arizona--I cannot remember when it
was adopted. You may have been in the legislature when that
occurred.

  Judge O'CONNOR. I was--yes.
  Senator DECONCINI. And you were probably a supporter of that
legislation?
  Judge O'CONNOR. I was--yes--and I have watched its operation
and have felt that it was sound.
                                          100

   Senator DECONCINI. The question that comes, of course, is the
 one you touch on: The constitutionality--something extremely sen-
 sitive.

   We have had testimony here on the Judicial Tenure Act which
has passed both Houses and been enacted, not nearly as restrictive
as I would have liked to have seen it, being one of the cosponsors,
but certainly a beginning, endorsed by the Chief Justice of the
 Supreme Court and providing for some procedure to handle com-
plaints within the various circuits and then some procedure to take
those complaints further up if there was some merit.

   That particular legislation excluded the Supreme Court from its
consideration.

   History shows us that impeachment procedures are really im-
practical today, and the struggle that a legislator has--and you
might have had the same struggle when you were in the State
senate--is how do you attempt to provide the citizens with some
way to have a grievance heard when there is indeed a judge.

   There have been a number of instances written about, a number
of instances provided before our committee when we had this bill--
the Judicial Tenure Act--before us last Congress, where indeed
-there was no question but that the judge was misbehaving under
the good behavior clause and there really was no way except
through peer pressure.

   I take it from your answer that you are committed on the State
and your experience is that it is very positive and that barring
constitutional prohibitions you are not adverse, at least philosophi-
cally, to an approach on the Federal level.

   Judge O'CONNOR. That is correct, Senator. My experience at the
State level with it has been a positive one.

   The concern that I hear people generally express is that as our
society has grown so large and as people feel that they are faced
with some kind of faceless bureaucracy in the Executive branch
and with a tenured Judiciary, if you will, which is not subject to
review on the other hand, it can be a sense of frustration for the
common citizen. I can well appreciate the concerns that have
caused consideration to be given to the problem.

   How it will work in practice and whether there are any constitu-
tional problems with what Congress has proposed I am refraining
from suggesting.

   Senator DECONCINI. I thank you, Judge O'Connor.
   Mr. Chairman, might I suggest a short break sometime this
afternoon at the appropriate time?
   The CHAIRMAN. We plan to stop at 5, but if Judge O'Connor
would like to have a break before then we would be pleased to
allow it.
   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, it is fine with me for you to
continue--as you wish.
   The CHAIRMAN. YOU prefer to continue?
   Judge O'CONNOR. That is fine with me, Mr. Chairman--at your
pleasure.
   The CHAIRMAN. The judge says she does not need a break.
[Laughter.]
   Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, I just want to be sure you
are taking care of her.
                                         101

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simpson had his round before lunch, so
we now come to Senator Leahy.

                                        JUDGE-MADE LAW

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I commend my colleague from Arizona for making sure that all
Arizonans are taken care of in the chamber.
  Judge O'Connor, I apologize for being a couple of minutes late
this afternoon. I came in as you were responding to a question
from Senator Laxalt. It was concerning the exclusionary rule. We
have had a great deal of discussion already this afternoon on that.

  You distinguished a judge-made rule from one of constitutional
dimension. If you have a judge-made rule on a constitutional issue,
is that not of constitutional dimension? I do not understand the
distinction.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Of course there are constitutional implications.
Under the fourth amendment we cannot of course violate the
search and seizure provisions of that amendment, and that amend-
ment is applicable to the States under the 14th amendment.

   What I was referring to by the judge-made portion of the rule is
simply the effect, if you will, of the utilization in court of evidence
which has been obtained in that fashion--illegally obtained, if you
will--as opposed to, for instance, the securing of a confession by
force, which raises I think very different problems.

   Senator LEAHY. In effect, using the exclusionary rule to bar a
confession--are we now at a constitutional level or are we at a
judge-made level? I still do not understand the distinction, Judge.

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, we of course are dealing with the
Constitution when we talk about search and seizure questions; but
the rule which the Court applied on the utilization of the evidence
is one which the courts really developed themselves and developed
initially to apply in the Federal courts and then subsequently
carried over for application to the State courts.

   It is that to which we commonly refer, I think, when we talk
about the exclusionary rule.

   Senator LEAHY. What about the exclusion of an unconstitutional-
ly obtained confession or any of the evidence that might be ob-
tained from that? Is that also within that parameter, would you
say?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Perhaps, Senator. In discussing the question
earlier--and perhaps you were not here--I indicated that the con-
cern that has been expressed by some for reexamination of the
exclusionary rule has not been heard, at least by me, to encompass
such matters as the confession obtained by force, trickery, or some-
thing of that sort.

   The Federal courts that have been discussing and indeed holding
that the exclusionary rule does not apply in certain instances have
been addressing themselves to the so-called good faith exception, if
you will--either the technical error made by the police officer, or
the error made by him when he assumes he has a valid warrant
and does not, or when he assumes he is operating under a particu-
lar case holding which in fact has been overturned, and another
                                         102

type of good faith exception which relates to the officer's under-
standing of the particular facts involved.

  These are areas in which I have noted that Federal courts have
begun to talk about changes or exceptions to the exclusionary rule.

  Senator LEAHY. YOU see such changes as being judge-made law?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. The potential for such changes being judge-made
law?
  Judge O'CONNOR. I think that I could probably characterize them
as such.
  Senator LEAHY. Senator Biden asked you a question about Brown
v. The Board of Education. It was on the subject of judicial activ-
ism, a term that I guess means many things to many people.
  You said that it did not create new social policy by the Court but
was simply the Court reversing a previous holding based on new
research, but that new research was not any new research into the
Constitution or into the law, was it? Was not that new research
rather the effects of segregation on minorities? It certainly was not
into congressional debates over the 14th amendment.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I think there was an element indeed
of the examination of the intent of the drafters of the amendment.
I am sure that particular case was impacted also by perceptions of
the social impacts in that particular instance.
  Senator LEAHY. But there is no new knowledge of the law in that
regard?
  Judge O'CONNOR. What I was trying to say was that in some
cases in which our Court has reached a contrary result after a
period of years to a previous decision they do so occasionally based
on a reexamination of the legislative history and of the intent of
the framers in an effort to determine whether the prior determina-
tion was correct.

  I am sure we do not have much new evidence to be examined,
but perhaps people are examining in some instances more thor-
oughly the evidence that we do have.

  Senator LEAHY. But did we not end up with a new social policy
with very far-reaching implications?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I think in that instance we did--yes.
  Senator LEAHY. And could that not be considered either judicial
or social activism?
  Judge O'CONNOR. I think it was so considered and still is so
considered by many.
  Senator LEAHY. HOW do you consider it?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I consider it as an accepted holding of
the Court. I was not there in 1954; and I did not participate in the
debate, and the hearings, the briefings, and the arguments; and I
cannot tell you all that went into the making of that decision.
  Certainly it overturned a precedent of long standing, and it did
so on the basis of a decision by a very substantial majority--8-1, as
I recall--that the previous understanding of the 14th amendment
was a flawed understanding.
                                         103

                         REFLECTION OF POPULAR SENTIMENT

  Senator LEAHY. DO you feel that that decision can stand as a
correct interpretation of the Constitution and not simply a reflec-
tion of popular sentiment of the time?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, it has stood since 1954 and apparently is
well entrenched.

   Senator LEAHY. The reason I ask that is that the Republican
platform on which the President ran last year talks about appoint-
ment of judges who reflect popular sentiment and respect for the
sanctity of human life and tends to be the main criterion for
picking judges.

   Do you feel that is a somewhat narrow criterion on which to pick
judges? Would you use a different one?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I think we need to use every possible
evaluation of a potential judge in an effort to place very well
qualified people on the bench. It seems to me that we want to
consider all aspects of the individual's character and ability.

   Senator LEAHY. Would you put as a primary consideration a
judge who would reflect popular sentiment?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I would like to think that the individ-
ual characteristics of the person, the capability, the judicial tem-
perament, and the judicial capacity would be critically important.

   Senator LEAHY. DO you feel that a judge should feel perfectly
able and willing to fly totally in the face of popular sentiment if
the judge felt that that was the only way to reflect the law?

   Judge O'CONNOR. If that is necessary. I think judges must be
prepared to act with courage.

   Senator LEAHY. DO you feel that a judge should feel perfectly
prepared to fly in the face of popular sentiment if the judge was
convinced that in so doing the judge was upholding the law?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I think we have to approach each case
on the basis of the facts of the case and the law applicable to it;
and we consider the case as judges in the context of the case which
has come before us--the factual record--the briefs that have been
filed, and the arguments of counsel.

   I do not think that judges are permitted to go outside the record
in resolving the issues to come before the judge.

   Senator LEAHY. Albeit a judge does not live isolated in some type
of a never never land. Judges do read newspapers, do see the news,
do live as members of the community and should

   Judge O'CONNOR. I hope so.
   Senator LEAHY [continuing]. In each one of those instances, or
else we have a lifeless judiciary.
   A judge can well be aware of what might be popular sentiment
of the time. If a judge feels, however, that the popular sentiment
does not reflect the law and must rule on an issue where the law
is, in that judge's estimation, contrary to popular sentiment, is
there any question where the judge has to go?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Not in my mind. I think the judge is obligated
to apply the law as the judge understands it to be.
   Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
   What do you feel are the most important criteria in picking a
judge? I ask you that question because I would assume that that
                                         104

would be also reflective of your own concept of judicial tempera-
ment.

  Judge O'CONNOR. I think we have to examine the person's over-
all character, integrity, capacity, experience, training, and perform-
ance.

  Senator LEAHY. The William & Mary article--incidentally, the
William & Mary Law Review has never gotten so much publicity in
1 day's time. Right now there are dozens and dozens of law schools
who wish that their law review editors had had the foresight to ask
you to write for them. [Laughter.]

  You suggest in that article that in the next decade there will
probably be significant traditional State court variations in cases
involving the issue of illegal searches and seizures under the fourth
amendment.

  You also say that, assuming the State courts are providing a full
and fair opportunity for the claims to be raised and the Federal
habeas corpus review is unavailable, the State courts are more
likely than their Federal counterparts to reach widely varying
results on search and seizure issues.

  Does that present some danger to the notion of a single constitu-
tion? Cannot States create a kind of balkanization of constitutional
rights, almost?

  Judge O'CONNOR. That is an ultimate danger if there is no final
review mechanism. That is correct.

  Senator LEAHY. HOW do you feel, on the question of final
review--obviously the U.S. Supreme Court is not in a position to
review every single case from every single State court--of the great
number of cases that might present a constitutional issue?--obvi-
ously, a matter of concern to a lot of people.

  There have been discussions of an intermediate appellate court--
a super court of appeals--beyond the normal courts of appeals.
How do you feel about that?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I know there is discussion of that. In fact,
unless I am mistaken, Senator Heflin on this committee has taken
a major role in discussions of that, among others.

  Justice James Duke Cameron, a former chief justice of the Arizo-
na Supreme Court, has just released an article on the same subject,
as a matter of fact.

  There is wide discussion of the possibility of establishing a na-
tional court of appeals to sit somewhere between the Supreme
Court and the various Federal courts of appeal.

  I think there are many variations of that court being discussed--
many possibilities. There are both pros and cons to having that
development occur, and I am sure that you have undoubtedly
participated in some of the hearings and are in the process of being
informed about those proposals.

  I do not have a fixed view on whether that would be desirable, or
if it were the form which it should take.

  I know that some discussions have suggested they should just
deal with criminal law. Others have taken a broader view. Some
have suggested that the referrals should all be made to the court
from the Supreme Court. Others make different suggestions.

  There is such variety in the proposals that I have heard that it is
really hard to know which ones are being seriously considered, but
                                      105
I think it is appropriate for the Congress to air these possibilities
and to hear from as many people as it can on the subject to
determine whether there is any consensus that that would be a
step in the right direction.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Judge. I appreciate your openness
and candor before the committee today.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator East?
  Senator EAST. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mrs. O'Connor, I greatly admire your fortitude here. This is an
exquisite form of torture, I think. The Senators, you will note,
come and go at their leisure; and we expect the witness to sit here
and endure this. I was greatly impressed with your willingness to
continue even when our distinguished chairman gave you the op-
portunity of opting out for a while.
  I appreciate the great frustration that you feel in this; and I
think Senators do, too--that we are never able to explore things in
the depth that we would like to and to the extent that we would
like to.
  I guess it inheres to things human that you have time limita-
tions, and so we all have 15 minutes and come back for another 15.
  I would then like to have it understood that I am trying to get to
the heart of what I think are some critical matters, not that these
matters that I wish to raise are necessarily the sole litmus test for
qualification, but because of the time limitations under which we
all work we must single out a few things to make a point or two on
and see, when we put it all together, if we have probed to some
depth and substance. I would at least like in my own small way to
try to contribute to that end.

                                 SEPARATION OF POWERS

  You have stated your general judicial philosophy as regards sepa-
ration of power, which I think was well stated. You have certainly
given us some indication of your conception of federalism, which I
again think was well stated.

  It does seem to me that it is appropriate to pursue certain
substantive areas that would reflect upon your basic values on
certain subjects because--to be candid--even though we talk about
a rigid separation of policymaking and judicial interpretation of
the law, we all know in the real world of the Supreme Court that,
for good or for ill, the decisions of the Supreme Court have enor-
mous policy implications. That has been true since Marbury v.
Madison, and one could think of many classic cases illustrating the
point you have discussed--Brown v. The Board, Plessey v. Ferguson,
Dred Scott, ad infinitum--the enormous policy impact the Supreme
Court has.

  Hence, the basic fundamental values on certain crucial items
that respective Justices have to me do become critical factors to
consider because we are not working in a vacuum today; you will
not work in a vacuum once you are appointed to the U.S. Supreme
Court, assuming that things continue to move in that direction.
                                         106

  Let me cut through this gordian knot and get to the heart of one
issue which has been alluded to before--there is no question about
it; namely, this very difficult, hotly debated issue of abortion in the
United States.

  I wish to say again that I do not think it is the sole test for
qualification. I do not think it is the only thing that ought to be
pursued, nor has it been the only thing that has been pursued, but
certainly it is fair game as a part of a whole panoply of items--
concept cases--that we might pursue.

  As I understand, Mrs. O'Connor, your basic personal position on
this issue of abortion--just stating your personal values--is that
abortion on demand as a form of birth control--you are personally
opposed to that? Is that correct?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes, Senator.
  Senator EAST. Let me then follow up with this question: It has
sometimes been said that most people personally oppose abortion
as a form of birth control--that the real division is between those
in the public arena who might wish to do something about it and
those who would choose to do nothing about it.

  As regards that particular division, what do you think would be
an appropriate public policy position as far as dealing with the
subject of abortion on demand as a form of birth control is con-
cerned?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I really do not know that I should be
in the business of advising either this Congress or State legislators
with regard to what their present posture should be in developing
public policy.

  I feel that it is a valid subject for legislative action and consider-
ation, and certainly this Congress and your subcommittee have
been deeply involved and engrossed in dealing with this precise
area and determining to what extent this Congress should take
certain action.

  I appreciate that and appreciate that effort. It certainly is an
appropriate role for the Congress. I just do not think that it is a
proper function for me to be suggesting to you what you ought to
be doing.

  Senator EAST. Fine. I appreciate your concise and candid answer.
  Let me pursue then this point: I gather what you are saying is
that you do feel that it is fundamentally a legislative function to
deal with the public policy question of how one copes with abortion
on demand as a form of birth control. You would look upon that in
a separation of power context, at the Federal level at least, as
being in the domain of congressional action as opposed to the other
two branches of the Government? Would that be correct?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I would, subject only to any constitu-
tional restraints which might exist. That is not to say that it
should not also be the subject of State legislative consideration.
  Senator EAST. I think, just parenthetically, on your latter point it
is valid--that initially this was fundamentally a State function--to
deal with the question of abortion. It was certainly so envisioned by
the framers and certainly so envisioned by any reasonable inter-
pretation of the Constitution. I appreciate your candor on that,
Mrs. O'Connor.
                                         107

  Let me proceed with this question if I might: I would like to get
your reaction to this particular statement by Justice White as a
dissenter in Roe v. Wade in which Justice Rehnquist joined him.
This is what they had to say about the majority opinion in that
case Roe v. Wade--of 1973, which candidly is considered by many,
even those who have differing views on the abortion issue, as
probably the most glaring and flagrant example we have of judicial
usurpation of congressional or--as you rightly put it--State policy-
making function.

  I would appreciate your reaction to this statement. Again, I am
quoting directly from Justices White and Rehnquist. They say: "As
an exercise of raw judicial power the Court perhaps has authority
to do what it does today, but in my view"--Justice White, Rehn-
quist agreeing--"its judgment is an improvident and extravagant
exercise of the power of judicial review which the Constitution
extends to this Court."

   Does that sound to you like a good statement of your judicial
philosophy and a pertinent one as regards--yes, candidly--the spe-
cific issue of dealing with abortion on demand in the public arena?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator East, I have read, of course, the dis-
sent in Roe v. Wade, and I have read at least several scholarly
articles criticizing that decision and have attempted to do a good
deal of reading on the subject.

   I am well aware of the criticisms that are leveled in those
dissenting opinions of Justices Rehnquist and White, as I am of the
other criticisms that have been raised.

   For me to join in that criticism would be perhaps perceived as an
improper exercise of my function right now, as a nominee to the
Court, for the simple reason that I suspect we have not seen the
last of that doctrine, or holding, or case, and that indeed we are
very likely to have the matter come back before the Court in one
form or another.

   At least many who are dissatisfied with the opinion have ex-
pressed that one of the things that should be done is that the Court
should be asked to reconsider that very holding, in which case
consideration of the views expressed in the dissent as well as the
majority and the other criticisms that have been raised and the
comments pro and con would be very important and would become
a part and parcel of the arguments to be considered when that case
is reconsidered.

   Senator EAST. I can certainly appreciate your desire not to specu-
late on hypothetical cases in the future, let alone certainly any
existing pending case; but in terms of getting a feel for your
fundamental judicial philosophy beyond generality, certainly to
comment upon already decided cases and doctrines emanating out
of them would be very appropriate in the confirmation hearing
process.

   This is not of course to be interpreted--and I would so publicly
state--that you are promising to vote a certain way on a given
speculated set of facts or a hypothetical case in the future.

   I am asking really simply whether you think that specific state-
ment is a reasonably valid one in terms of your understanding of
this very significant and very profound case that not only deals
with a very important issue but deals with the very fundamental

    87-101 O--81 1
                                         108

question that we are after this whole hearing--namely, the judicial
philosophy of you as the nominee.

  Judge O'CONNOR. I appreciate that. My concern is simply that
which was felt, I suppose, by Justice Harlan when he was asked
about the steel seizure cases which had been recently handed down
and other nominees who have been asked about their views on the
merits or lack thereof of recent decisions before their nomination
and their similar reluctance to directly respond.

  I understand your concern, and I appreciate it; I think it is
appropriate. It is just that I feel that it is improper for me to
endorse or criticize that decision which may well come back before
the Court in one'form or another and indeed appears to be coming
back with some regularity in a variety of contexts.

  I do not think we have seen the end of that issue or that holding,
and that is the concern I have about expressing an endorsement or
criticism of the holding.

  With respect to my judicial philosophy, I certainly feel comfort-
able in discussing that with you and in indicating how I would be
inclined to approach a problem or a case.

 ' I have tried to indicate today that I have attempted to view the
role of the judge as appropriately one of judicial restraint in decid-
ing those cases that come before the court on appropriately narrow
grounds and resolving issues based on my understanding of the
constitutional doctrines which are being invoked.

  Senator EAST. Again, I appreciate your candor and your forth-
rightness. I suppose the frustration--maybe it is somewhat unique,
though not at all for a moment reflecting adversely in terms of
your qualification or potential service on the bench--is that fre-
quently with nominees there would be, let us say, an extensive
record in terms of their background on major substantive questions
whereby we would not have to perhaps probe as deeply in a confir-
mation hearing because we would have a rather extensive written
record.

  It seems to me if we get a nominee where that is not necessarily
so, because of your great work at the State level, we have some-
what of a heightened responsibility to pursue your attitudes.

  For example, I would if time would allow--and it has run out on
me--one might inquire as to your general feelings on the rights of
women and how that might be reflected in the public policy arena;
or the rights of minorities--blacks, for example--and how that
might be reflected in the public policy arena; or your attitude on
the death penalty and how that might be reflected in the public
policy arena.

  So it is in that spirit that I inquire about it and do agree that I
pressed the point to that extent simply because of the dearth of
information on the record. Perhaps in my next 15 minutes I can
pursue this issue a bit further.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that my time has run
out.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Baucus?

 LIMIT SUPREME COURT JURISDICTION OVER CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES

  Senator BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge O'Connor, I would like to touch upon a subject that has
been addressed by most Senators this morning and this afternoon--
namely, what the proper congressional or Presidential response
should be when there is profound disagreement with a Supreme
Court interpretation of the Constitution.

  The classic traditional response has been for Congress and the
States to attempt to amend the Constitution through the amend-
ment process.

  Another remedy of course would be for the President to try to
appoint nominees who were in accordance with the public's view of
the issue.

  A third approach would be for Congress to attempt to impeach a
nominee. Additionally, Congress might try to override the Supreme
Court by statute--albeit Marbury v. Madison would pose a prob-
lem.

  A final solution--which has been the subject of discussion in this
body in the last couple of years would be for the Congress to try to
limit Supreme Court jurisdiction of the particular constitutional
issue.

   Earlier this morning you discussed with Senator Laxalt and an-
other Senator on this committee the McCardle and the Klein cases
and how the precedents in this area have been ambiguous. Fur-
thermore, those cases were decided many years ago anyway.

   My question is: As a matter of public policy--as Sandra Day
O'Connor, private citizen--what is your view as to whether Con-
gress should attempt to limit Supreme Court jurisdiction over con-
stitutional issues?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I really would feel constrained about
giving you my armchair advice on how you should handle these
things that are before you.

   Senator BAUCUS. Excuse me. I am not asking for you to advise us
on how to handle it. I am asking you as an individual citizen what
your personal view is.

   Judge O'CONNOR. When I was in the State legislature, Senator
Baucus, we had occasion to consider a particular proposal--a me-
morial to Congress asking in that instance that an amendment be
constructed to remove jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over a
certain subject matter.

   I did not support that memorial for the stated reason that I did
not feel, as a State legislator at that time, that I wanted to recom-
mend that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court be limited by
subject matter in that fashion.

   That was my own response as a State legislator when I had
occasion to consider that question. I was concerned that if it start-
ed in one area I did not know where it would end and that we
could be left without a court to determine the final state of the law
in that or other areas.

   Senator BAUCUS. IS that still your present view?
   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Baucus, it would be representative of
some of the questions and concerns which I would want to address
                                         110

if I were to consider that question as a legislator or Congressman
today.

  Senator BAUCUS. What are some of the public policy consider-
ations that come to mind on this issue?

  Judge O'CONNOR. That which I have indicated--to wit: I believe
it was contemplated by the framers of the Constitution that the
judicial branch, and acting through the Supreme Court ultimately,
would determine the final meaning, if you will, of the Constitution
and of Federal law and would resolve conflicts on the Federal law
which arose in the other Federal courts.

  To the extent that such power is removed by removing appellate
jurisdiction of the Court, then it would have the potential effect at
least of leaving unresolved those differences that might arise
among the several Federal courts and among the State courts, and
it would also have the potential effect in any event of leaving in
place any of the decisions which had previously been handed down
and which gave rise to the concern in the first place.

   Senator BAUCUS. SO one potential danger would be that the 50
States could have 50 different interpretations of the first amend-
ment--of free speech or free press. That would be one unfortunate
result that might occur--is that correct?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I think that is probably exaggerated because I
have to assume that even if jurisdiction were presently removed
over an area we would still have in place those decisions that had
previously been handed down. So it is not as though it would be
leaving everyone to write on a new slate, if you will.

  Senator BAUCUS. But if Congress removed Supreme Court review,
wouldn't Congress really be winking at the State courts and saying,
''States, go ahead and rule your own way because there is no other
body to override any decision you might make"?

  Judge O'CONNOR. These are among the questions that I think
have to be asked and addressed when we consider proposals of the
kind which you describe.

                        CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT PROCESS

  Senator BAUCUS. DO you think that the constitutional amend-
ment process works?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, it has worked of course about 26 times,
and at least we have that many on the books. Some others have
been proposed which were not approved.

  Senator BAUCUS. But do you think that the process is too cum-
bersome or too laborious to address unpopular Supreme Court deci-
sions?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, there have been several instances in
the history of our Nation where Congress has attacked a particular
holding of the Court by means of offering a constitutional amend-
ment, and it has been successful to the extent that amendments
have in fact been adopted.

  For example, the income tax amendment was really in reaction
to a holding of the Supreme Court.

  So I guess I have to respond that it can achieve the stated goal.
  Senator BAUCUS. That is correct. It is my understanding, too,
that in that case Senator Robert Taft argued against any attempt
                                         Ill

to limit Supreme Court jurisdiction on that issue because he felt it
better to address it by constitutional amendment--which was ulti-
mately accomplished by the 16th amendment.

  I raise the question because, during the debate on whether or not
Congress should limit Supreme Court jurisdiction, those who favor
such legislation argue that the constitutional amendment process is
too cumbersome and too laborious.

  I again ask you whether in your view you think the process is
too laborious or too cumbersome or whether it works well. Do you
think it is well designed as it is, or does Congress need the addi-
tional tool of limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction?

  Judge O'CONNOR. The amendment process takes varying
amounts of time to accomplish and various amounts of effort to
achieve.

  Our most recent example is with the 18-year-old voting amend-
ment. It did seem to take particularly long before that process was
completed.

  We have a number of other amendments in our Nation's history
which did not take long to complete. Others have taken much
longer and have been much more complex, in terms of dealing with
them.

   So I think it just depends on a case-by-case basis with the partic-
ular subject in mind whether the amendment process is the appro-
priate one to consider.

  There is another means, of course, of resolving issues which the
Supreme Court has addressed and which many find to be unsatis-
factory; and that process involves asking the Court by means of
other cases to reconsider or distinguish the holdings which were
found to be unfortunate. This is another way in which, over time at
least, changes in unpopular decisions, if you will, have been modi-
fied.

   Senator BAUCUS. I take it from an earlier answer you gave to
another member of this committee that the Court should not be
influenced by attempts in Congress to limit its jurisdiction or by
what it reads in the newspaper but more influenced by the briefs
and oral arguments of the cases before it?

   Judge O'CONNOR. It does seem to me that the Court should make
its decisions based on legal principles and not on its assessment of
outside opinion, if you will.

   It seems to me that the Court should review the facts of the
particular case and consider the arguments that are raised, which
may indeed be reflective of public concern, but should consider
those arguments in the proper setting within the framework of the
Court itself and within the framework of the oral arguments and
the briefing that is done on the cases.

                      PUBLIC CONFIDENCE OF SUPREME COURT

   Senator BAUCUS. Thank you.
   I would like to turn to a second subject. According to a Louis
Harris poll, in 1966, 51 percent of the American public had a great
deal of confidence in the Supreme Court. In 1980, 27 percent of the
American public expressed a similar confidence--a drop from 51
                                          112

percent to 27 percent in 14 years. What, in your view, explains that
drop?

   Judge O'CONNOR. I am not sure that I can explain it. I suppose
that a portion of it would have to be reflective of public perceptions
of the results of particular decisions which have been widely publi-
cized and would cause concern.

   Perhaps it is a reflection, if you will, of the manner in which the
Court has been treated in some form in the media; I do not know.

   Perhaps we have more public discussion of the Court, or perhaps
we have less. I am not sure which aspects have led to the change in
the polls.

                         SUPREME COURT PRESS CONFERENCES

   Senator BAUCUS. DO you think the Court should have press con-
ferences?

   Judge O'CONNOR. DO I think they should as a general rule have
press conferences?

   Senator BAUCUS. Yes.
   Judge O'CONNOR. AS a personal view only, I probably do not
think that that is a good plan.
   The Court does attempt to speak by explaining its reasoning and
rationale in the published opinions that it issues, and the hope at
least is that in that process the reasons will be sufficiently ex-
pounded.

                                                EPITAPH

   Senator BAUCUS. Finally--I told you I would ask you this ques-
tion, which is: How do you want to be remembered in history?

   Judge O'CONNOR. The tombstone question--what do I want on
the tombstone? [Laughter.]

   Senator BAUCUS. Hopefully it will be written in places other than
on a tombstone.

  Judge O'CONNOR. I hope it might say, "Here lies a good judge."
   Senator BAUCUS. What does that mean to you? Do you want to be
known as the first woman judge or the judge from the West, the
judge who upheld civil liberties--just what does that mean to you?
  Judge O'CONNOR. If I am confirmed I am sure that I would be
remembered, no doubt, as the first woman to have served in that
capacity; and I hope that in addition if I am confirmed and allowed
to serve that I would be remembered for having given fair and full
consideration to the issues that were raised and to resolving things
on an even-handed basis and with due respect and regard for the
Constitution of this country.
   I would hope that on occasion my opinions could reflect clarity of
thought and of word and be a reflection of the appropriate values
and analysis that I think is merited of these constitutional issues to
come before the Court.
  Senator BAUCUS. Are there any institutional changes that you
think should be made within the Court?
   Senator BIDEN. YOU might as well let them know before you get
there. [Laughter.]
  Judge O'CONNOR. AS the newcomer on the block I would hesitate
to offer all those opinions. It would probably be inappropriate.
                                         113

  I am aware though that the Court has a greatly increasing
caseload, and this is a concern I am sure because there are ever
more decisions that have the potential for review and that need
review, and the Court is limited by sheer virtue of numbers and
hours in what can be done; this is a concern.

  Senator BAUCUS. What in your view will be the most difficult
question the Court will face in the next 25 years--the death penal-
ty? Abortion? What will it be?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I do not think I can answer that. It hears all
the major issues of the day in one way or another. Most of those
land before the Court, and it ultimately addresses most of those
grave and serious concerns that this Nation faces in one form or
another. I would not know which of those on reflection would turn
out to be the most significant.

  Senator BAUCUS. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, I am sure you would agree that
our constitutional form of government is probably the greatest
form of government in the world. Many people feel that the Consti-
tution is the greatest document ever written by the mind of man
for the governing of a people.
  In view of that I guess a good epitaph for a judge would be,
"Here lies a judge who upheld the Constitution."
  Judge O'CONNOR. I think that would be very apt, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
   In view of that I think we can now recess, as we planned to, until
10 o'clock tomorrow morning.

on Thursday, September 10, 1981, at 10 a.m.]

                                                                         U.S. SENATE,
                                                    COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                              Washington, D.C.
  The committee met, pursuant to recess, at 10:08 a.m, in room
1202, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Senator Strom Thurmond
(chairman of the committee) presiding.
  Also present: Senators Mathias, Laxalt, Hatch, Dole, East, Grass-
ley, Denton, Specter, Biden, Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini,
Leahy, Baucus, and Heflin.
  Staff present: Vinton D. Lide, chief counsel; Quentin Crommelin,
Jr., staff director; Duke Short, chief investigator; and Candie Bruse,
chief clerk.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Judiciary Committee will come to order.
  The questioning of Judge O'Connor will now continue. Senator
Grassley of Iowa is next in line. Senator Grassley.
  Judge O'Connor, I remind you that you are still under oath.

TESTIMONY OF SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR, OF ARIZONA, NOMI-
  NATED TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, U.S. SUPREME COURT--
  Resumed
  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Welcome back, Judge O'Connor. According to the television last

night, you did very well.
  Unlike the other nominees, Judge O'Connor, you do not have a

strong record on major judicial issues for us to review. That is not
your fault; that is because you served on State courts as opposed to
Federal courts. You have not served on the Federal court of ap-
peals, as the Chief Justice did, or held the leadership position on
policy matters that was evident from Justice Powell's position in
the ABA or Justice Rehnquist's activities in the Justice Depart-
ment.

  All of us on this committee respect your obligation not to com-
ment on certain matters but I hope that you will understand that
in light of your lack of written record on major issues, it is our
obligation in this hearing to attempt to insure that you do not
prove as great a surprise to President Reagan as Earl Warren was
to President Eisenhower. [Laughter.]

                                       JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY

  Frankly, it has been my observation that every candidate for the
Senate is a fiscal conservative and every nominee to the Supreme

                                                     (115)
                                         116

Court is a strict constructionist but once they take their seat it
may be an entirely different matter. That is true of the Senate as
well as the Supreme Court. Therefore, this is really the only forum
in which we as Senators can learn of your judicial philosophy,
thereby allowing us to fulfill our duty in making a proper decision,
and it is to that end that I proceed with some questioning.

   I understand that part of your reason for not commenting on
specific cases is that you may have to disqualify yourself from
similar cases should they arise before the Court. As a part of your
preparation for this hearing, did you read the statute that governs
the kind of statements you are claiming privilege from making?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman and Senator Grassley, if you are
referring to title 28, United States Code, section 455

  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes.
  Judge O'CONNOR [continuing]. And the ABA canon 3(c), yes, I
have read those. I have also, of course, been guided in large meas-
ure by my review of the positions taken by prior nominees to the
Supreme Court when they have appeared before this body.
  I am sure you know, Senator, that beginning with the earliest
such occasions the nominees have felt reluctant to answer ques-
tions concerning issues that may come before the Court, and there
are many expressions of that concern which have I think been
called to our attention during the course of these proceedings.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Are you familiar with Justice Rehnquist's
comments in Laird v. Tatum, where respondents urged him to
disqualify himself because of public statements he made about the
constitutional issues that were raised in the case? He made these
statements prior to his nomination as a Supreme Court Justice.

  Justice Rehnquist's comments went on for 6 pages, citing not
only the above statute but also various instances where Justices
not only had commented publicly on substantive constitutional
issues but actually had been principal authors of the laws that
later came before the Supreme Court, before the Supreme Court
decided the constitutionality of that law, for support for his posi-
tion.

  Have you reviewed the transcripts of confirmation hearings of
other Court nominees who have appeared before this committee?
You have indicated that perhaps you have done that.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes, Senator Grassley, I have done that.
  Senator GRASSLEY. AS far as you know, is it true that n< other
member of the Supreme Court has ever had to disqualify himself
from a case because of policy statements made outside of the
courtroom?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, I cannot
answer that question. My review of the transcripts of the prior
hearings reveals that the nominees have been rather careful in
this area not to put themselves in that kind of a position.
  In Laird v. Tatum, in which the question was raised and Justice
Rehnquist had to address himself to it, it really related to certain
statements that he had made prior to becoming a nominee for the
Supreme Court. We do not live in a vacuum, of course, and I have
served as a State legislator and as a trial court judge. Certainly, I
would not expect that my statements or activities in that State
legislative body or as a State trial court judge could fairly be said
                                         117

to disqualify me from sitting on a case subsequently on the United
States Supreme Court, when some of those same issues would
subsequently be addressed.

  Basically, that is what Justice Rehnquist was discussing in Laird
v. Tatum but I think it might be useful to also quote Justice
Rehnquist from the same case, when he was discussing the situa-
tion of a nominee at a hearing such as this, in which he said:

  I would distinguish quite sharply between a public statement made prior to
nomination for the bench on the one hand, and a public statement by a nominee to
the bench. For the latter to express any but the most general observation about the
law would suggest that in order to obtain favorable consideration of his nomination,
he deliberately was announcing in advance, without benefit of judicial oath, briefs,
or argument, how he would decide a particular question that might come before him
as a judge.

  In that paragraph I think Justice Rehnquist did try to distin-
guish the situation to which you refer; namely, statements or con-
duct that occurred prior to becoming a nominee versus the process
following the nomination.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Could I suggest to you that you did not read
the entire quote, because in Laird Rehnquist noted that as to
disqualification there is no difference between a nominee's state-
ments and prior statements.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, the quote
that I have read I thought did correctly reflect and quote Justice
Rehnquist's view of the situation of the nominee at the hearing.
Indeed, my review of his own confirmation hearing would lend
some substance to that view, wherein he on occasion had to consid-
er the same troubling questions that we are considering now in the
sense that there were some things which might come before the
Court which he felt he was unable to address directly.

  Senator GRASSLEY. He differentiates between propriety as op-
posed to disqualification, but at this point I do not care to follow
that particular point any more except to ask you, in your process of
reviewing nominees' reactions before confirmation hearings, did
you have an opportunity to read Justice Powell's comments on
Escobido and Miranda in his confirmation hearings?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, yes, I did.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I suppose, then, that you are aware of the fact
that he did express an opinion and he was careful to make clear
that it was at the time that he was head of or active in the ABA.
At the time he said that he expressed the view that the minority
opinions were much sounder than the majority opinions. He did
express that in the confirmation hearings.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, the practice
of holding confirmation hearings really began with Justice Stone.
It was dropped, I think, until Justice Frankfurter was nominated
to the Court in 1937, and at the beginning of Justice Frankfurter's
hearing he observed that he would not care to express his personal
views on controversial issues affecting the Court.
  When the Chief Justice, Chief Justice Berger was asked a ques-
tion which might bear on how a conceivable case could be decided,
he said,

  I should certainly observe the proprieties by not undertaking to comment on
anything which might come either before the court on which I now sit or before any
other court on which I may sit. I think I must limit any comments in that way.
                                         118

  This is basically the thrust, Senator Grassley, of the nominees
who have appeared before the Senate committees and have been
questioned on matters which indeed might come before the Court.

  Senator GRASSLEY. DO you feel that Justice Powell went further
than he should have in his comments on the Escobido and Miranda
case?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, I am sure
Justice Powell responded only in a manner which he felt was
appropriate at the time.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge O'Connor, could you tell us how many
discussions you had with the President personally or by telephone
prior to his announcement of your selection?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, yes: two.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Can I ask you for how long a period of time
those two were, approximately, in minutes?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, it would be
really a speculation on my part because I was very engrossed, as
you might imagine, in the conversation. I was not watching any
clock or my watch.
  We had a discussion at the White House--I am not certain how
long that lasted--and we had a discussion on the telephone prior to
the nomination.
  Senator GRASSLEY. TO the best of your recollection, what were
some of the things that he asked you in those conversations?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, I think it
would not be proper for me to disclose the contents of private
conversations which I had with the President about this matter.
  Senator GRASSLEY. OK. Did he ask you any policy questions?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, I really do
not think that it is appropriate for me to relate what was stated,
other than that I think it would be proper for me to assure you
that I was not asked to make any commitments concerning any
issue which might come before the Court.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Would you repeat that, please?
  Judge O'CONNOR. I was not asked to make any commitments,
Senator Grassley, about what I would do or how I would resolve
any issue to come before the Court. I think it would be proper for
me to assure you of that.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, could you generalize to any extent? Was
any of the conversation that you had with the President similar to
any of the things that the members of this committee are asking
you?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, I would sug-
gest that I should not properly reveal the content of those conver-
sations.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Did the President ask you not to discuss that
conversation?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, I would sug-
gest that I should not reveal the contents of the conversation but I
am in no way suggesting that that was at his request. That is my
perception of what is proper.
                                             119

                                     COURT-ORDERED BUSING

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge O'Connor, yesterday we heard your
personal views on some issues. I really was hoping to have not your
personal views but how you might express your judicial philosophy,
and general approaches to things that might come before the
Court.

  You did give us your personal view on at least one issue, the
subject of abortion. Since we are going to probably cast a vote for
or against you based upon your personal views more so than state-
ments of substance that we would get on issues that may come
before the Court, could I ask you for your personal views on busing,
forced busing?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, I assume you
mean in the context of the court-ordered busing in connection with
school desegregation cases?

  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Grassley, as you are
probably aware, again any comments that I would make on this
subject about my personal views have no place in my opinion in
the resolution of any legal issues that might come before the Court.
  Senator GRASSLEY. OK. No; I want your personal views in the
same vein, in the same context and in the same environment you
gave us your personal views on abortion. I would like to have your
personal views on busing.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Speaking to that end, perhaps illustrative of
that is the position that I did take in the legislature when I had
occasion to vote in favor of a memorial that requested action to be
taken at the Federal level to terminate the use of forced busing in
desegregation cases.

  This is a matter of concern, I think, to many people. The trans-
portation of students over long distances and in a time-consuming
process in an effort to get them to school can be a very disruptive
part of any child's educational program.

   In that perhaps I am influenced a little bit by my own experi-
ence. I grew up in a very remote part of Arizona and we were not
near any school. It bothered me to be away from home to attend
school, which I had been from kindergarten on. In the eighth grade
I attempted to live at home on the ranch and ride a schoolbus to
get to school. It involved a 75-mile trip each day, round trip, that
is, and I found that I had to leave home before daylight and get
home after dark.

   I found that very disturbing to me as a child, and I am sure that
other children who have had to ride long distances on buses have
shared that experience. I just think that it is not a system that
often is terribly beneficial to the child.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Judge O'Connor. My time is up.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin.
   Senator HEFLIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge O'Connor, following the line of questioning that Senator
Grassley pursued in regard to your meetings and conversation with
the President, did the President offer you any jellybeans? [Laugh-
ter.]
                                          120

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Heflin, in the Oval
Office I was seated next to the jellybeans but I confess to you that I
was more interested in what was being said. [Laughter.]

                       POLICE POWER AND INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS

   Senator HEFLIN. For any person going on the Supreme Court,
there is a real problem that any court must face between individu-
al rights and police power. I suppose this issue has been an issue
that has confronted the Court and each individual member of the
Court since the Court has really been in being.

   It is the issue, of course, of the police power of the State and the
issue of the police power of the Federal Government within its
jurisdiction. There is the issue of constitutional rights, individual
rights. There are rights that are not expressly contained within the
Constitution and the amendments thereto but that have developed,
such as the right of privacy.

   I wonder if you would express to us your general philosophy in
making decisions dealing with the conflict between the police
power and individual rights?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I assume you are speaking in terms of, for
instance, legislation enacted for example within the police power
jurisdiction of State government?

   Senator HEFLIN. Well, for example, with all of our crimes, practi-
cally all of the crimes in the States, the issue arises sometimes in
the language, sometimes in the application. It raises the issue of
individual rights versus police power of the State.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Heflin, I suppose the
normal standard for review, of course, which is applied by the
Court is whether the particular legislative enactment that is being
reviewed bears a rational relationship to a legitimate State objec-
tive. Traditionally, if it does the enactment is upheld.

  Obviously when we are dealing with some rights, for example,
under the first amendment--the right of free speech or the right
under the establishment of free exercise clauses, something of that
sort--the Court has adopted I think a rather more stringent set of
tests to determine whether those rights have been preserved. We
could examine each of those individually, for instance, in the free
speech area or the freedom of religion area because the Court has
been rather more specific in those areas. However, just in broad,
general terms, absent one of those special rights, the Court has
tended to apply the usual test for the most part in determining
whether a particular piece of legislation should be upheld.

  Now if the legislation, either on its face or if determined by the
trier of fact, was intended to be discriminatory against a particular
group of people--for instance, on the basis of race or on the basis of
national origin, and in some cases on the basis of alienage--the
Court has applied a much stricter test in reviewing that legislation
and indeed has looked to see whether that particular provision,
discriminatory provision, is necessary to achieve a compelling State
interest or governmental interest.

  In the area of discriminatory legislation on the basis of gender,
the Court has applied a sometimes shifting standard to determine
                                      121

how to review those cases, something in between the strictly sus-
pect standard and the rational basis standard.

                                    TENTH AMENDMENT

  Senator HEFLIN. Thank you.
  The early decisions of the Supreme Court have recognized the
essential role of the States in our Federal system of government.
Justice Chase in the case of Texas v. White declared that "The
Constitution in all of its provisions looks to an indestructible Union
composed of indestructible States."
  You know that the 10th amendment reserves to the States and to
the people the powers not specifically delegated within the Consti-
tution. At the same time, it has been recognized that the Constitu-
tion has granted plenary authority to the Federal Government to
do all that is necessary and proper to carry out the express powers
enumerated in the Constitution.
  In light of these provisions, I would like to know your general
philosophy of the role of the Judiciary in preserving Federalism.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Heflin, the judiciary in
my view has an important obligation in that regard. The Federal
Government was the outgrowth or product of the States' willing-
ness to band together and form a Federal Government, and it of
course assumed that it had created a Federal Government of limit-
ed powers and, indeed, had delegated expressly to the Federal
Government those powers that the States then thought were appro-
priate, and reserved in the 10th amendment to the people and to
the States those powers that were not delegated.
  I guess we would have to say that it is under the 10th amend-
ment, really, that the States exercise their broad police power
which has been generally regarded as a reserve power to the
States. The Court through the years has not, at least in recent
decades, given much specific--or, has not based many decisions on
the 10th amendment.
  I think I mentioned yesterday, perhaps, the one instance that
comes to mind in recent years in which the Court invalidated a
congressional enactment as it applied to the States, and that was
in the National League of Cities v. Ussery case, in which the
Federal Government had attempted to apply the wage and hour
law to State employees and the Court drew the line in that in-
stance.
  It more recently, however, declined to rely on the 10th amend-
ment to invalidate congressional enactments in the area of surface
mining regulation, and said that in that instance the Congress was
addressing its primary thrust to the regulation of business or pri-
vate interests as such and not attempting to regulate the States as
States.
  I am sure that we have not seen the last of the inquiries that the
Court will make, by any stretch, into the application of the 10th
amendment, but it sets forth a very vital pronouncement of the
role of the States in the Federal system and indeed--as a product if
you will of State government, which I am--I have some concerns
about seeing that State governments and local government are
maintained in their abilities to deal with the problems affecting
                                         122

the people. The reason for that philosophically is because I think I
would agree with those who think that the government closest to
the people is best able to handle those problems.

  Now I guess time will tell the extent to which the Court and the
Federal courts generally will rely upon the 10th amendment in
their resolution of some of these problems.

                                     ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

  Senator HEFLIN. There has developed--and it has developed and
is prevalent today--a tremendous number of adjudications that
take place outside the formal judicial system of the Federal Gov-
ernment. What I am referring to are the administrative agencies.
There are many people today who feel that problems are presented
because administrative agencies occupy the position of investigator
or prosecutor, judge, trial judge, all combined in one.

  Of course, the administrative law judge system has developed.
There are many people who feel that there is neither the independ-
ence nor the appearance of independence in that system. I wonder
if you have any ideas as to what could be done to give more
independence, more impartiality to the decisions that are made in
the administrative agencies, and the scope of review by the courts
which is basically within the circuit courts of appeals. Do you have
any thoughts on this issue?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Heflin, it is a very
important subject. Much of the contact which the public has with
government in general, whether it is at the State or the Federal
level, is through the administrative branches of government. These
are the arms of the Federal agencies and the State agencies that
are actually administering the policies established by the legisla-
tive body.

  As you pointed out, the practice in administrative law is to have
the agency itself sit in judgment of any disputes that come with
relation to that agency's regulation of the public, and many people
find that that is a little bit difficult to accept in terms of having a
fair and impartial resolution of their problems. That concern is
understandable.

  Nevertheless, it appears to be rather firmly entrenched in both
the State and Federal systems. The question then becomes, how do
you make it more workable? I think there is discussion, certainly,
at various State levels and perhaps nationally about the extent to
which you can set up impartial tribunals that are not part and
parcel of the administrative agency itself to hear resolutions of the
problems; discussions about whether it would serve the governmen-
tal bodies well to set up an entirely separate administrative tribu-
nal that could serve as the trier of fact, if you will, for a number of
agencies rather than just each agency administering its own. I
think that these things have merit.

  I believe that the Congress is also considering certain amend-
ments to the standards of review in existence for administrative
agency decisions. Typically, the standard of review has been to
overturn the administrative decision only if there is an abuse of
discretion made, and great weight is given to the determinations of
the administrative agency. Now clearly, it would be within the
                                         123

legislative function to alter that standard, to have--I suppose if the
review were had de novo, that is nonproductive because it forces
such a load on the courts but maybe something in between can be
considered. Maybe we do not need to grant any presumptions of
validity.

  These are matters that I think are relevant for current discus-
sion and perhaps merit discussion because there is a great deal of
concern in the public generally about the field of administrative
law.

                                                CASE LOAD

  Senator HEFLIN. One other question: I will have to maybe give
you a brief background for it. In 1890 the U.S. Supreme Court had
filed with it approximately 550 cases. They asked for relief. In 1891
the nine circuit courts of appeal were established to give it relief.
After taking cases from the Supreme Court into those circuit
courts of appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court determined 275 cases in
1891. Some of those cases were summarily decided without opinion;
approximately two-thirds were decided with opinion.

  Last year the Supreme Court took approximately 275 cases and
has consistently taken approximately 275 cases since 1891. Cases
filed with the Supreme Court last year were something in the
neighborhood of 4,200, as compared to about 550 in 1891. The
granting of cert or the mandatory jurisdiction that had to be exer-
cised in those regards constituted about less than 7 percent of the
cases that were filed with it. I suppose, looking over the fact that
275 cases has been almost the norm since that period of time but
that the population has increased the number of cases, certainly
we are more litiguous today than we were then.

  You have had experience as a member of a court of appeals of
your State in which I suppose that the supreme court of your State
reviewed the decisions of your court of appeals. Is that correct?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Correct.
  Senator HEFLIN. DO you have any suggestions pertaining to the
discretionary cases that the Supreme Court takes or a remedy for
the overall problem? Largely, the Supreme Court today has to
select the ones that they feel are important to society in general.
Many cases that they might want to take, they will not take.
  We also know that we have had two studies of the Fraun propos-
al, and the Ruska Commission had worked on this. Do you have
any thoughts pertaining to some method of relief to the U.S. Su-
preme Court, and relief to the public and to the litigants that file,
where they have cases that cry out for consideration?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Heflin, I believe that
you have personally been involved in an in-depth review of this
area. You likewise have come from a State court system in which
you have taken a great personal interest in the affairs of the
administration of justice and I think are very well informed on the
subject.
  However, you have pointed out the extent and really dramatic
nature of the problem which the Court presently faces in terms of
sheer numbers. Several things I suppose are possible. One of the
things that is being studied and considered, I am told, is a national
court of appeals, something in between the Federal courts of appeal

       87-101 O--81 9
                                         124

and the Supreme Court which conceivably could assimilate some
additional number of the issues that need to be resolved, at least to
the extent that we have differing opinions among the various Fed-
eral courts of appeal.

   This is certainly one possibility, one that would have to be stud-
ied with a great amount of care in terms of determining what its
jurisdiction would be, whether in fact it would alleviate the situa-
tion or not, what types of cases it would really handle. Justice
James Cameron of our Arizona Supreme Court has done some
work in this area as well and is publishing something on the
subject currently.

   Another possibility, it seems to me, would be to consider removal
of the mandatory jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court. As you
know, some cases must be accepted on appeal. Possibly giving the
Court the opportunity to have entirely discretionary jurisdiction on
appeal could be helpful in the long run.

  Whether there are other things that can actually curtail the
tremendous problem we are having with numbers, I do not know.
One would like to think that with less extensive regulation, that
perhaps at some point some issues would become settled and would
no longer become the subject of as much litigation as we have, so
maybe we have to approach it from all aspects. Maybe we are
encouraging litigation at the bottom level at the same time we are
trying to solve the problem at the top.

  Senator HEFLIN. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Denton of Alabama.
  Senator DENTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Good morning, Judge O'Connor.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Good morning.
  Senator DENTON. We have had references to this being an ordeal,
an inquisition. I do congratulate you on your endurance and your
poise, your graciousness. I would like it known that I do not feel
like an inquisitor; I do not feel condescending.
  I had a little scrapbook of sayings which sort of guided my life.
They were printed, three or four of them, in a newspaper article
once and they were included in a book I wrote. One of them was,
"An officer should wear his uniform as a judge his ermine--with-
out a stain."
  Therefore, I have a tremendous respect for your profession, for
your position. I have a tremendous respect for you as a woman who
has fulfilled the indispensible roles of wife and mother in such a
successful way, and then has gone on to extrapolate into fields of
professional accomplishment which would amount to, in my opin-
ion, in sum constituting pretty much an ideal woman. I ask you
these questions with that feeling toward you.
  The other gentlemen here have asked you questions about such
subjects as judicial activism, civil rights, separation of powers, be-
cause respecting you at least as much as I, they are concerned
about matters which affect the welfare of this country vis-a-vis the
prospect of your nomination.
  I am compelled to ask, for the same reason, about abortion. As I
ask, I have in mind the cultural shock of my returning to this
country after almost 8 years away from it. We had changed in a lot
of ways, as you could probably imagine--we talked about this
                                         125

together--from 1965 to 1973. It was, I think, a devastatingly accel-
erated sort of self-degradation period which I believe we are tend-
ing to recover from.

  Among the changes I noted was the abortion issue, abortion
being totally accepted, although the ruling had been a little earlier.
It was just an accepted thing, and it was appalling to me but not as
appalling as it is today. In other words, I have gone through a
recognition of how important abortion is, since 1973 to now, a
much greater appreciation for what it consists of.

  I did not understand why there was so much concentration on
abortion, for example, by the Catholic Church in 1973 when I
returned. I thought, "Why are they picking on that instead of some
of the other things that are going on, the massage parlors, the
absolute free sex thing, the perversion? Why abortion?"

  I gradually found out, just from thinking about it, but I did note
that, you know, for thousands of years in Judeo-Christian society
abortion was about the worst word you could say. In the Navy we
used to have an expression: "That plan is an abortion." It was the
worst condemnation you could give to it in 1960, and all of a
sudden when I come home in 1973, you do not say that any more.
It is totally outmoded.

  What "remarkable enlightenment occurred to mankind to make
that happen in Judeo-Christian society, I did not understand, and
still do not. I am concerned about it in other ways, as I expressed
yesterday and might express again today.

  Based on my earlier conversation with you and your testimony
up to this time, it is my belief that you have changed your position
on abortion since you were in the Arizona Legislature. Under what
conditions do you now feel abortion is not offensive?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Denton, for myself it is
simply offensive to me. It is something that is repugnant to me and
something in which I would not engage. Obviously, there are others
who do not share these beliefs, and I recognize that. I think we are
obligated to recognize that others have different views and some
would draw the line in one place rather than another.

   Senator DENTON. That is the line I am asking you about: In your
personal view, where do you feel abortion is not offensive in the
respect of drawing that line? We here in the Congress have had to
think in those nitty-gritty terms. Each individual in the world,
really, and the United States in particular, is thinking in those
terms now. It is an agonizing question, and I do respect the differ-
ing points of view of others. I do know that I came through several
transition periods myself but I am asking you where you now are
in drawing that line. Where is it inoffensive?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, for myself I have to draw it
rather strictly. I am "over the hill." I am not going to be pregnant
any more, so it is perhaps easy for me to speak. For myself, I find
that it is something in which I would not engage.

  For those in the legislative halls, it poses very difficult problems
for them in drawing those lines legislatively. They are presently
constrained, of course, by the limitations placed on by the Court in
the Roe v. Wade decision, and if you were to draft legislation today
I suppose it would have to be drafted with that case in mind while
it remains on the books.
                                         126

  Senator DENTON. Well, with all due respect, we are dealing with
such nitty-gritty distinctions as rape, incest, and so forth, save the
life of the mother. I am asking your personal reflection on the
inoffensiveness with respect to those kinds of conditions. Where do
you think it occurs? Where does it become inoffensive? I realize
that this is not with respect to you, your personal body, but with
respect to justice or compassion, the sum of which you view life
with.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Denton, it remains
offensive at all levels. The question is, what exceptions will be
recognized in the public sector? That is really the question.

  Senator DENTON. Where do you feel that the possibility should
occur?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I find that it is a problem at any level. Where
you draw the line as a matter of public policy is really the task of
the legislator to determine. Would I personally object to drawing
the line to saving the life of the mother? No; I would not. Are there
other areas? Possibly. These are things that the legislator must
decide.

  Senator DENTON. Well, candidly, personally, in terms of a tubal
pregnancy with the impossibility of delivering that fetus, the oper-
ation to take it from the mother can be viewed as an abortion to
save the life of the mother. I want to confess that I am in favor of
that activity. I would not refer to it as abortion, but I want to say
that you are more conservative than I in the answer you just gave.

  Do you feel that your present attitude will remain as a final
position? If not, which way do you feel likely to trend on the issue?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Denton, I cannot
answer what I will feel in the future. I hope that none of us are
beyond the capacity to learn and to understand and to appreciate
things. I do not want to be that kind of a person. I want to be a
person who is open-minded and who is responsive to the reception
of knowledge.

  I must say that I do expect that in this particular area we will
know a great deal more 10 years from now about the processes in
the development of the fetus than we know today. I think we know
a great deal more today than we knew 10 years ago, and I hope
that all of us are receptive and responsive to the acquisition of
knowledge and to change based upon that knowledge.

                                 ROE VERSUS WADE DECISION

  Senator DENTON. Retrospectively, do you feel comfortable about
the correctness of the Roe v. Wade decision?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Denton, I do not quite
know what that question means. If you mean, am I unaware of the
concerns that have been expressed about it, of course I am aware of
the concerns that have been expressed.

  Senator DENTON. What I mean is, as a person are you comfort-
able with the status quo of sort of psychological environment, peer
pressure about what is right and wrong, that that decision has left?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Denton, I am con-
cerned about the extent of public concern about that issue. Obvi-
ously, law which does not have a broad consensus, if you will, is
                                         127

always a concern to us because we are here in a broad sense in
Government as servants of the people. Lawmakers, it seems to me,
have to be concerned about the views of the public generally and
about broad segments of the public who feel strongly about certain
issues. That is vitally important in the lawmaking field.

  I think that the judicial branch is, of course, designed to be not
directly responsive to public pressure, and rightly so. I think all of
us would concede that it would be unwise to have courts try to
resolve public issues in a given case that is before the courts on the
basis of public sentiment but, of course, it is always a concern to us
and should be a concern to us when there is a broad level of public
discontent about some issue.

  Senator DENTON. Well, a great many people regard the Roe v.
Wade decision as the most extreme example or one of the most
extreme examples of judicial preference for "personal ideas and
philosophy" over textual and historical sources of constitutional
law. As I understood you earlier in your answers, you were in favor
of a judge ruling from those bases rather than from what had
become, perhaps temporarily, a public perception in terms of what
is OK and not OK.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Denton, yes, I do feel
that a judge is constrained by the processes surrounding the judi-
cial system to resolving issues based on the framework of the
particular case that has come before the judge, the particular facts,
the particular statute, and the law applicable to those.

                               WOMEN SERVING IN COMBAT

   Senator DENTON. Would you give your present personal position
with respect to women serving in actual military combat or ships
and planes which would likely become involved in combat?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Denton, it seems to me
that consistent with the recommendation I made when I served on
the Defense Advisory Committee on women in the service, that the
term "combat" should be specifically examined with regard to spe-
cific assignments, and that women should be considered if they are
in the military for service on assignments taking into account their
ability and the specific mission to be performed.

   I did not favor and do not favor today a complete exclusion, for
example, of any women naval personnel from a ship merely be-
cause it is a ship and it is in the U.S. Navy. I think that it has to
be examined much more closely than that, and that process has in
fact been occurring and it is one which I think is appropriate.

   Senator DENTON. My question was not directed toward the
Dacowits testimony, with which I am familiar, but just your per-
sonal preference. Assuming that we knew whether or not a woman
would be committed in combat, would you be for or against that
commitment?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Denton, speaking as a
personal matter only, I have never felt and do not now feel that it
is appropriate for women to engage in combat if that term is
restricted in its meaning to a battlefield situation, as opposed to
pushing a button someplace in a missile silo.
                                         128

  Senator DENTON. In other words, you would not want them to be
in a position to be shot?

  Judge O'CONNOR. TO be captured or shot? No, I would not.
[Laughter.]

  Senator DENTON. Well, it may astound this audience, but at the
Naval Academy not too many months ago there were young ladies
standing up and demanding to be placed in just that position, and
saying that that was their right to do so because they were accept-
ed into the Naval Academy, so it really is not all this laughable,
you know. I am glad to hear that is your opinion, Judge O'Connor.

  Yesterday in describing yourself as a judge, you said that two of
the characteristics that have stood you in good stead over the years
are a short memory and a tough skin.

  I see my time is up. I will be asking you something about the
Starr memorandum in the next session. I thank you very much,
Judge.

  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter.

                                           DEATH PENALTY

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge O'Connor, I compliment you on your tour de force of
yesterday. I think that indirectly you have answered a number of
questions, with respect to capability, by the preparation and legal
skill that you have demonstrated with your answers, and with
respect to your temperament, your good health, and stamina.
  Did you have occasion while in the Arizona Senate to vote on the
death penalty issue?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, yes, I did, I
think more than once.
  Senator SPECTER. HOW did you vote?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, after the
Furman v. Georgia case, which basically overturned a good many
State death penalty statutes for all practical purposes, Arizona
along with other States engaged in an effort to reexamine its
statutes and determine whether it was possible to draft a statute
which would be upheld by the Supreme Court in the wake of
Furman v. Georgia.

  I participated rather extensively in that effort, in a subcommttee
which actually put together the language that was ultimately
adopted in the State legislature for reenactment of the death pen-
alty in Arizona. I voted for that measure after it was drafted and
brought to the floor. I subsequently had occasion to, in effect, apply
it as a judge in the trial court in Arizona in some criminal cases.

  I had previously participated in a vote on another death penalty
bill that I recall that may have come about before the one in the
wake of Furman v. Georgia, and that was a proposal to enact some
mandatory penalties in certain situations. My recollection is that I
voted against that proposal.

  Senator SPECTER. Have you changed your views since you voted
in favor of the death penalty?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, I felt that it
was an appropriate vote then and I have not changed my view.
                                             129

                                          PRETRIAL BAIL

  Senator SPECTER. Judge O'Connor, have you had occasion to set
pretrial bail?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator, yes, I have; not often,
but I have.

  Senator SPECTER. In the setting of pretrial bail, did you consider
the dangerousness of the defendant or did you limit your considera-
tion to his likelihood of appearing at trial?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator, the circumstances in
which I was called upon to set bail all related to some murder
charges in which, under Arizona's statutory provision, the judge
also considers, if you will, the nature of the evidence against the
defendant and other factors in setting bail.

  I am aware of the current discussion that is going on at the
Federal level generally about whether dangerousness should be
considered as a factor, and indeed whether it can be under the
eighth amendment and the prohibition against excessive bail.

  Senator SPECTER. When you set the bail, did you consider the
issue of dangerousness to the community in your evaluation of the
bail?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator, only indirectly, I sup-
pose, because what I was considering was the fact that it was a
death case and the extent of the evidence which had been obtained.
Upon the strength of that, the bail was determined, so indirectly
dangerousness perhaps was a factor.

                                   PREVENTIVE DETENTION

   Senator SPECTER. Judge O'Connor, what are your philosophical
views about bail and preventive detention as that concept may
conflict with the presumption of innocence in criminal trials?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator, these matters are cer-
tainly presently being debated and considered here, I believe, as
well as in the courts. Unless I am mistaken, there is a case now
awaiting action at the U.S. Supreme Court on a petition for certio-
rari, possibly, from the District of Columbia area involving the
validity of the District of Columbia amended bail statute. There-
fore, I would be reluctant to indicate a particular view on the
validity of that but I would indicate to you my broad personal
concern as it reflects upon individual liberty.

   It seems to me that all of us come to the judicial system encum-
bered, if you will, by our previous known activities. If people have
been previously convicted of offenses and these convictions are
known, or if for example someone has been charged with an of-
fense and released on bail and then charged again with another
offense and these factors in the record are known, these things
perhaps--speaking purely as a matter of personal belief and not as
a reflection on the legal issues involved--possibly merit considera-
tion in the determination of bail.

                              FUNDING FOR JUVENILE CRIME

   Senator SPECTER. Judge O'Connor, with admittedly limited re-
sources available, what priority would you personally assign to
                                      130
funding for juvenile crime prevention as contrasted with other
aspects of the criminal justice system?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, I would assign
a high priority to that particular area. One reason I would do so is
because the great bulk of crime is committed by people who are
very young and it seems to me that we need to concentrate our
efforts on that particular age group. If there is something we can
do at an early age to discourage a criminal career, it is all-impor-
tant, because I think the public is very, very distressed with the
extent of crime in this country. Indeed, I regard it as one of the
most serious problems that we have in this Nation and I would like
to see effort devoted to prevention of crime at an early age.

                            LIKELIHOOD OF REHABILITATION

  Senator SPECTER. Does your experience in the criminal court
suggest to you that there is a better likelihood of rehabilitation
among juvenile offenders?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, yes. I think
the earlier you reach an offender, the first time something happens
if something effective can be done you have a better chance of
stopping a subsequent repetition of that offense.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge O'Connor, do you think that it is appro-
priate for Supreme Court Justices to be advocates for social reform,
as Chief Justice Burger has been for improvements in the correc-
tional and prison system?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, it does seem to
me that the Chief Justice has a significant role to play in express-
ing views on the administration of justice and on matters closely
related thereto. It seems to me that that is something that all of us
in this Nation can value and can benefit from.

  Senator SPECTER. DO you think it appropriate for Supreme Court
Justices to participate in other activities, as Chief Justice Warren
did on the Warren Commission, or Justice Roberts did on the Pearl
Harbor Commission, or Justice Jackson did at Nuremburg?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, that bothers
me somewhat. I just wonder how there is time to do anything like
that. As I view the work of the Court, I wonder that there is time
to eat much less engage in a lot of other outside activities.

                                   LIMITED JURISDICTION

  Senator SPECTER. Judge O'Connor, if the Congress can limit the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court on constitutional issues, as you
say ex parte McCardle suggests, how can the U.S. Supreme Court
maintain its role as the final arbiter of the Constitution?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, I do not think
that I have suggested that that line has been finely drawn by the
Court. It has not been reexamined, really, since ex parte McCardle,
and I did not mean to suggest or imply that that is a fixed, final
position because that issue is very likely to be addressed.

  However, I have also expressed yesterday my concerns that to
the extent that the Supreme Court lacks appellate jurisdiction to
resolve some area of the law, then we no longer would have a
capacity within the Federal judicial system to have that Court
                                         131

determine, indeed, what is the proper interpretation of a particular
provision, or the law in the area from which its jurisdiction has
been taken. This of course should be a concern to people in review-
ing proposals for deprivation of jurisdiction.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, in your testimony yesterday you left open
that aspect of an interpretation of ex parte McCardle. My question
to you is, how can the jurisdiction of the Court be limited on
constitutional issues, given the Court's responsibility under the
Constitution? Is there anything that is an open issue there to be
decided?

  I am not asking you for a preview on your judgment. I am asking
you, if there is any justiciable issue there? Is it not plain that the
Court must retain jurisdiction over constitutional issues and that
the Congress cannot possibly eliminate that jurisdiction if we are
to preserve the role of the U.S. Supreme Court on constitutional
issues?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, these
are the concerns that I have tried to express that I think have to
be considered, of course, in connection with any discussion of the
limitation of the Court's jurisdiction. My effort was simply to point
out that we really do not have much to look at after ex parte
McCardle, which was a case which did uphold, as you know, the
withdrawal of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court from considering
appeals in habeas corpus matters. That affected a pending appeal.
The Court simply upheld that particular exercise, and we have
very little since then.

   As I tried to explain, I think the constitutional scholars who
have written on this subject have come to different conclusions as
to the extent to which subject matter jurisdiction can be removed.

   Senator SPECTER. Judge O'Connor, is it not inevitable for the
Supreme Court to be influenced, at least to some extent, by consid-
erations of social policy when the Court interprets the U.S. Consti-
tution?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, in one sense
we are all the product certainly of our experiences. People assume
the role of judge encumbered, if you will, by the product of those
experiences. Judges do, I suppose, as has been pointed out, read
newspapers and listen to radio and watch television to some extent,
so all are influenced to some greater or lesser degree by those
experiences.

   However, the framework within which a given case is decided
should, in my view, be limited to the record and to the briefs and
the arguments, and should not really be resolved on the basis of
outside social concerns, if you will.

   Senator SPECTER. I thought the questioning and your responses
yesterday on Brown v. Board of Education, Plessy v. Ferguson, and
the exclusionary rule were very enlightening, so I took occasion
last evening to go back and reread Brown. I would disagree respect-
fully with your suggestion that the Court in Brown rested on a
more intensive look at the origin of the 14th amendment. Without
citing the direct language, I think the holding is very plain that
the Court was looking to the effect of segregation on public educa-
tion.
                                         132

  With respect to the exclusionary rule and what you described as
a judge-made rule, Mapp v. Ohio was based on constitutional
grounds and I think explicitly by the holding.

  When you consider the intervention of the Supreme Court in the
criminal field starting with Brown v. Mississippi and its prohibition
against forced confessions, which neither the legislature of Missis-
sippi or the Congress of the United States had addressed--I am just
wondering if under your interpretation of "strict construction" you
would not agree that there is an avenue and an opening where
even the most strict constructionists would look to social policy in
the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court in meeting issues to which
the Congress or State legislatures have not directed their atten-
tion?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, I simply would
acknowledge that to a degree that has occurred.

  Senator SPECTER. Don't you think it is proper--if you take a
strict constructionist like Justice Harlan in Brown v. Board of
Education, and we could give a lot of other examples--that howev-
er strict a constructionist may be, there is some latitude appropri-
ately to consider public policy or social policy in interpreting the
Constitution?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Specter, it is a factor in
the sense that it is properly brought before the Court, and I have
indicated to you that I think in the presentation of cases these
matters are brought very poignantly to the Court through the
briefs and through the arguments. To that extent, obviously, they
are considered in that sense but by an appropriate mechanism, I
suggest to you.

  The suggestion that the Court should look outside the record in
the presentation of the case in an effort to establish or consider
social concerns or values, is what I have indicated I think would be
improper in my view.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge O'Connor.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                                  PRAYER IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  We shall now begin the second round of questions.
  Judge O'Connor, I shall propound certain questions to you but I
want to make it clear that if you feel that any of these questions
would impinge upon your responsibilities as an Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court, then you say so after the question is asked and
before any answer is expected.
  Judge O'Connor, the first amendment forbids the establishment
of a State religion. The first amendment also prohibits interference
with the free exercise of religion. This second prohibition is often
overlooked. Please share with us your views on the free exercise
clause as it relates to, first, prayer in public schools.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, as you know the Court has had
occasion in several instances to consider the State action, if you
will, in connection with prayer in the public school system. The
Court has basically determined that it is a violation of the first
amendment, both the establishment and free exercise clause, to
                                         133

mandate a particular prayer, even though it is nondenominational
in character, for recitation by the pupils on a regular basis. The
Court has even so determined despite the fact that an individual
pupil may ask to be excused from that exercise.

  In succeeding cases the Court has also prohibited the required
Bible reading in the public schools as part of a regular program. I
do not think it has prohibited, however, reference or reading the
Bible in connection with other studies, for example, of history.

  These cases of the Court have been the subject of an enormous
amount of concern by the public generally. That concern, I think,
is reflected because of the many connections that we have as a
people with religion. I think this Senate opens every one of its
sessions with a prayer. Certainly every session of the Supreme
Court opens with a statement concerning the role of God in our
system. We have a motto in this country of "In God We Trust." We
refer to God in our pledge of allegiance.

  I think the religious precepts in which this country was founded
are very much interwoven, if you will, throughout our system.
That is why the resolution of these problems under the first
amendment has been very difficult.

  I think at the present time the Court has indeed restricted the
recitation of prayers in the public school system which in any
sense are part of the public school program, despite the free exer-
cise clause. This has given rise, of course, to different constitutional
amendment proposals on occasion that have been considered in
this Congress. At the present time the Court rulings continue to
stand.

                                   CHARITABLE EXEMPTION

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW would you share with us your views on the
free exercise clause as it relates to the use of the Federal taxing
power to pressure religious schools.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, I believe that what you are
referring to probably is the action by the Internal Revenue Service
to withdraw the charitable exemption status under section 501(c) of
the Internal Revenue Code to a particular school or schools, based
on alleged policies of admission of pupils to those schools. At least I
understand that there have been some such instances.

   Speaking very generally only, the Internal Revenue Service
policy in this regard has been said, I believe, to raise questions in
the area of the extent to which the Internal Revenue Service
should be a revenue-collecting agency as opposed to an agency
concerned with public policy issues; and secondarily issues concern-
ing the extent to which the Internal Revenue Code authorizes IRS
to effectuate those policies.

   Now I believe that there are at least two cases in which petitions
for a writ of certiorari raising these issues are presently pending
before the Court, and I would anticipate that action would be
forthcoming with regard to those petitions, Mr. Chairman.

      FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT EXTEND TO OBSCENE MATERIAL

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, the Supreme Court has consist-
ently held that obscene material is not protected by the first
                                      134

amendment. What are your views on the application of the first
amendment in the area of pornography?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, generally speaking, I think the
law is established by virtue of the cases that have been handed
down in this area, that the first amendment right of free speech
does not extend to obscene material. The problem has been, of
course, in the definition of what is obscene.

  It would be very tempting to quote from Justice Potter Stewart
on that subject, but I will refrain and mention only that I think
the most recent determination of the court on what is obscene is
found in Miller v. California, in which the Court laid down basical-
ly three tests to consider in determining what is obscene.

  That includes, I believe, an examination as to whether the aver-
age person applying contemporary community standards would
find the subject obscene or appealing to the purient interest; and,
second, whether the act in question or material in question depicts
patently offensive sexual conduct as specifically defined by State
law; and then, finally, an examination as to whether the material
has any underlying literary or scientific or other value. Having
applied those tests, if it is determined then that the material is
obscene, the Court has held that its distribution or sale can be
restricted.

  I, in the legislature, had occasion to attempt in various years to
prepare and consider legislation in Arizona which would be in
compliance with the Supreme Court's holdings on obscenity, and
believed that as a matter of public policy the distribution of materi-
al which in fact is obscene is undesirable, and particularly with
respect to distribution to minors.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, in response to an earlier ques-
tion from Senator Hatch you emphasized, and I believe correctly,
the importance of seeking the intent of the original framers when
faced with the need to interpret a provision of the Constitution.
The Supreme Court is also called upon to construe specific statutes.

  What is your approach in construing specific statutes? Would
you feel constrained by the language of the statute and the legisla-
tive history or would you feel empowered to imply or create a
consensus that might not have existed in the legislative branch?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me important in
construing statutes that the Court look at the specific legislative
enactment itself, the language used, and any legislative history
which is available in connection with it, as aids in the proper
interpretation. These are crucial factors.

  The difficulty arises, I suppose, when the legislative history does
not cover the particular question and where the language is some-
how confused or conflicts with some other statutory provision
which has been enacted. In those instances I think the Court
simply has to rely on traditional means of interpreting statutes.

                               RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, as you know the second amend-
ment to the Constitution states that "A well-regulated militia being
necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to
keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." In light of that consti-
                                         135

tutional prohibition, to what extent if any do you feel that Con-
gress could curtail the right of the people to keep and bear weap-
ons that are of value in common defense?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, this question is one that has
not been addressed very often in the courts. I think I recall only
one instance, and that was in United States v. Miller, which was a
very long time ago in the 1930's. The Court had to consider the
National Firearms Act of 1934, which was an enactment of Con-
gress, and it restricted as I recall the carrying of certain types of
guns in interstate commerce. The Court upheld that enactment
and said that the second amendment did not guarantee the right to
people to have any certain type of weapon or arms.

   I do not know that we have anything that has been handed down
since then by way of Supreme Court interpretation. Certainly, as
far as I am able to determine, most cases in the lower courts have
applied the second amendment as being a prohibition against Con-
gress in interfering with the maintenance of a State militia, which
appeared to be the thrust of the language in the amendment.

   Certainly the various States have considered a variety of statutes
concerning the possession and use of weapons in connection with
their police power which is reserved to the States. Typical exam-
ples of those are laws which, for instance, prohibit the carrying of
concealed weapons or laws which impose additional penalties for
crimes committed with the use of a gun. That kind of legislation is
rather frequent.

   The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, should the opinions of any one
court of appeals be given any greater precedential value than those
of the other Federal circuits? Would you prefer a continued empha-
sis on concentrating venue for certain subjects in one particular
circuit, for example, administrative law questions in the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, or do you feel that diversity
of thought would be beneficial?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, I suppose in reality we give
more credence to the opinions of those judges whom we respect and
admire, and perhaps that is how we view them rather than giving
more credence to the opinions from one particular circuit than
another. I am sure that the court of appeals serving the District of
Columbia inherently gets many more administrative law questions
than other districts, by virtue of the fact that we have so many
Federal administrative agencies located here, and that has resulted
in a concentration.

   However, generally speaking, I would think that the opinions of
all the appellate circuits at the Federal level are entitled considera-
tion and very weighty consideration.

          INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION BY STATE COURTS

   The CHAIRMAN. Judge O'Connor, as a State court judge did you
ever feel that the Federal judiciary considered its ability to inter-
pret the Constitution to be superior to that of judges in State
courts? Do you believe that State courts can be depended upon to
interpret the Constitution as correctly as Federal courts?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, that depends of course on the
capacity of the individual State court but, speaking very broadly
                                      136

only, it seems to me that we do have in this Nation many very fine
State courts and that we would do well to allow those State courts
to function as indeed I think they are intended to function in
considering a wide range of issues, including those of Federal con-
stitutional principles as those cases arise. It is my belief that our
State courts can serve us well in that regard, and I have confidence
for the most part in their capacity to handle these very complex
issues.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  The distinguished Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden.
  Senator BIDEN. Thank you very much.
  To follow up on the question of the chairman about State courts,
and the article you wrote in the William & Mary Law Review,
Judge, isn't it true that historically the State courts have not done
too well with regard to interpreting the Federal Constitution? The
rationale for why the Supreme Court is better able to interpret the
Constitution relates to the independence of that body, lifetime
tenures, and the fact that many State courts are elected bodies and
subject to political pressures. As for familiarity with the material,
the fact of the matter is most State court judges do not regularly
resolve constitutional questions, whereas the Federal judges do.
  One of the things I would like to ask you is, do you truly believe
that on balance the Federal judiciary is not more qualified than
the State judiciary to interpret the Constitution of the United
States of America?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Biden, we obviously in kur system
have adopted the notion that we do need a Federal court system
and we do need a U.S. Supreme Court to be the final determiner of
these issues. I do not quarrel with that. I think it is a wonderful
system but what I have tried to point out is that we have a dual
system of courts in our country.
  We have State court systems that also deal day-in and day-out
with these constitutional issues. Indeed, the vast bulk of all crimi-
nal cases are tried in the State courts, not the Federal courts, and
there is not a trial in a criminal case in a State court that does not
raise certain Federal constitutional issues with which those courts
have to deal. State courts are in fact dealing day-in and day-out
with Federal constitutional issues and it is my belief that they are
well-equipped to do this, and that we should not assume that
because their manner of selection may differ or their length of
tenure may differ, that they are less independent. I have seen some
really remarkable examples of courage among State court judges in
dealing with issues.

                                          LIFE TENURE

  Senator BIDEN. I do not dispute that but if that is true--I do not
dispute that there are remarkable examples, but if that is true
then the need for life tenure on the Supreme Court becomes much
less significant. Some of my colleagues right here in the Senate
suggest that there should not be life tenure. Some suggest that
there should be mandatory retirement. I even heard it suggested
there should be election.

  Therefore, if in fact that is true, Judge, you are undercutting the
argument that in fact life tenure is essential to the independence
                                         137

of the Supreme Court. There must, by definition, be some differ-
ence at least in degree.

  I go back to the point again--I do not want to belabor this--but
the reason the Federal courts got into this business in the first
place is that the State courts did not--I emphasize, did not--
interpret the Constitution in a way that the Federal courts felt
proper.

  They got into the business because citizens in the South and
citizens in my State decided that they were going to keep some
citizens in different positions than other citizens. They got into the
business because they thought that they had to protect individual
rights of citizens in certain States that the State courts obviously,
on their face, refused to protect.

  That is why they got into the business, and I just get sick and
tired, quite frankly, of all this talk. Everything that has to do with
the Federal branch of Government, whether it is the Federal
courts or the Congress or anything Federal is bad, and States are
good. I remind you and I remind my colleagues and I remind the
audience that the reason the Federal Government got into 90 per-
cent of the business it got into is that the State courts did not do
the job.

   I do not want to debate it with you. You are welcome to respond
if you would like but I just think it is malarky to talk about how
State courts historically are so competent and State court judges
are equally competent on balance as Federal court judges. If that is
the case, then we should change the Federal system and make it
much easier.

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator, I have not suggested
that there is not a need for the Federal courts, and I am sure you
recognize that. That has not been suggested.

   Senator BIDEN. NO; I am not saying that, but do you think there
is a need for life tenure? Is there a need for life tenure for Su-
preme Court Justices?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Life tenure, of course, is provided in the Consti-
tution and to change that would require a constitutional amend-
ment.

   Senator BIDEN. I know that. Is there a need for that? Let me ask
you a direct question: Do you think there is a need for that? I know
it is in it. Do you think there is a need for it?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Biden, it seems to me
that judges can function independently under alternate systems of
tenure.

   Senator BIDEN. I agree.
   Judge O'CONNOR. I do not believe that it is essential to the
integrity or function of a given judge that that judge have life
tenure.
   Senator BIDEN. I see.
   Judge O'CONNOR. That is quite a different question from saying,
should we with the U.S. Supreme Court amend the Constitution so
that we do not have it? I think it has served us perhaps reasonably
well through the years, and those are different questions, but I do
truly believe that it is possible for judges to function independently
and well under alternate systems.
                                         138

  Senator BIDEN. I agree that that is the case. We have examples
of it. I also agree that there are a number of public officials who
are destined to be in the second edition of Profiles in Courage. I
believe that there are brilliant women and men in every field, but I
would suggest that the Founding Fathers were pretty smart. They
perceived the vulnerabilities that exist in human nature and the
exigencies of the times and what pressures they bring on people,
and decided that it was not worth the chance to count on excep-
tional courage.

  Let me go to one other point, to follow up on what Senator
Specter said. Judge, I am going to vote for you. I think you will
make a very good judge but I am a little disturbed about the
reluctance to answer any questions. [Laughter.]

  I am not being facetious. I mean that sincerely.
  Let me read you from the Brown case. In the Brown case it says:
"In approaching this problem"--the problem referred to is whether
or not "separate but equal" is an appropriate doctrine--"we cannot
turn back the clock to 1868 when the amendment was adopted, or
even to 1896 when Plessy v. Ferguson was written. We must consid-
er public education in light of its full development and its present
place in American life throughout the Nation. Only in this way can
it be determined if segregation of public schools deprives these
plaintiffs of equal protection of the law."
  I see nothing in the decision, there is no place in the decision
where the Court said anything other than, straight up, "We are not
reexamining the 14th amendment, we are not reconsidering it; we
are saying that social changes, social policy, and social mores in
America have changed to now make it reprehensible to allow any
school board, any State, any jurisdiction, to say black folks cannot
go to school with white folks for whatever the reason."
  That was a fundamental change in the social mores of this
country. The Court made no pretense about on what basis they
were making it. They did. not go back and say the 14th amendment
was misinterpreted. They flat out said, "We are reflecting the
change in social policy."
  I know you know that, and I know it is difficult for you to
respond to that because as soon as you respond to me you are going
to have 14 other men jumping on you to say something else, so I
will not even ask you to answer it, but I hope you know that I
know you know. [Laughter.]

                                        DISQUALIFICATION

  However, I will ask you some specific questions that will not get
you in trouble but have to be asked in my capacity as the ranking
member. I guess these are the very dull questions that nevertheless
should be on the record. They relate to the questions of recusal or
disqualification. With all due respect, they relate to your distin-
guished husband.

  Title 28, United States Code, section 455, requires disqualification
of a judge when their spouse

  (1) has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or any other
interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of a proceeding, or
                                             139

  (2) is a party to a proceeding or an officer, director, or trustee of a party, is acting
as a lawyer in a proceeding, is known by the judge to have an interest that could be
substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.

  Now your spouse is a distinguished partner in a law firm in
Phoenix, Ariz., and by virtue of the community property laws of
Arizona, you have an undivided one-half interest in that partner-
ship, as we understand it. What standards will you use to deter-
mine when to disqualify yourself? Will you make an effort to
determine what cases your spouse has worked on in the past? Will
you keep yourself aware of the names of clients that your spouse
has represented in the past? Will you determine when deciding an
issue in the future whether your spouse has any connection with
the parties in that case?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Biden, yes. These are
very serious matters and of great concern to anyone serving on the
bench. It is a concern when the judge is married to an attorney
that the judge be informed about the clients that the spouse is
representing, and indeed the clients that the firm is representing,
and to exercise great care in avoiding participating in any case in
which it might be said that there was some relationship there.

  Senator BIDEN. I have no doubt you will do that, Judge, but give
us an idea mechanically of how you plan on being kept apprised of
what cases your distinguished husband's law firm is involved in. I
mean, mechanically how does that happen? I know that is clearly
your intent; I have no doubt about your integrity but, mechanical-
ly, how do you do that?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, at the Federal level as I understand it
and in the Supreme Court, the parties are required, for instance, in
the case of a corporation to reflect and list for the benefit of the
Judges of the Court all of the subsidiaries and related companies
involved, so that you do have an opportunity to know in fact what
the links are with that party. Then it becomes necessary for you to
determine whether that is on any list of clients that the office has,
and of course they maintain such lists, so that is fairly easily done
in a mechanical sense.

  In addition, if the law firm in any capacity had been connected
with the case, that would appear in the record someplace in the
case below. I mean, they would have appeared as parties; they
would show up on the pleadings. You know who has been repre-
senting them, so you have the further question, then--assuming
that neither the spouse nor the law firm had any connection what-
ever with the case--if it related to a client, an occasional client or
even a frequent client of the firm but in this instance the client
was dealing with a matter that arose in another State and with
another law firm. Then you have to determine whether that con-
nection is such that a disqualification is necessary.

  Senator BIDEN. I appreciate your taking the time to go into that.
I think it is important that it be on the record, and for the public
who are watching this hearing and for those who have a more
cynical view of our system, our Congress, our courts, that there is a
mechanism, that you are aware of the mechanism, that you have
every intention of maintaining in a very scrupulous fashion adher-
ence to that mechanism. That is why I bothered to ask the ques-
tion.

                                         140

   My time is running out, but let me ask you one other question, if
I may, about the appropriateness to be involved in promotion of
social issues. Would it be, in your opinion, inappropriate for you as
the first and only woman at this point on the Supreme Court--if
you are confirmed, as I believe you will and should be--to for
example be involved in national efforts to promote the ERA?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Biden; I believe that it
would be inappropriate.

   Senator BIDEN. Why would it be inappropriate for you to do that
while it is appropriate for Justice Burger to be traveling around
the country telling us and everyone else what State and Federal
jurisictions should do about prison construction and what attorneys
should do about law schools and how they should be maintained,
and whether or not we should have barristers and solicitors. I
mean, what is the distinction? Is it a personal one or is there a real
one?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman
   Senator BIDEN. I do not suggest he should not do that; I want to
know what your distinction is. [Laughter.]
  Judge O'CONNOR. It seems to me that it is appropriate for judges
to be concerned and, indeed, to express themselves in matters
relating to the administration of justice in the courts, and as to
matters which would improve that administration of justice in
some fashion. Certainly the court system is very heavily involved
in the criminal justice system.
  Senator BIDEN. However, doesn't he also speak not just about
administration of justice? Hasn't he spoken--correct me if I am
wrong--but hasn't he spoken about procedural changes in the law,
not just for the administration of justice, in the broad sense of
whether there are prisons or whether there are backlogs in the
courts, but actually what should be the law relating to criminal
matters and other matters? I mean, he has gone beyond and sug-
gested legislation.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Biden, yes, I think that
the canons of judicial ethics do say that a judge may engage in
activities to improve the law and the legal system and the adminis-
tration of justice. I am sure that those statements which have been
made are made in

  Senator BIDEN. I just do not want you to wall yourself off, Judge.
You are a tremendous asset. You are a woman and the first one on
the Court; don't let these folks, me included, run you out of being
that. You are a woman; you do stand for something that this
country needs very badly. We need spokespersons in positions of
high authority. Don't lock yourself in, in this hearing or any other
hearing, to do things that you are not proscribed from doing in the
canons of ethics.

  It is your right, if it were your desire, to go out and campaign
very strongly for the ERA. It is your right to go out and make
speeches across the country about inequality for women, if you
believed it. Don't wall yourself off. Your male brethren have not
done it. Don't you do it.

  You are a singular asset, and you are looked at by many of us
not merely because you are a bright, competent lawyer but also
because you are a woman. That is something that should be adver-
                                         141

tised by you. You have an obligation, it seems to me, to women in
this country to speak out on those issues that you are allowed to
under the canons of ethics. Don't let us intimidate you into not
doing it.

  [Applause.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I will warn the audience there will be no clap-
ping, and the police will remove anyone who attempts it again.
  Senator BIDEN. Will they remove the person who causes it, Mr.
Chairman? [Laughter.]
  I apologize. My time is up.
  The CHAIRMAN. I wish to tell the police to remove anyone who
attempts to express himself in such a manner, if it occurs again.
  The distinguished Senator from Maryland, Senator Mathias.

                                TV IN THE SUPREME COURT

  Senator MATHIAS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  These last few moments, Judge O'Connor, have been recorded on
television and transmitted to the world. In fact, not only these last
few moments but these last 2 days we have all been basking in the
bright lights that are required for television.
  I am wondering what your attitude is towards the introduction of
television cameras into the courtroom of the Supreme Court. Jus-
tice Potter Stewart recently said that--

  Our courtroom is an open courtroom. The public and the press are there routine-
ly. Since today TV is a part of the press, I have a hard time seeing why it should
not be there too. As I understand the present technology, disruption is hardly a
threat anymore, and I think it is difficult to make an argument to keep TV out
when you allow everyone else in.

  Of course, that is the conclusion that our chairman has made
about this meeting, and I am wondering how you feel about TV in
the Supreme Court.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Mathias, I would cer-
tainly want to wait until I had served on the Court, and discussed
the situation with others and been privy to the concerns that
others may have on the subject before I would formulate a position
on it.

   However, let me tell you that at least in Arizona we have been
allowing cameras in the appellate courtrooms, television cameras,
and I have participated as an appellate court judge in court with
television cameras present. The experience has been reasonably
satisfactory, I would say, as far as I am concerned. I have not yet
participated in or did not participate in a trial in which television
cameras were permitted in the courtroom.

   It has been my thought that, as the technology improves and as
it is possible to have that recorded without the necessity for the
bright lights and with cameras which are not readily apparent, and
without noise and interruptions, that it is conceivable to me that
the technology will be such that we will conclude that it is less
disruptive than perhaps originally might have been the case.
Therefore, I would anticipate that we have not seen the last of the
development in this area because, as you have correctly noted,
television has become an important means of communication for
people generally.
                                         142

  Senator MATHIAS. I think that is right. Through television, you
have become known to millions of Americans. The disruptive
aspect which might be complained about in a trial is unlikely to be
a problem in the Supreme Court.

  Let me move on now to another subject which is routinely con-
sidered by this committee when we have nominees for the courts or
nominees for the Office of Attorney General before us, and that is
the question of private clubs that discriminate on the basis of race,
religion, sex, or national origin. Do you believe that it is appropri-
ate for Federal judges to belong to organizations of this kind?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Mathias, the judicial
conference has been considering this precise question, and in gener-
al has espoused the view that it is not desirable for Federal judges
to belong to clubs which discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or
national origin. It is suggested that in each instance that will be
left to the individual conscience of the judge, at least that is the
present status of it.

  I do not disagree with it in general as it is applied to professional
associations, certainly, or to clubs which discriminate on the basis
of race. I, myself, belong to several women's clubs and they are
service clubs, if you will, organizations that have devoted them-
selves to bettering the community. They do not discriminate on the
basis of race or national origin but have no male members. I cite
specifically the Soroptimist Club of Phoenix and the Charter 100,
and the Junior League of Phoenix of which I am now a sustaining,
not an active, member. It is not my feeling that those memberships
should necessarily be dropped because of going on the Federal
bench.

                                       FIRST AMENDMENT

  Senator MATHIAS. Let me turn to the first amendment. Chief
Justice Burger has written that "a responsible press is an undoubt-
edly desirable goal but that press responsibility is not mandated by
the Constitution and like many other virtues, it cannot be legislat-
ed." Would you feel in general harmony with those views of the
Chief Justice?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Mathias, I am not sure
that I know the total thrust of that language or those comments.
Would you care to expand and explain to me?

  Senator MATHIAS. Well, I think generally it is whether or not
you feel the first amendment is a comprehensive guarantee of
freedom of expression; whether or not efforts to limit the first
amendment in various ways, adopting the Chief Justice's words, to
make the press more responsible, are in fact proper and constitu-
tional.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, the first amendment right of
free speech, Senator Mathias, is a crucial right. It is a right which
in this country has been recognized by the Court as having some
precedence over many other rights that are also important. Cases
examining statutory restrictions on the right of free speech have
applied very strict standards, and appropriately so, very appropri-
ately so.
                                      143

  The restrictions or exceptions have been rather limited in
nature. They relate generally, as we know, to matters which are
obscene; in the area of commercial speech to fraudulent speech or
misleading speech; and in the case of other speech to speech which
is basically to incite a riot or other criminal action. Beyond that,
very few limitations have been upheld, and appropriately so, in my
view.

  Senator MATHIAS. Would you go as far, do you think, as the late
Justice Black, who said that you had to take the first amendment
right at face value: that when it said that "Congress shall make no
law respecting the limitation of freedom of speech," that it meant
just that?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Mathias, I suppose not
in the sense that I accept and recognize the exceptions that have
already been placed, as I have mentioned.

                 BALANCE BETWEEN FREE PRESS AND FAIR TRIAL

  Senator MATHIAS. What about the place where the first amend-
ment collides with other guarantees, let's say, the guarantee of a
fair trial or the right of privacy? Where would you make the
balance between a free press and a fair trial?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Mathias, these are very
difficult issues and, of course, the Court has been addressing them
in connection with criminal trials. In the Gannet case, of course,
the Court held that it is at least possible and that it would draw
the balance in that case in favor of upholding the ability of a trial
court, under appropriate circumstances, to close a pretrial hearing.

  In a subsequent case, however, arising out of Virginia, the Court
said that the trial itself will generally be open to the public and
the press despite the defendant's wish to perhaps have it closed,
except in certain circumstances which the Court did not define. It
did not absolutely rule out the possibility that in a particular case
that a defendant's right to fair trial would not take precedence, but
it did not enlighten us as to the circumstances when that would
occur.

  I have found in my own experience that the conduct of the
business of the courts is public business. On no occasion did I close
the doors to my courtroom to the media. We conducted all of the
business which I had, at least, in public. I felt that that worked
well.

  There are other things that a court can do to protect a defend-
ant's rights in a given situation, such as sequestering the jury if
that is necessary. It is also possible to change the venue of the trial
if the media attention is so great that no fair trial can be obtained,
so I think there are ways of dealing with the situation that give
some flexibility to the court in an individual situation.

  Senator MATHIAS. Therefore, you think--as I hear you answer-
ing--that the balance should be wherever possible in favor of the
free press, the first amendment question?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Mathias, I do not want
to be drawing any lines that are going to prove troublesome in
connection with a given case, but I do feel that the conduct of trials
in public is appropriate and that it is hard for me to visualize
                                         144

circumstances that would make it absolutely necessary to close the
doors, although it is conceivable that there are such. There are
other avenues open for a judge to employ.

  Senator MATHIAS. Well, to go back to the question we discussed
earlier kf electronic coverage of a trial, suppose it would be deter-
mined in a given case that television coverage was going to be
disruptive for some reason. Would you then consider that, let's say,
radio coverage which does not require lights, does not require
cameras, might be an appropriate way in which to provide for a
full public access to the information that was available?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Mathias, that would
not be offensive to me personally, had I been a trial court judge. I
would want, of course, to comply with the canons of judicial ethics
applicable in my State, and would be very concerned about doing
that. As you know, not all States have made it possible for courts
to be recorded either on the radio or by television; in fact, very few
have.

                               DOCTRINE OF PRIOR RESTRAINT

  Senator MATHIAS. Of course, here in the Senate we have on some
occasions, notably the Panama Canal Treaty debate, used radio as
an alternative for television as a means of informing the public of
precisely what is happening here.

  Now one recurring issue with respect to the first amendment is
the applicability of the doctrine of prior restraint. We had a nota-
ble case recently, the Progressive Magazine case, in which they had
published a diagram of how to build your own atom bomb. What
are your views on the doctrine of prior restraint, and particularly
when it is raised with a plea of national security?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Mathias, again the
balancing test is sometimes extremely difficult to employ. Under
the first amendment, it would appear that the line will be drawn
in favor of no prior restraint unless the Government bears and
meets its extremely heavy burden to establish that indeed there is
an actual danger affecting the national security which is very real
and very present, before any prior restraint would be authorized.

  It seems to me that that is an appropriate way to approach the
issue. It is not an easy burden for the State--or the Federal Gov-
ernment in that case--to bear and, indeed, they usually lose but it
should at least be possible for the Federal Goverment, it seems to
me, to present an appropriate case that would truly affect national
security.

  Senator MATHIAS. Therefore, you would describe the burden not
merely as heavy but as extremely heavy, before they can success-
fully argue for prior restraint.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, Mr. Chairman, Senator Mathias, I would
hope I would not be held to that in writing an opinion but it is
somewhere in that range. It is a very great burden which the
Government has in order to justify a prior restraint.

  Senator MATHIAS. Personally, I would think the burden would be
an extremely heavy one.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts,
Mr. Kennedy.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair-
man.

  To follow along on the issue which Senator Mathias has raised
but to approach it in a somewhat different manner--and that is
the claim of national security and how you balance the national
security interest versus the first amendment--I think at the time
when I was going to law school a number of years ago, the general
rulings at that time were that whenever the Executive claimed
national security, a very heavy deference was given to the Chief
Executive or to the Office of the President.

  We have seen and recent history has taught us the need to
scrutinize the claims of the executive branch with great care before
contemplating the inhibition on free speech, free association, free
press, and the right of dissent. These cases which involved the
Pentagon papers, the Elsberg break-in, I think reflect that as really
a different view or a different role by the Court in reviewing the
claims of national security.

   I was interested in hearing your own attitude, how you as an
individual view the role: whether you view the role as an umpire
in our Federal system, weighing the competing first amendment
and national security claims. Are you going to give the complete,
basic, and overwhelming presumption to those who make the
claim? Are you going to examine in some detail the background for
such claim? How will you approach this general issue?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy, I think I
would not approach it by the application of presumptions but,
rather, that it would be appropriate to know the basis upon which
the claim is made as fully as possible.

   Senator KENNEDY. Therefore, as I understand your answer,
rather than just deferring to those that claim it, you would assume
an active role in examining the underlying assumptions for such a
claim.

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy, yes, it would
seem to me to be the appropriate role of the Court.

   Senator KENNEDY. In another area that was raised by some of
our colleagues on the issue of crime and law enforcement, and your
responses to another Senator's inquiry about the doctrine of stare
decisis, I wonder as you view the development of criminal law
rulings that have been made over the last 20 years, whether you
will follow the doctrine of stare decisis for the holdings of the
Supreme Court in some of these important areas of preserving the
individual rights of the defendant.

   Will you follow that doctrine of stare decisis as closely as you
may in some of the other areas? Whatever our definition of judicial
activism will be, or how it has been established over the course of
these hearings, is it your basic feeling that you will follow those
criminal law holdings of the Court in the past as precisely as you
might in other areas of policy?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy, I would
expect to apply my view of the rule of precedent evenhandedly,
without respect to the area of the law to which we are referring.

                                        MIRANDA RULE

  Senator KENNEDY. AS a judge, and in your experience as a judge,
how much impact has the exclusionary rule and the Miranda rule
on confessions actually had on prosecutions that you have dealt
with?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy, I want to
distinguish the two because I had different experiences concerning
them.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I would be interested in both.
  Judge O'CONNOR. I had many criminal felony trials on the trial
court bench, many. That is all I did, all day long, for 2 years, and
had others throughout the remainder of my time on the bench.
  The Miranda rule was one which frankly those in Arizona did
not greet with a lot of enthusiasm. It came from Arizona; it was an
Arizona case and, of course, those in Arizona thought they had
done the right thing, so it required a period of adjustment.
  It requires the recitation of some rights which frankly can
become rather mechanical in its recitation, and as applied to those
criminals who have had extensive experience with the law, I think
some of those defendants could recite the rights more easily than
the peace officers assigned to do the task. However, for some it has
had meaning, for some who are not experienced in the criminal
law, being advised of their rights has had a substantive effect and a
meaning.
  My experience on a trial court is that the application of Miranda
has not resulted in an inability of the police to still be reasonably
successful in their efforts to gain information and obtain state-
ments. It has, no doubt, precluded some but on a broad, general
basis I cannot say that I think the police have been unable to cope
with it.
  We have had to have Miranda hearings in advance of every trial
to determine to what extent these statements must be excluded,
and it was seldom that we had to exclude the statements. People
continued to make statements despite the fact that they had been
warned of the consequences, in large measure. Therefore, I cannot
say that I think the application of Miranda has simply tied the
hands to the extent that police work is ineffective.

                                    EXCLUSIONARY RULE

  Senator KENNEDY. HOW about in the exclusionary rule? How
many times did that come up, say, in the time of your 2 years?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Many, many times. Almost always in a drug
case.

  Senator KENNEDY. I see. How many times did that really affect
the outcome, either in an acquittal or a reversal?

  Judge O'CONNOR. A number of times. I think the exclusionary
rule, from my simple observation as a trial court judge, has proven
to be much more difficult in terms of the administration of justice.
There are times when perfectly relevant evidence and, indeed,
sometimes the only evidence in the case has been excluded by
application of a rule which, if different standards were applied
maybe would not have been applied in that situation, for instance,
to good faith conduct on the part of the police.
                                         147

  I am not suggesting, and do not want to be interpreted as sug-
gesting that I think it is inappropriate where force or trickery or
some other reprehensible conduct has been used but I have seen
examples of the application of the rule which I thought were
unfortunate, on the trial court.

  Senator KENNEDY. DO you think that either rule has had much
of an impact on the rate of crime, for example, in Arizona?

  Judge O'CONNOR. That is a very speculative sort of a thing for
me to respond to. I would not think that the Miranda rule has
actually affected the crime rate. Conceivably, the exclusionary rule
has had some effect in some areas of the crime rate, possibly in the
drug enforcement.

  Senator KENNEDY. In an entirely different area, the Court has
had increasing involvement in complex claims involving Native
Americans, redress, broken treaties, and these have involved large
tracts of lands and large sums sought for compensation. Your
record shows an awareness of a special obligation to Native Ameri-
cans. Could you give us some idea, in general, as a westerner, how
you would approach these issues in order to try and deal with a
sense of justice and equity to the Native Americans and still bal-
ance the legitimate claims of others, without unduly disrupting the
lives and the economy of the rest of a State's citizens who are
perhaps completely innocent bystanders?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy, Arizona is
fortunate in having approximately 14 Indian tribes and a great
deal of reservation land in the State. I think it adds to the cultural
diversity of Arizona and the interests that we enjoy.

   It also has given rise to some litigation, as you have mentioned,
in a variety of contexts and it has given rise to some disputes on
the legislative level concerning the appropriate boundaries for rep-
resentative bodies. As you know, on the reservation Indians are not
subject to State taxation, and I would say that much of the litiga-
tion which I have seen arises out of the framework of the taxabili-
tiy of certain transactions which occur on the reservation, transac-
tions involving non-Indians and Indians, or non-Indians but on the
reservation, and so forth.

  These matters have developed over the years a body of law
dealing particularly with these relations, and the Indian tribes
enjoy certainly a special status and special exemptions in the area
of taxation and other State regulation.

   Senator KENNEDY. I was thinking not only of taxation but water
rights. Even in my part of the country, because of the failure of the
Congress to pass enabling legislation, there still are some very
serious questions about land distribution and the real title to var-
ious land.

   I was just interested in your own concern about the fairness and
equity to Native Americans, and how you balance some very
solemn obligation responsibilities that we have with the rapid de-
velopment in some parts of the country among agricultural inter-
ests and other types of interests. How you are going to approach
these matters. Clearly you have had a strong interest in these
issues in the past. I think for many Native Americans they would
be interested in the concern that you will bring to the Court about
their interests.
                                      148
  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, Mr. Chairman, Senator Kennedy, I view
with interest and concern the problems of the Native Americans,
as I do every other discreet group which has suffered from disad-
vantages. I would approach each particular case involving a ques-
tion of taxation or water rights or land ownership as I would any
other case for any other citizen, I would hope, very evenhandedly. I
would try to deal with it in as fair a manner as I know how. I am
aware of the background and the heritage and the problems, and I
would try to resolve the cases on the basis of the facts of the case
and the law applicable to that particular situation.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr.
Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge O'Connor, I have to apologize to you because I have to
conduct my own committee this afternoon, so I will not be able to
sit in and listen to your responses, but I have satisfied myself from
our almost an hour discussion and other discussions subsequent to
that, that you are an excellent choice for the U.S. Supreme Court
and a long overdue one at that.
  However, I do have some questions I think are important to put
on the record, and I would like to just take a few minutes of your
time and ask them here today.
  In a number of decisions over the years, the Court has held that
the 14th and 15th amendments require proof of intent or purpose
prior to a finding of a constitutional violation. Given that this is
the standard, and given that Congress chooses to use either of
these amendments as the basis for a statutory measure, would you
believe that the Congress might constitutionally adopt some lesser
standard for identifying violations?
  I might add, putting policy aside, do you believe that the Con-
gress would have to have constitutional authority to do this?

                                   AFFIRMATIVE ACTION

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Hatch, I am not sure I quite under-
stand yet the thrust of the question. Now this is in connection with
affirmative action?

  Senator HATCH. Yes; it would be affirmative action, and let's use
that as a perfect illustration. I will give you an illustration: In
recent years, some in the civil rights community and in the Justice
Department have developed a test for determining the existence of
discrimination that looks to the effects or disparate impact of an
otherwise neutral action, rather than to whether there is some
discriminatory intent or purpose or motivation, in other words,
some wrongful state of mind.

  Now considering that, and considering that the Court has held in
a number of cases that the standard of proof generally requires
some degree of intent or purpose, even circumstantially, do you
believe that Congress could adopt a lesser standard than some
proof of intent in these cases, and do you think that the Congress
might constitutionally adopt some lesser standard in order to re-
solve some of these problems or identify violations?
                                         149

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, this whole area
of affirmative action is one that has given rise, of course, to some
fairly recent litigation touching upon both congressional enact-
ments and State statutory enactments and policies.

  In general, it appears to me that what the. Supreme Court has
done is to say that the enforcement clauses of the 14th and the
15th amendments, giving Congress the power to enforce those
amendments by appropriate legislation, has been to acknowledge a
power of Congress that goes beyond, if you will, the direct applica-
tion of those amendments on their face.

  In other words, if the 14th amendment or the 15th amendment
on its face would have been held by the Court, as it has been, to
require proof of discriminatory purpose, or intent, on the other
hand the Court has said that Congress can apparently go beyond
that in its enactments, to a degree.

  I think the area of the law is still undeveloped in some respects
but we are seeing several examples, at least, in court decisions that
have been handed down where the power of Congress under the
enforcement sections has extended beyond the bare applicability of
the statutes. I would assume that Congress in its wisdom would be
considering, as I know you are, the appropriate statutory resolution
of these matters. I am sure that we will continue to see additional
litigation.

                                   DISCRIMINATORY INTENT

   Senator HATCH. Let me put it another way: There seems to be a
fundamental distinction between men and women of good will on
the issue of identifying what constitutes "discrimination." To some,
the act of discrimination requires some mental element, some dem-
onstration of a mind purpose, or a motive. To others, statistical
imbalance is enough to show racial or ethnic discrimination with-
out any proof of intent whatsoever, even by circumstantial evi-
dence or otherwise.

   Do you have any views on this matter personally? In other
words, can you brand somebody a discriminator or as racially
motivated or a racist without some element of intent, whether it is
circumstantial or otherwise?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, again without
intending to represent that this is a legal decision on any of these
very complicated matters that would come before the Court, my
general personal approach would be to look for discriminatory
intent, evidence of that.

   Senator HATCH. Thank you.
   Yesterday Senator Metzenbaum asked you a series of questions
about 42 United States Code 1983, which is a very volatile subject
today in American jurisprudence. His questions, it seemed to me,
may have left a lingering impression that I would really like to see
resolved.
   He maintained that Federal rights such as those arising in social
security cases and the like should be accorded a right of access to
the Federal courts. Now is there any particular type of claim or
particular class of cases that give a claimant a right to have his
claim adjudicated in the Federal courts?
                                      150
  Maybe I could clarify that even a little bit more. In the McCurry
case of this year, the Court reversed a court of appeals holding that
appeared "to be a generally framed principle that every person
asserting a Federal right is entitled to one unencumbered opportu-
nity to litigate that right in the Federal district court, regardless of
the legal posture in which the Federal claim arises, but" the Court
continues "the authority for this principle is difficult to discern. It
cannot lie in the Constitution, which makes no such guarantee but
leaves the scope of the jurisdiction of the Federal district courts to
the wisdom of the Congress."
  The Court then proceeded to reject every other "conceivable
basis for finding a universal right to litigate a Federal claim in a
Federal district court."
  Now does this Supreme Court language seem to support your
reading that the State courts are worthy of more credence in these
type of cases?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, I do not know
whether that is what the Court had in mind when it wrote those
words, but we have discussed I guess at length in these hearings
my belief that indeed State courts can provide a hospitable forum
for the hearing of Federal rights.
  Certainly the Supreme Court in the recent session handed down
several decisions in this whole area of examining Federal statutes
to determine when those statutes created a cause of action for
someone and when they did not. It appears to me to be an area in
which the Court, at least more recently is looking more closely at
the congressional legislation to determine if indeed there is such a
right.
  This is an area, I might add, in which I think the Congress has a
very important role as well as the courts, Congress in its role to
make clear whether it intends to be creating some cause of action,
and if so, what.
  Senator HATCH. Yesterday, in response po one of Senator Thur-
mond's questions, you noted that you supported a bill in the Arizo-
na Senate, 1165, I believe, which disallowed funding for abortions
unless medically necessary, but later you told Senator Dole that
this bill bascially reflects your views today, or at least that is the
way I understood it. How did you understand the meaning of
"medically necessary" in 1974, and can you draw a distinction,
either in your past role as a State legislator or in your current role
as a judicial nominee, between Federal rights and Federal funding
to further rights?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, my recollection is that that is
not exactly the language of the bill, and I will refer to it.
  Senator HATCH. I am not sure myself.
  Judge O'CONNOR. It contained a provision that no benefits would
be provided for abortions except when deemed medically necessary
to save the life of the mother
  Senator HATCH. I see.
  Judge O'CONNOR [continuing]. Or where pregnancy resulted from
rape, incest, or criminal action. That was the language of the bill.
  Senator HATCH. Therefore, you would limit it to that language.
                                         151

  Judge O'CONNOR. That was the provision to which I referred,
which was adopted and passed. The other portion of your question
was

  Senator HATCH. The other portion was, can you draw a distinc-
tion either in your past role as a State legislator or in your present
role as a judicial nominee, between Federal rights and Federal
funding to further rights?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, yes, I think that
the establishment or recognition, if you will, of a particular consti-
tutional right has been held by the Court not to carry with it a
right to funding for the exercise of that right, if that is what you
mean, and I believe that has been reasonably established.

   Senator HATCH. I think that helps.
  Several recent Supreme Court decisions have sharply--I will go
back to that Thibidoe decision that I brought up prior because I
think it is an important issue of today--several recent Supreme
Court decisions have sharply expanded the liability of municipal-
ities under section 1983. The Thibidoe case, for an example, ex-
tended th scope of 1983 to include violations of any Federal law
instead of just civil rights law. The Owens case eliminated even the
good faith defense for municipalities.

   Now what distinctions would you make to prevent further expan-
sion of 1983, or really can it be expanded any further?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, I am not sure
that I know that it can. Since the Thibidoe case the Supreme Court
has handed down several additional cases to which you have re-
ferred this morning which have in fact not found a cause of action
being created in those specific contexts of the legislation, so I think
Thibidoe has been modified to a degree by subsequent cases.

   Senator HATCH. It has been expanded, in many ways.
   Judge O'CONNOR. It has been expanded in other areas. Certainly
the municipalities have no good faith defense, athough I think the
other public officials and employees are still granted the good faith
defense.
   Another recent case has held that no punitive damages are al-
lowable.
   Senator HATCH. Of course, you cannot convince the municipal-
ities of that because there are multibillions of dollars of actionable
claims against municipalities all over this country today, as a
result of Thibidoe, both the Thibidoe and the Owens cases.
   Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, I think it is a
matter of concern and I think it is a matter of concern not only
within the context of individual cases to come before the Court but
to the Congress itself as it reviews these provisions.

                                           ATTORNEYS FEES

   Senator HATCH. In your article in the William & Mary Law
Review, you indicate that the attorneys fees statute, section 1988,
might profitably be modified to reduce the number of section 1983
suits and to reduce the burden on State and local governments.
Now since we are discussing that in our committee now--on the
Subcommittee on the Constitution, which I chair--do you have any
                                         152

specific recommendations for amending section 1988 with regard to
attorneys fees?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Hatch, nothing specific
other than to suggest that categories of types of actions perhaps
could be considered and weighed with regard to it. To preclude
appropriate causes of action or to discourage appropriate causes of
action by removing the capacity to collect attorneys fees would no
doubt be unwise, but to discourage causes of action that are spe-
cious, or in areas in which the Congress never intended, if you will,
that the section be applicable would present another matter for
consideration.

  Senator HATCH. Judge, I would just like to say in closing that I
have certainly enjoyed listening to you. I think this is a very
difficult position to be in, with all these lights and all these people
and all these questions and all these Senators, but I think you have
acquitted yourself really well.

  I personally am very proud of you, and I am going to support
you, as I indicated quite a while ago, and be very proud to have
you on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. I am
very pleased with having you here during these hearings, and
having you have this opportunity.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The committee will now stand in recess until
2:30.
  [Whereupon at 12:55 p.m. the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 2:30 p.m. the same day.]

                                       AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The Judiciary Committee will come to order.
  Questioning of Judge O'Connor by the members of the committee
will continue.
  Judge O'Connor, I would remind you that you are still under
oath.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will now hear from Senator Laxalt of
Nevada.

          PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY OVER INDEPENDENT AGENCIES

  Senator LAXALT. Judge O'Connor, in 1972 legislation which was
sponsored by you was enacted by the Arizona Legislature giving
the State attorney general power to approve all regulations pro-
posed by State agencies.

  Here at the Federal level the experts have debated what inher-
ent authority the President has over Federal agencies, including
the so-called independent agencies, due to his constitutional role as
Chief Executive.

  We are in the throes now of attempting to enact and implement
administratively as well as up here legislatively substantial regula-
tory reform. The essence of that problem is jurisdictional in part.

  I would like to have your views as to what Executive authority
over the so-called independent administrative agencies you believe
a President of the United States has.
                                         153

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Laxalt, I think it may
depend on the legislation in each instance as to what role has been
envisioned for the Executive with respect to some particular
agency.

  I recognize that Congress is dealing today in terms of legislative
review of the relationship that would be appropriate in terms of
agency regulation.

  In fact, I think some consideration is being given--if I am not
mistaken--to even having the legislative body itself involved by
some sort of legislative review.

  These proposals, of course, have not been tested yet; and I cannot
speak to the constitutional validity of them, I think; but it involves
essentially a question of the essential separation of powers concept
and the extent to which, under the separation of powers at the
Federal level, it is considered desirable to have some form of over-
sight of the administrative bodies, whether it be by the executive
branch or the legislative branch.

  To the extent that these administrative agencies are executive
agencies or agencies under the executive branch of Government
and that the executive branch is given some role of oversight in
connection with them, it does not appear to involve a question of
separation of powers.

  To the extent that the concept or vehicle used is one of legisla-
tive review of the regulations or the actions, we have different
questions at play.

   In Arizona, as you have indicated, the State adopted a practice in
the year that you mentioned of having the attorney general part of
the executive branch review the regulations of agencies of the
executive branch for legality prior to their adoption by those agen-
cies. That system seems to have served reasonably well.

   Senator LAXALT. If I understand you correctly, in the absence of
some legislative prohibition there would be no constitutional bar
on the grounds of separation of powers or otherwise, restraining a
President from exercising direct authority and responsibility over
the independent agencies if the legislation in question opened the
door for him to do so?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Mr. Chairman, Senator Laxalt, it would appear
to me--again without attempting to express any legal opinion on a
given case--that within the executive branch, provided the legisla-
tion allowed for it, the executive branch could be assigned certain
roles for review of those executive branch agencies.

   Senator LAXALT. AS you indicated, a combination of proper over-
sight here of those agencies plus general supervision on the part of
the Executive theoretically at least should get the job done?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Laxalt, we would hope so.

                                           VENUE RULES

   Senator LAXALT. Let us talk about venue for a moment. I do not
know whether or not you have followed the progress of rather
substantial venue legislation we are pursuing through this commit-
tee.

   Under section 1391 of title 28 of the United States Code actions
in which the Government is a party may be brought in one of four
                                         154

places--I am sure you are already familiar with this--No. 1, where
the plaintiff resides; two, where the defendant resides; three, where
the cause of action arose; or, four, where any real property in-
volved in the action is located.

  As you probably already know from your previous experience in
a Western State, many cases involving Federal land located in
Western States are brought here in Washington, D.C. As a result,
there is little opportunity for individuals vitally interested in the
outcome to participate in such a proceedings effectively.

  We have had land decisions decided here; we have had water
decisions affecting our water decided here by district judges within
the District of Columbia.

  In addition, there is some feeling that the Federal judges in those
Western States have a better understanding of the practical conse-
quences of these lawsuits over land use.

  Considering that the Federal Government owns or controls ap-
proximately 50 percent of the land in the Western States--and in
your State and mine substantially more than that; ours is 87; I do
not know exactly what yours is, but I think it is near that--people
in those States increasingly feel that they have no say about sig-
nificant matters that affect them on a daily basis.

  Now, Judge O'Connor, do you consider a change in the venue
rules which requires suits to be brought in the district where the
outcome of the suit will have the greatest impact an appropriate
action by this Congress?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Laxalt, it appears to me that that
determination is one that is peculiarly appropriate, I suppose, to
the legislative branch to determine.

  If there were no other impediments involved normally we would
want to consider in terms of where a cause of action is brought
some of the factors affecting the convenience of the parties. In
other words, if most of the parties find that it would be more
convenient to have the trial brought in a particular location rather
than another, that is a factor that normally one would want to
consider.

  As far as any statutory changes are concerned concerning the
provisions for venue, that seems to me to be a policy question
appropriate for the legislative branch to address certainly.

  Senator LAXALT. DO you see that this poses any degree of consti-
tutional question?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Laxalt, I do not know offhand whether
any particular constitutional issue could be raised concerning it. I
really have not studied that problem and would want to have the
benefit of some research before I could answer that. None comes
immediately to mind, but I have not researched the question.

                                          JUDICIAL NOTICE

  Senator LAXALT. I understand.
  Let us talk about judicial notice for just a moment or so. Review-
ing your own record, it has been very pleasant for this Senator as a
former lawyer and one who has worked on this committee for quite
a while to find that you have, in fact, as a judge, exercised consid-
erable judicial restraint. You, in fact, in your position, have been a
                                         155

judge rather than a public official or a legislator; and you have
operated within those constraints.

   One of the areas where license can be used, I would imagine, by
any judge, is in looking beyond the record factually as a judge may
or may not find that record and getting out into the labyrinth that
we call judicial notice. This brings into play then, factually and
otherwise, an independent situation which may or may not be
proper.

   In this general area I would like to ask you this, Judge O'Connor:
In the context of several of your own opinions you have been called
upon to address the permissible scope of judicial notice. As a
matter of policy rather than one of statutory construction, what do
you, as a judge who has sat on the State level and who now aspires
to sit on our highest court, view as the proper range of judicial
notice?

   I suspect that in controversial cases that have been alluded to
here previously Roe v. Wade and others--perhaps our Supreme
Court in that situation did, I think, indulge in far too much lati-
tude in this area. May I have your views?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Laxalt, with respect to the application
of those things of which a court can take judicial notice I can share
with you my views as a State court judge when I have had to face
the question, and that basically is that the court was allowed to
take judicial notice only of matters which were, in effect, beyond
dispute--for example, a date or the time within which the Sun rose
or set on a given date, or the location of a particular community
geographically, or something of that sort.

   These are the instances in which we would normally apply judi-
cial notice at the State level--I would say very limited circum-
stances.

   Senator LAXALT. DO you see an application of the doctrine in
respect to the functions of the Supreme Court?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Laxalt, I have not had occasion to
review all the instances in which the Supreme Court has been
called upon to take judicial notice of something, so I would be
perhaps not in a position to give you examples of where the Court
may have adopted a broader view if it has. I can only speak from
my experience as a State court judge in which the application of
the doctrine would be very limited.

    REGULATORY STATUTES MAY VIOLATE CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE

   Senator LAXALT. Judge O'Connor, as chairman of the Regulatory
Reform Subcommittee within the framework of this general com-
mittee I am becoming increasingly involved with issues of lawmak-
ing by administrative agencies.

   Senator Heflin alluded to this during the course of his question-
ing but did not have an opportunity to pursue it further, so I would
like to if I may.

   Many have criticized the Congress for giving this power to agen-
cies too broadly without sufficient guidelines, essentially abdicating
congressional responsibility to legislate to the agencies.

   That has been part of our problem here. We have passed legisla-
tion for many years in general form and, I think as a political

        87-101 O--81 11
                                      156
matter, passed the buck downtown and let them do the dirty work
by fleshing it out with rules and regulations on the part of many
agencies, none of whom in terms of personnel are responsive to the
process--unelected people.

  Some eminent legal figures have concluded--I guess eminent
legal figures are ordinarily those who agree with you--that certain
of these statutes violate constitutional doctrine that Congress may
not delegate its lawmaking power without clear and adequate
guidelines.

  Now, Judge O'Connor, do you believe that some existing regula-
tory statutes may be unconstitutional because of the failure of
Congress to adequately lay down the general policies and standards
that animate those statutes?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Laxalt, it seems to me that there was
a time in our Nation's history when the Supreme Court used to
look under the separation of powers doctrine at the delegation of
legislative power to the executive and administrative agencies and
review very strictly those delegations. Those were the days of
Schlecter Poultry v. United States back in the 1930's.

  Such an uproar arose at that time that ultimately the Court
reversed that trend and began to approve very sweeping delega-
tions of power to administrative agencies and has upheld agency
regulations which had really a very tenuous basis of support in the
legislation itself.

  One can recall for example the Red Lion Broadcasting case
where, under very limited delegation by Congress, very sweeping
regulations were upheld.

  My observation is that in recent years there are some indications
at least that the Court is examining the legislative basis for agency
regulations more carefully than had been the case for a while.

  A very recent case dealt with whether an agency had to make a
cost-benefit analysis of its regulations, and I believe the Court
indicated that because that was not reflected as a duty in the
legislation therefore none would be implied.

  Certainly it would appear to me that the legislative branch has a
very important role to play in this area in terms of determining for
itself the extent to which it wants to be specific in its delegation
and limitation of power to the Administrative agency to adopt
regulations.

  Just as a personal view expressed by one who has been in the
legislative branch, it seemed to me then that very careful guide-
lines were appropriate to be drawn by the legislative branch in
permitting agencies to adopt rules and regulations. Certainly the
legislative branch has a terribly important role in this.

  The Court's role then becomes one of examining the legislation
to determine whether, in fact, the administrative agency is author-
ized to adopt the types of regulations that it has. In that regard I
can only indicate to you what I may see as a trend of more careful
study of that matter by the courts.

  Senator LAXALT. I thank you very much, Judge.
  Mr. Chairman, that concludes my time and my questioning. I
thank the chairman. I thank the judge.
  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator
Metzenbaum.
                                             157

                                    CONCERNS OF THE POOR

  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge O'Connor, your testimony yester-
day led us down some paths about which I would like to make a
few comments.

  Your thoughts for limiting attorney's fees in section 1983 cases
and keeping the $10,000 jurisdictional prerequisite for other Feder-
al question cases, in my opinion, actually strike at the heart of
Federal jurisdiction.

  I think that what disturbs me particularly is that apart from
whether the Federal courts should have this jurisdiction in general,
the attorney's fee and $10,000 limitations actually strike only one
group of litigants, and that is the poor. That is one reason Congress
created the right to attorney's fees in section 1983 cases just a few
years ago, in 1976.

  Since this is a matter that seems to me to be so relevant, since I
am concerned that if there is any group of people in this country at
the moment who are the forgotten people of the country and who
are going to be even more forgotten in the months and years
ahead, I am disturbed about that kind of expression or that direc-
tion.

  I wonder if you would care to comment, because in your past
legislative history, in all fairness, I see nothing to indicate that you
have been indifferent to the concerns of the poor.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, indeed I am not indiffer-
ent to the concerns of the poor.

  The legislation in section 1988, as I read it, is certainly not
limited to the award of attorney's fees to people who are impover-
ished. Indeed, I suppose a very wealthy individual can file a suit
under section 1983 and seek attorney's fees under section 1988. So I
do not believe that the legislation, as drafted at least, is in any way
limited to a protection of the poor.

   No doubt a portion of the motivation for its enactment was to
enable suits to be brought by anyone regardless of their means to
do so.

   Senator METZENBAUM. But the attorney's fee question hurts
them the most because those who are the "haves" can hire their
own lawyers. It is the "have nots" who really have the difficulty of
finding counsel, and counsel taking it then on an "if come" basis
could get awarded attorney's fees under the law. Your article sug-
gests a contrary point of view.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, my article suggested
that Congress should review very carefully its delegations of au-
thority to sue in the first instance and also a review of those
matters in which it thinks attorney's fees provisions are appropri-
ate.

  The article in no way suggested that that was a function of the
judiciary, and I am sure that Congress in its wisdom will consider
all of these factors as it makes this type of review.

   I have not suggested, I think, that people who are impoverished
be denied access to the courts. In fact, that would be a most
unfortunate suggestion and one which I would not make.

   But the extent to which Congress wants to authorize suits in the
first instance in the Federal courts as opposed to the State court
                                      158

and the extent to which Congress wants to authorize suits and
have attorney's fees a possibility are appropriate things, it seems to
me, for the Congress itself to consider as a matter of policy.

                             MORE LITIGATION IN STATE COURTS

  Senator METZENBAUM. YOU mention the matter of the State
courts. Actually you also suggest that more litigation ought to be
in the State courts rather than just full access to the Federal
courts.

  But actually State courts really have had more experience in the
constitutional issues where criminal matters were involved, and
much less experience with respect to civil constitutional claims,
which are the subject of all section 1983 civil rights cases and other
Federal question cases. You would agree with that, would you not?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes; I would agree generally that the expertise
of the State courts in the constitutional area, while not exclusively
confined to criminal cases, has been primarily in terms of numbers
in that area.

  I think that the State courts have developed a pretty good capac-
ity to deal with those questions, and I see no reason why that
capacity could not be extended to other areas as well.

  Senator METZENBAUM. In view of your desire to shift Federal
question and section 1983 cases to the State courts and to rely on
the State legislatures as indicated by your response to the Judici-
ary Committee questionnaire, would you disagree with this state-
ment by Justice Stewart speaking for a unanimous Court in Mit-
chum v. Foster in 1972 that, "the very purpose of section 1983 was
to interpose the Federal courts between the States and the people
as guardians of the people's Federal rights to protect the people
from unconstitutional actions under color of State law whether
that action be executive, legislative, or judicial"?

  Obviously, he is saying that we need to have that Federal right
and the right to go into the Federal court because in many in-
stances the denial of rights occurred not alone at the executive
level, not alone at the legislative level, but also at the judicial
level.

  If you force those cases back into the judicial level, then how
does the litigant get a chance to protect his or her civil rights?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, I do not disagree at all
with the statement that you read. The framework of review could
of course encompass making an initial presentation of one's case at
the State level in any given situation, and if it were believed that a
Federal right had been violated and that it was not adequately
vindicated at the State level then to pursue the remedy further
through the Federal courts. That certainly is a possibility, it strikes
me.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I am not sure I follow that. If you cannot
get your rights litigated and the court has ruled against you in the
State court, are you suggesting that you could relitigate the issue
in the Federal courts?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I am suggesting, Senator Metzenbaum, that to
the extent that one is in a Federal court and believes that the
                                         159

result on an issue of Federal law was erroneously received or
determined one can raise that issue then in the Federal court.

  Senator METZENBAUM. DO you not think res judicata would pre-
vail to cause the Federal court to dispose of that matter rather
summarily on the basis that the case had been decided and the
constitutional issue had been raised in State court?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, not if you are appealing
from that very matter of course res judicata is not attached. If you
are pursuing your remedy in Federal court, and you feel an error
has been made, and you then go to the Federal court for review,
no, you are not precluded from doing that.

  If on the other hand you had litigated your case, and dropped it,
and had taken no appeal or petition for review in the Federal
system, and then tried to pursue it again, yes, then you would have
a res judicata problem.

  Senator METZENBAUM. If you had litigated the issue in the State
court, and the State has ruled that you had no Federal right or
constitutional right, and you do not appeal, and then you file suit
anew in the Federal court, is it not entirely probable or logical that
defense counsel would immediately file a motion to dismiss on the
basis of res judicata?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes, Senator Metzenbaum, if you do not pursue
your immediately available remedies within the Federal system
and let it be terminated at the State level. Yes, of course, you are
thereafter precluded.

   Senator METZENBAUM. What would be the immediately available
remedy in that instance? You have lost in the State court; now
what is your immediately available Federal remedy?

  Judge O'CONNOR. YOU can file your petition for certiorari of
course if it has been determined adversely on the Bederal issue. If
you have gone to the highest State court you can certainly do that.

   Senator METZENBAUM. NOW you have to take your case all the
way up through the appellate procedure and then file your petition
for certiorari with the Supreme Court. That really is not really a
very practical remedy for the average litigant because by that time
he or she has pretty well run out of money, particularly if they are
not well-heeled. That would mean you were in the fourth court:
You had been in the lower court, the appellate court, and the
supreme court of the State, and then you take the case on certiora-
ri. Then you have to make out that Federal issue that is involved.

   I just wonder whether realistically speaking, by moving more of
the civil cases through the State courts and forcing litigants there
and also denying them their attorney's fees, a great injustice would
not be done to hundreds of thousands and maybe millions of
Americans who might otherwise want to litigate a Federal ques-
tion.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, these are the precise
things that I would assume this body would consider when it
considers that issue. Of course you want to review all these matters
very carefully. I am sure that the Senate in its wisdom will do
precisely that.
                                             160

                                       JUDICIAL ACTIVISM

   Senator METZENBAUM. All right. Let me change the subject. In
your response to the committee's questionnaire and your other
answers here you have made it very clear that you are opposed to
"judicial activism."

   Exactly what is and is not judicial activism is not that easy to
define. It is very easy to say that the Supreme Court or the court
should not make laws.

   I would like to ask some questions about some of the major
issues in some cases that have already been decided by the Su-
preme Court. Most of them are quite old and probably will never
again come before the Supreme Court.

   The Baker v. Carr case--this 1962 decision allowing the Federal
courts to require local legislative bodies to be fairly apportioned--
probably did more to reshape our political system than almost any
other decision of the Supreme Court. It largely ended the gross
malapportionment that existed in many States.

   In your opinion was that decision an inappropriate exercise of
judicial activism?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, you are correct in your
characterization of the dramatic results of that decision and its
progeny. I think what the Court really did in Baker v. Carr was to
reexamine the question of what is a political question which the
Supreme Court will or will not consider.

   I think before Baker v. Carr the Court had taken a more restric-
tive view, if you will, of what is of justiciability--of what is a
political question--and in what case will the Court avoid deciding
it at all because it is a political question.

   In Baker v. Carr it really drew more liberal lines, if you will, in
determining what is a political question which the Court will con-
sider. That now appears to be the leading case on the subject of
what is or is not a political question.

   Senator METZENBAUM. And that is the case that established the
one man, one vote rule.

  Judge O'CONNOR. That is correct.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Was that an inappropriate exercise of
judicial activism?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, I may have been heard
to comment at the time that it concerned me but--that perhaps it
was. Certainly the time that has intervened in the meantime and
the acceptance of that decision has put it pretty much in place in
terms of its present effect and application.

                                      SEX DISCRIMINATION

   Senator METZENBAUM. DO you think there was inappropriate
judicial activism in 1971 for the Burger Court to rule for the first
time in Reed v. Reed that sex discrimination was unconstitutional?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, it was in my view an
appropriate consideration of the problem of gender-based discrimi-
nation.
                                         161

                          CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT

  Senator METZENBAUM. DO you think it inappropriate judicial
activism for a Federal district court to order major changes in a
prison after finding that conditions in a penal system constituted
cruel and unusual punishment? That was in the case of Hutto v.
Finney, which reached the Supreme Court in 1978.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, I think the constitution-
al provision against cruel and unusual punishment has been of
course part of our Constitution for many years; and it is certainly
not inappropriate for the Court to consider a case that alleges that
a particular prison condition constitutes cruel and unusual punish-
ment. I do not view that as any unusual exercise of judicial activ-
ism.

  You can examine then the particular remedies that are selected
by the Federal district court, assuminx it finds such a condition,
and then begin to discuss the extent to which the district court
remedies exceed what is regarded as an appropriate exercise of the
Court's discretion once that condition is found. It seems to me that
is a different question.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I have just one last question. I have a
number of other cases of this same kind of judicial activism, but
my real question is this: Is not the matter of judicial activism a
question of which side of the court you are on--and I mean tennis
court, not the court in the other sense--a question of which way
the ball bounces as to whether one man's or one woman's judicial
activism is not another party's legalistic approach to what should
or should not be done, and that overreacting to the question of
judicial activism could be just as bad as overinvolvement by the
courts in attempting to make new law?

  I would just hope that this question of judicial activism would
not be of such a nature as to cause you to lean over backward or
forward with respect to the actions of the Supreme Court, because I
think it is these cliches that get us all in trouble. I do not think
they will get you in trouble, but I at least for one would hope that
the Court would not do less in meeting its responsibilities than it
has done in the past in order to protect constitutional rights of the
people of this country.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Metzenbaum, there is always a danger
in oversimplification and in sloganism, and I understand that.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you very much.
   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr.
Dole.
   Senator DOLE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge O'Connor, in your testimony yesterday you expressed your
feeling that it is not the job of the Court to establish public policy
through its judicial work. As a practical matter we know that the
Court has frequently found justification for such policymaking by
expansive readings of the constitutional or statutory law.
  Today we find courts running school systems, apportioning legis-
latures, managing railroads, and generally involved in a whole host
of activities which would have been unthinkable a generation ago.
                                         162

   Sometimes those of us in the Congress feel that the Court has
gone beyond interpretation of law to an extent that it makes it
difficult to know who, in fact, is setting policy for our Nation.

   We have talked generally about your philosophy of judicial re-
straint. I wonder if you might be more specific on the question of
how that philosophy can be imparted to lower courts. Is there
something that the Supreme Court might do to impart some of that
restraint to lower courts?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Dole, I suppose every time the Su-
preme Court acts in terms of publishing an opinion that expresses
a point of view that point of view is read and heard and considered
by all the other Federal courts and the State courts.

   To the extent that the Supreme Court expresses concepts of
judicial restraint I assume that those are addressed.

   Obviously, the other very simplistic answer is that judges, like
lawyers, enjoy attending training programs, seminars, and so forth;
and all of these means are constantly available for dissemination of
concepts of appropriate judicial management and action.

                                           BAKKE DECISION

   Senator DOLE. I think also it appears to many of us on the
outside at times that the Court avoids controversy and attack from
outside sources by avoiding decisions on difficult issues until it is
presented with a very narrow, well-defined case. There are a
number of examples of that.

   One I recall is the affirmative action decision--the so-called
Bakke decision. The Court avoided a decision on the constitutional-
ity of reverse discrimination until presented with the issue of
quotas in that case.

   Do you have any opinion on whether or not the Court shirks its
responsibilities by following this practice--by waiting for just the
right case, a very narrowly defined case?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Dole, I have not participated of course
in the discussions that surround that particular activity.

  I believe that the Court had previously rejected an affirmative
action case on the grounds that the issue was then moot--in other
words, that the plaintiff who had filed was no longer attending the
institution and the question had become moot. That was not the
situation, I gather, in Bakke, and the Court took jurisdiction.

  The doctrine of not accepting a case which is moot is not an
absolute one. Exceptions have been made in the past, particularly
for those instances in which otherwise the case could never get to
the Court.

   However, in general the Court has attempted to, I suppose,
accept jurisdiction of those cases in which it feels an issue has been
appropriately raised that would lend itself to resolution.

  Senator DOLE. SO you are not concerned that they may, in effect,
sometimes avoid coming to grips with a matter by waiting for some
narrowly defined case to come before the Court?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Dole, of course it is a concern. We all
hope that matters of great significance and in which there is a
need for a final voice, if you will, are given the opportunity to be
heard.
                                         163

  These are very delicate questions, I am sure, that have to be
addressed on a case-by-case basis; and applying all the normal
principles of review, is this case appropriate for acceptance?

  I am sure that another factor of course is the tremendous
number of cases and the limitation inherently that exists because
of the incapacity to accept more than a fairly limited number of
matters each term.

                                         ILLEGAL ALIENS

  Senator DOLE. Let me shift to another matter which is of consid-
erable interest and probably will become more of interest--and
maybe for that reason you cannot fairly comment on it.

  The Court has never decided whether aliens who enter the
United States illegally should be afforded the full protection and
rights guaranteed under the 14th amendment.

   The dispute finds recent expression in a suit filed against the
State of Texas by certain organizations who claim that the State
must make educational facilities available to the children of illegal
aliens.

   Do you have any general views as to the extent to which due
process and equal protection rights should be afforded to illegal
aliens?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Dole, that is an issue that is currently
either awaiting certiorari or has been accepted. It is a matter
which is going to make its way I think soon to the U.S. Supreme
Court and a matter of grave concern to many people.

   Our country has, as you know, received within its borders in
recent years large numbers of illegal aliens; and the question of the
right of those individuals to a public school education, for instance,
and other rights is a matter that is of concern to many and which
does raise serious constitutional questions, and those questions are
likely to be heard soon, I believe.

   Certainly with regard to the subject of aliens generally the
Court's primary reported decisions have really dealt with those
who are legally in the country, and various standards for review--
in fact, a rather strict standard for review--in many instances has
been applied to cases arising in that area.

   Senator DOLE. I certainly accept that answer. I am certain this
case will find its way to the Court, and you will be asked at that
time I assume to apply the proper principles of law or equity.

   I addressed a question to you yesterday with reference to the
exclusionary rule following a question asked by Senator Laxalt,
and I think there was a question asked this morning by another
member of the committee. You responded with an example of a
case in which you had to exclude wiretap evidence under title 3 of
the 1968 Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act.

   In that legislation Congress attempted to provide for admissibil-
ity of wiretap evidence under a formula which called for court
supervision over the use of electronic surveillance techniques by
Federal and State enforcement authorities.

   This statutory scheme has subsequently been upheld by the Su-
preme Court, and this scheme could well serve as a precedent for
                                         164

other congressional efforts to limit the scope of the exclusionary
rule.

  I would be interested in receiving your thoughts on your prob-
lems with the 1968 act in the cases you referred to yesterday.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Dole, for one thing the act applied to
information obtained by private individuals in addition to those
who are peace officers. The exclusionary rule as we know it under
the fourth amendment is applicable only to information or evi-
dence obtained by peace officers. If a private individual obtains
evidence illegally it is not excluded in court in a criminal action
based on the exclusionary rule.

  However, Congress in that act has applied it not only to peace
officers but to information or evidence obtained by private citizens.

  In addition, the act by its terms I believe makes a blanket
prohibition of the use in court and provides for no "good faith"
exception, if there is such a thing, as has been addressed in some of
the Federal courts with regard to the criminal exclusionary rule.

  Senator DOLE. Finally, I was not able to be here this morning,
but we were monitoring the session, and I understand that Senator
Thurmond asked a question concerning the second amendment
right of citizens to keep and bear arms.

  Your response, as I understand it, included the citation, United
States v. Miller--one of the few instances where the Supreme
Court has ruled in recent years on the scope and meaning of the
second amendment.

  In that case the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of
the National Firearms Act of 1934. That act was based on Con-
gress' power to place transfer taxes and national registration on
gangstertype weapons such as machine guns and sawed-off shot-
guns.

  These and similar weapons, however, certainly would be appro-
priate for use by militias or State militias, and it seems to me that
the state of the art firearms technology of that decision would be
open to question if the matter came before the Court again.

  In these days--and I think as recently as yesterday--we hear
announcements of increased crime rates, especially violent crimes
committed with firearms.

  Can the several States or the Federal Government impose re-
strictions on private possession and use of sporting firearms with-
out violating the constitutional guarantees of the second amend-
ment?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Dole, possibly there is a difference
under the second amendment question with respect to what the
States can do and what the Federal Government can do. At least
that is a possibility.

  The Miller case addressed the power of Congress to enact certain
prohibitions under the commerce clause of the carrying of certain
types of weapons.

  In a very brief decision actually, the Court simply held that the
second amendment did not guarantee the right of people to have a
certain type of weapon but rather was addressed to a prohibition
against Congress interfering with the maintenance of a State mili-
tia.
                                      165
  We just do not have additional determinations by the Court of
the meaning of that act. We do know, however, that the States,
acting in their police power, have adopted a wide range of statutes
regulating the possession and use of firearms.
  It is a matter of great concern to many people. In Arizona at
least that regulation has been limited by and large to a regulation
prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons and provisions limit-
ing the use of weapons at all in certain inhabited areas, regulations
concerning the use of firearms by the very young, and also statutes
that impose additional penalties on people who commit crimes in-
volving the use of weapons.
  It has been the view, at least in our State, of the legislators at
this point that the legislative power if it exists to further limit the
use or ownership of firearms by citizens for sport purposes or for
self-defense should not be limited. I think that has been a policy
decision at the legislative level and not tested under the second
amendment that is applicable.
  Senator DOLE. Judge O'Connor, the other questions I have you
have addressed, I think, directly or indirectly. I yield back the
balance of my time, and I want to indicate my strong support for
your nomination.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr.
DeConcini.

                                     PROBLEM OF CRIME

  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
  Judge O'Connor, thank you for your fine testimony today. It has
been exceptional, as was yesterday's.
  I would like to address a couple of general areas with you. If you
can labor through them I would be most appreciative.
  The problem of organized crime, violent crime, and drug-related
crime in this country has surfaced once again as a primary subject
and a primary objective of many of us in the Senate; and certainly
now the administration has come forward with a, not termed a
"war on crime," but some specifics; and I think some of them are
very positive. A number of Senators here have suggested specific
legislation.
  I wonder, Judge O'Connor, if you could just characterize in a
general sense what you believe--first of all, if you agree that it is
the problem that I believe it is; and, second, what you believe the
Court can do and should do to participate in a more active way or
passive way, but in some way, to bear some of the burden of
improving the safety of the citizens of this country?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator DeConcini, you have done a tremen-
dous amount of work in this particular area, perhaps because of
your background in law enforcement in Pima County and your
continued interest thereafter at the State level and this body.
  It seems to me that it is a subject of tremendous concern to a
tremendous number of people.
  We have truly an unacceptably high crime rate in our Nation.
We certainly have an unacceptably high crime rate in the State of
                                      166

Arizona and in the city of Phoenix and surrounding areas. All
public officials in our area have exhibited a real concern about it.

  It seems to me that there is no avenue, whether it be legislative
or judicial, that should not be explored to see how we can improve
the situation.

  If I had an answer to these problems of how to instantly reduce
crime I would be more than happy to give them to you; I do not
know.

  But we must, I think, within the judicial system itself strive
constantly to resolve criminal cases rapidly. I think delay in that
area simply promotes a disillusionment of people with the ability of
the system to function. So we have to be concerned about the speed
with which we handle these matters.

  I think we have to be concerned within the judicial branch about
at what point we can say that a case has been fairly litigated and
fairly reviewed on appeal or on post-conviction review and now it is
at an end. There must be some way to more effectively do that.
That has to be a concern of people on the bench as well as legisla-
tors.

  We have to be concerned, I suppose, with the imposition kf fair
and appropriate remedies. It will always be a concern, I am sure, to
judges on the bench that there are appropriate facilities in which
to place convicted defendants if an incarcerative sentence is appro-
priate.

  We have to be concerned, I think, with insuring that there is the
power at least to order those who are convicted to make restitution
in appropriate instances and the means of enforcing that.

  Senator DECONCINI. Judge O'Connor, you spell it out well. Obvi-
ously, you feel the Court has a responsibility and should be a
partner in any effort by any government, whether it is State or
Federal, to attempt to improve the quality of life by lessening the
crime.

  Mr. Chairman, I would like to call to the committee's attention a
letter, dated September 9, 1981, from Congressman Bob Stump, the
Congressman from the third district of Arizona. I understand the
chairman is going to insert it in the record in the proper place.

  I want to explain to Judge O'Connor that Congressman Stump
has written a very laudatory letter, one that is very explicit about
serving with you in the Arizona State Senate when he was minor-
ity leader and you were majority leader. I will furnish you a copy
of it.

  I am very pleased that that will be in the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, that letter will be placed in
the record. I intended to do it at the conclusion of the questions by
the Senators, but I can do it now if you wish.x
  Senator DECONCINI. NO. That will be fine, Mr. Chairman. I just
wanted to call it to the attention of Judge O'Connor.
  Judge, in your William and Mary law review article--which I am
sure now you probably wish you had published and had a royalty
from the sale of those that everyone will be clamoring for--you go
into the area of more involvement of the State courts. You com-

   1 Letter can be found on page 216.
                                         167

merit on the expanded jurisdiction that Congress has recently
granted to the Federal magistrates and the bankruptcy judges.

  Do you feel that there is room for continued expansion of the
role of these officials and these courts and others like them that
might alleviate the burden on the article 3 courts, providing obvi-
ously that it does not diminish quality of justice?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator DeConcini, I suppose we will want to
look at the results of the expanded jurisdiction and the bankruptcy
level to see in fact how that works and if it is a satisfactory
solution.

  I think that it is not inappropriate to consider the establishment
of additional tribunals or different tribunals to handle a specific
aspect of the workload, and I am sure that lawyers everywhere will
be wanting to monitor the work of the new bankruptcy court. I
think you had a substantial responsibility in connection with that
legislation.

   Senator DECONCINI. DO you think it is worth pursuing, whether
it is on a trial basis or otherwise, an attempt to broaden the
jurisdiction of other than article 3 courts to attempt to relieve and
provide some other access to the courts other than just the article
3?

  Judge O'CONNOR. It merits consideration. I hope that it is not
always at the expense of State participation or involvement.

                                     COURT ADMINISTRATION

   Senator DECONCINI. The problem of court administration has
greatly increased over the past 15 years or so. On the Federal level
Chief Justice Burger has been keenly aware of the problem and
has attempted in a very positive manner to deal with it; and
though I have not agreed with everything he has said or done
certainly it is an improvement, in my opinion.

   In addition to your work, assuming you are confirmed--and I am
sure that that is going to happen--on specific cases that you will
handle as an Associate Justice, do you anticipate that you will be
active in a broad sense in court administration? Are you bent in
that direction at all? Do you feel it is a proper area for you to delve
into, and can you share with us any ideas or what your direction
will be?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator DeConcini, I do have an interest in
court administration. It is very important to me because, having
been a judge, it has become apparent to me that effective court
administration is essential in this day of burgeoning caseloads in
both the State and the Federal courts. The numbers are such that
unless we do the job more efficiently we are not going to do it well.

   I think my greatest concern has been in the area of delay. We
have made efforts both at the State and Federal level to handle
criminal cases more expeditiously, and mandates have been legis-
lated to require that.

   This is at the expense then of the ability of the courts to handle
expeditiously general civil litigation. People who have to wait, for
example, to go to trial in a civil case are being denied justice, in
my view, very dramatically. That simply is not acceptable in our
system.
                                         168

  We have to find ways to make the system work so that people
can have more rapid access to the courts when access is needed. So
court administration is a vital tool in this area.

  I participated in an experiment in the trial court in Maricopa
County to provide speedier trial practices for civil cases generally.
That experiment was very, very successful, thanks largely to the
efforts of presiding Judge Bloomfield.

  I think there is room for improvement nationwide in this area. I
have an interest. Whether I will be encouraged or even allowed by
virtue of time pressures to engage in that if I were to be confirmed
for the U.S. Supreme Court I cannot say, but time and other
circumstances permitting I would be very interested.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU are not reluctant to get involved in it
assuming the time is there?

  Judge O'CONNOR. NO.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU mentioned the experiment in Maricopa
County. After you are confirmed I do not know if we will be able to
ask you over, Judge, to testify and give us a little background on
that. Can you just tell us very briefly--because it has been a great
interest of mine--how that project did succeed?
  Judge O'CONNOR. The project for the civil delay reduction had
several components. One was that we required that lawyers be
ready for trial much sooner than normally is the case, so it com-
pressed their preparation time substantially.
  Senator DECONCINI. What happened if they were not ready?
  Judge O'CONNOR. There were always avenues if justice truly
required it to extend the time, but we found that in the great bulk
of cases it was not required.
  Then the lawyers were given a specific date on which the matter
would go to trial, and there was a no continuance policy. So the
lawyers who came in and had a vacation or had other reasons for
continuing the case were simply turned aside, and we went ahead
on the trial date that was scheduled. If the particular judge to
which it was assigned was already in trial then another courtroom
and another judge were found, even if we had to go to the commu-
nity to find judges pro tempore.
  The system had the effect of encouraging a great many settle-
ments, and those that did not settle did go to trial as scheduled,
and it was very effective.
  Senator DECONCINI. Has Maricopa County adopted that on any
larger basis, or has any other jurisdiction in Arizona, to your
knowledge?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, Maricopa County has greatly expand-
ed the program due to its success.
  Senator DECONCINI. I want to compliment you and the court
system there for that trial experiment. Obviously, I think it has
been successful from what I have heard, even though there has
been a little moaning and groaning by members of the trial bar
there, but I think that is a good sign.
  Judge O'Connor, much of the Federal courts' judicial and nonju-
dicial activities are conducted behind and beyond the public eye.
The executive and legislative branches have opened many of their
proceedings to public scrutiny under the so-called sunshine laws,
particularly in those areas of the Federal court nonjudicial work,
                                         169

such as meetings of the Judicial Conference of the United States or
the council meetings of the various circuits where no cases are
discussed or no debate is focused and the decisions are administra-
tive or quasi-legislative matters.

  Do you think it would help the process at all if some sort of
sunshine laws were applicable in this specific area of the judiciary?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator DeConcini, you mean concerning only
the conference matters, or the rulemaking function, or policymak-
ing functions?

  Senator DECONCINI. Yes.
  Judge O'CONNOR. I really do not know whether sunshine laws
would be helpful in that regard or not. I have not had information
as yet on the extent to which opening the meetings has been
productive or nonproductive. I can speak only from my experience
as a legislator in which I did support open meeting laws in Arizona
and operated extensively in the public sector under those laws and
have found it satisfactory. I have not had experience at the judicial
level with that application.
   Senator DECONCINI. DO you think it is worthy of some considera-
tion by the judiciary and some debate within the judiciary?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator DeConcini, that is not inappropriate at
all to expect it to be discussed and considered.
   Senator DECONCINI. Judge O'Connor, I want to thank you again
for your fine testimony the last 2 days.
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Senator Simpson was next, but he is not here. Senator Leahy,
the distinguished Senator from Vermont, is next.

                                       JUDICIAL ACTIVISM

   Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to be here as I
mentioned before.
   As I think some of us have mentioned to Judge O'Connor, unlike
the chairman, for some of us this is the first time that we have
been present at the confirmation hearings of a Supreme Court
Justice. That is only one small reason for the good attendance by
Senate standards at these hearings. I think Judge O'Connor's per-
sonality and abilities are the main reason. I am glad we have had
this opportunity.
   Judge, I would like to follow up on a point raised earlier this
morning by Senator Specter.
   In Brown y. Board of Education I suppose we go back and forth
on the question of whether we were trying to determine judicial
activism, whether it is a question of judge-made law or simply
further research into the old law--why we have Brown v. Board of
Education as law today and not Plessey v. Ferguson.
   I would just read from one part of Brown v. Board of Education
because I quite frankly had not read it since law school days and
went back and reread it. That is the part in the Chief Justice's
decision where he says,

   * * * in approaching this problem we cannot turn the clock back to 1868 when the
amendment was adopted or even to 1896 when Plessey v. Ferguson was written. We
must consider public education in the light of its full development and its present
                                         170

place in American life throughout the Nation. Only in this way can it be deter-
mined if segregation in public schools deprives these plaintiffs of the equal protec-
tion of the laws.

  I state that simply--and I do not mean to get back into the
whole debate on it all over again--because in my mind it appears
more that the Court in effect was making law rather than simply
finding some new interpretation of the Constitution.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Leahy, the Court did hold ultimately
that separate educational facilities in the public school system
were inherently unequal under the equal protection clause.

  The Court did, of course, ask for extensive historical research
and data in connection with its study of the problem.

  In its written opinion you are correct in stating that the Court
did not particularly refer to the historical analysis in reaching its
decision. However, the effect of it is to determine that the equal
protection clause meant what it says and that separate is not
equal.

  I suppose that most students of the law today would agree that
that was an appropriate interpretation of that language.

  To an extent, and certainly in its famous footnote, it referred to
matters that traditionally are not referred to by the Court in
reaching those solutions, and that of course was the subject of a lot
of attention at the time.

  Senator LEAHY. Of course what is judicial activism to some may
probably be strict constructionism to another.

  I recall probably one of the most memorable days I spent in law
school, and that was the day I was selected to have lunch with
Hugo Black.

  Hugo Black was seen by many people certainly as a judicial
activist. I recall him saying--I recollected it I believe this morning
when Senator Mathias mentioned him--his views of the first
amendment.

  He said,

  The First Amendment says there should be no abridgement on the right of free
speech, and I read that as a strict constructionist meaning there should be no
abridgement on the right of free speech.

  He was adamant on that.
  In applying that standard of course in some of the decisions he
wrote he was accused of judicial activism.
  In a decision that your immediate predecessor, Justice Stewart,
wrote in 1972--he said, quoting United States v. Bass,

  Unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly it would not be deemed to have
significantly changed the Federal/State balance. Congress has traditionally been
reluctant to define as a Federal crime conduct readily denounced as criminal by the
States. We will not be quick to assume that Congress has meant to effect a signifi-
cant change in the sensitive relation between Federal and State criminal jurisdic-
tion.

  I would assume that that would be along the lines--without
going into that particular case--of how you feel a Justice should
approach a case involving judicial construction and federalism?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I think that was an appropriate statement,
Senator Leahy.
                                         171

  Senator LEAHY. The reason I mentioned the difficulty is that in
that same case Justice Douglas dissented--and here is somebody
who is seen very much as an activist--where he said,

  The Court today achieves by interpretation what those who were opposed to the
Hobbs Act in this case were unable to get Congress to do.

  He was joined by Chief Justice Burger, Justice Powell, and Jus-
tice Rehnquist, who were all convinced that Congress had intended
to usurp the power of State government to prosecute violence
committed during a lawful labor strike in this particular case.

  I am a former prosecutor, and I think Justice Stewart was cor-
rect. I agree with his statement. He strictly construed the statute
and deferred to State authorities to prosecute acts of labor vio-
lence.

  Our distinguished chairman of course has been here much longer
than I have. He now feels that we need legislation that would
make labor violence a crime to be handled by Federal authorities.
So the issue can go back and forth. I am not really looking for an
answer. I am just saying that we can make a bad mistake, and
those who report on these hearings can make a bad mistake by
trying to fit any one case or any one Justice into a one-line defini-
tion. I think you would agree on that.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes; I would. I would also simply comment
that Congress can be very helpful of course to the courts if it
indicates what its intention is when it passes legislation as to
whether it intends to preempt State jurisdiction or not. Sometimes
those direct expressions can be most useful to the courts.

                                       RIGHT TO PRIVACY

   Senator LEAHY. I could not agree with you more. I think we
make a bad mistake in the Congress where, in trying to get legisla-
tion through that everyone can rally around, we make it some-
times either too bland or too nonspecific, and then we pass it on to
the regulators for applicable regulations. They have little to guide
them. You put one more layer in there, and everyone sits back
comfortably thinking that at some time or another some advocate
for one side or another will bring it before the Court for the Court
to work it out. That is a bad situation.

   I know that there are areas where we will continue to have
regulation and litigation. I know of your own fights in Arizona for
tough antipollution controls, which bring about regulations and
litigation, but it is a price that society should be willing to pay.

   The Constitution does not speak of a right to privacy, but lately
the question of a right to personal privacy comes up in opinions
more and more. Do you have any views on that right within the
Constitution?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Leahy, you are correct that the Consti-
tution does not mention the right to privacy directly. The Constitu-
tion has been interpreted though by the Court as carrying with it a
penumbra of rights under the Bill of Rights, and within that doc-
trine the Court, I think in Griswold v. Connecticut, first addressed
directly and recognized a right of privacy. That was the case in-
volving the right to sell or possess contraceptive devices in that
State and overturned a State statute prohibiting that.

        87-101 O--81 12
                                         172

  The right to privacy has been recognized again by the Court in
several other cases, one involving the possession I believe of some
obscene material among other things.

  The Court seems to have established that there is such a right.
  Senator LEAHY. HOW do you feel on that?
  Judge O'CONNOR. I accept the fact that the Court has established
that.
  The ninth amendment of course refers to a reservation to the
people of other rights not enumerated. I do not believe the courts
have directly pinned the right of privacy to the ninth amendment
by any means; but it is simply a reference or an acknowledgement,
if you will, in the Constitution that people do have certain other
rights that are not enumerated.

                                WILLIAM AND MARY ARTICLE

  Senator LEAHY. Reference was made once more to the William
and Mary article. Just as a matter of curiosity, how did you come
to write that article?

  Judge O'CONNOR. I am beginning to wish, Senator Leahy, that I
never had. [Laughter.]

  However, the William and Mary Law Review in its wisdom was
aware that the relationship of our dual system of State and Feder-
al courts and their workings is an unusual one in terms of the
international field--other nations do not have such systems--and
that inherent in such a dual system are certain areas of concern
and interrelationship that is of interest at least to those in the
system.

  The Law Review decided to invite some noted legal scholars to
write some major papers on the subject and then decided to invite
several Federal and State court judges to participate in the semi-
nar and in the panel discussion and to make remarks.

  That sounded to me like it would be fine--as a State court judge
I would be happy to participate--and after I said fine I learned
that they would like an article in addition. That is how the article
came about.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge O'Connor, I am in one moment going to do
something that Senators do only with the utmost reluctance, and
that is yield back the balance of time available to us. We do this
even with more reluctance if there is a television camera going
somewhere.

  I will just simply repeat what I said yesterday and what I said
earlier when we met in my office: I really do not care whether an
appointee to the U.S. Supreme Court is Republican, Democrat,
conservative, or liberal. I care about competence, honesty, and
integrity. I feel that you have certainly demonstrated that through-
out these hearings, and I will very enthusiastically vote for your
confirmation.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina,
Mr. East.
  Senator EAST. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

  Mr. Chairman, before I begin my questioning I would like to
request that a memorandum that has been prepared by the staff of
the Subcommittee on Separation of Powers dealing with the subject
of appropriate questions for the nominee to the Supreme Court be
made a part of the record of these hearings. I would like to make
that request.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Memorandum on the Proper Scope of Questioning of Supreme
Court Nominees at Senate Advice and Consent Hearings

To: Subcommittee on Separation of Powers
       Senator John East, Chairman

From:  Grover Rees III
       Assistant Professor of Law, The University of
       Texas (on leave 1981-82)
       Counsel, Subcommittee on Separation of Powers

       September 1, 1981

I. Introduction
         In a few days the Senate Judiciary Committee will

hold public hearings on the nomination of Sandra O'Connor
to serve as a Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
There is currently a great deal of interest in what questions
Senators will ask Judge O'Connor at the hearings, and in
whether she ought to answer specific questions about her
views on constitutional questions. This interest has been
generated partly because of the controversy over Judge
O'Connor's public record on the abortion issue, but also
because of a relative uncertainty, among Senators and
the interested public, about her general constitutional
philosophy. In her public career as a legislator and
as a state court judge, Judge O'Connor had few occasions
on which to express her opinions on constitutional questions.
The Senate advice and consent hearings, therefore, will
constitute an unusually large part of the public record
when the Senate votes on her nomination. It is thus
especially important that Senators be informed on the
proper scope of questioning at advice and consent hearings
on Supreme Court nominees.

         Understandably but unfortunately, most of what has
been said and written on this question has been in the
context of specific questions to specific nominees. The
                                      175

Senators and the nominees concerned tend not to have given
 the question much advance consideration, and they tend to
divide up according to their relative enthusiasm for the
nomination at hand, with the strongest opponents favoring
the broadest scope for questioning and some of the nominees
themselves taking the narrowest view. Before turning to
the record of prior confirmation hearings, therefore, it
will be helpful to consider whether any rules for questioning
can be deduced from generally accepted propositions about
the role of a Supreme Court Justice and the role of the
Senate in advising and consenting to Court nominations.

          The controversy over questioning at confirmation
hearings stems from a tension between two incontrovertible
propositions: First, the Senate has a duty to exercise its
advice and consent function with the most careful consideration
and the greatest possible knowledge of all factors that might
bear on whether the nominee will be a good or a bad Supreme
Court Justice. Second, a Justice of the Supreme Court owes
the litigants in each case his honest judgment on what the
law is, and such judgment would be compromised if a nominee
were to promise his vote on a particular case or class of
cases in an effort to facilitate his confirmation.

          These w o duties are in tension but not necessarily
in contradiction. They suggest a series of standards by
which to judge the propriety of a question put to a
Supreme Court nominee at advice and consent hearings:

           1) Does the question seek information that it would
be proper for a Senator to consider in deciding whether to
vote for or against a nominee's confirmation?

           2) Can the nominee answer the question without violating
his obligation to decide honestly and impartially all the
cases that will come before him as a Justice?
                         176

           3) If there is a possibility that by answering the
question the nominee might risk a violation of his future
obligations as a Justice, but the information is relevant
to the decision the Senator must make, can the information
be obtained in some other way than by asking the nominee?

          4) If relevant information cannot be obtained otherwise
than by asking the nominee, can the question be asked and
answered in such a way as to minimize the risk of compromising
the nominee's future obligation as a Justice?

           It is the purpose of this memorandum to inquire whether,
according to these standards, it would be proper for Senators
to expect Judge O'Connor to answer specific questions about
her views on constitutional law. The memorandum will also
deal with the propriety of questions and answers about the
nominee's views on social, economic and political matters.
Precisely because these two classes of questions are closely
related, it is important to bear in mind that they present
different problems. For instance, the question whether a
nominee personally favors abortion (or the death penalty,
or pornography) may be asked and answered with little risk
of compromising a future case, since a judge's personal
views on the merits of an issue are supposed to be
irrelevant to his judgment on whether the Constitution
requires or prohibits a certain result; yet exactly
insofar as the nominee's personal views are irrelevant
to future cases, it may be improper for a Senator to
cast his confirmation vote on the basis of what those
personal views are. A nominee's views on whether laws against

abortion are constitutional, however  or on any other

constitutional question  are highly relevant to the

nominee's future performance as a Supreme Court Justice,

and may therefore be a proper reason for a Senator to vote

                                      177

a nominee may not share these highly relevant views with
Senators, lest their expression be construed as a promise
to vote a certain way in a future case.

         With regard to the nominee's views on questions of
constitutional law, therefore, and also with regard to
political, social and economic views, this memorandum will
consider first whether such views may properly
be considered by Senators in casting their confirmation
votes. The next inquiry will be whether expression of
such views at confirmation hearings could be a basis for
disqualifying a Justice from participating in the Court's
consideration of a case, or might otherwise be regarded
as tainting the Justice's participation in such a case.
Finally, illustrative questions, answers and approaches
to the problem taken by Senators and nominees at past
confirmation hearings will be discussed.

II. The Scope of the Duty to Advise and Consent to Supreme
       Court Nominations.
         Article II, section 2 of the Constitution provides

that the President "shall nominate, and by and with the
Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . .
Judges of the supreme Court . . . ." There is broad
agreement among constitutional scholars that the Senate's
duty to "advise and consent" to Supreme Court nominations
is at the very least an obligation to be more than a
rubber stamp for the President's choices. The most widely
cited modern discussion of the question is by Professor
Charles Black of the Yale Law School, who wrote in 1970
that "a judge's judicial work is . . . influenced and
formed by his whole lifeview, by his economic and political
comprehensions, and by his sense, sharp or vague, of where
justice lies in respect of the great questions of his time."
Professor Black argued that in voting on whether to jonfirm
                  178

judges  who, unlike officials of the executive branch,

"are not the President's people. God forbid!"       Senators

have a duty to consider the judge's views on such questions,

just as the President considers their views in deciding

whether to nominate them. "In a world that knows that a man's

social philosophy shapes his judicial behavior, that philosophy

is a factor in a man's fitness. If it is a philosophy the

Senator thinks will make a judge whose service on the Bench

will hurt the country, then the Senator can do right only by

treating this judgment of his, unecumbered by deference to

the President's, as a satisfactory basis in itself for a

negative vote."3

Charles Black is a great and honest  scholar whose

work has long been admired by students of the Constitution

of all political and philosophical views, but it is not

inappropriate to note that he is a liberal Democrat who

was writing in an age when the President was a conservative

Republican and the Senate was controlled by liberal Democrats.

It is interesting to observe the similarity of Black's views

to those expressed in 1959 by William Rehnquist, a conservative

Republican who had then recently served as a Supreme Court

clerk. Discussing the Senate debate on the nomination of

Justice Charles Whittaker, Rehnquist complained that the

discussion had

         succeeded in adducing only the following facts:
         (a) proceeds from skunk trapping in rural Kansas
        assisted him in obtaining his early education;
         (b) he was both fair and able in his decisions as
        a judge of the lower federal courts; (c) he was the
        first Missourian ever appointed to the Supreme Court;
         (d) since he had been born in Kansas but now resided
        in Missouri, his nomination honored two states.^

Rehnquist distinguished the Senate's duty in voting on

the nomination of a judge of s lower federal court  whose

principal duty is to apply rules laid down by the Supreme

Court, and whose integrity, education and legal ability are
                     179

the paramount factors in his qualification  from the

confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice:

The Supreme Court, in interpreting the

constitution, is the highest authority in the

land. Nor is the law of the constitution just

"there," waiting to be applied in the same sense

that an inferior court may match precedents.

There are those who bemoan the absence of stare

decisis in constitutional law, but of its absence

there can be no doubt. And it is no accident that

the provisions of the constitution which have been

most productive of judicial law-making      the

"due process of law" and "equal protection of the

laws" clauses        are about the vaguest and most

general of any in the instrument. The Court in

Brown v. Board of Education, [347 U.S. 483 (1954)],

held in effect that the framers of the Fourteenth

Amendment left it to the Court to decide what "due

process" and "equal protection" meant. Whether or

not the framers thought this, it is sufficient for

this discussion that the present Court thinks the

framers thought it.

         Given this state of things in March, 1957, what
could have been more important to the Senate than
Mr. Justice Whittaker's views on equal protection
and due process? . . . . The only way for the Senate
to learn of these [views] is to "inquire of men on
their way to the Supreme Court something of their
views on these questions."

         Both the Black and the Rehnquist articles take the
position that it is proper for Senators to vote for or
against Supreme Court nominees on the basis of social,
economic and political views. It is important to note that
the basis for this position is the suggestion that, rightly
or wrongly, such views are likely to affect the future
Justice's positions on questions of constitutional law.
Therefore it is at least as proper for Senators to vote
on the basis of nominees' views about the meaning of the

Constitution per se  the text and history of the

document itself      as on the basis of views that are

relevant only insofar as they will indirectly affect

the Justice's constitutional philosophy.

It is also important to note that some students of

the Constitution believe that at least some parts of the

Constitution really are "there," with clear meanings and
                                       180

  leaving little room for injection of the judge's own
 views. If a Senator believed that a certain constitutional
 question had a right answer and a wrong answer, then it
  would be at least as proper for the Senator to vote
  against a Court nominee who disagreed with him on this
  question as it would be for the Senator to vote against
  a nominee whose social or political philosophy made it
  likely that he would disagree with the Senator in an
  area where the text of the Constitution was less clear.
 This is especially true today, when disagreements over
 constitutional law are often framed in terms of whether
 the Court ought to "make law" or "interpret the Constitution.
 To the extent that a Senator believed that a judge could
 reach a certain result only by "making law," that Senator
 would be justified in voting against a nominee who reached
 that result. The difference in result would be evidence
 of a difference in constitutional philosophy.

         Other scholars have generally agreed that social
and economic philosophy, insofar as they reflect on a
judge's likely position on constitutional issues, are
legitimate bases on which Senators might vote to confirm
or reject Supreme Court nominees. As recently as last
May two prominent constitutional law professors, testifying
before the Subcommittee on the Separation of Powers in
opposition to the proposed Human Life Bill, suggested that
the advice and consent power may legitimately be used to
influence the Supreme Court's decisions on constitutional
questions. Professor Laurence Tribe of the Harvard Law
School testified that "Congress has not been without
                                        181

 important devices for making its will felt and known through
 amending the Constitution . . . . However, apart from amendment
 there are other measures. . . . There are a great many things
 that can be done legislatively, not the least of which is
 expressed through the power of advice and consent in the
 Senate when appointments are made to the United States
Supreme Court." Professor William Van Alstyne of Duke
University Law School agreed with Professor Tribe that "[i]t
is not illicit of Congress to make its displeasure [with a
Supreme Court decision or a pattern of such decisions] felt
incidental to the appointment process."8 These remarks were
made in response to a question by Senator East asking what
actions Congress might take to effect a reversal of Roe v.
Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), the Supreme Court decision holding
that the Constitution contains a right to abortion.

If a Senator may legitimately vote to confirm or

reject a nominee because of the nominee's positions on

questions of constitutional law or related questions of

social and economic policy  and especially if, as

Black and Rehnquist suggest, a Senator may have a duty

to base his vote at least partly on the nominee's views --

then the Senator ought to have some way of ascertaining

what these views are. Before turning to whether a

nominee's future obligations as a Justice may bar him

from answering questions which the Senator otherwise seems

to have a duty to ask, one should observe that the nominee's

views, unlike his other qualifications, will often be

difficult for the Senator to ascertain except by directly

asking the nominee. Education and experience can be reduced

to lines on a resume. Integrity can be attested to by

witnesses other than the nominee. Even the presence or

absence of a "judicial temperament" might be deduced by
182

observation of a nominee testifying on subjects that are

general and in no way sensitive. Yet unless the nominee

has a long prior record of writings, speeches, and/or

lower court opinions on constitutional issues  a condition

met by many Supreme Court nominees, but not by Judge O'Connor ·

the advice and consent hearings constitute the only forum

in which Senators can learn of the nominee's philosophy.

It should also be observed that useful knowledge about

questions of constitutional law will rarely be gained except

through specific answers to specific questions, usually about

actual or hypothetical cases. Almost all Supreme Court

nominees have testified that they are "strict constructionists'

who believe courts should always "interpret the Constitution"

and never "make law." Justice Blackmun, for instance,

testified at his confirmation hearings that

          I personally feel that the Constitution is a
         document of specified words and construction.
          I would do my best not to have my decision affected
         by my personal ideas and philosophy, but would
         attempt to construe that instrument in the light
         of what I feel is its definite and determined
         meaning.

Several years later Justice Blackmun wrote the Court's

opinion in Roe v. Wade, supra, which is generally regarded

as among the most extreme examples of judicial preference
                                                    o

for "personal ideas and philsophy" over textual and

historical sources of constitutional law. Justice Fortas,

a Warren Court member generally regarded as a "liberal,"

was asked to what extent he believed "the Court should attempt

to bring about social and economic changes," to which he
                                                                10

responded, "Zero, absolutely zero." Professor L.A. Powe
of the University of Texas Law School concludes that "Senate

questioning has proved astonishingly ineffective in eliciting

the desired information. Questions can always be answered

less specifically than desired. . . . If the questions were
                        183

inartfully drawn and left room for maneuvering, one can

fault the senators, but the nominees understood the purposes

of the questions  their responses simply were not designed

to assist the Senate."

Labels can be misleading. A judicial nominee might

sincerely consider himself a "strict constructionist" and

yet believe that the Constitution guarantees rights to

abortion, racial balance in the public schools by means of

mandatory busing, and other things that an equally conscientious

Senator might regard as evidence that the nominee is reading

his own social, political and economic views into the

Con stitution. By the same token, a self-styled "progressive"

nominee might believe in a "living Constitution" yet be

convinced that the Constitution does not forbid the states

from operating segregated schools. If the nominee has a

duty not to discuss specific doctrines  and specific past

Supreme Court cases, which are the building blocks of doctrines --

then he has a duty not to provide the Senate with more than

labels and slogans. These will not help, and may actually

obstruct, Senators in performance of their duty to advise

and consent only to nominees whose views they believe to be

consistent with the Constitution.

III. Statements at Confirmation Hearings as Bases for
          Disqualification or as Evidence of Prejudice

           A nominee's discussion of questions of constitutional
law at confirmation hearings, outside the context of specific
pending cases, is not a proper basis for his disqualification
from cases involving these questions that come before the
Court after his confirmation. Nor should such discussion
be viewed as evidence that the nominee will not honestly
and impartially decide future cases.

         The statute governing disqualification of Supreme
Court Justices is 28 USC § 455, which provides:
                                       184

               Any Justice or judge of the United States shall
          disqualify himself in any case in which he has a
          substantial interest, has been of counsel, is or has
          been a material witness, or is so related to or
          connected with any party or his attorney as to
          render it improper, in his opinion, for him to sit
         on the trial, or appeal, or other proceeding therein.

          In the case of Laird v. Tatum, 409 U.S. 824 (1972),

respondents had urged Justice Rehnquist to disqualify

himself. One ground for the proposed disqualification was

that prior to his nomination as a Supreme Court Justice

he had publicly spoken about the constitutional issues that

were raised in the case. After noting that the statute

did not seem to require disqualification on the ground that

the Justice had made public statements, Justice Rehnquist

stated that public statements about the case itself might

constitute a discretionary ground for disqualification, but

he sharply distinguished public statements about what the

Constitution provides, outside the context of the specific
case on which disqualification is demanded. Rehnquist1 s history

of the modern Court's attitude toward public statements

by Justices disposes of the argument that such statements

are grounds for disqualification:

   My impression is that none ot       hearings on the subject of the bill

since 1911 have followed a practice    and presented the favorable report

reason. See, e.g., the opinion of Mr. qualification.1*

              Since a Justice has discretion to disqualify h'-se^t

     whenever his past association with a case would rake

     it improper for him to sit on the case, the consistent

     refusal of Justices to disqualify themselves in areas

     where they had previously expressed their views on the

     law strongly suggests that these Justices did not regard

     such statements as evidence of prejudice. If a statement

     prior to nomination would not constitute prejudice, then

neither would the same statement made after nomination but

     before confirmation -- nor, for that matter, a statement

     about an abstract question of constitutional law or about

     a past Supreme Court case by a sitting Justice. As Justice

     Rehnquist concluded in Laird, supra;

                   The oath . . . taken by each person upon
              becoming a member of the federal judiciary
              requires that he "administer justice without
              respect to persons, and do equal right to the
              poor and to the rich," that he "faithfully
              and impartially discharge and perform all
             .the duties incumbent upon [him] . . . agreeably
              to the Constitution and laws of the United
              States." Every litigant is entitled to
             have his case heard by a judge mindful of this
             oath. But neither the oath, the disqualification
              statute, nor the practice of the former Justices
             of this Court guarantee a litigant that each
              judge will start off from dead center in his
             willingness or ability to reconcile the opposing
             arguments of counsel with his understanding
             of the Constitution and the law.

     409 U.S. at 838-39.

             The most persuasive argument against discussion of

    specific questions of constitutional law by nominees at

    confirmation hearings is not that this will prejudice their

    decisions in future cases, but that they will be tempted

    to alter their positions in order to facilitate confirmation,

    or that the public will perceive such trimming even if it

    does not actually occur. Indeed, Justice Rehnquist added a

    footnote in his Laird opinion expressing this concern:
                               189

       In terms of propriety rather than disqualification,
 I would distinguish quite sharply between a public
 statement made prior to nomination for the bench on
 the one hand, and a public statement made by a
 nominee to the bench. For the latter to express
 any but the most general observation, about the
law would suggest that, in order to obtain favorable
 consideration of his nomination, he deliberately was
 announcing in advance, without benefit of judicial
 oath, briefs, or argument, how he would decide a
 particular question that might come before him as a
 judge.

409 U.S. at 836 n.5. This statement is in direct conflict

with the sentiments expressed in Rehnquist's 1959 article

on the need to "inquire of men on their way to the Supreme

Court something of their views on these questions," but it

is not unpersuasive. Indeed, if it were not so important

that Senators have the necessary information with which to

comply fully with their duty to advise and consent to Supreme

Court nominations, Rehnquist's concern about the appearance
of impropriety might be dispositive. If, however, a way can
be found for the nominee to share relevant information with
the Senate without giving rise to a suspicion of bribery

or blackmail, then the duty to cast an intelligent vote

on the nomination  and the nominee's duty to assist

Senators in casting such votes by answering candidly all

relevant and proper questions  become paramount.

The tension between the Senators' and the nominee's

respective duties can be resolved, first, by a good faith

effort to understand each other's problems. Such understanding

would entail a mutual recognition that a candid discussion

of a question of constitutional law at a confirmation hearing

is not a promise to vote a certain way. This is true

precisely because of the judicial oath cited by Justice

Rehnquist in his Laird opinion. A Supreme Court Justice

promises to consider all arguments raised by counsel in

briefs and oral arguments in all the cases that will come

before him. There is also the prospect of collegial
             190

decision-making, and of the changes that time, experience
and study can effect in any person's attitudes and beliefs.
Insofar as a statement that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided
o r B r o w n v. Board of Education rightly decided is not given
or taken as a promise of a vote in all future cases on abortion
or civil rights, the spectres of bribery and blackmail are
banished. Nor is it too much to expect of our Supreme
Court nominees enough integrity to resist the temptation
actually to change their views, or to pretend such a change,
in order to secure confirmation.

         Even with the best of faith, some questions will go
too far. It is improper for a nominee to comment on a

specific pending case, because here the appearance of

impropriety  the possibility that expectations will

be raised which the Justice will be reluctant to disappoint,
and consequently the Justice's unwillingness to give full

consideration to a specific set of briefs and oral arguments
is far greater than in a case where a Felix Frankfurther
happens to sit in a labor case or a Thurgood Marshall in
a civil rights case. For the same reason, a hypothetical

question that is too similar to a case now pending before

the Court, or likely to come before it soon, would be

unacceptable. Insofar as actual prejudice can be avoided,

however, the prospect of improper appearances must be

balanced against the need of the Senate for information

on which to base the exercise of its constitutional duty.
The balance must be struck in such a way as to leave rhe

nominee free to discuss leading Supreme Court cases such
as Brown and Roe, without which an intelligent discussion of the

fundamental problems of constitutional law is impossible;
in such a way as to leave Senators with something more

than resumes and slogans as a basis for their decision.

 IV. An Illustrative History of Advice and Consent Hearings

          For the last two decades the confirmation hearings
          have evinced persistent Senate questioning of witnesses
          about their beliefs on stare decisis, specific past
          decisions of the Court, and their probable votes
          in certain types of potential cases. The senators
         who ask such questions have a simple position
         given the importance of the Supreme Court and a
          nominee's lifetime appointment, the Senate needs
          all relevant facts in order to make informed decisions.
         As Senator Ervin has stated, if the Senate "ought not
          to be permitted to find out what his attitude is toward
          the Constitution, or what his philosophy is," then
          "I don't see why the Constitution was so foolish as to
          suggest that the nominee for the Supreme Court ought
          to be confirmed by the Senate. Just give them [the
         Executive] absolute power in the first place."

         The history of Senate confirmation hearings reveals a

wide range of attitudes toward the proper scope of questioning,

with the attitudes of Senators ranging from Senator Ervin's

view to that expressed by Senator Hart, who in Justice

Fortas's nomination to the Chief Justiceship urged his

colleagues not to ask questions that went beyond the past

written statements of the nominee. Likewise the

nominees have varied in their attitudes: Justice Minton

refused to appear before the committee on the ground

that "I might be required to express my views on highly

controversial and litigious issues affecting the Court,"

whereas Justice Blackmun predicted that he would vote to uphold the

death penalty except in cases where a state imposed it for

a pedestrian crossing against a red light.

         The closest thing to an "official" position that

has emerged from the hearings was a ruling made by Chairman

Eastland during the Stewart hearings. Senator Hennings

raised a point of order suggesting that it was improper to

question the nominee on his "opinion as to any of the decisions

or the reasoning upon decisions . . . heretofore . . . handed

down by that court." Senator Eastland ruled that Senators

could ask any questions they liked, but that the nominee

was free to decline to answer any questions he thought
                        192

improper. Senator Hennings withdrew his point of order

after several Senators had indicated their support for the

Eastland ruling. Since the Eastland ruling seems only to

state the obvious       that no Senator will be prevented from

asking any question he likes, and no attempt will be made to

force a nominee to answer a question if he prefers not to

it is of little value as authority on what questions and

answers are proper.

The most common pattern in confirmation hearings at

which nominees appeared personally was for the nominee to

express reservations about discussing specific past Supreme

Court cases, and to decline to answer some questions on

this basis, but subsequently to answer others. The following

exchanges are typical:

Senator Ervin. . . . And if the Constitution means
the things that were announced in the opinions handed
down on May 20, 1968, why one of the smart judges
who served on the Supreme Court during the preceding
178 years did not discover it?

Justice Fortas. Senator, again, much as I would like

to discuss this, I am inhibited from doing it. I

respectfully note, if I may, sir, that the granddaddy

of all these cases, in my judgment . . . was the famous

Scottsboro case. It was in that case that Mr. Justice

Sutherland said that the critical period in a criminal

prosecution was from arraignment to trial  arraignment

to trial. I think that can fairly be characterized as

dictum. But it was that statement that I think has been

sort of the granddaddy of all this.

     Now here I have done something I should not have done.
I am sorry, sir.

Senator Mathias. . . . Now, I am wondering if, No. 1,
you think these cases should be overruled?

Mr. Powell. I would think perhaps, Senator Mathias,
it would be unwise for me to answer that question
directly. . . . Indeed on the facts in Escobido, I
think, the Court decided the case, plainly correctly,
but our concern was with respect to the scope of the
opinion rather than with the precise decision..Q

Mr. Rehnquist. Well, I certainly understand your
                                      193

         interest, Senator. The expression of a view of a
         nominee on the constitutionality of a measure pending
         in Congress, I feel the nominee simply cannot answer.

         Mr. Rehnquist. Let me answer it this way: To me,
         the question of Congress1 authority to cut off the
         funds under the appropriation power of the first
         amendment is so clear that I have no hesitancy in
         saying so, because I do not regard that as a debatable
         constitutional question.

         Mr. Rehnquist. Well, I suppose one is entitled to
         take into account the fact that public education in
         1954 is a much more significant institution in our
         society than it was in 1896. That is not to say that
         that means that the framers of the 14th amendment may
         have meant one thing but now we change that, but just
         that the rather broad language they used now has a
         somewhat different application based on new
         development in our society.

         Senator Bayh. . . . Let me ask you this: Do you feel
         that busing is a reasonable tool or a worthy tool or
         that it is a useful instrument in accomplishing equal
         educational opportunities, quality education for all
         citizens?

         Mr. Rehnquist. I have felt obligated to respond with my
         personal views on busing because of the letter which I
         wrote and I have done so with a good deal of reluctance
         because of the fact that obviously busing has been
         and is still a question of constitutional dimension in
         view of some of the Supreme Court decisions, and I am loath
         to expand on what I have previously said.

              My personal opinion is that I remain of the same view
         as to busing over long distances. The idea of transporting
         people by bus in the interest of quality education is
         certainly something I would feel I would want to consider
         all the factors involved in. I think that is a legislative,
         or at least a local school board, type of decision. j_g

         Just as some nominees expressed a narrow view of what

questions they could properly answer and then tended to

answer rather more questions than they had intended, others

stated a relatively broad view and then answered fewer questions

than their general statement seemed to justify. For instance,

Justice Marshall repeatedly said that he was refusing to

answer only those questions that he actually expected to come

before the Court soon, not just those that might conceivably

come before the Court, and he indicated his willingness

"to discuss the fifth amendment and to look it up against
                                      194

the recent decisions of the'Supreme Court," but he found
                                                                                 20

reason to object to most specific questions.
          It should also be noted that some judges who refused

 to answer questions did so on a narrow ground. Brennan and
 Stewart had both received recess appointments, and declined
 to comment on cases on the grounds that they were sitting
 Justices. Fortas, a sitting Justice during the hearings on
his nomination to be Chief Justice, also declined on this

             11
ground. Harlan observed that he realized the Senators
had a problem, but that his record was well known and that
the Senators should vote on the basis of what they knew
about him. Frankfurter, who also declined to answer specific
questions, also had a voluminous public record on a wide
range of constitutional issues.

         One issue that almost all nominees felt comfortable
discussing was the doctrine of stare decisis. Although a
nominee's views on stare decisis are at least as valuable
an indicator of his votes on future cases as are his views
on specific past Court decisions, no nominee objected to
discussing the doctrine on the ground that it might prejudice
his decision in some future case, and nominees including
Brennan, Fortas, Marshall and Rehnquist discussed the
doctrine and its application to constitutional law.

         Most of the questions and answers in confirmation
hearings, however, have been in the unhelpful rhetorical
mode. Nominees have assured the committee that they are
strict constructionists who believe that the Court must
"interpret the Constitution" and never "make law" or
"amend the Constitution." Brennan, Marshall, Fortas and
Blackmun are among these adherents of the intentions of
the Framers. Only Haynsworth and Carswell seemed to have
                    195

any use for the "living Constitution."

               Finally, it is worth noting that at least one

"single issue" dominated a number of the confirmation

hearings. Race      as a social and political issue

and also as a constitutional matter     was prominent in the

Stewart, Haynsworth, Carswell and Rehnquist hearings. Indeed,

two of the three nominees rejected during this century,

Carswell and Jono J-Parker, were defeated partly because of

racist campaign speeches made during pre-judicial political

careers. The other issue on which Carswell was attacked

was mediocrity, while Parker, an outstanding judge, was

attacked for the constitutional and political dimensions of

a decision he had written upholding an injunction against

violating a "yellow dog" anti-union contract. Rehnquist was

asked about his personal opposition some years earlier to

a local open-housing ordinance and about his activities as

a pollwatcher allegedly discouraging black persons from

voting; he and almost all nominees after 1954 were asked numerous

questions about Brown and its progeny. Thus if Judge O'Connor

were asked about her voting record in the."state legislature

on abortion and related issues, about her position on Roe

v. Wade, and about the relationship between her personal,

political and constitutional views on the abortion issue, it

would hardly be an unprecedented attempt to ferret out discrete

elements of a nominee's "whole lifeview" and "sense, sharp or vague,

of where justice lies in respect of the great questions of his

time. «- ·  »  Zlf

   Senator EAST. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mrs. O'Connor, I welcome you back again.
  I bumped into you briefly a few moments ago over in the Senate
building, and we are back in here again. It is a pleasure to be with
you.
  Time presses upon us. I would like, in the 15 minutes that I
have, to commence by picking up a loose end we were talking
about when time cut me off yesterday. If I might, please, I would
just very briefly here review the bidding.
  I had focused--it is true--upon this issue of abortion. It is of
course an important public issue in its own right, but I think one
could pick other issues dealing with race relations, rights of
women, the death penalty, and so on and so forth, to allow us some
way or other in microcosm to get at this question of judicial philos-
ophy and basic personal values on fundamental issues of the day.
  As I understood your position yesterday on this matter of abor-
tion--you of course have repeated since then--you are personally
opposed to it, except in extraordinary circumstances, as a general
policy of birth control. You were negative on it, as I understood
your position.
  I then turned to the question of how one might approach it in
dealing with it in the public arena as a matter of public policy. As
I understood your position there, you said you thought it was very
much a legislative type of function.
  I do not wish to put words in your mouth. Please correct me if
you think I am in error here. You thought it also might be looked
on as a State function--at least historically it had been prior to
Roe v. Wade.
  I then turned to Roe v. Wade and asked you what you thought of
this quotation from Justices White and Rehnquist in which they
described the majority opinion as being an improvident and extrav-
agant exercise of the power of judicial review.
  On this matter of Roe v. Wade it is not only important because
of the issue that it dealt with--namely, the abortion issue--but it
is also probably the premier case that many offer in suggesting
that the Supreme Court had gone way beyond any reasonable
conception in its role as an interpreter and applier of the law. As is
said here, it is just an improvident and extravagant exercise of the
power of judicial review that is the legislative function.
  In fact Justice Rehnquist in his own dissent said,

  The decision here to break the term of pregnancy into three distinct terms and to
outline the permissible restrictions the State may impose upon each one partakes
more of judicial legislation than it does of the determination of the intent of the
drafters of the fourteenth amendment

  Just to put the question to you again, as I understand it you do
not wish to comment upon Justice Rehnquist's observations on this
case?

   I think it is particularly intriguing because you and Justice
Rehnquist of course were in law school together, as I understand it,
and were classmates and I presume might even have had the same
teachers for constitutional law. So it adds a bit of heightened
interest to it.

  Again if I might have your response to their observations on this
case?
                                         199

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator East, with all respect, it does seem
inappropriate to me to either endorse or criticize a specific case or
a specific opinion in a case handed down by those judges now
sitting and in a matter which may well be revisited in the Court in
the not too distant future. I have great reluctance to do that.

  I recall the late Justice Harlan who at his confirmation hearing
was asked, much as you have asked, questions about Roe v. Wade.
He was asked his comments and reactions to the then-recent steel
seizure cases.

  His response was that if he were to comment upon cases which
might come before him it would, "raise the gravest kind of question
as to whether I was qualified to sit on that Court."

  More recently the Chief Justice was asked to comment on a
Supreme Court redistricting decision which was subject then to a
great deal of criticism by some Senators. The Chief Justice noted
that:

  I should certainly observe the proprieties by not undertaking to comment on
anything which might come either before the Court on which I now sit or on any
other Court on which I may sit.

  These are things that have concerned others before me and
concern me now.

  Senator EAST. I was noting earlier though, for example, your
willingness in response to a question from Senator Metzenbaum
about Baker v. Carr. You said that you were concerned about that
case at that time, which I gather meant you had reservations about
it.

  I might for example inquire: Were you concerned about Roe v.
Wade at that time?

  Is there a tendency here to be selective in terms of which cases
or doctrines you will or will not comment on; or, I guess, quite
specifically, is the reluctance particularly applicable to Roe v.
Wade and the abortion issue?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator East, I am trying not to be selective in
those matters to which I am willing to react, if you will. Certain
things have been rather well decided and are not likely to be
coming back before the Court directly or in any closely related
form on the merits, if you will. With that situation my observation
in the prior transcripts is that there is not the same reluctance
expressed.

  I felt it was a little unlikely, I suppose, that the Court was going
to retreat or reconsider the basic precepts behind Baker v. Carr.

                                              ADVISE AND CONSENT

  Senator EAST. Of course the reapportionment issue, as the death
penalty issue, as the rights of minorities issue, as the rights of
women's issue, as the question of abortion--these things--I am
simply probing--do they not constantly recur?

  Let me restate it. If you are arguing that a prospective Supreme
Court nominee cannot indicate particular values or sentiments on
prominent issues of the time--if I might shift the focus of this to
the whole problem of the Constitution and separation of power--it
seems to me the confirmation process becomes almost meaningless;
it simply means it is reduced to ceremony and resumes.
                                                  200

   I do not, for heavens' sakes, wish this to be understood in terms
of any personal reflection upon you because you have done an
outstanding job. I am concerned as a Senator, as I look at the
concept of separation of power, where we are supposed to be a part
of this process of appointment to the Supreme Court. The President
nominates, and we are supposed to advise and consent.

   If in our fulfilling that obligation which the framers gave to us
we are forbidden to get real substantive comment on issues of
consequence--for example, previous doctrines and cases--I dare
say we set a precedent--potentially, do we not?--whereby we
cannot really fulfill any meaningful constitutional obligation;
hence, we might suspense with it.

   It is frustrating, as a Senator, because the Senate and the Con-
gress are trying, I feel, in so many ways to reassert their policy-
making function which many feel has been eclipsed by the bu-
reaucracy under the direction of the executive branch or frequently
by the Supreme Court and the judiciary.

   We are given a few tools in the Constitution to try to assert our
check and balance in separation of power. One of those is to be a
part of the confirmation process. We have clearly that check or
balance under the Constitution, but if we are forbidden by our own
practices or those insisted upon by nominees, I query whether that
formal and fundamental check and balance--and probably the
most fundamental one we have in the appointment process--is not
negated and eliminated simply because questions cannot be asked
in a fairly thorough and substantive way.

   I can appreciate you cannot promise anything; I can appreciate
you could not comment upon pending cases; but when we are told
that there cannot be comment upon previous cases and previous
doctrines of substance, I query as one lowly freshman Senator
whether we are able really to get our teeth into anything.

   We are setting a precedent here. It has been noted that half of us
have never been in on this process before, and you are probably the
first of a number we are going to have coming up down the road
with President Reagan.

   I would hope that the Senate and the Judiciary Committee would
set the precedent for confirmations of substance and depth and
meaning.

   You have certainly been an outstanding witness; there is no
question about that. I probe it not in a personal way; I probe it in a
constitutional sense as to whether we the Senators are really going
to be in a position to make a substantive judgment.

   I appreciate your candor in Roe v. Wade, and I certainly respect
your judgment and your unwillingness to pursue it in greater
depth. I do not wish to belabor the obvious, and so I will let the
issue of Roe v. Wade rest because you have clearly indicated your
reluctance to get into the specifics of it.

   If I might please, Mrs. O'Connor, let me shift to one other
point--time moves on--a different area beyond Roe v. Wade, but it
relates to the check and balance that the Congress has upon the
Supreme Court and the Federal judiciary. This is the question that
Senator Specter so properly raised this morning on the question of
jurisdiction under article 3.
                                         201

  Under article 3 of the Constitution, as you are well aware, there
is the language dealing with this question of the appellate jurisdic-
tion of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  We are told that, "the Supreme Court shall have appellate juris-
diction both as to law and to fact with such exceptions and under
such regulations as the Congress shall make." That is very explicit
language to me, indicating that we do have that check or balance
to set the limits, great or small, of the Supreme Court's appellate
jurisdiction. You were noting that article 3.

  Then the question was: Do we have any Supreme Court prece-
dent on it? You noted ex parte McCardle.

   I was interested in your comment. You said, "This is all we have;
we don't have much to look at."

   I would query, Mrs. O'Connor. We have an express provision in
the Constitution. We have a Supreme Court decision that expressly
upholds it. I would say that is a great deal to look at. That is about
as convincing as one might make the case if stare decisis, prece-
dent, and express language mean anything.

   Am I correct in understanding your position that this is a very
open, clouded issue whether the Congress has the power to deal
with the question of the appellate jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme
Court? Do you think that is very much an up-in-the-air question?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator East, only in the sense that we do not
have experience as yet in the area of the Congress having actually
passed legislation which becomes law and which says, for instance,
the U.S. Supreme Court shall have no further jurisdiction over any
question relating to, let us say, busing of schoolchildren. We have
not had that kind of legislation enacted, and therefore no test, if
you will, of the validity of that.

   When I said that it was an open question I think I referred to
the fact that a number of constitutional scholars have written
articles on that very question simply because there are so many
proposals now pending in the Congress to limit the appellate juris-
diction of the Supreme Court and also jurisdiction of the lower
Federal courts in a variety of areas. So the subject has become one
of interest.

   I did point out that some believe that ex parte McCardle was
perhaps not the complete answer to all questions which might
potentially arise without power to be exercised in some fashion by
the Congress. So I suppose in that sense we would logically expect
that such an enactment could be questioned.

   Ex parte McCardle is the case which was decided on a specific
enactment of Congress repealing appellate court jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court in that instance of any habeas corpus holdings of
the lower courts. That simply is all that we have on that area.

   If I might go back to your previous question for one moment to
make one comment I would appreciate it. That is, in trying to draw
the line on past cases where you feel comfortable in making com-
ments as a nominee and those which you do not, I am simply
aware in this instance that there are a number of people who have
urged and continue to urge that the Roe v. Wade case--those who
believe it was incorrectly decided who urge that the matter should
be brought back before the Court at the earlier date and the Court
                                                    202

should be asked to consider again that question or questions relat-
ed closely to it.

   I think that it does fall in a category for that reason of concern
as opposed to those cases where we are not hearing that kind of an
approach.

   Senator EAST. Mrs. O'Connor, on that point, every fundamental
constitutional question is never fully resolved; it is always recur-
ring, in whatever field it is. I see what you are saying, and I
respect your judgment on it. I just respectfully disagree in that
questions are always recurring, being reexamined, and redefined.

   I do not see anything that is unique about this one as opposed to
the others because they too shall be coming back, and I suspect this
one will be coming back for an indefinite period of time.

   But, again, I thank you for your courtesy and responsiveness.
   Mr. Chairman, I have run out my time.
   The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished Senator from Montana, Mr.
Baucus.
   Senator BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Judge O'Connor, I think it would be helpful if we pursued the
same issue a little further.
   It is my understanding that subsequent to the McCardle case the
Kline case was decided which held that the Congress cannot limit
Supreme Court jurisdiction in order to achieve a certain result.
   Not only are there various constitutional scholars who come
down on different sides, but the case law here is a bit confused, too.
Is that not the case?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Baucus, you are correct. I think ap-
proximately 4 years after ex parte McCardle we had the case in
1872 of United States v. Kline.
   I believe--I am not certain--that case involved a removal of
jurisdiction at a lower Federal court level and was not directly
related to the appellate jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court. I
could be wrong, but that is my recollection.

  The case involved a matter which was then pending involving a
litigant in the lower Federal court who had obtained a Presidential
pardon for^disloyalty in the Civil War, and he had a claim which
was being made which he was entitled to make based on the
Presidential pardon.

  The Congress passed a law which in effect directed the court to
dismiss the lawsuit of any person who had obtained a Presidential
pardon for disloyalty in the Civil War. It was directed of course at
that precise lawsuit, and the Supreme Court did hold that that
action by Congress, which was directed toward resolving a particu-
lar case, was invalid.

   Senator BAUCUS. Yesterday when we discussed this same issue I
asked you as a matter of public policy how far you felt Congress
should go in limiting Supreme Court review of constitutional ques-
tions. You appropriately did not give a definitive answer to that
question.

   Nevertheless, I was left with the impression that you had certain
problems with limiting Supreme Court jurisdiction because you
cited a vote that you had cast in the Arizona Senate on a related
issue.
                                                  203

  I would like to quote from the minutes of the Arizona State
Senate, which quote you, after your vote in opposition to Senate
Memorial No. 1. This was on February 25, 1970. It substantiates
the point you made to me yesterday.

  I quote--this is you:

  The issue is whether we want to advocate stripping the supreme court of jurisdic-
tion over certain matters because we disagree with some of its decisions. I too
disagree with certain United States Supreme Court decisions in the field of pornog-
raphy and obscenity, but I cannot advocate limiting the Court's appellate jurisdic-
tion. Once we start such a procedure, where do we stop?

  My question is whether you still subscribe to that view.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Baucus, I was of course speaking as a
legislator in 1970, and I do not want to be put in the position of
suggesting to other legislators how they should view the situation
today.
  But that certainly was my expression at that time in regard to
the proposal that was before us. I do not think that I would have
retreated from that position thereafter as a legislator.

                                                  SPECIALTY COURTS

   Senator BAUCUS. Turning to another area, because our country is
getting more complex, some have suggested that we create special-
ty courts, particularly specialty courts of appeal--a tax court of
appeals for example; some have suggested an environmental court
of appeals.

   My question to you is what is your general view of the degree to
which Congress should set up specialty courts of appeals as opposed
to letting the circuit courts of appeals and the Supreme Court
handle complicated and arcane issues as generalist judges.

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Baucus, Senator DeConcini was really
addressing some of the same questions with me this afternoon.

   I do not know that I have a clear picture in my own mind of
precisely how such courts would work. I think the Congress is now
in a position to evaluate the bankruptcy court structure that it has
established--and that certainly is a specialty court in a sense--and
can determine whether the enhanced jurisdiction that has been
given to that bankruptcy court will work well in that specialized
area. If it does and if people generally are satisfied, then perhaps it
can be considered in some other areas.

   Senator BAUCUS. I am wondering though, as an appellate court
judge, what guidance you might give us. Do you think it is good
public policy to move in the direction of setting up specialized
courts; or is it better public policy for appellate court judges as
generalists to hear cases arising from different directions?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Baucus, as an appellate court judge, I
have personally valued the opportunity to deal with a wide range
of cases and issues. I have been happier in my work, if you will,
just as a personal matter, to have the opportunity to deal with a
broader range of issues.

   What we really want to know is what best serves the public
generally--what is going to make the court system work best and
not what pleases the appellate court judges.

   Senator BAUCUS. That is correct.

    87-101 O--81 14
                                               204

  Judge O'CONNOR. In that regard I think we have to develop a
little experience before we can say that it is appropriate to go off in
a certain area.

  It is conceivable to me that in some areas they are so completely
specialized that it is not totally inappropriate to at least consider
it--conceivably in the tax or patent area, for example--but do we
need ultimately some avenue back into the general court system
for some final review from that specialized first treatment? These
are the questions that need to be evaluated, I think.

                                 REDUCTION OF VIOLENT CRIME

  Senator BAUCUS. AS you know, this committee and the Congress
have been asked by the President to take up a major crime pack-
age. On that agenda are many items including the death penalty,
sentencing reform, bail reform, preventive detention, elimination of
the exclusionary rule, and a massive program to build more pris-
ons.

  Based upon your experience as a jurist, a legislator, a mother, or
as a citizen, tell us how you think we should go about addressing
the problem of violent crime. In which of these areas do you think
we should spend most of our time and attention?

  How much do you think we should devote resources to rehabilita-
tion? Or is that passe? Should we spend time on enacting tougher
longer sentences?

  I am just curious as to what your general philosophy is toward
violent crime and how we reduce violent crime.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Baucus, I wish I had a ready and an
easy answer, because I think the problem is of enormous signifi-
cance to us as a people and as a nation. I think it is of grave
concern to our citizens, and certainly it is to me.

  My experience with the criminal justice system has resulted in
some disappointments in the lack of effectiveness; the recidivism
rate is extremely high, and the crime rate generally is extremely
high. We have to ask why.

  It is a question that I have asked myself many times, and I think
it is partially a result and factor of a general breakdown, if you
will, of the standards that we apply in our society to moral behav-
ior. I truly believe that.

  Whether there is some legislative remedy to that I question. It is
a matter that has to concern every one of us, and we have to
attempt in every way we can to set standards that will discourage
criminal behavior.

  It seems to me that we are a mobile society, we are no longer a
rural society, and we live big cities, our neighbors do not know us,
and we do not know our neighbors. We do not have extended
families living together, and so the pressure that comes from peer
pressure, if you will, to behave in certain acceptable ways no
longer exists for most people in our Nation. I think these things
contribute, frankly, to the crime problem.

  I also believe that our ready access, at least in the Southwest, to
the drug traffic has contributed heavily to the crime problem in
those Western States. It has been a very serious matter, and if
there were some way to spend a little more effort and control in
                                               205

the problem of traffic in heavy narcotic drugs I think it would be
time and effort well spent.

  If there is a way to provide more prison space, it is evident that
there is a great need for that at both the State and the Federal
level. We simply have more population, we have high crime rates,
we have people who are being sentenced, and there is no space for
them.

  In Arizona, for example, we have a State prison sentence that
the legislature has devised as a sentencing structure that was
intended to be very specific for the judges. Certain crimes would
have certain fixed sentences imposed.

  We are so short of prison space in Arizona that a 5-year sentence
that is imposed by the judge might result in a release within 3
months because there is no room at the prison. That kind of system
is not effective.

  So there are many means, and I think we need to approach them
on a broad front. I wish I had some easy answers, but I do not
think I do.

  Senator BAUCUS. Frankly, I commend you on your answer be-
cause I think it is very complex and there is no simple solution.
For example, I think that the building of prisons or lengthening of
sentences alone is not the answer. It is a very complicated problem.

  It reminds me of something that H. L. Mencken once said, "For
every complicated problem there is a simple solution, and it's usu-
ally wrong." We have to exercise every effort at our command to
try to resolve it, but it is going to be a complicated and a very
difficult effort.

  As a westerner I know you are very aware of some of the
resource conflicts that are emerging in our country. The West has
a lot of coal; oil and gas development is a potentially promising
source of energy for our country; oil shale is developing in the
West.

  As I am sure you know, the Western States also are trying to
protect their own resources. They have enacted severance taxes to
compensate for the costs of development, including the disruptions
and dislocations that might occur in those States.

  As energy becomes more desired in our country, there is a great-
er potential for more conflict between Eastern States and Western
States--the producing States in the West and the consuming States
in the East.

  I am curious as to how you see the tension resolving itself and
the degree to which you think the 10th amendment will have any
meaning as these cases arise.

  The Supreme Court, as you may know, not too long ago held that
Montana, for example, properly imposed a severance tax on coal
that is mined in the State of Montana. The court held that the
commerce clause did not prevent the State from imposing such a
tax.

  How do you see the Federal-State tensions moving, and what
guidance would you give us in trying to help resolve that?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Baucus, I do not think I can give the
Congress any particular guidance in that area. These are matters
as far as the Congress is concerned that affect very directly the
                                               206

State and Federal relationship. So these issues will be debated fully
here and explored from a policy standpoint.

  With regard to the 10th amendment, to the extent that the
regulations I suppose are directed or the Federal statutes, if you
will, are directed toward the activities of private business as op-
posed to the activities of the States as States, the most recent
pronouncements indicate that the 10th amendment would not be
considered as a bar.

  So I do not know that we can look to that for guidance in the
extent to which the Federal Government is properly regulating
activity of private business within the States in this developing
field.

  Senator BAUCUS. I guess my question really is what you see in
the Constitution that enables States to control the development of
their own resources as opposed to provisions in the Constitution
which allow the Congress to limit State control over resource devel-
opment. Unfortunately my time is up, so we cannot pursue this
any longer.

  I want to close, though, by saying that this is probably the last
time you and I are going to have to chat publicly over these
matters. I think you have been an excellent witness.

  There is a possibility that you may reappear later after the other
witnesses. That has not been finally determined, but in all prob-
ability you will not return.

  I frankly want to praise you and tell you that I think you have
done very, very well. I wish we had more opportunity to discuss
more substantively some of the issues that are coming before the
Court.

  I understand your reluctance to get into some of these matters in
great detail. I agree that you should not discuss them publicly
more than you have. Your restraint in addressing these questions
has caused my admiration for you to increase rather than decrease.

  Further, I think it is in large respect your personal views on
substantive issues is less important than your competence and your
integrity. You have certainly demonstrated the highest integrity
and the highest competence in your testimony before us.

  I just want to wish you the very best of luck. You are going to
have to bear heavy responsibility on the Court. In many ways I
envy you. We all send our best wishes with you. Thank you.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you very much, Senator Baucus.
  Senator BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grass-
ley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge O'Connor, since I tend to look so seri-
ous whenever I ask questions I would like to spend just a few
minutes being philosophical and commenting in much the same
vein as my predecessor, Senator Baucus, has just done.
  This may be the last time you and I will have conversations
unless, for instance, you would be nominated for Chief Justice
some day and come back before the committee.
  As I think about the things that I would hope for you, I have to
think about the first thing you said to me when we met privately
in my office. I was very relieved to have you say it and open up the
conversation in that way. You said something to me like, "And
                                                       207

you're a farmer, too." You then went into a discussion of your
background, having obviously done your homework about what
Chuck Grassley was all about.

  That did not mean so much at the time, until I was later visiting
with somebody in my home State who said things that were com-
plimentary about you. Although the way I repeat them they may
not come out that way, they are intended to be complimentary.

   As he was trying to explore with me whether or not you ought to
be confirmed--and it was his opinion you should be--he too had
read something about your rural background, and that you had
worked your way through the legal system and the political system
to become what you are today.

   He looked upon your appointment as a breath of fresh air. His
understanding of your background had a great deal to do with his
looking sympathetically and approvingly at your nomination.

   I think the implication was that here you are, a person who has
been successful, you have come from a rural State with a rural
background, and people who have that sort of background cannot
be all bad--in fact, your having a rural background could bring a
dimension to the Supreme Court that was refreshing to him.

   I put together what he said with what you first said to me, and
realized that there is something very personal about you, brought
out in meetings like this, that cannot help but impress us very
much.

   I say this now because I am always one to ask questions, never
having time at the end of a 15-minute interval for these kinds of
comments.

   At any rate, this is the way that I have looked at you in the 6
weeks or 2 months that I have had an opportunity to know about
you and read about you.

                                           LEGISLATIVE VETO

   Now I would like to ask you a question that would follow up on
what I believe Senator Dole brought up. He was getting into a
philosphical discussion with you about whether or not administra-
tive agencies had been delegated too much power by the Congress
and the extent to which that delegation ought to be reviewed, and
further controlled by Congress.

   I would like to ask you somewhat the same question that I asked
you in our private conversations in my office--how you look at the
whole subject of congressional veto or whatever terminology you
might want to use--the whole process by which Congress could
have some sort of check on the administrative agencies as a follow-
up of the delegation of legislative authority, and not as a congres-
sional control over administrative decisions that are constitutional-
ly within the realm of the President. I think that that is a differen-
tiation that we must make.

   I would like to have your opinion on congressional control or
review over the delegation of a legislative authority.

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Grassley, I know that that is a topic of
great interest presently in the Congress. Several proposals are
being made for a legislative veto in one form or another.
                                             208

  These proposals are being aired in various forms at the State
level also. I understand they have actually been adopted in a
number of States in one form or another.

  I had no experience in Arizona with a legislative veto, if you will,
because during my years there no such proposal was adopted. So I
have had no personal experience at all with it.

  As it has been discussed and considered in the Congress some
have expressed concern about the separation of powers concept and
the extent to which Congress should have veto power, if you will,
over administrative agency regulations after those regulations have
been adopted.

  These are really unanswered questions in two ways: One, the
Congress has not adopted such a provision yet really; and, two, the
courts have not had a chance to review them in respect to the
allegation of separation of powers.

  It strikes me that Congress has a very effective power irrespec-
tive of any legislative veto provision that it might want to adopt,
and that is the power to take a look at the administrative regula-
tions which the particular agency has adopted, and if Congress
feels that that agency has gone beyond the scope of the intended
authority of Congress, Congress has the power to directly legislate
in such a fashion as to make clear that it was not intended to have
that power and to effectively by direct enactment curtail that kind
of power. So I assume that that is a very direct means which
Congress can also use.

  Senator GRASSLEY. That would not be included in one of the
instruments though because that is just a natural response and
obviously a constitutional response.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Legislation amending existing statutes would
be the sort of instrument--and I use that term very generally--
that would be considered and is being considered by the Congress.
  How would you view something beyond what we know and un-
derstand we can do presently under the Constitution?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Grassley, I wish I could give you a
more definitive response, but my experience with it is limited, and
I do not believe the court has had a chance to rule on it, so I
cannot speak from that viewpoint.
  I assume that a lot of questions are being addressed by the
Congress as they consider these proposals. For instance, if the
reviewing body is less than the entire body of Congress; if it is
confined for instance to a designated group within one branch--
either the Senate or the House--then you run into questions of
bicamerality.
  Senator GRASSLEY. That is true.
  Judge O'CONNOR. If it is less than a whole body, what do you do
with that?
  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU do not need to go into those details.
Maybe I can make it easier for you by asking if there is anything
in the concept that you find abhorrent to you personally from your
legal experience, from your being a legislator, or as you have an
understanding of the Constitution today.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Grassley, I would only say that there
may be basic issues of separation of powers involved in a particular
                                         209

enactment, but I would certainly want to look at the particular
enactment that was produced before formulating any conclusion
and would also want to have the benefit of briefs, arguments, and
discussion.

  Senator GRASSLEY. On another point--and this again has been
asked by one or two other Members but not quite in the way that I
am asking it--the Court has recently required that the plaintiffs in
civil rights litigation specifically demonstrate how it is they have
been discriminated against before the burden of proof shifts to the
defendants.

  Previously the plaintiff was only required to make the allegation
of discrimination and then the defendant had to rebut that allega-
tion.

  Would you favor placing a stricter burden on the plaintiff?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Grassley, I do not know that I have
reviewed the decision adequately enough to know precisely what
standards are being employed.
  I would look initially I think at the statutory provision in-
volved--if it is a proceeding under title 7, title 6, or whatever it
is--and determine the intent as expressed by Congress in reviewing
such a matter. Then I would certainly want to look at the prece-
dent established in the cases.
   If the precedent is established as you say quite firmly with
respect to that provision, then that would of course be very signifi-
cant.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Again there has been reference made by sev-
eral members of the committee to the recent Law Review article
that you wrote from the perspective of a State court judge.
   In my reading of that, as I had done previous to my private
meeting with you, I got the impression that you would look favor-
ably upon returning to the State court exclusive jurisdiction in
some matters which involve Federal constitutional questions.
   Is my impression correct, and over what matters do you believe
only State court review is necessary?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Grassley, I do not think I ever ex-
pressed the view that State jurisdiction should be exclusive on
Federal questions. Indeed it cannot be under our constitutional
system. But I did feel that there are many instances in which a full
and fair hearing of a Federal issue can be had at the State level.
   In those instances perhaps we already have seen indications that
when that is the case perhaps the Federal courts will decline the
granting of a further review other than a review to determine
whether there was a full and fair hearing granted at the State
level. Those types of trends seem to me to be healthy.
   Senator GRASSLEY. That was obviously written during your pres-
ent position on the court of appeals. How do you view your consid-
eration of that article and specifically this point now that you are
being considered for the Supreme Court?
   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Grassley, that remains to be seen. I
was asked that question, I think, by someone when I spoke at the
seminar and was asked, "Well, I wonder after years of experience
on a Federal bench if you would view the thing in the same light?"
   I can only say to you that if given that opportunity I would be
happy to report back. [Laughter.]
                                         210

   Senator GRASSLEY. DO you feel your attitude toward the State
court system has been affected by the fact that you became a State
court of appeals judge after having been a State trial judge?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Grassley, I do not think that it altered
my perceptions of the capacity of the State court system to consid-
er certain questions. I would say it reinforced those views.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of
my time.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Senator Denton is next. He had to go to the White House, and so
we have agreed on account of that emergency for him to question
in the morning on his second go-round.
   Senator Specter, we have now reached you.

                                     LENGTHY COURT DELAYS

   Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Judge O'Connor, in light of the hardship on litigants occasioned
by lengthy court delays do you believe it would be useful to limit
the time that appellate courts could take to decide cases, along the
lines of the Federal Speedy Trial Act for criminal cases?
   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, that is a difficult question in
a sense. I am extremely concerned about the length of time that it
takes to get civil litigation concluded.
   Certainly at the appellate level some cases require a great deal
more work and study than others. At the appellate level some
cases take longer time within which to gain a consensus than do
others. This is a natural part of the process, and so a time limit
that would be quite suitable for a run-of-the-mill case for which
there are no unusual difficulties and no unusual disagreement
among the Justices would not pose particular problems. On the
other hand, some other cases could pose problems.

   State legislatures have occasionally addressed this problem.
Indeed, the legislature in Arizona has and has mandated that
judges may not receive their paychecks unless work is completed
within a certain amount of time, granted certain exceptions how-
ever at the appellate level.

   Senator SPECTER. What is the result then of withholding pay?
  Judge O'CONNOR. I do not recall any checks having been with-
held. Whether that is because the work is done or it is not being
enforced I could not tell you.
   Senator SPECTER. IS there any realistic way that the Congress
could act to limit the courts from writing such long opinions?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, I wish there were. I think
that we can do a good job in general with less verbiage. At least
that is my belief. It is my hope that I would be able to do that.
Time will tell.
   Senator SPECTER. In dealing with the complexities of the cases,
the Supreme Court limits the length of briefs and limits the time
for litigants to make their arguments. Why would it not be equally
possible to limit the length of court opinions or the length of time
that the courts could spend? They deal with the same case in terms
of complexity.
                                     211
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, I am sure that we would hear
if we were to consult with others the fact that some cases require
more words to explain than others, some issues are more complex,
in some cases the court has to address more issues which have been
raised by the litigant, and it obviously takes more words and more
paper to do that.
  Just speaking in broad generalities, I tend to favor, if you will,
brevity but not at the expense of clarity or not at the expense of a
failure to analyze or expound on the necessary issues. That is
terribly critical.
  I am sure litigants would rather have an extra page of paper, if
that is what it took, to deal with a specific issue than to have some
arbitrary limit on the length.
  But just speaking in general terms, I think brevity can be a
virtue and dealing with matters expeditiously is clearly a virtue.
  Senator SPECTER. Our research has shown that you have not
written any dissenting or concurring opinions. Is that accurate?
  Judge O'CONNOR. NO; Senator Specter, it is not. In the sense of
the published opinions it is possible that that is the case, but I have
participated on my panels in the court of appeals in many cases,
and there have been at least some occasions in which there has
been a dissent or a concurring expression by me. Whether it was in
a memo decision or decisions I am not sure.

                                 MULTIPLE OFFENDER STATUTES

  Senator SPECTER. Judge O'Connor, do you think it wise, as many
States have done under multiple offender statutes, to give the trial
judge the discretion to impose a life sentence on a person convicted
of four major felonies such as robbery, rape, burglary, arson, or
drug selling?

  Judge O'CONNOR. DO I think that is an appropriate sentence
possibility?

  Senator SPECTER. Yes; do you think it is wise to give a trial judge
the discretion to impose a life sentence for the so-called career
criminal defined under many multiple offender statutes as a
person who has committed three or perhaps four major felonies
among the ones I enumerated?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, without expressing any opin-
ion on the eighth amendment implications, if any, I am generally
in favor of giving trial judges discretion to impose lengthy sen-
tences if necessary, including up to life sentences, for repeat offend-
ers. That concept seems to me to be generally a valid one.

  It has been my observation that a life sentence can be a lot
shorter in actuality than a lengthy term of years. Be that as it
may, I think discretion is appropriate.

                                    MANDATORY LIFE SENTENCE

  Senator SPECTER. When I asked you this morning about the
death penalty you commented in addition that you were opposed to
mandatory sentences. What would your objection be, if any, to
having a mandatory sentence of life in jail for someone who is
established as a career criminal--a repeater of violent crimes--by
                                      212
a standard of having committed three or four major felonies such
as rape, robbery, burglary, or drug sales?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, this morning in response to
your question on the mandatory sentence I indicated that I had
voted against a mandatory death penalty statute in Arizona; and
that was not intended by me to be an expression of the view that I
am opposed to a legislative body mandating certain narrow ranges
of sentence for all other crimes. I did not really address that
subject, and you now are.

  I think that certainly the legislature has a prerogative--a very
great prerogative--in the area of determining the range or appro-
priate sentence for criminal behavior. In fact, I can think of no
more frequently exercised topic of discussion and action for State
legislative bodies than in that very area.

  It is not inappropriate in my view that a legislative body might
determine that there are certain very closely defined limits for
sentencing of repeat offenders.

  Senator SPECTER. DO you agree with the feelings of many of us
who have been active in law enforcement that as a generalization
judges do not impose sufficiently long sentences for violent crimi-
nal repeaters?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, it is hard to generalize on
that. There is no doubt that the criticism perhaps can be made of
some judges with some sentencing patterns.

  The public has often been dismayed at the sentencing habits of
individual judges. These are very individualized matters, of course,
because each defendant in being dealt with by the court at the
time of sentencing presents a different set of circumstances as to
background, age, and circumstances of the offense, and so forth. It
is a very individualized matter.

  The expression of the public sentiment and disappointment about
judges' sentencing patterns has resulted in some States, such as
Arizona, in the adoption of an entirely new sentencing structure in
Arizona and in the production of an entirely revised criminal code.
The result of that effort was to closely restrict the discretion of
judges in sentencing.

  To an extent, that effort of the legislature has been frustrated in
large measure by the fact that there is not prison space and that
the sentences that are mandated and handed down are not served.

  So it has been, I am sure, a continuing frustration both to the
citizens and the legislators.

                           FEDERAL AND STATE JUDGE SALARIES

  Senator SPECTER. Judge O'Connor, do you believe that there is a
real danger to the quality of the Federal bench posed by resigna-
tions because of low pay?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, this has occurred of course. It
has occurred at the Federal level--I have read of instances--and it
has occurred at the State level. I am aware of a number of those
instances.

  I may say that the pay of State judges generally is substantially
lower on the average than that of the Federal judges. So if there is
a problem at the Federal level it is even more acute at the State
                                         213

level, and it is and should be a matter of concern to people general-
ly to see that judges receive adequate salaries in my view, suffi-
cient to attract competent people to the bench and hold them.

  Senator SPECTER. In a day with so many very deep Federal cuts
in so many programs--social programs and perhaps now defense--
is it appropriate to raise Federal judges' salaries to offset a signifi-
cant threat being posed to an inadequate Federal judiciary by
current wage levels? This is a question consistently before the
Congress.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, it seems to me that the Con-
gress has to consider seriously the plight of all officers and employ-
ees who are serving at fixed salaries in a period of heavy inflation.
It seems to me that that is absolutely crucial that those factors be
considered in determining what is appropriate.

   Senator SPECTER. Are you familiar with the Supreme Court deci-
sion, United States v. Will?

  Judge O'CONNOR. That is the salary case, Senator Specter?
   Senator SPECTER. Yes.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Yes--generally I am.
   Senator SPECTER. That case posed a situation where for four pay
periods the U.S. Supreme Court decided, in favor of judges, to raise
the compensation for Associate Justices from $72,000 to $88,700,
circumventing what is customarily the congressional prerogative to
establish compensation for Federal judges and did so on the very
narrow ground that where cost-of-living adjustments had been
passed by the Congress and in 1 year the President acted to rescind
it on September 30, and in another year the President acted to
rescind it on the morning of October 1. The Supreme Court of the
United States said that where the year had started and the cost-of-
living adjustment had gone into effect rescinding it would be a
violation of the constitutional prohibition against diminishing the
salary of a judge in a term of office.

   I think there are many of us who felt that whatever case there
was to be made for increases in compensation, including Federal
judges, it was a matter that ought to come through the Congress,
as with all other Federal employees, as opposed to having the U.S.
Supreme Court itself take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and
give themselves that kind of a pay raise.

   I think that is a case which is not likely to come back, at least in
that form, so perhaps that is one where I might appropriately ask
if you agree with that specific decision.

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, I frankly did not study that
decision at all. It was not of that great a concern to me because I
little expected that I might some day be sitting on that court.

   Senator SPECTER. Well, the case may have some extra signifi-
cance soon.

   There has been a fair amount of comment about the desirability
of letting the public have a greater understanding of the work of
the U.S. Supreme Court, and there has been a popular book writ-
ten recently, "The Brethren", which perhaps had as sources of
information disclosures by employees of the Supreme Court Jus-
tices.
                                         214

  Would you consider restricting in anyway your law clerks, your
secretaries, or anyone under your direct control from making any
such disclosures to journalists?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, I do not know whether I
would or not. I certainly would instruct employees that they must
maintain the strictest confidence concerning pending matters
before the Court. That seems to me absolutely crucial and vital. I
think little is to be gained by anything less than a very firm policy
in that regard.

   No doubt other matters such as personalities or the general way
in which the business of the Court is conducted are matters which
will always be discussed to an extent by those who have knowledge
of those aspects.

                    DIVERSITY IN SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENT

   Senator SPECTER. Let me skip quite a number of questions since
my time is almost up and ask you one final question, Judge O'Con-
nor. Do you think there is any basis at all for appointing a Su-
preme Court Justice with a view to diversity on account of sex,
race, religion, or geography; or would you think it preferable to
appoint the nine most qualified people that could be found for the
job, even if they all came from Stanford in the same year and lived
in Arizona?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Specter, that would undoubtedly guar-
antee quality if that were to be the case.

  [Laughter.]
   Senator SPECTER. It might also, in the process, eliminate the
potential conflict of interest issue which was raised by Senator
Biden with respect to Mr. O'Connor.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Very possibly.
   Senator SPECTER. DO you think though that there is any realistic
basis to look for diversity--more than one woman; perpetuating, if
I may say, a black seat on the Supreme Court; or seeking geograph-
ical balance in the appointments to the Court?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator, I think the Court traditionally has
reflected some effort to achieve diversity. Anyone who is skilled in
the political arena knows that it is often desirable for political
reasons to see that diversity in any given body in which the ap-
pointment process is being exercised reflect a certain amount of
diversity. I would expect the political process to always take that
into account to some extent.
   At the same time, I think it is quite possible, even though one
might want to have diversity, whether it is of geography, race, or
sex, to all select people of competence, ability, and quality, because
I think people of that capacity abound in all races, in both sexes,
and in all parts of the country.
   Senator SPECTER. Judge O'Connor, I started this morning by
complimenting you on your tour de force of yesterday and I would
add to that my compliment for today.
   In the interest of hearing the balance of the witnesses who will
be coming forward I will refrain from making any commitment as
to my own vote, but that is the only reason.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. I have a letter addressed to me as chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, from Congressman Bob Stump of Arizo-
na. It is a very complimentary letter about you, Judge O'Connor.
Without objection, we will place this in the record.

Senator Strom Thurmond
Chairman, Judiciary Committee
2226 Dirksen Building
Washington, D.C. 20515

Dear Mr. Chairman:

         It is my pleasure to recommend to you Judge Sandra O'Connor,
of the Arizona Court of Appeals, for confirmation as a Justice of
the United States Supreme Court. She is emminently qualified for
that position, both through intellect and disposition.

        Judge O'Connor and I served together in the Arizona State
Senate on opposite sides of the aisle. At one point, she was
majority leader while I was minority leader. Perhaps adversaries
have the best opportunity to appraise their opponents. Based on
that experience, I can make the following observations.

        She has a consistent and coherent conservative philosophy
of government and of law. Her decisions are grounded in principle
and her approach is precise, with attention to detail. The effect
is that those who deal with her know where she stands.

         She is fair. The power of the majority can tempt some to
take unfair advantage of their adversaries. As majority leader
Judge O'Connor did not abuse that power. We were given the
greatest possible latitude for making our case on any issue. The
result was that all parties got a fair hearing in debate. I
believe the quality of the laws enacted was improved.

        Her attention to the details of statute drafting was such that
no point of grammar or punctuation was too small to consider. She
understood that failure to attend to such details often resulted in
statutes that lacked clarity. She knew that imprecise statutes
often lead Courts to substitute their policy judgement for that
of the legislature. She believes very strongly that the legislature
is the proper forum for policy debate and determination. Her sense
of responsibility told her that anything less than the best legis-
lative job was a potential abrogation of power to the Judiciary,
which was unintended by the Constitution.
                                     217

         Her intellect is incisive. She is not led astray by irrele-
vancies. These qualities will help her decide which of todays
many complex legal issues deserve the attention of the Supreme
Court.

         Mr. Chairman, you can expect Judge O'Connor to settle for
no less than the best from our Courts. I suggest that we can
ask no more than that. Judge O'Connor's record and reputation
is her best recommendation, but I am happy to add my name to the
long list of those who support her confirmation.

                                                             Sincerely,

                                                             BOB STUMP

  The CHAIRMAN. I have a letter from Senator Gordon Humphrey
requesting that you answer certain questions. I would turn that
over to the staff. If you could answer those by tomorrow it would
be appreciated.

  [Material follows:]
                                        218

                                                                        September 11, 1981

 The Honorable Strom Thurmond
 Chairman
 Committee on the Judiciary
 United States Senate
 Washington, D.C. 20510

 Dear Mr. Chairman:

              In his letter of September 9, 1981, Senator Humphrey
 sets forth the following questions:

              1. Do you believe that all human beings should be
                    regarded as persons for the purposes of the
                    right to life protected by the Fifth and Four-
                     teenth Amendments?

             2. In your opinion, is the unborn child a human being?

             3. What is your opinion of the decision of the Supreme
                    Court in the 1973 abortion cases, Roe v. Wade and Doe
                    v. Bolton?

             4. Do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted
                    to permit the states to prohibit abortion? If your
                    answer is yes, are there any types of abortions where
                    you think the Constitution should be interpreted so
                    as not to allow such prohibition?

             5. Do you think the Constitution should be interpreted
                    to permit the states to require the consent of parents
                    before their unmarried, unemancipated minor child
                    has an abortion performed on her?

             6. Do you think the Constitution should be interpreted
                    to permit the states to require the consent of parents
                    before their unmarried, unemancipated minor child is
                    sterilized?

             7. Do you think the Constitution should be interpreted to
                    permit the states to require the consent of parents
                    before their unmarried, unemancipated minor child is
                    given contraceptives by a third party?

             The first and second questions concern the definition of human
life and the legal consequences which attach to that definition.
Congress is currently considering proposals directly addressed to
these issues. Questions concerning the validity and effect of
these proposals, if any are passed, might well be presented to
the Supreme Court for decision.

            A nominee to the Court must refrain from expressing any
view on an issue which may be presented to the Court. A federal
judge is required by law to "disqualify himself in any proceeding
in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned." 28
U.S.C. § 455; see Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3C. If a nominee
to the Supreme Court were to state how he or she would rule in a
particular case, it would suggest that, as a Justice, the nominee
would not impartially consider the arguments presented by each
litigant. If a nominee were to commit to a prospective ruling
                                      219

in response to a question from a Senator, there is an even more
serious appearance of impropriety, because it may seem that the
nominee has pledged to take a particular view of the law in return
for the Senator's vote. In either circumstance, the nominee may
be disqualified when the case or issue comes before the Court. As
Justice Frankfurter stated in Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S.
11 (1954), a core component of justice is the appearance of justice.
It would clearly tarnish the appearance of justice for me to state
in advance how I would decide a particular case or issue.

             Other nominees to the Supreme Court have scrupulously re-
frained from commenting on the merits of recent Court decisions
or specific matters which may come before the Court. Justice
Stewart, for example, declined at his confirmation hearings to
answer questions concerning Brown v. Board of Education, noting
that pending and future cases raised issues affected by that
decision and that "a serious problem of simple judicial ethics"
would arise if he were to commit himself as a nominee. Hearings
at 62-63. The late Justice Harlan declined to respond to questions
about the then-recent Steel Seizure cases, Hearings at 167, 174,
and stated that if he were to comment upon cases which might come
before him it would raise "the gravest kind of question as to
whether I was qualified to sit on that Court." Hearings at 138.
More recently, the Chief Justice declined to comment on a Supreme
Court redistricting decision which was criticized by a Senator,
noting, "I should certainly observe the proprieties by not under-
taking to comment on anything which might come either before the
court on which I now sit or on any other court on which I may sit."
Hearings at 18.

            Questions three and four directly raise the issue of the
correctness of particular Supreme Court decisions. In Roe v.
Wade and Doe v. Bo1ton the Supreme Court held that states may not
prohibit abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy. Ques-
tions related to the issues reached in these decisions may come
before the Court, and the Court may also be asked to reconsider
the decisions themselves. For the reasons I have stated in this
letter as well as in my testimony before the Senate Committee on the
Judiciary, it would therefore be inappropriate for me to answer
questions three and four.

            The fifth question concerns'the constitutional validity
of a law requiring parental consent prior to the performance of
an abortion on an unmarried, unemancipated minor child. Several
state statutes dealing with this subject have come before the
Court and have resulted in sharply divided decisions. In Planned
Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976), the Court ruled uncon-
stitutional a statute requiring parental consent before an un-
married person under 18 could obtain an abortion. The Court
specifically noted, however, that it was not ruling that every
minor was capable of giving effective consent, simply that giving
an absolute veto to the parents in all cases was invalid. In
Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622 (1979), the Court struck down a
statute which required parental or judicial consent prior to the
performance of an abortion on an unmarried minor. The Court
failed to agree on a majority rationale. Just last Term, however,
in H.L. v. Matheson, 101 S.Ct. 1154 (1981), the Court upheld a
Utah statute requiring notification of parents prior to an abor-
tion, at least as the statute was applied to an unmarried, un-
emancipated minor who had not made any claim as to her own maturity.
These decisions indicate that the area is a particularly trouble-
some one for the Court, and also cne in which future cases can be
expected to arise.

            The Supreme Court has recognized that "the parents' claim
to authority in their own household is basic in the structure of

     87-101 0 -- 81 15
                                      220

our society." Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 639 (1958)
 (plurality) . My sense of family values is such that I would hope
that any minor considering an abortion would seek the guidance
and counseling of her parents.

             The sixth question concerns the constitutional validity
of a law requiring parental consent before an unmarried, unemanci-
pated minor child is sterilized. Once again I would hope that
any minor considering such a drastic and usually irreversible
step would seek the guidance of his or her parents and family.
It would be inappropriate for me, however, to express any view in
response to a specific question concerning the legality of a
parental consent law, because the whole area of the constitution-
ality of statutes requiring parental consent is in a stage of
development and because such statutes are likely to be presented
to the Court for review. My hesitation is also based on the fact
that I have not had the benefit of a specific factual case, briefs,
or arguments.

            The final question concerns the constitutional validity of
a law requiring the consent of parents before an unmarried, uneman-
cipated minor child is given contraceptives by a third party. In
Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678 (1977),
the Court struck down a law making it a crime for anyone to sell
or distribute nonprescription contraceptives to anyone under 16.
The case, however, did not involve a parental consent requirement;
indeed, Justice Powell found the law offensive precisely because
it applied to parents and interfered with their rights to raise
their children. Id. at 708 (concurring opinion) . A three-judge
district court found a state law prohibiting family planning
assistance to minors in the absence of parental consent unconsti-
tutional as interfering with the minor's rights, T.H. v. Jones,
425 F.Supp. 873, 881 (Utah 1975), but when the case reached the
Supreme Court it was affirmed on other grounds, 425 U.S. 986 (1976).
The constitutional question is therefore still open, and I must
respectfully decline any further comments for the reasons set forth
previously.

            Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to set forth my
views on these matters in response to Senator Humphrey's letter.

                                                    Sincerely,

                                                    Sandra Day O'Connor

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Biden has asked for a special concession
of 3 more minutes.

  Senator BIDEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge, I want to just cover one area that, although I had to be
out of the room for about an hour and a half, I do not think was
covered. That was relating to court procedure in standing.
  In deciding whether standing exists or whether a class action
would properly lie, should a Supreme Court Justice take into ac-
count his or her belief, assuming that it is held by that Justice,
that the courts are too congested and that the dockets are too
crowded when determining whether or not standing exists or
whether or not a class action properly lies?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Biden, I have not had to address this
question. As a judge, it seems to me that primary in determining
whether to decide that a given case is a justiciable case would be
perhaps factors other than court congestion--the importance of the
issue, the posture in which the case is, the other factors that one
normally considers.

  Senator BIDEN. I would hope that that would be the case. Al-
though the courts clearly are congested in many areas and al-
though the dockets are sometimes too crowded, it seems to me that
the ability to have access to justice should not be precluded as a
consequence of the inability of either the judiciary and/or the
legislative body to make accommodations for access to justice.

  I would hope that as a Justice you would not make as part of
your decision whether or not to preclude access the fact that it was
crowded--in other words, "You came too late, fella--sorry--even
though you have a justiciable case." I would hope that would be
your position, as you stated.

  I have no further questions. Thank you very much for your
comments.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator East, did you have any further ques-
tions?
   Senator EAST. NO, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. That concludes with you this afternoon, Judge
O'Connor. We have some other witnesses, so we are going to go
ahead. I want to be sure we finish tomorrow, if possible, by 1
o'clock.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you.
   Senator BIDEN. YOU are welcome to stay.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you, Senator Biden.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Judge O'CONNOR. With the permission of the Chair then, thank
you, Mr. Chairman. I shall withdraw.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW we have a panel consisting of the Honor-
able Tony West, the Honorable Donna Carlson West, and the Hon-
orable Art Hamilton, members of the Arizona House of Repre-
sentatives.
  If you folks would come up, we would be glad to hear from you at
this time.
   Please stand and raise your right hands. I will now swear you in.
Do you swear that the evidence you will give in this hearing will
                                                   222

be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help
you, God?

   Mr. WEST. I do.

   Ms. WEST. I do.

   Mr. HAMILTON. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. Please be seated.
  Mr. West, we might begin with you. We are allowing 5 minutes
to each one of you. We have a large number of witnesses to hear
yet. We can place your entire statement in the record unless you
can give it in 5 minutes. If you can give it in 5 minutes, OK. If you
cannot, I suggest we print it in the record in full and then you
summarize it in 5 minutes.

     TESTIMONY OF HON. TONY WEST, ARIZONA HOUSE OF
                              REPRESENTATIVES

  Mr. WEST. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
  Before I begin my formal remarks I certainly want to reassure
the American people and to congratulate you and the members of
the Judiciary Committee for the outstanding job that you have
undertaken here in the last 2 days.
  I think you have seen why we from Arizona are here to testify
on behalf of Sandra Day O'Connor as an Associate Justice to the
Supreme Court.
  If candor, intellect, endurance, and courage are part of the quali-
fications for being a nominee to the Supreme Court it is obvious
why she has been appointed by President Reagan.
  I am here today to give my wholehearted and unequivocal sup-
port to Judge Sandra Day O'Connor, President Reagan's outstand-
ing nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. In my judgment, she is
eminently qualified to sit as an Associate Justice on the U.S.
Supreme Court.
  As you have seen, Judge O'Connor is gifted with an exceptional
intellect; rational, judicial temperament; and an approach to prob-
lem solving which is logical, analytical, and well balanced.
  Judge O'Connor is one of the few--if not the only nominee, to my
knowledge--who has ever had training and experience in all three
branches of government, ranging from her position in the Arizona
State Senate--the legislative branch--as an assistant attorney gen-
eral in the executive branch and, of course, her position on both
the superior court and the court of appeals--judicial branch.
  It is my observation that Judge Sandra O'Connor will provide a
new beginning in reestablishing respect and credibility to the Su-
preme Court as an institution.
  Though we all realize that this is an historic event, with Sandra
being the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, her recog-
nition will go far beyond that of being the first female appointed.
  Her effective leadership and the new vitality that she will bring
to the Supreme Court will be a positive contribution to all people of
our Nation.
  In my judgment, with the exception of Sandra's obvious aesthetic
beauty and her very feminine qualities, in the future it will be
difficult at best to determine any gender by the reading or inter-
pretation of her decisions.
                                                   223

  Mr. Chairman, I am one of the leading pro-life legislators in the
State of Arizona having been a sponsor and a major participant on
every piece of pro-life legislation and pro-life action taken in the
Arizona Legislature since my very first election.

  While it is true, Judge O'Connor certainly was not a pro-life
proponent while a member of the Arizona Senate, neither was she
then nor to my knowledge has she ever been the friend of those
who advocate the killing of the innocent unborn babies.

  Abortion is a violent, silent holocaust taking place in our country
today and is an absolute abomination, the ultimate evil plaguing
our society. With the strong feelings that I harbor for the sanctity
and the quality of life, I am certain in my own mind that Judge
O'Connor shares these same concerns.

  It is my opinion that the pro-life movement needs as many
converts and friends as possible. This conversion process is normal-
ly accomplished through an intellectual and academic stimulus, as
well as understanding, love, kindness, and above all, compassion
shown to those who are not always sympathic to our own views.

  A prime example in this hearing room today is Representative
Art Hamilton, the Democratic Arizona minority leader, who went
through this evolution and conversion process and is now one of
our leading pro-life advocates.

   It is my feeling that Judge O'Connor, in the reflection of the
judicial setting, without constituency pressure and the quest for
reelection, if she has not already done so, will come to the same
conclusions about the sacredness and sanctity of human life both
inside and outside the womb.

   It is my opinion that her decisions on the bench will reflect that
thoughtful, careful, and compassionate consideration that a mother
of three and a person of destiny would be expected to reflect.

   The phrase, equal justice under the law, will be deeply enriched
with a new vibrancy with the confirmation of Judge O'Connor.

   Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
to know Sandra O'Connor is to love and to respect her. I assure you
that with her grace and her eloquence she will captivate our Na-
tion's Capitol as she has my State of Arizona.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   We will now hear from the Honorable Donna Carlson West, a
member of the Arizona House of Representatives.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DONNA CARLSON WEST, ARIZONA HOUSE

                            OF REPRESENTATIVES

   Mrs. WEST. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I might note before I begin my formal remarks that I, too, am a
pro-life legislator from Arizona and I am known as the leader of
the Stop-ERA movement in Arizona.
   Mr. Chairman, I am very honored to have been asked to testify
at these hearings on the appointment of Sandra O'Connor to the
U.S. Supreme Court. President Reagan has chosen a gracious lady
who has served Arizona admirably for a number of years. Our
State will sorely miss the talents of such a brilliant lawyer, legisla-
tor, and jurist.
                                                  224

  Sandra O'Connor is known in Arizona as an outstanding leader.
In the legislature she was a driving force in passing many laws
which were in the best interests of our State. She showed a com-
mitment to equal treatment of all our citizens by revising antiquat-
ed, discriminatory statutes.

  She also displayed a genuine concern for the taxpayers by initiat-
ing a wide-ranging bill that reduced local property taxes.

  In addition to believing that laws should treat all people fairly
and that the cost of government should remain reasonable, Sandra
O'Connor believed that the actions of government should be a
matter of public knowledge. Therefore, she was a strong supporter
of legislation requiring government to make decisions in open
meetings.

  Judge O'Connor, our Nation's first woman State senate majority
leader, has been an inspiration to her colleagues. Her personality
draws out and enhances the best in others.

  I began my association with Sandra O'Connor when I was a staff
member in the Senate during her term in office.

  I observed her to be meticulous, determined, independent, and,
as one of your members said this morning, an ideal woman--a true
role model for other women who would seek public office.

  As a staunch supporter of the family and woman's important
role as a mother and wife, I can assure you that Judge O'Connor
also reflects this view.

  With her numerous demanding professional and civic responsibil-
ities she remains dedicated to her family. She has always displayed
love and support for her sons and husband. She cherishes their
shared experiences and private life together.

  That is another reason I regard Judge O'Connor as proof that
women can successfully combine family and career and contribute
much to society in both roles. Many who have tried to persuade our
young people that one must be sacrificed at the expense of the
other would do well to emulate her approach to combining a pro-
fessional and family life.

  I must say that I disagreed with some of the votes that Sandra
Day O'Connor cast as a State legislator. I have many friends who
have been very vocal in expressing their opposition to those same
votes. Because of my personal views against abortion, I am thank-
ful that these concerns have been expressed. I truly believe that 5
years ago there would not have been the concern on the part of the
public nor the members of this committee to ask the questions on
abortion that I have heard during the course of this testimony. I
am grateful that this issue has been raised by those who are truly
concerned.

  I am very pleased to hear Judge O'Connor's responses to the very
difficult questions which you have asked. They reinforce my re-
spect for the fine qualities she can offer as a jurist.

  Her intellect and fair and impartial attitude will earn her the
respect and recognition of all those in the Court, and from my
observation she has an excellent grasp of a wide range of issues
which may come before her. Saudra Day O'Connor understands the
power of the Court. She believes in a philosophy of judicial re-
straint--interpretation rather than legislation.
                                                   225

  In her decisions she is guided by logic and fact. Her concern for
people often makes those decisions painful. In one case she heard
as a superior court judge the decision was made to incarcerate the
criminal, a mother who pled not to be separated from her family.
Knowing that justice must be served, Judge O'Connor sentenced
the woman to jail, knowing the pain the woman would suffer being
separated from her children. Sandra O'Connor retired to her cham-
ber and wept. She did what had to be done, but she showed a deep
compassion. These qualities will make her a noteworthy, historic
Supreme Court Justice.

  I urge you to unanimously recommend the confirmation of Presi-
dent Reagan's nominee, Judge Sandra Day O'Connor, to the U.S.
Supreme Court; and I thank you very much for giving me the
opportunity to appear before you and express my views.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  The Honorable Art Hamilton, a member of the Arizona House of
Representatives.

   TESTIMONY OF HON. ART HAMILTON, ARIZONA HOUSE OF
                              REPRESENTATIVES

  Mr. HAMILTON. Chairman Thurmond and members of the com-
mittee, thank you very much. I wish to thank you for this opportu-
nity to address you regarding the nomination of Sandra O'Connor
to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. I consider this not
only an honor but a tremendous responsibility.

  The Supreme Court is for most Americans the last refuge of
appeal when we believe our rights have been violated or ignored.
This is particularly true of minorities who have reached out to the
Court in an effort to see their liberties guaranteed. So I feel pecu-
liarly sensitive to the kind of individual who should hold this
awesome power over our lives, and this is in part why I am here.

   Sandra O'Connor was an outstanding legislator with whom I
served, but that is not why I support her nomination. She is as well
an outstanding member of the bench in Arizona, but that is not
why I support her nomination.

   As I know you now understand, she is clearly an exceptional
legal scholar, but that is also not the reason I am here.

   I have come to Washington to state my support for Judge O'Con-
nor because I believe that she is totally and resolutely committed
to the ideal of equal justice under law.

   In my years of dealing with Judge O'Connor I have never failed
to be impressed by her intuitive sensitivity to the rights, hopes, and
desires of the "have nots" as well as the "haves" of our society.

   I do not know and cannot say how Judge O'Connor will vote on
specific issues that come before the Court. I am confident that
some of those decisions I am not going to agree with.

  What I am sure of, and what I believe you can be assured of, is
Judge O'Connor's fidelity to the Constitution and her impartiality
in guaranteeing the rights of all Americans. She will, as they say,
call them as she believes the Constitution calls her to see them. Of
this much I am totally confident.

   What I believe speaks best from my perspective is that when all
else is said what remains is that Sandra O'Connor is a good and
                                                     226

decent person of compassion, intellect, and good will. She loves this
country and will seek to preserve, protect, and improve it.

  I believe she deserves the support of this committee, the support
of the U.S. Senate, and having gained those she will earn the
support and respect of the people of these United States.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Senator Grassley, do you have any questions of this panel?

                                           PRO-LIFE STAND

  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
  First of all, I appreciate your comments about what you believe
to be her pro-life stand. As a person who has had some concern
about her lack of being explicit, which I can understand, I would
like to ask each whether or not you would expect her to be support-
ive of pro-life positions in the Supreme Court, as you know her
today? I would like to have each of the three of you answer that.

  Mr. HAMILTON. Senator Grassley, I do not know, sir; and I would
not even attempt to speculate. I have a strong pro-life record, and I
am very proud of that.

  I think Sandra O'Connor is a good and decent person who will
seek to do what she believes the Constitution calls for her to do.

  I have faith that her position with regard to being pro-life is an
evolving one. That is why I am here and in part why I am support-
ive, but I would not want to speculate what she is going to do. I
tried that a couple of times when she was in the Senate, and I have
not guessed right yet.

  She has the best instincts of any person I have ever dealt with. I
sincerely believe she cares about the rights of the unborn, and I
believe she will seek to protect them.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Mrs. West?
  Mrs. WEST. Mr. Chairman and Senator Grassley, I would not
want to speculate on how she might decide a case that dealt with
the abortion issue. I think that she will weigh the facts of the case,
consider the laws involved in that particular case, and make her
decision based on her interpretation of those factors. I think that is
a quality that we look for in a judge.
  I have had private conversations with her on the issues of abor-
tion and the Equal Rights Amendment and was satisfied with her
views. I am convinced she is a woman of integrity. I am also
convinced, though, that she will deal with each individual case
based on the facts and the law; and I do not think we can ask any
more of her.
  Senator GRASSLEY.. Mr. Hamilton?
  Mrs. WEST. Mr. Chairman and Senator, I would not be sitting
here making the testimony that I just gave if I thought for a
moment that Judge O'Connor would come down for the continu-
ation of the murder of the innocent unborn.
  It is my personal judgment that she has gone through this con-
version process. I think she has said in open hearing, under oath,
that if she had to do it again she doubts if she would vote the same
way she voted in 1970 and maybe on some of the other issues. God
                                                   227

knows, I have made some votes that I have regretted and even
been a little bit repentant for occasionally.

  I believe that she fully recognizes that she is a woman of destiny
and that she certainly believes in a divine creator. In my judgment
we are going to be very satisfied with Judge O'Connor, her astute-
ness, her openess, and the balance that she is going to bring to the
Supreme Court.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I'm finished questioning the
witness.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator DeConcini?
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, I have no questions. I want
to thank my colleagues from Arizona for being here, for their
forthright position, and for addressing one of the more sensitive
issues that has arisen here and addressing it in a manner that I
think is most proper.
  I would like to call to the attention of the committee that Repre-
sentative Tony West, not speaking in any manner in behalf of the
Roman Catholic Church, is an ordained deacon in the church. I
have known him for a long time in his commitment to the pro-life
area, a commitment that I also have, and I am very pleased that
he is here to express his conscience and his belief.
  I also wish to thank Donna Carlson West and my friend, Art
Hamilton, for taking the time, Mr. Chairman, from their full-time
jobs. The Arizona Legislature is not a full-time job, and the pay is
minimal. They all hold full-time jobs and have families and many
commitments. To be back here today, I think, is an expression of
the people of Arizona--how they feel about Judge O'Connor. I
thank them sincerely for their forthrightness and the sacrifice of
their time to be here today with this committee.
  Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. I want to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for
your presence here and for the testimony you have given. You are
now excused.
   Our next panel consists of the Honorable Leo Corbet, president
of the Arizona Senate; the Honorable Stan Turley, a member of the
Arizona Senate; and the Honorable Alfredo Gutierrez, a member of
the Arizona State Senate.
   Would you gentlemen please come forward? We will be pleased
to hear from you.
   I had better swear you in first. Would you rise and hold up your
right hands? Do you swear that the evidence you shall give in this
hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you, God?

   Mr. CORBET. I do.
   Mr. TURLEY. I do.
   Mr. GUTIERREZ. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. Would you identify yourselves? We will start on
the left.

    TESTIMONY OF HON. LEO CORBET, PRESIDENT, ARIZONA
                                 STATE SENATE

  Mr. CORBET. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my
name is Leo Corbet. I am the president of the Arizona State
                                         228

Senate. I had the privilege of serving with then Senator O'Connor
and now Judge O'Connor for two terms when she was in that same
senate.

  I came here, as you know, with a prepared statement which I
will submit and try to summarize some of the things in deference
to the kindness of this committee.

  The CHAIRMAN. DO you want the entire statement to go in the
record or what you say now?

  Mr. CORBET. What I say now.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. You may proceed.
  Mr. CORBET. Thank you.
  It is very difficult, I think, to do anything that would add to the
luster of Senator and Judge O'Connor after these last 2 days of
hearing. You know now what we have known for a long time in
Arizona; and that is that she is articulate, prepared, intelligent,
and she is the kind of person you want doing any number of
important jobs, whether it be at the State or the Federal level.
  The support of the people who have come back here to testify in
her behalf, I think, is testimony itself of the kind of person she is,
from the Democratic side, to some of us Reaganites, to Roman
Catholics. All of us are proud of Sandra. We are proud of the job
that she has done.
  As a State legislator and one who is an advocate of States' rights,
I am especially pleased to see someone of her caliber and her
background on this Court. As a lawyer, I have served with her in
the legislature of course and also been before her in the court of
appeals, and I can tell you that the kind of preparation that she
snowed the gentlemen of this committee is the kind of preparation
that she brings to each job and each task that she is assigned.
  I can also say that Sandra O'Connor is a very special person and
that our beloved Constitution will be in good hands with her on the
Court.
  I thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Would you please give your name and position?

 TESTIMONY OF HON. STAN TURLEY, ARIZONA STATE SENATE

  Mr. TURLEY. Mr. Chairman and members of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, my name is Stan Turley. I am a Republican State senator
from Arizona. I appreciate very much this opportunity to appear
before you on behalf of Judge O'Connor as nominee to the Supreme
Court of the United States.

  I am impressed today with your patience, Mr. Chairman. I have
heard of you for many years, and it is a privilege to now see you in
action and to see you going after hours.

  I am impressed also with the depth of the hearing that has taken
place here. I want you to know that my feelings toward this whole
process have been reinforced with what I have seen here today.

  I have known Judge O'Connor and her family for many years.
My first acquaintance with her was as an assistant to the State
attorney general. At that time I felt she was destined for more
than a windowless office in the attorney general's office, although I
confess that I did not foresee the scene before us today.
                                         229

  We worked closely together as members of the majority in the
State senate, so I feel that I know her well. She is an unusual lady
of many talents which you are hearing about and which I need not
repeat. There are, however, a few aspects of Judge O'Connor's
nomination to which I would like to call particular attention.

  Foremost, Sandra holds what I consider to be the proper perspec-
tive of the role of the three branches of Government. By that I
mean she has demonstrated her strong belief in the separation of
powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches as
they function in our system. She has shown impatience with the
judicial branch when it has been used to make law rather than to
interpret law.

   Judge O'Connor has a heritage from a pioneer family in Arizona
that is unique. The family has been located on the same old ranch
for just over 100 years. It is a big, isolated, tough, hard outfit
located in a hostile desert environment subject to all of the forces
of nature such as drought, winds, floods, grasshoppers, range fires,
predators, and almost anything else you want to mention.

   To be reared in this environment where so many things are
beyond man's control sometimes--not always, but sometimes--
gives an added dimension of character to those who are subject to
those forces. A dimension of humility, fortitude, of faith in divine
providence, integrity, and commonsense developed from meeting
that type of challenge.

   In my opinion, Sandra has this added dimension to a high
degree. True, it is an intangible; nevertheless it is real.

   Much has been said about Judge O'Connor's stand on abortion
and the equal rights amendment. Whatever her position on these
matters, I can say without fear of contradiction that she was not
an activist leading the charge on these issues.

   As a member both of the State and national right to life organi-
zations and a long-time opponent of the equal rights amendment, I
have no reservations whatsoever in supporting her nomination to
the High Court.

   Here are the reasons why: I know Judge O'Connor to be a person
of integrity, highly qualified, intensely dedicated to excellence, a
fair-minded person with a great empathy and understanding of the
problems of the common man. She has a balance that is needed in
this appointment.

   You will go far to find a person equally at home ladling out
beans to a work crew in a cow camp, attending a board meeting of
a large bank, ironing shirts for her sons, leading the Arizona
Senate as majority leader, counseling with the Salvation Army
people, and presiding as a judge in our court system.

   I suppose she has her failings, but I am convinced that Judge
O'Connor has all those basic qualifications to be a great Supreme
Court Justice. I strongly urge her confirmation.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Senator Gutierrez.

  TESTIMONY OF HON. ALFREDO GUTIERREZ, ARIZONA STATE
                                      SENATE

   Mr. GUTIERREZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
                                                   230

  My name is Alfredo Gutierrez, and I am an Arizona State sena-
tor. I came to the Arizona Senate as a Democrat in 1973 when
Sandra O'Connor was the Republican majority leader. Two years
later I was to succeed Judge O'Connor as majority leader when my
party gained control of the senate.

  During the years that I served on the legislature with Sandra
O'Connor we inevitably found ourselves on the opposite side of
many issues as I became the leader of the liberal wing of the
senate Democrats while she was the spokesman for the essentially
conservative positions of the Republican caucus.

  Despite the fact that we were frequent foes on the floor of the
Arizona Senate, I never had cause to doubt either her sincerity or
her ability. Sandra O'Connor always represented her positions in a
manner that revealed meticulous research and a thorough grasp of
the intricacies of the law. She also conducted herself with great
fairness, and I think that fundamental fairness is an excellent sign
for the minority communities of the United States.

  As a result of my legislative service with Sandra O'Connor I
know that the U.S. Supreme Court will be gaining someone who
has conducted herself according to the highest standards of integri-
ty as well as someone who has demonstrated both a respect for and
a profound knowledge of our Constitution and law.

  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  Do you have any questions, Senator Grassley?
  Senator GRASSLEY. NO, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator DeConcini?
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, I have no questions. I think
the fine statements given by my friends and colleagues here speak
well of the caliber of the legislators in Arizona, and I thank them
sincerely for taking their personal time from their jobs and fami-
lies to be with us today.

  The CHAIRMAN. I want to express my appreciation to you ladies
and gentlemen--Members of the Senate and Members of the
House, both--for coming to Washington on your own initiative and
testifying in these hearings. We appreciate it.

  You are now excused.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will now call on Mr. Gordon S. Jones of
United Families of America.
  Mr. Jones, please come forward and take a seat.
  Is Mr. Jones here?
  [No response.]
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Ann Neamon, Citizens for God and Coun-
try--is Ms. Neamon here?
  [No response.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Frank Brown, National Association for Personal
Rights in Education?
  Mr. Brown, please come forward and hold up your hand to be
sworn. Do you swear that the evidence you shall give in this
hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth, so help you, God?

   Mr. BROWN. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU may proceed for 5 minutes, Mr. Brown.

      TESTIMONY OF FRANK BROWN, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL
      ASSOCIATION FOR PERSONAL RIGHTS IN EDUCATION

  Mr. BROWN. The National Association for Personal Rights in
Education, a parental group dedicated to the personal civil, and
consitutional rights of families and students to academic freedom
and religious liberty in education, appreciates the opportunity to
speak here today.

  The confirmation of any new Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court
is a fateful step in the process of American Government, for it
gives a specific citizen a sweeping and lifelong judgment over the
rights and property of the citizens of this country, a power that can
be used beneficially in the light of the Constitution, but a power
that can be used harmfully in the light of the background and
personal values of the justice.

  Today the National Association for Personal Rights in Education
[NAPRE], a parental group dedicated to the personal civil and
constitutional rights of families and students to academic freedom
and religious liberty in education, appreciates the opportunity to
speak on the occasion of the hearings on Judge Sandra Day O'Con-
nor.

  We are a parental group. We do not speak for any church or
school, nor does any church or school speak for us. In our 22-year
history we have struggled, mainly in Illinois, for types of parental
and student grants--for example, the voucher--through which
families and students would have an equitable share of the educa-
tion tax to attend the schools, public or private, of their choice. We
have also at times supported tuition tax credit bills that contain
negative income or refundability provisions through which low-
income families having a tax credit of $500 and a tax indebtedness
of $200 would receive a refund of $300.

   Judge O'Connor does not in this matter have an ascertainable
record as a legislator and none as a judge. However, when an
Arizona senator, she was quoted in the Phoenix magazine--Febru-
ary 1971--during a period when tuition tax credit legislation--for
example, senate bill 1161--was an issue as saying that State aid to
private schools is "clearly unconstitutional." The New York Times,
June 12, 1981, reports that in the senate she opposed public aid to
parochial and private schools.

   In view of these reports we address three main lines of concern.
First, we are concerned that families seeking tax benefits for chil-
dren in church-related elementary and secondary schools are told
by the Supreme Court that such benefits are as violative of the
establishment clause as are benefits to church schools. But the
personal rights of parents and children stand on their own consti-
tutional merits and may not be denied by reason of any relation-
ship between the State and any church or school.

   Such families are accused of subterfuge, of trying to attain indi-
rectly an unconstitutional goal that cannot be achieved directly,
namely, aid to religion, but the reverse is the case, with those who
cannot directly refute the personal rights of parents and students
doing so indirectly by invoking church-State controversies.

   Unfortunately some justices, in their absorption with church-
State matters, have lost sight of parental and child rights, but
fortunately three present justices, Chief Justice Burger and Jus-
                                                  232

tices Rehnquist and White, are aware of these rights, with Burger
saying, in his dissent in Lemon v. Sloan (1973):

  The essence of all these decisions (Everson, Allen), I suggest, is that Government
aid to individuals generally stands on an entirely different footing from direct aid to
religious institutions . . . But, at least where the state law is genuinely directed at
enhancing a recognized freedom of individuals, even one involving both secular and
religious consequences . . . the Establishment Clause no longer has a prohibitive
effect.

  In his dissent in Meek v. Pittenger (1975), a decision denying tax
benefits to handicapped children in church-related schools, Burger
condemned the economic pressure put on parents in a moving and
disturbing statement,

  The melancholy consequence of what the Court does today is to force the parent
to choose between the "free exercise" of a religious belief by opting for a sectarian
education for his child or to forgo the opportunity for his child to learn to cope
with--or overcome--serious congenital learning handicaps through remedial assist-
ance financed by his taxes. Affluent parents, by employing private teaching special-
ists, will be able po cope with this denial of equal protection, which is, for me a
gross violation of Fourteenth Amendment rights, but all others will be forced to
make a choice between their judgment as to their children's spiritual needs and
their temporal need for special remedial learning assistance.

  Our second concern is that the determination of education tax
benefits for children, including those in church-related schools, is a
public policy matter under the control of the legislature rather
than of the judiciary.

  The State legislatures established the State public schools with a
monopoly of the education tax in the mid-19th century. Many
families, especially in some sections of the country, did not accept
these schools on grounds of academic preference and religious con-
viction, but, with the dominant Protestant churches throwing their
political strength behind them, these schools have done much good
educational work in this country.

  However in recent years many parents and citizens have become
disenchanted with them. Many hold that the academic quality has
gone down, that the schools are not developing character, that the
concept of the child as a person capable of developing independent
intellectual habits has been widely displaced by a behaviorism
which seeks to manipulate the student--Lance Klass, "The Leipzig
Connection"--that many are not prepared for possible defense of
the country, that many are unemployable, and that, with the ac-
creditation process overloaded with teaching methods rather than
academic content, the intellectual level of the teachers has de-
clined.

  To heal old wounds and meet new needs State legislatures have
in recent years enacted many laws to provide tax benefits for
children in alternative schools, but almost all their efforts have
been struck down by the Court as though the legislators are chil-
dren without any sense of the public policy needs of their constitu-
ents. As a group which has in the past 12 years in Illinois spon-
sored eight parental grant bills, four of which passed the House, we
can attest that the most effective opponent of parental freedom of
choice in education is the U.S. Supreme Court.

  As a group active in the innercity, we have struggled to obtain
some form of tax-supported alternative schooling for minorities and
have argued that for the minorities the voucher would be a long
                                                  233

step forward to first-class status in this society, for it would give
them economic control over the schooling of their children. In this
respect incidentally on our last parental grant House floor vote, of
14 minority Representatives, 12 voted yes, with 1 present and 1
absent.

  Our third concern is that the relevant court decisions are based
on misinterpretation by Justice Hugo Black in the Everson (1947)
case of the meaning of the establishment clause.

  In building up his interpretation of the establishment clause,
Black relied almost exclusively on the successful struggle of Madi-
son and Jefferson in Virginia to outlaw any church or religion
being given preferential tax status.

  Black concluded that the establishment clause meant, among
other things, that neither a State nor the Federal Government
could pass laws which aid all religions and upon this base the
Supreme Court has built up its doctrine outlawing tax aid to par-
ents and children in church-related elementary and secondary
schools. As to Black's conclusion, Michael Malbin in his monograph
"Religion and Politics: the Intentions of the Authors of the First
Amendments" points out that not only was this the first time that
the Court outlawed nonpreferential aid to religion but also that the
congressional debates on this matter do not uphold the Court's
action. As to the new Court doctrine on aid to parents and chil-
dren, there is no logical explanation as to how the Court has been
able to use the defeat of the Virginia establishment to deny tax
equity to children in church-related schools.

   If Justice Black wanted to find out what the people at the time
of the founding of the Government meant establishment to be, why
then did he not refer to Elliott's "Debates," which in reporting the
debates over ratification of the Constitution in the various States
gives abundant proof that the people widely considered establish-
ment to be Government support of one preferred sect or religion.
Why did not Black study the "Annals of Congress," which as
Malbin points out, reveals quite adequately that Madison--while
privately thinking that an establishment clause was unnecessary--
urged in the congressional debates on this matter an amendment
outlawing the establishment of a national religion.

   If Black did not get his ideas on this matter from the struggles
against church or religion establishment, where did he get them?
Actually his ideas stem from the rationale behind the public
school, which justifies a monopoly of the tax for those who conform
and denies any taxes, even their own, to heretics.

   In a search for the logic of the law, we ask, if an equitable share
of the education taxation is denied to students in Catholic, Baptist,
Lutheran, and Christian elementary and secondary schools, how
come that the State and Federal Governments can provide all sorts
of loans and grants to students in Baptist, Methodist, and Catholic
colleges?

   Can the Court, using stare decisis, continue to hold to its unscho-
larly and harmful decisions in this matter? Perhaps so, for it has
the power to do so, but it is meeting a stiff resistance from within,
as the following judicial statements of dissent in Meek v. Pittenger
(1975) demonstrate.

   Thus Justice Rehnquist, with White concurring:
                                                   234

   The Court apparently believes that the Establishment Clause of the First Amend-
ment not only mandates religious neutrality on the part of government but also
requires that this Court go further and throw its weight on the side of those who
believe that our society as a whole should be a purely secular one. Nothing in the
First Amendment or in the cases interpreting it requires such an extreme approach
to this difficult question, and (a)ny interpretation of (the Establishment Clause) and
constitutional values it serves must also take account of the free exercise clause and
the values it serves.

   Thus Chief Justice Berger:

   One can only hope that, at some future date, the Court will come to a more
enlightened and tolerant view of the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise,
thus eliminating the denial of equal protection to children in church-sponsored
schools, and take a more realistic view that carefully limited aid to children is not a
step toward establishing a state religion--at least while this Court sits.

   In conclusion, we would be distressed to have any more Justices
on the Court who in this matter have prejudged our parental rights
and the rights of our children.

   We therefore respectfully seek to determine whether Judge
O'Connor recognizes that parents and children have rights that
have a constitutional life independent of church-State confronta-
tions; whether she considers that the determination of educational
tax policy is, with due respect for parents, a public policy matter in
the hands of the legislators; and whether she would reexamine the
scholarship, or rather lack thereof, on which the present Court
doctrine in this matter now rests.

   The CHAIRMAN. Senator Grassley?

                                               TUITION TAX CREDITS

   Senator GRASSLEY. I would like to have you give me your under-
standing of her position regarding tuition tax credits, where you
are quoting from, and the appropriate date of when she said what
she said.

   Mr. BROWN. Senator, as I said, there is no ascertainable record
as a legislator and none as a judge. We went over the journals--the
journals were gone over fairly closely. At that time--somebody
mentioned here 1970-73--there were no recorded votes in the com-
mittees in the Arizona Legislature.

   She was quoted in the Phoenix magazine of February 1971,
during a period when tuition tax credit legislation, S.B. 1161, was
an issue, as saying that State aid to private schools is "clearly
unconstitutional.''

   Senator GRASSLEY. Does the article make it clear whether or not
that statement of unconstitutionally was made in regard to her
understanding of the Arizona State constitution or the Federal
Constitution?

   Mr. BROWN. It was not clear.
   Senator GRASSLEY. If that was her view relative to the Arizona
State constitution, it is one thing; if that is her view of the Federal
Constitution, then it is quite a different thing.
   Mr. BROWN. It is not there, and it is very difficult to get any-
thing. Our people looked through all the records and everything
else.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Let me explain to you the difference between
language in the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution and
similar language in the Iowa constitution--my home State.
                                         235

  The Iowa constitution is more restrictive in regard to that and
more explicit than the Federal Constitution.

  I am not making any commentary on your position or to whether
or not there is any legitimacy to what you say. We ought to make
clear for the record when the statement was made, and you have
made that very clear.

  If you could expand on that statement--not now, because you do
not have the information; but if you could get the information, I
think that would be significant.

  Mr. BROWN. On the Arizona constitution, our main objections
still hold--that there are guarantees of individual religious free-
dom in the Arizona constitution, the Illinois constitution, and
others, which prevail as far as the protection of the rights of the
family and the rights of the parent, which prevail over any effort
to try to deny aid to a church school.

  No matter how tightly provisions are drawn, the rights of the
individual under the State constitutions--and I know this is so in
Illinois--the right of religious freedom is so carefully drawn as to
protect the right of the individual. I am sure that is the same in
Arizona.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I can only suggest this to you: If she was
referring to the Arizona State constitution, I am not sure that that
can be a basis for determining her views as to whether or not
tuition tax credits violate the Federal Constitution.

  Mr. BROWN. I understand that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Are there any further questions?
  [No response.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much for your presence and
your testimony.
  Mr. BROWN. Thank you for the opportunity.
  The CHAIRMAN. I think the time has come now that we will take
a recess until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. At that time the
committee will reconvene, and Judge O'Connor will be back at that
time for questioning by the distinguished Senator from Alabama,
Senator Denton.
  [Whereupon, at 5:45 p.m., the hearing was recessed, to reconvene
the following day at 10 a.m.]

Denton.

TESTIMONY OF HON. SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR, NOMINATED TO
     BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, U.S. SUPREME COURT--Resumed

  Senator DENTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Good morning, Judge O'Connor.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Good morning.
  Senator DENTON. At the outset, let me clear up what amounted
to a misunderstanding on my part yesterday. I had questioned you
on your personal views on abortion, and you stated during that
exchange, "It remains offensive at all levels," and stated that you
think it is a problem at any level.
  Then I thought I heard you say that you would not be in favor of
abortion even to save the life of the mother. After several others
had thought the same thing, and then having been questioned by
some news people, I did look at the transcript and so forth and find
out that that is not what you said.
  You actually said: "Would I personally object to drawing the line
to saving the life of the mother? No, I would not." You went on to
say: "Are there other areas?" Then you said: "Possibly."
  Therefore, I would have to withdraw my statement since it was
based on error in understanding you. I misunderstood you. I would
have to say that it appears that indeed you are not more conserv-
ative than I on that issue, and I would remind you that legislative-
ly the Congress has done what it could to outlaw or forbid pay-

                                                    (237)
                                                  238

ments for Government funding of abortion except to save the life of
the mother.

  That is where Congress drew the line but we could not go any
further than just stop Goverment funding for it. We could not get
into the legislation of abortion with respect to the public because
we were preempted by a Supreme Court manifestation of judicial
activism in the Roe v. Wade decision. Therefore, there is a real
problem of that judicial activism, and I am sure that not all of my
colleagues would agree that it is the wrong kind but, nevertheless,
there was that example.

  Therefore, I have learned that you are less conservative than I,
and as I go into the Kenneth Starr memorandum I would refer to a
previous statement of yours which said that you felt that your
personal feelings should not constitute the basis of decisions made
on this matter or any other matter in the Supreme Court, before
the Supreme Court, but rather that if there is a constitutional
principle which applies, it should be the determining factor.

  I submit that in the Declaration we do have the statement, "all
men created equal," et cetera, "endowed by their Creator with
certain inalienable rights. Among these are life * * *." Then in the
Constitution, in the Bill of Rights, article 5, "No person can be
deprived of life without due process of law."

  Senator East, as you know, has been conducting hearings to
determine whether or not a fetus is a person. I agree that that is a
very difficult question. I do not agree that it is difficult to deter-
mine that it is human life. I believe that that is irrefutable.

  I believe that, as I said before, our democracy is predicated on
respect, infinite respect, for human life. Socrates, whom we may be
proving right these days, has said that a democracy cannot work
because sooner or later the people will perceive that they can get
their hands in the till; elected officials will cater to that trend, and
bankruptcy will result. I think we are on the way to proving that,
were on the way to proving that true. We are trying to turn that
around.

  He also indicated that the majority would crunch the minority in
every case in a democracy. By our system we have been proving
him wrong so far--and I am justifying why I am going into the
Kenneth Starr memorandum and the abortion issue further.

  The Judeo-Christian ethic brought compassion into the picture.
The ethic did not exist as a religious principle in Socrates' day. He
tried to talk about a "one god" thing and they poisoned him
because he did not believe in all of the gods being the way to go.
Therefore, we do have a substantial portion of the world believing
in that God, and among those nations the United States has been
one of the more notable.

  That ethic of compassion applied to the dog-eat-dog majority rule
in the political sense, and the otherwise dog-eat-dog, free-enterprise
system, is in my opinion what has gotten us to the point where we
have proved Socrates wrong, have made a success out of democra-
cy. To me, compassion is the key to civil rights, to human rights, to
caring for the needy, to the survival of a democracy. If you break
down compassion, you will find the prefix "com"--with--and the
word "passion"--passion for what? Humanity, infinite, godlike hu-
manity.
                                         239

  The human life in the womb is the most needy, most dependent,
most helpless minority, for which--for whom, depending on how
you want to look at it--we must have compassion. Our real politi-
cal, economic, military, and psychological problems from my point
of view--and I thought of this a great deal in prison and after
coming home--all stem from our growing preoccupation--which
has been repeated over and over in history--as a nation becomes
more preoccupied with luxury than necessity, we have become
"me-istic." We have stopped thinking about the other guy as much,
our wife or our husband, our brother, our fellow of another color,
our colleague of another color.

   I believe that abortion is the opposite of compassion for that
being which needs it the most. I believe that history will prove that
once a nation goes that way, from an ethic like ours, as Nazi
Germany did, you immediately get involved with infanticide, eu-
thanasia, genocide, and the whole idea of selective murder. This
brings into play the question of the convenience of the existence of
that person which is based on human judgment. That is why I feel
so strongly about what might be called fetal rights, the right to
survival on the part of that human life.

   I do not believe, with you, that learning more about fetuses will
ever change the fact that there is life there, God-given life which
we do not understand, and we do not even know what makes grass
grow. How can we get into the process of deciding, for convenience
or for money--because that kid is going to cost money if it is
born--or embarrassment that we want to spare the 13- or 14-year-
old girl--and you have said that you are opposed to it for birth
control purposes.

   However, I want to know what you meant yesterday when you
said, "Are there other areas?"--besides saving the life of the
mother--and then you said, ''Possibly." I would have to say that
that is less conservative than that which Congress has indicated as
its collective will, and it leaves me befuddled as to where you are. I
feel I have gotten nowhere, in that you have said possibly there are
other areas. We could go on for perhaps a month, and if that is all
the specific you are going to be, I would not know at all where you
are coming from philosophically on that issue.

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, I believe that I recounted
previously for the committee my vote in the legislature on funding
in connection with the bill for providing medical care to indigents,
where I did support a measure that provided for certain exclusions
in addition to what was necessary to save the life of the mother. In
that instance it included instances of rape and incest, criminal
actions, and I supported that.

   Senator DENTON. However, the criminal action--a little baby to
be--is not involved in.

   Judge O'CONNOR. I simply was trying to indicate, Senator
Denton, where I had had occasion to vote as a legislator on the
issue. These are very difficult questions for the legislator because,
of course, people--many people--share your very eloquent views
and your very perceptive views on this most pressing problem.

   There are others who, perhaps out of different concerns, might
draw the line in some slightly different fashion or indeed in some
substantially different fashion, and these are the troubling issues
                                                   240

that come before a legislator when asked to specifically draw the
line. I appreciate that problem. I think I can simply indicate to you
how I voted at that time on that issue.

  Senator DENTON. OK. Well, with respect to some of those votes,
then, I would like to go into the document which has become
known as the Starr memorandum. I would preface that by a ques-
tion. You feel abortion is personally abhorrent and repugnant.
Would it follow that you believe the unborn ought to be legally
protected? If so, how and at what stage of their development?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, excuse me. Is that your ques-
tion?

  Senator DENTON. Yes. You have stated that you feel it is person-
ally abhorrent and repugnant, and that it is a legislative matter to
deal with it. Do you mean by that that we should legally protect
the unborn? If so, how, considering the Roe v. Wade activism from
the judicial branch?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, Senator Denton, a legislative body at the
State level today would be limited in that effort by the limitations
placed in the Roe v. Wade decision. I recognize that. If a State
legislature today were to try to draw the lines, it would have to
reckon with that decision, which of course places substantial limi-
tations on the freedom of State legislative bodies presently.

  Senator DENTON. Until that decision is changed or if something
comes up to render it subject to change, it makes your appointment
extremely important and your philosophy on that matter extreme-
ly important. Therefore, I hope you can appreciate the interest of
those tens of millions--and there are tens of millions on the other
side--who are interested in your position on that. I am not clear
that we have drawn much out. Let me get on this

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, I do appreciate the concerns
and the strongly held views of so many people on this issue.

  Senator DENTON. I understand that.
  On July 7, 1981, you had two telephone conversations with Ken-
neth W. Starr, counselor to the Attorney General of the United
States.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Excuse me. On what date, please?
  Senator DENTON. July 7, 1981, is my information.
  Did you state in one or both of those conversations that you
"know well the Arizona leader of the right-to-life movement, a
prominent female physician in Phoenix, and have never had any
disputes or controversies with her"?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, I am sure that I indicated that
I knew Dr. Gerster. Indeed, she lives in the same community in
which I live, the Scottsdale-Paradise Valley area.
  Senator DENTON. Yes, and you are acquaintances.
  Judge O'CONNOR. We have children who have attended the same
school, and I have seen her on any number of occasions.
  I had occasion, of course, to see her in 1974 in my capacity as a
legislator as well. She at that time was interested in the house
memorial 2002, dealing with the question of whether the Arizona
Legislature should recommend to the Congress an amendment of
the U.S. Constitution as a means of addressing the Roe v. Wade
decision. Dr. Gerster
                                         241

  Senator DENTON. Excuse me. I do not mean to be impolite but in
the interest of trying to stay within the time, the only part of the
question that I am--the question deals with whether or not you
said that you had never had any disputes or controversies with
that leader, Dr. Gerster. Did you say that, because the Starr memo-
randum is quoted as having had you saying that?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, I am sure that I did indicate
that and I would like to explain precisely why I said that.

  As a legislator, I had many instances in which people would
come before the legislature and espouse a particular position with
regard to a particular bill. I as a legislator was obligated to listen
to those views along with the views of others, and then ultimately
cast a vote. My receiving of information of that sort and ultimately
casting a vote, even if it were cast in a manner other than that
being espoused by the speaker, did not cast me in my view in the
role of being an adversary.

  I did not feel that in my position as a legislator, that every time I
voted against a measure that someone in the public sector was
supporting publicly in front of me, that I became an adversary. I
was not a leader in connection with the passage or defeat of house
memorial 2002. I was a legislator

  Senator DENTON. I understand. I really do understand the thrust
of your answer. It does appear, however, that the thrust that one
would take from that answer which was quoted is that you and the
right-to-life movement leader there really had no disputes on prob-
ably that issue. That I think might have been gleaned from that
statement. I leave that to speculation. It certainly would have been
my inference from it.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Well, Senator Denton, I think that it is impor-
tant to recognize that what I am trying to reflect is that because I
may have voted differently than Dr. Gerster would have, had she
been a legislator, does not mean that we are adversaries.

  Senator DENTON. Yes, I understand. However, there has been
much opposition to your nomination and public statements by Dr.
Gerster, which probably we will hear some of later, concerning her
opposition to many of your past legislative decisions. Therefore,
there was an inconsistency, not in what your attitude was or what
your statement was but I think with respect to the thrust of what
that inclusion in Mr. Starr's report might have been intepreted as
meaning.

  Did you tell Mr. Starr that you did not remember how you voted
on a bill to legalize abortion in Arizona, or that there is no record
of how you voted on legislation to legalize abortion in Arizona? I
believe we heard you say that you had some difficulty remember-
ing one, and you had to get it out of a newspaper because it was
not in the legislative records. Somebody in Arizona has said that
that was the equivalent of not remembering how one would have
voted on the Panama Canal issue.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, as I explained I think in the
first day of these hearings, with respect to house bill 20 I frankly
had no recollection of the vote. We voted on literally thousands of
measures and that bill never went to the floor for a vote. I tended
to remember with more clarity those measures which required a
vote on the merits on the floor. Committee votes are something
                                                    242

else: Technically speaking, you are not voting on the merits in a
committee vote. You are voting to put it out of committee with a
certain recommendation.

   In the year 1970, as reflected in the newspaper articles which I
eventually unearthed, house bill 20 was not a major issue at that
time in terms of having much public attention, in terms of having
many people at a committee hearing, in any other way. It was
simply not a measure that attracted that much attention.

   In addition, house bill 20 was destined never to go to the floor in
the State senate. I think it was widely known and believed even
when it was in committee that it would never emerge from the
Republican caucus. The votes were never there. It was a dead bill.

   Senator DENTON. Yes. Then it might be relevant to follow up:
You stated that some change in Arizona statutes was appropriate,
and "had a bill been presented to me that was less sweeping than
H.B. 20, I would have supported that. It was not." You broke off,
but you meant it was not introduced. Is that correct?

  Judge O'CONNOR. That is correct.
   Senator DENTON. Can you then remember why you did not sup-
port S.B. 216, which was a more conservative bill regarding abor-
tion which was pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee after
March 23, 1970, roughly a month before the committee's vote on
H.B. 20?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, was that Senator McNulty's
bill, if you know?
  Senator DENTON. The bill provided for therapeutic abortions in
cases involving rape, incest, or the life of the mother.
  I have just been informed that my time is up.
  It was Senator McNulty's bill, yes.
  May she finish the answer to this question, Mr. Chairman?
  The CHAIRMAN. She may finish the answer to your question.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, as I recall that bill it provided
for an elaborate mechanism of counseling services and other mech-
anisms for dealing with the question, and I was not satisfied that
the complicated mechanism and structure of that bill was a work-
able one.
  Senator DENTON. OK. Thank you, Judge O'Connor.
  With my time up, Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent
that a speech I made on August 26, 1981 delivered in Birmingham,
Ala., on the subject of adolescent pregnancy be made a part of the
record on this because it deals with the subject.
  Sir, I must respectfully submit that, considering the importance
of the matters being questioned into, although I am a freshman
Senator, relatively inexperienced, I feel quite frustrated that these
matters have not been developed in my opinion to the degree
required for such an important appointment as a lifetime appoint-
ment to the Supreme Court. I just would like to mention that to
you at this time as my feeling.
  The CHAIRMAN. All Senators had 15 minutes on the first round
and 15 minutes on the second round, except Senator Simpson who
is not here today for his second round and so waives it, and
Senator Heflin who has stated he did not care for a second round,
and Senator Robert Byrd, the distinguished minority leader, who
has not had either round on account of his duties.
                                                   243

  Senator, out of my great respect for you, I will call on Senator
Byrd and then come back to you for an extra 15 minutes which
will give you three 15-minute rounds, if that is agreeable.

  Senator DENTON. It will certainly offer more opportunity, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Byrd of West Virginia.
  Senator BYRD. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
  I will be very glad to wait and let the Senator complete his line
of questions. I have found that it is very important that a Senator
be able to finish his line of questions without interruption. I thank
you for allowing me to speak at this time but if the Senator would
like to complete his questions, I can wait another 15 minutes. I
have very little to say and I can say it in 2 minutes but I would be
very happy to wait.

  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Senator Denton, we will call on you
now and give you an extra 15 minutes.

  Senator DENTON. All right, sir. Thank you.
  The complicated mechanisms to which you refer, Judge O'Con-
nor, I would not think would be ruled out in view of the complexity
of the issue and so forth. I would have thought that you would
allow that those complicated mechanisms should be considered--in
continuance of your remarks, as we were broken off.
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, again I would ask you to
reflect on the fact that we are talking about the year 1970. That
was a time when at least my perception as a State legislator in
Arizona indicated that this subject was not the subject of the public
attention and concern that it is today.
  I did not perceive very much in the way of public support at that
time for the invocation of expensive counseling machinery in con-
nection with this area. It is simply something that was basically a
new approach being suggested in the legislature and I was not
satisfied at that time that that was an appropriate approach.

                                     STARR MEMORANDUM

  Senator DENTON. OK. You keep referring to the social awareness,
and so forth, and yet I keep remembering your statement about
constitutional principle. I believe that upon further reflection on
your part you might see a connection, and I believe you may have
already begun to see a connection between the constitutional provi-
sion for protection of life and due process maybe, and this issue,
and certainly the statement in the Declaration of Independence,
and so forth.

  The Starr memorandum makes no mention at all of your April
23, 1974 vote against a House-opposed right-to-life memorial which
called on the U.S. Congress to constitutionally protect the life of
the unborn. Was that discussed with Mr. Starr? If not, why not?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, I certainly believe that it was.
That memorial was the subject of a good deal of concern. Of course,
I have not seen the so-called Starr memorandum. I have seen
references in the newspaper to it but I did not see it. If I am
correct in your date, that is something that occurred after the
nomination had been announced, or the selection, rather, had been
announced by the President.
                                                   244

  Senator DENTON. Well, since this memorandum is such an impor-
tant issue with so many people and such an important issue bear-
ing on the subject we are discussing, I would ask permission from
the chairman to deliver this memorandum--a copy of it, it is
relatively brief--to Judge O'Connor, sir, so that she can ad-
dress

  The CHAIRMAN. The staff will deliver a copy of the memorandum
to Judge O'Connor.

  Senator DENTON. Mr. Chairman, I would respectfully request
that a copy of the memorandum be placed in the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.
  [Material to be supplied follows:]

                                                                   OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,

                                                                 Washington, D.C., July 7, 1981.

Memorandum for the Attorney General.

From: Kenneth W. Starr, Counselor to the Attorney General.

  On Monday, July 6, 1981, I spoke by phone on two occasions with Judge O'Connor.
She provided the following information with respect to her public record on family-
related issues:

  As a trial and appellate judge, she has not had occasion to rule on any issue
relating to abortion.

  Contrary to media reports, she has never attended or spoken at a women's rights
conference on abortion.

  She was involved in the following legislative initiatives as a State Senator in
Arizona:

        In 1973, she requested the preparation of a bill, which was subsequently
     enacted, which gave the right to hospitals, physicians and medical personnel
     not to participate in abortions if the institution or individual chose not to do so.
     The measure, Senate Bill 1133, was passed in 1973.

        In 1973, she was a co-sponsor (along with 10 other Senators) of a bill that
     would permit state agencies to participate in "family planning" activities and to
     disseminate information with respect to family planning. The bill made no
     express mention of abortion and was not viewed by then Senator O'Connor as
     an abortion measure. The bill died in Committee. She recalls no controversy
     with respect to the bill and is unaware of any hearings on the proposed
     measure.

        In 1974, Senate Bill 1245 was passed by the Senate. Supported by Senator
     O'Connor, the bill as passed would have permitted the University of Arizona to
     issue bonds to expand existing sports facilities. In the House, and amendment
     was added providing that no abortions could be performed at any educational
     facility under the jurisdiction of the Arizona Board of Regents. Upon the
     measure's return from the House, Senator O'Connor voted against the bill as
     amended, on the ground that the Arizona Constitution forbade enactment of
     legislation treating unrelated subject matters. In her view, the anti-E jrtion
     rider was unrelated to the primary purpose of the bill, namely empowering the
     University to issue bonds to expand sports facilities. Her reasons for so voting
     are nowhere stated on the record.

        In 1970, House Bill 20 was considered by the Senate Committee on which
     Senator O'Connor then served. As passed by the House, the bill would have
     repealed Arizona's then extant criminal prohibitions against abortion. The Com-
     mittee majority voted in favor of this pre-Z?oe v. Wade measure; a minority on
     the Committee voted against it. There is no record of how Senator O'Connor
     voted, and she indicated that she has no recollection of how she voted. (One
     Senator voting against the measure did have his vote recorded.)
  Judge O'Connor further indicated, in response to my questions, that she had
never been a leader or outspoken advocate on behalf of either pro-life or abortion-
rights organizations. She knows well the Arizona leader of the right-to-life move-
ment, a prominent female physician in Phoenix, and has never had any disputes or
controversies with her.

  Senator DENTON. If I may, Mrs. O'Connor, I would ask you to
read it because I am going to ask if you think that the memoran-
                                                   245

dum could be characterized as a fair representation of your record
on the abortion issue.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW as I understand, this memorandum was
made by Mr. Starr of the Justice Department

  Senator DENTON. Sir, I have no other
  The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. To the Attorney General. It was not
made by the witness, Judge O'Connor. I just wanted to get the
record straight on that.
  Senator DENTON. It appears, sir, the dateline, the heading is
"Office of the Attorney General, Washington, D.C., Memorandum
for the Attorney General from Kenneth W. Starr, Counselor to the
Attorney General." I have no
  The CHAIRMAN. Of course, Judge O'Connor is not responsible for
what some member of the Justice Department wrote to the Attor-
ney General.
   Senator DENTON. Yes, sir, I totally agree.
   The CHAIRMAN. However, we admit the memorandum for such
consideration as it deserves.
   Senator METZENBAUM. I wonder if the Senator from Alabama
could make a copy of that memorandum available to other mem-
bers of the committee, please.
   Senator DOLE. Yes, sir. I have one other here so we could make a
copy of it, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Staff informs me that copies of the memorandum
are being made available and will be handed around.
   Senator Denton, you may proceed.
   Senator DENTON. All right.
   Judge O'Connor, as a lawyer, would you say that this memoran-
dum could be characterized as being a fair representation of your
record on the abortion issue?
   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, it is somewhat incomplete. It
does not reflect my vote in 1974 on the funding of medical care for
the indigent, and so forth. I think it is not totally complete on that
issue.
   Senator DENTON. It has been represented or perceived by many
that that memorandum, which many understand to have been the
principal input to the President regarding your record, you might
say is a bit optimistic from the standpoint of those who are prolife
in its characterization of your record. That is why I brought it
forward.
   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, I can only comment
   The CHAIRMAN. If you will pardon me just a minute, now, Sena-
tor, if you are going to the process by which the President made his
selection, that is one thing. The question we are considering here is
her fitness for this position. I have no objection if you wish to ask
the question but I want to emphasize this: that we, the members of
this committee, will determine her fitness for this position and not
the method by which the President went about making his selec-
tion. That was his business and not ours.
   You may proceed.
   Senator DENTON. Yes, sir, I totally accept that admonition.
   Her statements in the memorandum are relevant to the issue of
deciding where she stands or figuring out where she stands on this
issue.
                                               246

  The CHAIRMAN. I think you can ask any question as to where she
stands on the issues but as to what the President had in mind
when he selected her, that is another question. I do not think that
would be appropriate, for her to try to interpret or imagine what
the President had in mind when he made this selection.

                                            PARENTAL RIGHTS

  Senator DENTON. Yes, sir. I do not remember asking her a ques-
tion on that but I certainly will not.

  On the issue of parental rights, there has been only one case in
which the constitutional issues involved in parental notification for
contraceptive services to minors have been considered. In that case,
Doe v. Irwin, a Federal appeals court held that parents do not have
a constitutional right to be notified of their daughter's decision to
visit a State-supported family planning clinic, at which place she
can be issued the contraceptives and so forth.

  Do you believe that the Supreme Court acted properly in allow-
ing this decision to stand by refusing to review the case?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, the Court has had several
occasions to consider the question of parental consent in the area
of abortion or contraceptive availability and so forth. I would have
to say that I think the questions in that area are still somewhat in
doubt. I do not know that we have perceived the full range of what
the Court's ultimate holdings will be.

  The Court has indicated in the Ginsberg case back in 1958 that
the Supreme Court has consistently recognized that the parents'
claim to authority in their own household is basic in the structure
of our society. I think that is an apt expression of the concern that
has been expressed in the Court, and certainly the role of family
values is very important in this area.

  On the other hand, the Court in the Danforth case ruled uncon-
stitutional, as you know, a statute requiring parental consent
before an unmarried minor could obtain an abortion, but the Court
did note in that case that it was not ruling that every minor was
capable of giving effective consent, so it left the question very
much open.

  In the Baird case in 1979, the Court struck down a statute which
required parental consent prior to the performance of an abortion
but the Court did not agree in that case on a rationale, and I do
not think we know what that might be. Certainly the Matheson
case decided last year from Utah, to which Senator Hatch had
referred, did uphold a requirement of notification to the parents.

  It certainly is my hope that every young person faced with a
decision whether to get an abortion, or indeed whether it is appro-
priate to get birth control supplies, would feel able and willing to
discuss that with the parents and get parental guidance. That is
my hope.

  I know that in fact in some families that kind of relationship
between parent and child simply does not exist. I suppose we all
realize that that is one of the failings of our current society, that
not every family functions in a way that facilitates that kind of
communication.
                                                     247

  Senator DENTON. However, where the family is in existence and
the 13-year-old wants an abortion, would you be in favor of her
being required under normal circumstances to have the parents
notified, and so forth?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, again without expressing a
view that could be interpreted as my position on any legal issue
that would come before the Court in connection with the subject of
how far a statute can go in mandating parental consent, I would
simply say that it is my personal view that I would want to have
the child consult the parents and have the parents work with the
child on that issue.

                                    RIGHTS OF HOMOSEXUALS

   Senator DENTON. In reconciliation, a bill which permits a child to
go to a place where that procedure would be in effect was passed.
Whether or not it is appropriate is going to be another question, so
I am happy to hear that you are in favor of that. The other system
of doing it gets 10 times as much money as the new one, where
they do not have to ask the parent about anything. The parents are
not brought in.

   Do you believe there are any constitutional limitations on laws
which might be passed by a State or the Federal Government
forbidding homosexuality, homosexual practices, or limiting the
rights of homosexuals because of their sexual deviance? For exam-
ple, do you believe that Congress has the authority to make rules
and regulations which establish that homosexuality is a cause for
dismissal from Government jobs requiring security clearance,
unless an honorable discharge from the military?

   Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, I can only say that the state
of the law concerning homosexuality is, in one word, unsettled. I
hardly know how to characterize the state of the law in this
particular subject.

   Back in 1977 in the Carey case, the Supreme Court indicated in a
footnote that it had not yet definitively answered the difficult
question whether and to what extent the Constitution prohibits
State statutes regulating private consentual sexual behavior among
adults. Then in the Doe case in 1976, a three-judge court had
initially ruled on the question and then the Supreme Court simply
summarily affirmed that lower court decision denying a challenge
to a State criminal statute prohibiting sodomy.

   Therefore, that is all we know I think at the moment on the
Supreme Court holdings in that area. The cases concerning the
rights of people who are homosexuals in connection with being
deprived of a position as an employee or having custody of children
are really very confused on the lower court level. Some of those
cases are working their way up to the Supreme Court and, I think,
pose some very unsettled questions on which the Court will indeed
be asked to rule.

   Senator DENTON. Thank you.
   How much more time do I have, Mr. Chairman?
   The CHAIRMAN. HOW much more time do you want, Senator? I
want to accommodate you.
   Senator DENTON. All right, sir.
                                         248

  The CHAIRMAN. Your time is up now but we will give you more
time if you want it.

  Senator DENTON. Finding out where she stands on other areas
where abortion would be permissible than to save the life of the
mother is an area of investigation which seems fruitless.

  The CHAIRMAN. Would another 15 minutes suffice?
  Senator DENTON. I do not know whether another month would
do, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, would another 15 minutes allow you to
complete your questioning?
  Senator DENTON. Unless Judge O'Connor wishes to expand or
describe in some kind of specifics what other areas she thinks
abortion is not offensive or should be
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, suppose we allot you another 15 min-
utes, which in all gives you a full hour of questioning.
  Senator DENTON. Would you care, then, Judge O Connor, to say
anything further about what you mean by other areas in which
abortion should be permissible other than to save the life of the
mother?
  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Denton, I understand your concerns
and frustrations and I hope that you appreciate my concerns and
my hope not to prejudge matters that surely are going to come
before the Court, if you see fit to confirm me for this nomination. I
feel the same sense of frustration in part as you do in having to be
somewhat careful about what I say because of the constraints
which I feel legitimately exist. I understand your concerns, and I
have tried to adhere to that line which has been indicated to me--
in my review of previous hearings--has been followed generally by
other nominees.
  Senator DENTON. Well, as no lawyer, I cannot gainsay your stand
that you are prejudicing the situation by giving specific answers on
a position regarding your feelings as to the permissibility or moral-
ity or whatever of abortion other than to save the life of the
mother. However, I will quote from the constitutional lawyer's
comments which I have submitted previously for the record, and
the chairman graciously, and the other members without objection,
permitted.
  He says that--

  One thing stands out supremely when a vacancy on the Supreme Court occurs.
The replacement should be deliberate, not impulsive. The public interest is not
served by a fait d'accompli, however politically brilliant. The most careful probing
and the most measured deliberation are what are called for.

  He maintains:

  Unhappily, the atmosphere surrounding the nomination to the Supreme Court is
one almost of panic. Considering that the liberties of the American people can ride
on a single vote in the Supreme Court, any politically or ideologically motivated
impatience should be thrust aside and time taken to do the job right. Plainly there
is no need for instantaneous confirmation hearings, and the most painstaking effort
should be made to fully know the qualifications, including philosophy, of the candi-
date. My first plea would be, therefore, do not rush this nomination through.

  I must admit the chairman has been more than careful to permit
in this case all the time he chooses to give to my questioning. The
problem is that I do not think I am getting the answers to which
the next part of this gentleman's memorandum or paper refers.

  He says:
                                             249

  My second misgiving relates indeed to the matter of philosophy. Some zealous
supporters of the O'Connor nomination, who themselves have notoriety as ideolo-
gues, have made the astonishing statement that on the Supreme Court of the
United States ideology does not count. They say, in other words, that it should be of
no significance that a candidate would have an actual and proven record of having
voted or acted on behalf of racism or anti-Semitism or any other philosophic point of
view profoundly opposed by millions of Americans. Those concerns are not dispelled
by a recital that the candidate is "personally" opposed to such a point of view. Why
the qualifying adverb? Does that not imply that while the candidate may harbor
private disgust over certain practices, he or she does not intend to forego support of
those practices?

  He maintains:

   Philosophy is everything in dealing with the spacious provisions of the first
amendment, the due process clauses, equal protection, and much else in the Consti-
tution. It is perfect nonsense to praise a candidate as a "strict constructionist" when
in these vital areas of the Constitution there is really very little language to
"strictly" construe. As to other areas of the Constitution, for example, article 1,
section 4, "The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year," to speak of
"strict construction" is also absurd since everything is already "constructed."

   The more relevant thing that he says is that:

   Broad and bland answers could of course be given to each of these questions, but
lack of knowledge or lack of specificity in answers would obviously be useful indices
of the capabilities or candor of the candidate. Fair, too, and important would be
questions to the candidate calling for agreement with, disagreement with, and
discussion of major prior decisions of the Supreme Court. Not the slightest impropri-
ety would be involved in, and much could be gained by public exposition of the
candidate's fund of information on these cases, interest in the problems they have
posed, and reaction to the judgments made. Even these few considerations make it
clear that the Senate's next job is not to confirm Mrs. O'Connor but instead to find
out who she really is, that is, what convictions she possesses on great issues. I thus
return to my theme that deliberativeness, not haste, et cetera.

   He ends by saying:

   Other vacancies may soon arise. The precedent of lightning-fast decisions in the
matter of choosing our Supreme Court Justices would be a bad precedent indeed.

   My only problem is that I do not feel I have made any progress
personally in determining where you stand on the issue of abor-
tion. I believe when you say "and there may be other matters," or
issues, or however you stated that makes it totally vague, and
therefore I find myself at a loss, considering this constitutional
lawyer's opinion.

   I have not determined your position, and William Bentley Ball
seems to feel--that is the name of this gentleman--that it would
have been desirable for you to comment on past Supreme Court
decisions because in the future the precise case will not come up in
that identical form. However, you have maintained that it would. I
will have to defer to your position on that but I do so with regret
because it makes it very difficult for me to understand where you
are on that issue with which I was so concerned.

   Thank you very kindly, Judge O'Connor, for your responsiveness.
I have to respect your position on this. I must note that Alexander
Haig took about a month to get through; Mr. Donovan in here did
not receive quite the polite application of questioning that you
have, but I do not regret politeness. I did not ask him any impolite
questions either.

   With that, Mr. Chairman, I conclude my questioning.
   The CHAIRMAN. Senator, do you have any more questions you
would like to propound?
                                             250

  Senator DENTON. I do not think they would be fruitfully put
forward, sir.

  The CHAIRMAN. I believe Senator Simpson, as I mentioned, is not
here, and Senator Heflin has indicated he has no second round.

  Senator Byrd of West Virginia.

       OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD

  Senator BYRD. Judge O'Connor, I have observed the hearings
from afar, to an extent, and I have been aware of the subject areas
of the questions that have been asked and aware of your responses
to a considerable degree.

  The fact that I have not been able to attend the hearings does
not in any way demonstrate a lack of interest in your nomination.
I told you several weeks ago that it was my intention to vote for
your nomination unless something developed which I did not fore-
see and which might otherwise cause me to change my mind.

  I have listened to the questions about how you stood on various
bills and why you voted for or against various bills in the legisla-
ture 10 or 12 years ago. I do not know of any more difficult
question that can be asked than "Why did you vote for H.R. 1476,"
or "Why did you vote against 1415," 10 years ago or in my case 30
years ago, in the State legislature. I do not know of any more
difficult question that can be asked than "Why did you vote for or
against this or that bill 2 years ago?"

  If someone were to ask me why I voted for the Panama Canal
treaties, I can answer that question. It was a very controversial
issue at the time. There was a great deal of opposition to the
treaties on the part of a lot of people who had never read them,
and who perhaps have not read them yet today. It was a matter
that was before the Senate for a considerable length of time, very
heatedly debated, and one which I can respond to questions on on
the spur of any moment.

  However, there are many bills which we voted on, many votes we
took last year which did not command my attention to the extent
that I can, at the drop of the hat, answer why I voted for this or
that amendment. Sometimes it is even difficult to remember that
such and such an amendment was called up.

  That is not to derogate those who ask such questions. It is simply
to say for the record that it is asking almost for the impossible in
some instances to expect a former legislator or a current legislator
to relate the details of why he reached such and such a decision on
such and such a bill at such and such a time.

  As a former State legislator in both houses of the West Virginia
Legislature, I voted on some issues there undoubtedly in a way
that I would not vote today if I were a member of that legislature.
I voted against the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and spoke I believe 16
hours against it; it may have been 14 hours.

  However, I voted my conscience at that time, and I voted against
the Voting Rights Act when it was first enacted, but I was in good
company when I voted against those pieces of legislation. Sam
Ervin, who is an acknowledged constitutional scholar, Senator Rus-
sell, and other Senate greats who were steeped in the Constitution,
for constitutional reasons opposed those acts, both of them.
                                         251

  For what I thought to be sufficient constitutional reasons--not
only sufficient but for compelling constitutional reasons--I voted
against those pieces of legislation, spoke against them, but I have
since changed my mind on the Voting Rights Act. I voted for its
extension and intend to vote for its extension again. The Supreme
Court has upheld the act. The great constitutional scholars who
presented what I thought were irresistible arguments in opposition
to those pieces of legislation apparently were wrong, and I feel that
I was wrong in voting against the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

  Therefore, I think that is the position that you are in as a former
legislator, and I have to take cognizance of those difficulties when
it comes to answering the kinds of questions that have been asked
of you. Again, I cast no aspersions or reflections on the Senators
who are asking those questions. They are conscientiously pursuing
a line of questions that they feel is necessary in order to put to rest
certain concerns that they have.

  Also, I can appreciate the fact that one's personal views need not
be compelling when it comes to interpreting the Constitution. Your
function will be to interpret the Constitution and to apply that
interpretation or construction to the sets of facts that are before
you from time to time.

   I can appreciate the fact that you may personally have a feeling
on this or that subject but, when it comes to interpreting the
Constitution, you are not supposed to let your own personal biases,
prejudices--if that is what they may be--enter in to it. I can say
that in my case I do not claim to be one who is without some biases
and prejudices but, if I were attempting to interpret the Constitu-
tion and construe it and apply it, I do not think I should let my
personal feelings intervene. I think it would be my reponsibility
under my oath to do the very best I could to avoid letting my own
personal feelings sway my judgment.

   It may be impossible. Perhaps one's subconscious feelings, his
personal feelings may come through. However, I respect the posi-
tion you have taken. Perhaps your personal views on many of these
things do not parallel my own, but I have faith that you are going
to attempt to interpret that Constitution and construe it and apply
it in accordance with the oath which you will take, and that you
will not let your personal views be the determining factor, difficult
though it may be at some times.

                                                STARE DECISIS

   I can also understand the desire of Senators to understand what
your philosophy is. For a long time I felt that the Supreme Court of
the United States was a permanent constitutional convention and
that it was setting itself up as a higher legislature than Congress.
Therefore, from that standpoint I am interested in what your
philosophy is, but it will go only to this extent: What is your
philosophy, if I may use that word, with respect to the subject of
stare decisis?

   I understand that others have brought up the subject, and it
seems to me that that is one of the very important questions that
should be asked. Recognizing the difficulty in answering it to the
satisfaction of any given Senator, I still would like to ask it again.

   87-101 O--81 17
                                                   252

Just how much weight will you give to former precedents of the
Supreme Court? I do not think that I would have been critical of
the Supreme Court of the United States in the recent past if I had
felt that the Justices on that Court were adhering to the doctrine
of stare decisis a little more closely than what they apparently, to
me at least, were demonstrating.

  How do you feel about that doctrine? Is it going to be a doctrine
that will be a supervening one, one that you will be always con-
scious of as you deal with cases that come before the Court? Just
how will you be guided by previous decisions and by the previous
precedents that have been laid down by the Court?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Byrd, I have addressed this same ques-
tion previously, as you were aware, and will characterize again my
thoughts on this concept.

  The doctrine of stare decisis is a very significant and important
one for the judicial system in our country. Indeed, it is a very basic
concept in our system. The reason for it, of course, is to give
predictibility and stability to the law, an effort so that the public
generally and other judges can be guided by the knowledge that
the law in a certain area has been decided. Indeed, as one previous
famous judge has indicated, sometimes it is better that the law be
decided than that it be decided correctly.

  On the other hand, all appellate courts have recognized that
there are instances when the judges become convinced in their own
minds that a previous decision was decided incorrectly or was
based on some flawed understanding of the previous judges of the
issues or principles involved. We have examples throughout our
system of instances in which a subsequent case has overruled a
previous holding, so it happens. It happens perhaps not frequently
but it occurs, and it is appropriate that it can occur.

  Certainly, as Justice Cardozo pointed out, if we approached every
case on a case-by-case basis the law would be hopelessly confused
and the administration of justice would be impossible. We do not do
that, but at the constitutional level there have been indications
that only if the Court has the capacity to change its mind, if you
will, on the correctness or principles of a previous decision, is it
possible for an erroneous interpretation of the Constitution to be
corrected. It is either that, or we amend the Constitution.

  Therefore, we have instances in the Court's history, of the U.S.
Supreme Court, in fact approaching perhaps 150 such instances in
the Court's history in which the Court has in effect overturned a
previous decision. We have, I think, an indication from the Court
that in the case of statutory interpretation--for instance, when the
Court has occasion to rule on the interpretation of a statute en-
acted by Congress--if indeed that interpretation is erroneous the
Congress itself can take appropriate action, presumably, to make
corrections. Therefore, the doctrine of stare decisis might indicate
that one would be very much more reluctant to change.

  I think in essence that sets forth my understanding of the con-
cept.

  Senator BYRD. Well, do I understand you to say that while you
recognize that new precedents have to be set and that from time to
time the Court has to reverse previous precedents, that nonetheless
the doctrine of stare decisis is a sound one and that it establishes a
                                                   253

principle that you will constantly keep in mind, and as much as
possible adhere to where the circumstances permit?

  Judge O'CONNOR. Senator Byrd, it is an important and a sound
concept in my view and one which will always be appropriately
considered. Only when the judge or justice becomes convinced in
his or her own mind that something was previously incorrectly
resolved and that there are sufficient reasons for reaching a con-
trary result, would that obtain, but this is a very serious business.

  Senator BYRD. Judge O'Connor, I think that we strict construc-
tionists should feel very comfortable with that response. I am
applying the term to myself, and I feel very satisfied with it. If I
had been able to express it so eloquently and so succinctly as you,
were I in your position, I would have said just what you said.

  I think your responses reflect that you have been well prepared.
I think they have indicated on your part a juridical approach to
the questions. You have I think been as forthright as one can be
and you have been honest, in my judgment, in your responses. You
have at all times been conscious of the fact that you cannot go
beyond a certain line in responding to questions, lest once you have
been confirmed you would find you have created difficulties for
yourself, in which case you either would have to act in a way that
left others thinking that you broke your word, or on the other
hand you would have to be untrue to yourself.

  I compliment you. I think you have demonstrated the demeanor
and the bearing that a Justice should have, and I intend to support
your nomination enthusiastically. I congratulate you, and I will do
everything I can to expedite the Senate confirmation of your nomi-
nation once it is reported from this committee.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you, Senator Byrd.
   Senator BYRD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Senator, do you have any other questions? Sena-
tor Byrd, do you have any other questions?
   Senator BYRD. NO.
   The CHAIRMAN. DO you wish to confess any other errors of the
past? [Laughter.]
   Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, if that happens you will find the
attendance will really swell around here. [Laughter.]
   The CHAIRMAN. Does any other Senator have
   Senator BYRD. Mr. Chairman, will you allow me to respond to
that question? [Laughter.]
   I have heretofore confessed to those errors, so it is not a matter
of news but simply a matter that I thought was appropriate for
this record in this particular instance.
   The CHAIRMAN. Does any other Senator now request any addi-
tional time? We gave the Senator from Alabama additional time
and we want to be fair to all Senators. Does any other Senator
request any additional time on either side?
   Senator BIDEN. Mr. Chairman, I would like 60 seconds to make a
comment.
   The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Delaware.
   Senator BIDEN. Mr. Chairman, I think that the line of question-
ing about the nominee's personal views on abortion is appropriate
and has been appropriately directed to her. I think her distinction
                                                     254

between her personal views and what she would or would not do as
a Justice of the Supreme Court is equally appropriate.

   If I can make an analogy, I think it would be appropriate for us
to ask the Justice, were it an issue, what her view on membership
in the Nazi Party would be and whether or not that should disqual-
ify her from the bench--and that is not an issue in that case, but
to make the analogy--but it would be inappropriate for us to ask
her how she would vote as a Justice of the Supreme Court on the
Nazi Party marching through Skokie, 111., or whatever the suburb
was. I think it would be inappropriate to ask her to comment on
that but I do think it would be appropriate, were it an issue of the
day as abortion is, to ask her what her personal view would be on
whether or not she should or should not be a member of the
American Nazi Party.

  Therefore, I think you have made the distinction well. I want to
publicly compliment my colleagues. I must make a public confes-
sion also. I was not at all sure that there was going to be the
judicial demeanor and the good manners and the good conscience
displayed by some of my friends who are characterized by the press
and me as the New Right. I compliment them on their demeanor. I
think their questions were appropriate. I think they conducted
themselves well, did justice to themselves and the committee, and
that your answers were equally judicious and appropriate.

  The CHAIRMAN. Does any other Senator have any further ques-
tions?

  Senator DOLE. Mr. Chairman, if I may just comment, I think
Senator Biden has done pretty well, too. [Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. Does any other Senator have any other ques-
tions?

  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, was the Senator from Kansas
asking for a vote on that last observation? [Laughter.]

   Senator DOLE. I would not want to have a vote on Senator Biden.
It would be too close. [Laughter.]

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Denton, did you want any additional
time now?

                                        COMMITTEE REPORT

  Senator DENTON. NO, sir. I would request that a written record
be made, a written report, of these proceedings. Is that in order?

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, all of this will be printed.
  Senator DENTON. A report written by the committee staff is the
request I am making, which I understand is distinct from the
normal transcript and so on.
  The CHAIRMAN. The entire hearing will be printed and reported,
and the committee's report will be prepared by the staff. If you
have any questions, why, you feel free to get in touch with the
staff.
  If we finish this hearing today, which I think we will do, then we
will place this nomination on the calendar for Tuesday. Of course,
any member can carry it over a week if he wants to, but at the
same time we wish to expedite it and to get action as soon as
convenient.
                                                   255

  Senator DENTON. Sir, I was informed that there is a provision
when you have a committee report for including supplementary
views, and that was the reason for my request.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is correct. Any Senator who wishes to state
supplementary views to the majority of the committee report will
have the opportunity to do so.

  If no other Senator has any other questions now, we are going to
excuse Judge O'Connor.

                               COMMENDATION OF WITNESS

  Judge O'Connor, before you leave I want to say that the commit-
tee as a whole I am sure has been deeply impressed with your
intellect and with your candidness, with your capacity, with your
dedication. We feel if the Senate confirms you here that you will
make an outstanding Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Judge O'CONNOR. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank all the
members of the committee and you for the courtesy shown to me
during these proceedings. I appreciate that very much.

  The CHAIRMAN. We will now hear from other witnesses. The next
witness is the Governor of Arizona, the Honorable Bruce Babbitt, if
he will come around and take the witness stand.

  Governor Babbitt of Arizona, will you stand and be sworn?
   Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?
  Governor BABBITT. I do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Have a seat. Governor, we will be glad to hear
any statement you wish to make.

   TESTIMONY OF HON. BRUCE BABBITT, GOVERNOR OF THE
                              STATE OF ARIZONA

  Governor BABBITT. Mr. Chairman, committee members, it is a
great honor for me to appear before you as Governor of Arizona to
testify on behalf of the President's nomination of Judge O'Connor.

   I have a written statement which I will submit for the record,
and in lieu of reading that I would like to simply summarize
briefly a few thoughts about this nomination.

  The committee has heard and will continue to hear from many
witnesses who will testify to Judge O'Connor's exemplary skills as
a legislator, a judge, a lawyer, legal scholar, community leader, and
family leader. I do not intend to cover that ground. I believe that
even those who are appearing in ostensible opposition to this nomi-
nation concede her exemplary character, intellect, and personal
qualifications to be confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United
States.

   In lieu of that I would like briefly to cover two other subjects:
The first, why it is that I appointed her to the Arizona Court of
Appeals several years ago; and, second, what I believe this nomina-
tion means to the Governors of the 50 States of this federal Union.

  The name of Judge O'Connor came to me in October 1979 as one
of three names on a merit selection list from which I had complete
discretion to name a judge for the appellate court vacancy. Now I
found myself at that time on ground somewhat similar to that
                                                  256

occupied by Reverend Falwell, Dr. Gerster, and others. Judge
O'Connor had a splendid and productive career as the leader, the
legislative leader of the Republican Party in Arizona. I was a
Democratic Governor. The other two names on the list were distin-
guished and qualified Democrats.

   I had occasion to consider how it is that a decision of this type is
made, and I had occasion to reflect on the fact that we had been
not infrequently political opponents. I had occasion to reflect on
the thousands of votes that she had cast as a member of the
Arizona Legislature, a good many of which I took exception with.

   It quickly occurred to me that however appropriate it may be to
compile a scorecard of votes taken on the many and diverse issues
that confront a legislator, however appropriate it might be to do
that to elect or judge a Governor or a Senator, that the appoint-
ment of a judge was a manifestly different process. It was not a
political process of compiling scorecards, and I submit then and
now that there are two considerations, considerations which I ap-
plied.

  The first and obvious one is the character, intellectual ability,
and judicial temperament of the candidate. I believe those issues
have been covered. They are obvious. I felt then and now that from
the written record and from the testimony you will hear, that she
possesses those in ample quantity beyond any conceivable doubt.

  The second legitimate question that I posed prior to making that
appointment was this issue of judicial philosophy, an important
one, an important one to me as Governor. I believed then and now
that Judge O'Connor is a judicial conservative, and I use "conserv-
ative" in the old and true and institutional sense of that word, a
quality I think perhaps best expressed in the decisions of Justice
Frankfurter, a quality that perhaps has been missing in recent
decades, or at least not fully present in recent decades in the U.S.
Supreme Court and elsewhere in this land.

   I believed then and now that she possesses the qualities of a
judicial conservative, with all of the implications that that phrase
has as we enter into a new decade where this issue of federalism, of
the role of the three branches of government and the interplay
between Federal and State governments is rapidly coming to the
fore as one of the great and important issues of our time.

   Lastly, Mr. Chairman, committee members, I would like to sug-
gest what this nomination by the President means to the 50 Gover-
nors of this Republic, partners in this federal system mandated by
the Constitution of the United States. I believe I speak for all of
the Governors of this Union when I say that, like the President
himself, we have become increasingly concerned about the status
and the quality of the federal system.

   Like the President, we have come to believe with increasing
strength and conviction that the system has become unbalanced,
that the Federal side of the system over the last few decades--
through judicial activism, through activism in the U.S. Congress--
has tipped to the point of eroding this fine balance that was con-
templated by the drafters of the Constitution.

   Believing that, I believe that the Governors of this Nation take
great encouragement and great heart in the President's nomina-
tion of Judge O'Connor. We recognize as, Mr. Chairman, you your-
                                                   257

self pointed out several days ago, this is the first time in 24 years
that a Justice nominee has come before this committee with a
background in the administration of a State court system, the only
judicial forum in this constitutional Republic where all of the
matters of daily life and business and social intercourse are fit and
proper subjects for judicial resolution under our Constitution.

   We take heart in the fact that for the first time in 42 years a
candidate comes before this committee with legislative experience,
again, legislative experience on the front lines in a forum under
our Constitution where all the matters of daily life are presented
as issues of first import, of general import, without the restrictions
that inevitably attend consideration of these issues at the Federal
legislative or judicial level.

   It is for this reason, Mr. Chairman, that I believe the President
has uniquely selected a nominee for this season in our constitution-
al and legal history. It is for this reason that I recognize with many
of you that this is indeed a historic occasion, and I simply urge this
committee to confirm the President's nomination unanimously.

   Thank you very much.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Governor.

   Are there any questions by any member of the committee?
   Senator BIDEN. I have one question.
   The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Delaware.
   Senator BIDEN. Governor, thank you. It is good to see you again.
My only question is, How many more Arizona residents do you
have ready for us for the Supreme Court? [Laughter.]
   Governor BABBITT. There are more in line, Senator.
   Senator BIDEN. Nice of you to come, Governor.
   Governor BABBITT. Thank you.
   Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman?
   The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Arizona.
   Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman.
   Thank you, Governor Babbitt, for being here. I know with the
business of your office, the ^apportionment that is under way and
different things, to take the time to come out here
   Governor BABBITT. Senator DeConcini, excuse me. Let me assure
you that your district is safe. [Laughter.]
   Senator DECONCINI. That was the question: I wanted to be sure
that you were not trying to make three Senators.
   I want to point out to the committee that Governor Babbitt has
established a policy for some time, since he has been in office and
even before when he was an attorney general, to select judges on
their merits. He has appointed a number of Republican judges to
the appellate court and the superior court in Arizona, Sandra
O'Connor being only one--obviously an outstanding example for all
State Governors and one that I truly believe the President looked
at closely in his selection process.
   I am very proud that Arizona has been able to step out of the
political arena of selecting judges. Indeed, Governor Babbitt de-
serves the great credit. I wanted to call that to the attention of my
colleagues here and for the record.
   Thank you, Governor.
   Governor BABBITT. Thank you, sir.
                                                   258

  The CHAIRMAN. Governor, congratulations on selecting judges on
their merit, including the Republicans. [Laughter.]

  If there are no other questions, we will now excuse you. Thank
you very much for your appearance.

  Governor BABBITT. Mr. Chairman, thank you.

                                                                       \

          Statement submitted by

          Arizona Governor Bruce Babbitt

, *       to Senate Judiciary Committee

          September 11, 1981

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

         I am honored to appear before this Committee to testify on
behalf of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor as President Reagan's nominee
to the United States Supreme Court.

         This Committee will hear from many witnesses regarding
Judge O'Connor's outstanding record as student and law review
editor, her exemplary family life, her achievements as a State
Legislator and Senate Majority Leader, Prosecutor, private prac-
titioner, Assistant State Attorney General, Trial Court Judge,
Appellate Court Judge, and community leader. The richness,
diversity and depth of her experience and her impeccable character
have been attested by all, even those ,\ho appear in ostensible
opposition to her nomination.

         I appear today sharing some common ground with Reverend
Falwell, Dr. Gerster and Mr. Lofton for I too have had my differences
with Judge O'Connor. Prior to becoming a judge, Mrs. O'Connor
served as the Republican Majority Leader of the Arizona Legislature.
I am a Democrat.

         Two years ago, in October of 1979, I had occasion to reflect
seriously on our political differences when her name appeared on
a list of three lawyers, two Democrats and one Republican, submitted
to me by a merit panel for a seat on the Arizona Court of Appeals.
Under the Arizona Constitution, I had complete discretion to
select from that list. I selected Mrs. O'Connor despite the fact
that I did not share many of her political views. I selected her
even though T could find fault with some or even many of the
thousands of votes she had cast during her legislative career.

         It occurred to me then that compiling a scorecard of legis-
lative votes may be the correct way to select a Senator or a
                                     260

Governor. 6ut it is manifestly the wrong way to select a judge.
The judicial function is distinctive, separate and apart from the
legislative function. The judge's job is not to compile a score-
card for review by the Americans for Democratic Action or the
Americans for Constitutional Action; it is to defend and interpret
the Constitution and laws of the United States.

          The criteria that I applied to select Mrs. O'Connor over two
fellow Democrats were essentially two. First, does she possess
the necessary traits of intellect, character, legal excellence and
judicial temperament? The answer was and is, yes, clearly manifest
by both the paper record and the witnesses before this Committee.

         The second proper question is whether she possesses a judicial
philosophy acceptable to those who make the appointment. My answer
to that question was again, yes. Mrs. O'Connor is a judicial con-
servative in the older and institutional meaning of that word, the
meaning best expressed for me in the opinions of Justice Frankfurter.
She has a strong sense of the tripartite nature of American govern-
ment, of the delicate lines between judicial construction and
judicial invention, and a feeling for the inherent limits within
which the branches of government must function if we are to maintain
that balance and tension that preserves our liberties and makes
government work.

         I would suggest one reason why this nomination has been
received so enthusiastically by the Governors of the 50 states.
Like the President, the Governors believe that our Federal system,
that two-tier division of powers between the national government and
the states, has in recent decades become seriously unbalanced. A
great deal of the erosion of our Federal system can be laid directly
at the feet of the United States Congress. However, much of the
problem also lies with the United States Supreme Court. The Court
in pursuit of worthy goals has not infrequently extended the reach
of Federal power in ways that have compromised and undermined the
ability of state courts, state legislatures and Governors to carry
out the responsibilities assigned to them by the Constitution.
                                     261

Many of us who believe that the time is now at hand to re-examine
these issues of constitutional ends and means are greatly encouraged
by this nomination.

         Judge O'Connor is the splendid product of a new generation of
state and local leaders who know the Constitution, who advocate
good and competent government, who believe in civil rights and
whose motives are untinged by racism, and who also understand what
John Dickinson meant when he compared the Federal system to a
Newtonian solar system, "in which the states were the planets and
ought to be left to move freely in their proper orbits."

          As your Chairman has pointed out, for the first time in
 24 years a nominee for the Supreme Court comes before this
 Committee with experience gained in the turbulent front lines
 of a state court, the only courts of general jurisdiction in
 this Republic. And for the first time in 42 years, a candidate
 appears before this Committre with experience in a state legislature,
 the only forums in this Republic where all the great and mundane
 matters of daily life and business surface to be debated and acted
 upon. However divergent this rich and variegated experience nay be
 from more common entry points, such as Wall Street, the Justice
 Department and the Federal bench, I believe that the Suprerre Court,
 its judicial business and our aspirations for a renewal of the
 Federal system will be greatly enhanced by the addition of
 Sandra Day O'Connor.

  The CHAIRMAN. We will now ask the distinguished mayor of the
city of Phoenix, the Honorable Margaret Hance, and a member of
the Arizona Board of Regents, the Honorable Jim McNulty, to
come forward.

  On account of the constraints of time, we are going to have to
stop the witness after 5 minutes. The blue light means your time
has started; the yellow light means you have 1 minute left; the red
light means your time is up and you have to stop. Our time is
limited.

  We thank you for coming. Would you hold up your right hands
and be sworn?

  Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

  Mayor HANCE. I do.

   Mr. MCNULTY. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. Have a seat. We would be glad to hear from you.

TESTIMONY OF HON. MARGARET HANCE, MAYOR OF THE CITY
                                  OF PHOENIX

  Mayor HANCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the com-
mittee.

  Mine has been a close and friendly relationship with Judge
O'Connor since we first met more than 20 years ago. I feel that I
know her very well. We have been active together in many proj-
ects, and she has been a representative in various community
activities concerning the government and welfare of the people of
Phoenix.

  These items give me the necessary showing of formal connection
but that is not really why I am here. Judge O'Connor and I have
been friends for many years. I like her. I respect her, and I know
her to be a good person.

  Perhaps the most obvious and most important observation that I
can make is, for the great office to which the President has called
her, any appointee must have unimpeachably good character.
Judge O'Connor has unimpeachably good character.

  In a world in which it is so easy to be mean and so few are kind,
I have never heard anyone reflect with one word on Judge O'Con-
nor's integrity. If the first quality for public service is character,
then you have a first-quality person here.

  The second major quality is ability. I am not technically compe-
tent to appraise Judge O'Connor's work as a lawyer, and I leave
that to others. I am, however, competent to observe that in the
many activities in which we have worked together she has been
superbly effective. She organizes the job. She does not waste time.
She effectively enlists the help of others. She gets the job done.

  I suspect that Judge O'Connor is a tough judge but also a fair
one. I am sure that she brings to the task of judging the quality of
human sympathy and compassion for others. There is not a mean
streak in her, but that is not enough. She has an affirmative desire
to help, to be kind where she can be kind, and to be generous
where generosity is possible.

  I expect that this spirit of comfortable rather than overbearingly
good citizenship comes from her comfortable family life. I know her
                                                   263

in her roles as wife and mother, and our community regards her as
a model of both.

  I think also in the zeal of her friends to portray Judge O'Connor
for what she is--a very splendid choice for this high office--we
may overlook a very human quality. Judge O'Connor also happens
to have a very lively sense of humor, a fine sense of proportion,
and a total lack of ostentation. As we used to say in the schoolyard,
she is not "stuck up." I think her fellow judges will find her easy to
get along with, and I think that is important, a valuable quality in
a court of nine.

  One last observation: Judge O'Connor has repeatedly shown that
she can take on matters which are new to her and quickly master
them. In the cliche of the day, she is a quick study. I have seen her,
on city affairs, time after time become involved in matters with
which she could not have been acquainted earlier but when she is
through, she knows her subject inside out. I suppose the legislative
experience contributes to this but perhaps that is why she was a
good legislator to begin with.

  Federalism has been mentioned. I would also like to add that
when she was in the legislature Judge O'Connor was extremely
helpful in providing local government with the tools we need to
help our citizens. I applaud--as Senator Laxalt knows from his
Federalism Commission--I applaud and I really cheer the perspec-
tive of someone who favors problem solving at the local level of
government, that jurisdiction which is closest to the people.

  I would like to say one last and highly personal word about the
special plus factor which gives me such extraordinary satisfaction.
I happen to have the honor of being one of the few women mayors
in the major cities of America. Women are making their mark in
Congress and the State legislatures, and at the lower levels of the
Federal court system, but everyone in this room knows that this is
an epoch-making occasion, this nomination of the first woman
Justice. As a woman in public service, and on behalf of women
everywhere, I express great pride and honor in being invited to
testify on this very great occasion.

   I have a vivid illustration, to illustrate the universality of this
feeling. On the morning that the White House called me to notify
me of the nomination, I started to get on the phone to congratulate
my old friend. I found that to be absolutely impossible. You could
not even dial the last number. After 4 hours I gave up trying, so I
decided to send her a telegram. As I was dictating it to this young
operator, the first two words were, "I am ecstatic," and the young
woman interrupted me and said, "Oh, boy, so am I."

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. We are delighted to have
you with us, Mayor Hance.

               TESTIMONY OF MAYOR MARGARET HANCE
        BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARINGS

                           SEPTEMBER 9-11, 1981

           MY NAME IS MARGARET HANCE. I HAVE BEEN THE MAYOR
OF THE CITY OF PHOENIX SINCE 1976. PRIOR TO THAT TIME I WAS
A MEMBER OF THE CITY COUNCIL. I HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN CIVIC
AFFAIRS AS A VOLUNTEER FOR MORE YEARS THAN I CARE TO REMEMBER.

           MINE HAS BEEN A CLOSE AND FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP
WITH JUDGE O'CONNOR SINCE WE FIRST MET MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS
AGO. I FEEL THAT I KNOW HER WELL. WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVE
TOGETHER IN MANY PROJECTS, AND SHE HAS BEEN A REPRESENTATIVE
IN VARIOUS COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES CONCERNING THE GOVERNMENT
AND WELFARE OF THE PEOPLE OF PHOENIX.

           THESE THINGS GIVE ME THE NECESSARY SHOWING OF
FORMAL CONNECTION, BUT THAT IS NOT REALLY WHY I AM HERE.
JUDGE O'CONNOR AND I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR MANY YEARS.
I LIKE HER. I RESPECT HER. I KNOW HER TO BE A GOOD PERSON.

           LET ME BEGIN WITH THE MOST OBVIOUS BUT I THINK THE
MOST USEFUL OBSERVATION I CAM MAKE: FOR THE GREAT OFFICE TO
WHICH THE PRESIDENT HAS CALLED HER, ANY APPOINTEE MUST HAVE
UNIMPEACHABLY GOOD CHARACTER. JUDGE O'CONNOR HAS UNIMPEACHABLY
                                    265

GOOD CHARACTER. I HAVE NEVER IN A WORLD IN WHICH IT IS SO
EASY TO BE MEAN AND TOO FEW PEOPLE ARE KIND, HEARD ANYONE
SAY A WORD REFLECTING ON JUDGE O'CONNOR'S INTEGRITY. IF THE
FIRST QUALITY FOR PUBLIC SERVICE IS CHARACTER, THEN YOU HAVE
A FIRST QUALITY PERSON HERE.

          THE SECOND MAJOR QUALITY IS ABILITY. I AM NOT
TECHNICALLY COMPETENT TO APPRAISE JUDGE O'CONNOR'S WORK AS A
LAWYER, AND I LEAVE THAT TO OTHERS. I AM, HOWEVER, COMPETENT
TO OBSERVE THAT IN THE MANY ACTIVITIES IN WHICH WE HAVE
WORKED TOGETHER, SHE HAS BEEN SUPERBLY EFFECTIVE. SHE
ORGANIZES THE JOB. SHE DOES NOT WASTE TIME. SHE EFFECTIVELY
ENLISTS THE HELP OF OTHERS. SHE GETS THE JOB DONE. I HAVE
NEVER KNOWN JUDGE O'CONNOR TO LAY DOWN A TASK UNFINISHED.

           I SUSPECT THAT JUDGE O'CONNOR IS A TOUGH JUDGE
THOUGH A FAIR ONE. AT THE SAME TIME, I AM SURE THAT SHE
BRINGS TO THE TASK OF JUDGING THE QUALITY OF HUMAN SYMPATHY
AND COMPASSION FOR OTHERS. THERE IS NOT A MEAN STREAK IN
HER, BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. SHE HAS AN AFFIRMATIVE DESIRE
TO HELP, TO BE KIND WHERE SHE CAN BE KIND, TO BE GENEROUS
WHERE GENEROSITY IS POSSIBLE. SHE HAS AN INCREDIBLE RECORD,
STRETCHING OVER ALMOST A QUARTER OF A CENTURY, OF CONCERN
                                     266

FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP AND OF FINDING WAYS TO PROVIDE THAT
HELP.

           I EXPECT THAT THIS SPIRIT OF COMFORTABLE RATHER
THAN OVERBEARING GOOD CITIZENSHIP COMES FROM A COMFORTABLE
FAMILY LIFE. I KNOW JUDGE O'CONNOR IN HER ROLES AS WIFE AND
MOTHER. OUR COMMUNITY REGARDS HER AS A MODEL OF BOTH. THE
CHILDREN ARE FINE YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY COME FROM A
LOVING HOME.

           IN THE ZEAL OF HER FRIENDS TO PORTRAY JUDGE O'CONNOR
FOR WHAT SHE IS, A VERY SPLENDID CHOICE FOR THIS HIGH OFFICE,
WE MAY OVERLOOK A VERY HUMAN QUALITY. JUDGE O'CONNOR BRINGS
TO LIVING A LIVELY SENSE OF HUMOR, A SENSE OF PROPORTION, AND
A TOTAL LACK OF OSTENTATION. AS WE USED TO SAY IN THE SCHOOL
YARDS, SHE IS NOT "STUCK UP." HER FELLOW JUDGES WILL FIND
HER EASY TO GET ALONG WITH AND THIS, I SUSPECT, IS A VALUABLE
QUALITY IN A COURT OF NINE.

           ONE LAST OBSERVATION. JUDGE O'CONNOR HAS REPEATEDLY
SHOWN THAT SHE CAN TAKE ON MATTERS WHICH ARE NEW TO HER AND
QUICKLY MASTER THEM. IF I MAY USE THE CLICHE OF THE DAY,
SHE IS A QUICK STUDY. I HAVE SEEN HER ON OUR CITY AFFAIRS
TIME AFTER TIME BECOME INVOLVED IN MATTERS WITH WHICH SHE COULD
                                     267

NOT HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED EARLIER, BUT WHEN SHE IS DONE, SHE
KNOWS HER SUBJECT INSIDE OUT. I SUPPOSE THE LEGISLATIVE
EXPERIENCE CONTRIBUTES TO THIS, BUT PERHAPS THIS IS WHY SHE
WAS A GOOD LEGISLATOR TO BEGIN WITH. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO
ADD THAT, WHEN SHE WAS IN THE LEGISLATURE, JUDGE O'CONNOR WAS
EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN PROVIDING LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE
TOOLS WE NEED TO HELP OUR CITIZENS. I APPLAUD THE PERSPECTIVE
OF SOMEONE WHO FAVORS PROBLEM-SOLVING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF
GOVERNMENT-THAT JURISDICTION WHICH IS CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE.

           LET ME SAY ONE LAST AND HIGHLY PERSONAL WORD.
THERE IS A SPECIAL PLUS FACTOR WHICH GIVES ME EXTRAORDINARY
SATISFACTION. I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING ONE OF THE FEW
WOMEN MAYORS IN THE MAJOR CITIES OF AMERICA. WOMEN ARE
MAKING THEIR MARK IN CONGRESS, IN THE STATE LEGISLATURES,
AND AT THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM.

           YET EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM KNOWS THAT THIS IS AN
EPOCH-MAKING OCCASION FOR THIS IS THE NOMINATION OF THE FIRST

      JUSTICE IN THE HISTORY QF THE UNITED STATES. AS A
       IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND ON BEHALF OF WOMEN EVERYWHERE,
I EXPRESS GREAT PRIDE AND HONOR IN BEING INVITED TO TESTIFY
ON THIS VERY GREAT OCCASION.

                                       268

            I HAD A VIVID ILLUSTRATION OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF

 THIS HAPPY SENSE WHEN THE WHITE HOUSE CALLED ME TO TELL ME

 OF THE APPOINTMENT. I IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO REACH MY OLD

 FRIEND ON THE PHONE TO CONGRATULATE HER, BUT THE CAUSE WAS

 HOPELESS; EVERYONE ELSE WAS DOING THE SAME THING. FOUR HOURS

LATER I DECIDED TO SEND HER A TELEGRAM WHICH I BEGAN

DICTATING TO AN OPERATOR. MY MESSAGE STARTED, "I AM

ECSTATIC ..." AND THE YOUNG WOMAN INTERRUPTED TO SAY,

"OH BOY, SO AM I!"

  The CHAIRMAN. W e will now hear from Mr. McNulty.
  TESTIMONY OF JAMES McNULTY, MEMBER, ARIZONA BOARD

                                  OF REGENTS
  Mr. MCNULTY. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, may it
please the committee, I am James McNulty, a real country lawyer
in a community that seems to have an extraordinary number of
like claimants. I am a private citizen, here at my own expense,
from a copper mining camp in Arizona on the mountains of the
Mexican border, Bisbee, my home for the last 31 years.
  Not long ago I had the opportunity of serving in the Arizona
State Senate for three terms, terms that overlapped the service of
Judge O'Connor in the same body. My testimony is based on that
service, on the very close relationships in such a small group, only
30 persons, and relationships built up in the close and sometimes
fierce atmosphere of legislative activities.
  I want to address an area important to me and one unaddressed
by the publicity I have seen thus far touching upon this important
nomination.
   In 1972, Judge O'Connor led a successful legislative effort to
move the noncriminal problems of alcoholism out of the criminal
justice system. It was a progressive and thoughtful bill aimed at
America s principle drug problem, alcohol.
  It freed highly trained officers and expensive equipment and
massive blocks of judicial time from the pathetically monotonous
chores of booking, fingerprinting, photographing, arraigning, and
sentencing public drunks. It put these unfortunates into a program
where they are exposed to expert remedial help, and where some
began better lives and began feeling better about themselves.
  Today in Arizona there is no crime of being drunk in public, but
there is a speedy trip to a so-called local alcoholism reception
                                         269

center, a trip that marks the beginning and the end of the role of
the police and all the rest of the law-enforcement apparatus.

  The legislation incorporated uncommon vision, hard-headed real-
ism, and high legislative skill. It addressed a corrosive problem on
its own terms, and that lengthy law was unconcerned with what I
would call orthodox trivialities. It deserves national attention. It
suggests a system that can work, and it testifies to the broadness of
this nominee's interests and skills.

  We liberals occasionally make the mistake of believing that con-
servatives are inevitably and necessarily callous in social matters.
It ain't so, and this is an important opportunity to say so, and
simultaneously a superb occasion to give witness to the praisewor-
thy concerns of this nominee as a public servant in an area of her
life which has not been discussed heretofore much, if at all.

  This concern of hers only adds another dimension to a person
who already has quite a few strings to her bow. I know her to be
intelligent and fair minded, to be judicious and patient. I suppose,
the way the world works, the first woman Supreme Court Justice
has to be superior to most male nominees. Well, she probably is.
She does more things better than anyone else I know, male or
female.

   She knows when to talk and when to listen, and that following
rules in the absence of any other direction is well advised, although
the first rule is to suspend all the other rules when commonsense
demands. In short, I think our citizens are, by a disposition toward
fairness, ready for a woman for all seasons.

   If you approve her, as I most heartily recommend you do, then
you do a service to our Nation, to the legal system of this country,
and you begin what would be--even in the absence of the high
skills of this nominee--a wholesome, fuller view of our society.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. We are very pleased to
have you with us, Mr. McNulty, and we thank you both for your
appearance here today.
   Are there any questions that any member has? Do any commit-
tee members have any questions?
   [No response.]
   The CHAIRMAN. It appears not.
   Our next witness is Ms. Brooksley Landau, representing the
American Bar Association, if you will come around, Ms. Landau.
   Hold up your hand and be sworn.
   Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

   Ms. LANDAU. I do.

   The CHAIRMAN. MS. Landau, I believe you are representing the
American Bar Association.

   Ms. LANDAU. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. YOU may proceed.

TESTIMONY OF BROOKSLEY LANDAU, CHAIRPERSON, STAND-
  ING COMMITTEE ON FEDERAL JUDICIARY, AMERICAN BAR
  ASSOCIATION

   Ms. LANDAU. Thank you.
                                                    270

   My name is Brooksley Landau. I practice law in Washington,
D.C., and I am the chairperson of the American Bar Association's
Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary. I am here today to
present the views of the American Bar Association on the profes-
sional qualifications of the Honorable Sandra Day O'Connor of
Arizona, who has been nominated for Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States.

   Our committee has conducted an extensive investigation of Judge
O'Connor. We have interviewed more than 300 persons across the
country. We interviewed Federal and State court judges through-
out the Nation. We interviewed a number of practicing attorneys
and a number of deans and faculty members of law schools
throughout the country.

   We also asked a group of practicing lawyers and two groups of
law school professors to review the written judicial opinions of
Judge O'Connor and to give us their evaluations of those opinions.
We talked to a number of Arizona State senators who had served
in the senate with Judge O'Connor. Finally, three members of the
committee interviewed Judge O'Connor at some length.

   The purpose of our investigation was to analyze Judge O'Con-
nor's professional credentials--her professional competence, judi-
cial temperament, and integrity. Based on our investigation, the
committee has unanimously adopted the following evaluation of
Judge O'Connor:

   The committee is of the opinion that Judge O'Connor meets the
highest standards of judicial temperament and integrity. Her pro-
fessional experience to date has not been as extensive or challeng-
ing as that of some other persons who might be available for
appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States. Neverthe-
less, after considering her outstanding academic record, her demon-
strated intelligence, and her service as a legislator, a lawyer, and a
trial and appellate court judge, the committee is of the opinion
that she is qualified from the standpoint of professional compe-
tence for appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.

   I have filed with the committee a letter detailing our investiga-
tion and the basis for our evaluation, and I would like that letter,
Mr. Chairman, to be submitted for the record, if that is possible.

   The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.

   Ms. LANDAU. Thank you.
  I would like very briefly to summarize our findings.
  Our investigation revealed that Judge O'Connor is very intelli-
gent, analytical, thorough, and hardworking. The diversity of her
experience as a lawyer, legislator, and judge provides a valuable
background for the Supreme Court. She is dedicated to the legal
profession and has made significant contributions to her communi-
ty-
   Furthermore, the committee's investigation has demonstrated
that Judge O'Connor has an appropriate judicial temperament. Her
judgment is sound, and she is well respected by her colleagues. Her
integrity is above reproach.
  In conclusion, the committee has unanimously found that Judge
O'Connor has the professional qualifications required of an Asso-
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
  Thank you very much.

  The CHAIRMAN. Are there any questions by any member of the
Judiciary Committee?

  [No response.]
  The CHAIRMAN. There appear to be no questions. We thank you
very much, Ms. Landau, for your appearance.
  Ms. LANDAU. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are now excused.

                                               vestigation described below.

                                                            The Committee is of the opinion that Judge O'Connor
                                               meets the highest standards of judicial temperament and
                                               integrity. Her professional experience to date has not
                                               been as extensive or challenging as that of some other

                                               Supreme Court of the United States. Nevertheless, after
                                               considering her outstanding academic record, her demon-
                                               strated intelligence and her service as a legislator, a
                                               lawyer and a trial and appellate judge, the Committee is
                                               of the opinion that she is qualified from the standpoint
                                               of professional competence for appointment to the Supreme
                                               Court of the United States.

                                                            The Committee's investigation of Judge O'Connor
                                               was limited to her professional qualifications -- her
                                               professional competence, judicial temperament and in-
                                               tegrity. Consistent with the Committee's longstanding
                                               tradition, the Committee has not undertaken to make any
                                               determinations about Judge O'Connor's general political
                                               ideology or her views on any issues that she may face

should she be confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court of
the United States. These issues are not matters properly
of concern to the Committee. */

             The Committee's investigation of Judge O'Connor
included the following inquiries:

              (1) Members of the Committee interviewed a large
number of federal and state judges throughout the United
States.

              (2) Members of the Committee interviewed a cross
section of practicing lawyers, including government
lawyers, legal services and public interest lawyers and
private practitioners, both in and outside of Arizona.

              (3) Members of the Committee interviewed a number
of deans and faculty members of law schools throughout
the country.

              (4) Members of the Committee interviewed a number
of members of the Arizona State Senate.

              (5) A group of practicing attorneys and two
groups of law professors reviewed Judge O'Connor's judi-
cial opinions.

              (6) Three members of the Committee interviewed
Judge O'Connor.

^ 7 T h e Committee's approach in this respect is based on
well established standards of behavior governing the
conduct of those seeking judicial positions. These
standards, which are set forth in the American Bar A s -
sociation's Code of Judicial Conduct, provide that a
candidate for judicial office "should not make pledges
or promises of conduct in office other than the faithful
and impartial performance of the duties of the office;
 [or] announce his views on disputed legal or political
issues . . . ." ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 7,
11 B ( l ) ( c ) . Because it would be improper for a nominee
to address such political matters, it would be inap-
propriate for the Committee to evaluate a nominee on
that basis.

             Professional Background

             The Committee's investigation revealed that Judge
O'Connor's career has included service as a practicing
lawyer, a legislator, and a judge. She received an A.B.
degree with great distinction from Stanford University
in 1950. She received an LL.B. from Stanford Law School
in 1952. While in law school, Judge O'Connor was a
member of the Board of Editors of the Stanford Law Review
and was elected a member of the Order of the Coif, an
honorary scholarship society. She was admitted to the
Bar of the State of California in 1952 and to the Bar of
the State of Arizona in 1957.

             Judge O'Connor spent a year in 1953 working at
the San Mateo District Attorney's Office in California,
first as a law clerk and then as a Deputy District
Attorney. Thereafter, from 1954 through 1957 she worked
as a civilian attorney at the Quartermaster Market Center
in Frankfurt, West Germany.

             From 1959 to 1965, Judge O'Connor was engaged in
the private practice of law in Maricopa County, Arizona.
Her practice covered a broad spectrum of matters, in-
cluding contracts, domestic relations, and criminal
matters. She was also active in community volunteer
work, including work in county bar activities and ser-
vice as a juvenile court referee.

             From 1965 to 1969 Judge O'Connor was an Assistant
Attorney General in Arizona, representing the state
finance department, the state auditor, the governor's
office and the state welfare department. Then in 1969
she was elected to the Arizona State Senate where she
served two terms until 1975. During this period Judge
O'Connor was elected Majority Leader of the Arizona
State Senate and served as Majority Leader during 1973
and 1974.

             In 1975 Judge O'Connor was elected Superior Court
Judge in Maricopa County, Arizona. She was elevated to
the Arizona Court of Appeals, an intermediate state
appellate court, by Governor Babbit in 1979 and has
served as a judge of that court until the present.

             Through interviews of those who worked with Judge
O'Connor during various stages of her professional career,
the Committee learned that she has performed her work
very competently, has demonstrated a high degree of
integrity and has displayed excellent judicial tempera-
ment .

                     Interviews With Judges

             The Committee also interviewed federal and state
judges outside Arizona. Although most of these judges
have no firsthand knowledge of Judge O'Connor's per-
formance, those who do described her in favorable terms.
She was characterized as "intellectually well prepared,"
"very thoughtful" and "capable of mastering anything she
puts her mind to master." Many judges who do not per-
sonally know Judge O'Connor have a favorable impression
of her based on conversations they have had with their
colleagues. On the whole, the Committee found that the
judicial community -- both in and outside of Arizona --
supports Judge O'Connor's nomination.

             2. Interviews With Lawyers
             In our evaluation of Judge O'Connor, the Com-
mittee contacted about a hundred practicing lawyers
throughout the United States. We talked with a broad
cross section of the legal community, including lawyers
                        276

The Honorable Strom Thurmond
September 8, 1981
Page Five

who represent women's groups, minority groups, labor
unions, large corporations, individuals in civil liti-
gations and defendants in criminal cases. Without ex-
ception the Arizona lawyers who were interviewed reported
favorable impressions of Judge O'Connor, her abilities
as a lawyer and her performance as a trial and appellate
judge. They described her as "bright" and "objective"
and as a "quick study." Lawyers who have tried cases
before Judge O'Connor reported that she is always pre-
pared and runs a "tight ship" in the courtroom. These
interviews convinced the Committee that, although her
experience as a trial and appellate judge has been limited,
Judge O'Connor has demonstrated the necessary qualities
of professional competence, judicial temperament and in-
tegrity.

             Very few lawyers interviewed who practice outside
of Arizona are personally familiar with Judge O'Connor.
However, the uniform reaction of those who have a basis
for opinion is favorable. One lawyer aptly summed up
the comments received by saying that he would give Judge
O'Connor "high marks in every department."

             3. Interviews With Deans and Professors of Law

             The Committee spoke to more than forty deans and
faculty members of a number of law schools throughout
the country. Only a few of those to whom we spoke know
Judge O'Connor personally or are familiar with her work
on the bench. However, those individuals spoke favor-
ably of Judge O'Connor.

             4. Interviews With State Senators

            The Committee interviewed approximately a dozen
Arizona State Senators -- both Democrats and Republicans
-- who had served with Judge O'Connor. They were uni-
form in their praise of Judge O'Connor, describing her
as "an excellent Senator," "an enormously intelligent
person," "a woman of integrity" and a "very fair and
open-minded" person. The Committee was assured that
"she has no prejudices with respect to race, creed or
color."

             5. Survey of Judge O'Connor's Opinions

             Judge O'Connor's opinions and other legal writ-
ings were examined for the Committee by a group of prac-
ticing attorneys and by two groups of law school pro-
fessors. Those consulted expressed differing views con-
cerning the strength of her opinion writing. Judge
O'Connor has written relatively few published opinions
-- approximately thirty -- since she became a judge in
1975. She has also written two published articles. Not
surprisingly, Judge O'Connor's opinions deal almost
exclusively with issues of state law. For the most
part, the subject matter of her opinions is such that
they do not involve the elaborate legal analysis or
complex social issues often found in Supreme Court deci-
sions. Nonetheless, the Committee concluded that the
opinions are competently written and her writing style
is clear and logical.

             6. Interview With Judge O'Connor

             Judge O'Connor was interviewed by three members
of the Committee. Their impression of Judge O'Connor is
that she is an intelligent, articulate person who is
committed to the law and to equal justice and who is
concerned about people and their problems. She will
approach her new position, if confirmed, with enthusi-
asm, determination and dedication.

             Based on the investigation described above and
notwithstanding the fact that Judge O'Connor's profes-
sional experience has not been as extensive or chal-
lenging as that of others who might be available, the
Committee has unanimously found that Judge O'Connor has
the professional qualifications required of an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

             Those who have worked with Judge O'Connor des-
cribe her as very intelligent, analytical, thorough and
hard-working. The diversity of her experience as a
practicing lawyer, legislator and judge provides a valu-
able background for a Supreme Court Justice. She is
dedicated to the legal profession and has made signif-
icant contributions to her community.

             Furthermore, the Committee's investigation has
demonstrated that Judge O'Connor has an appropriate
judicial temperament. Her judgment is sound, and she is
well respected by her colleagues. Her integrity is
above reproach.

             This report is being filed at the commencement of
the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing. We will, as a
matter of routine, review our report at the conclusion
of the hearings and notify you if any circumstances have
developed that may require modification of our views.

                                                Respectfully submitted,

       TESTIMONY OF KATHY WILSON, NATIONAL WOMEN'S
                              POLITICAL CAUCUS

  Ms. WILSON. Thank you.
  I am Kathy Wilson, chair of the National Women's Political
Caucus. Accompanying me today is Susan Ness, director of the
NWPC judicial appointments project. In addition to my organiza-
tion, I speak today on behalf of 21 organizations, which include the
American Association of University Women, Arizona Women Law-
yers' Association, Federally Employed Women, Mexican-American
Women's National Association, National Association of Negro Busi-
ness and Professional Women's Clubs, National Council of Jewish
Women, National Federation of Business and Professional Clubs,
National Women's Party, Rural American Women, and the
Women's Equity Action League.
  Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
thank you very much for providing the National Women's Political
Caucus with the opportunity to testify before you in support of the
confirmation of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor, nominee for Associate
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
  The millions of women I speak for today are delighted by the
appointment of Judge O'Connor, the first women selected to serve
on the U.S. Supreme Court in its 190-year history.
  As a jurist, Judge O'Connor has consistently demonstrated those
qualities that are the foundation of the American judicial system:
the highest standards of professionalism, competence, integrity, ju-
                                         279

dicial temperament, and commitment to equal justice under law.
She enjoys a reputation of being fair and impartial. The extremely
high rating she was given by members of the Arizona Bar is
testimony to the respect and esteem in which she is held by those
practicing before her.

  Earlier in her career, she also distinguished herself as a lawyer
and outstanding public official. Her accomplishments are not limit-
ed to her professional life, however. In her private life as well she
has given generously of her time, helping a wide variety of commu-
nity institutions.

  Thus, we testify today in support of an individual who on the
basis of her past achievements shows great promise to become a
truly distinguished Supreme Court Justice, but our presence here
today is for someone who will be more than simply one of the nine
Justices on the highest court in the land. She will become the first
woman to hold that position in the 190-year history of the Court,
and follows an unbroken string of 101 Justices--all men.

  This confirmation hearing thus marks a historic occasion, the
culmination of over 100 years work on the part of women and men
to break down the barriers to equality for women and men in our
system of justice. Only 108 years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court--on
which Judge O'Connor soon will sit--in the infamous case of Brad-
well v. Illinois, upheld a State court refusal to admit women to the
practice of law on the grounds that women were unsuited for such
a role. Not until the turn of the century were women allowed to
practice law in most States, and only within the last 10 years have
all American Bar Association approved law schools opened their
doors to women.

  The advancement of women as Federal judges was equally slow.
Not until 1934, with the appointment of Judge Florence Allen to
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, was there a female
Federal judge. For many years she remained the only woman.
Despite strong support for her around the country, Judge Allen
was not to become a member of the Supreme Court--solely on
account of her sex.

   Only within the past 4 years have women begun to be appointed
in significant numbers to the Federal bench. During this period,
the number of female Federal judges jumped from 5 to 44, or from
1 percent to 6.6 percent of the Federal judiciary. Given the fact
that there are over 70,000 female lawyers in the United States
today, such an increase is not surprising; rather, it is long overdue.

   In applauding the selection of Judge O'Connor to the Supreme
Court, we caution against allowing that milestone to mask the need
for greater representation at every level of the judiciary. With
three-fourths of the U.S. district courts and one-third of the circuit
courts still male only, much remains to be done to bring about a
better balanced judiciary. Nor should we be content to see Justice
O'Connor remain the only woman on the Supreme Court. As va-
cancies on that Court arise, other women should be considered and
selected as well.

   As the first and, for now, only female Supreme Court Justice,
Judge O'Connor undoubtedly will be in the public limelight. That
is a tough assignment, but we feel confident that this particular
Supreme Court nominee will carry out that role with dignity,
                                             280

wisdom, and sensitivity. We of the National Women's Political
Caucus wish her well, and we urge the Senate to accord her a
speedy confirmation.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Any questions by any member of the committee?
  [No response.]
  The CHAIRMAN. If not, Ms. Wilson, we thank you for your ap-
pearance here today.
  Our next witnesses are a panel of two: Dr. Jack Willke and Dr.
Carolyn F. Gerster of the National Right to Life Committee. We
will ask these two witnesses to come forward.
  Will you hold up your hands and be sworn?
  Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

   Dr. WILLKE. I do.

   Dr. GERSTER. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. Have seats, and we will be pleased to hear from
you.

TESTIMONY OF DR. CAROLYN F. GERSTER, VICE PRESIDENT
  IN CHARGE OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, NATIONAL RIGHT
  TO LIFE COMMITTEE, INC.

  Dr. GERSTER. I would like to thank Senator Strom Thurmond and
the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for this opportuni-
ty to testify at the confirmation hearing.

  I am an Arizona physician, cofounder, and first president of the
Arizona Right to Life. I have served as director from Arizona to the
national board since its formation in 1973. I was immediate past
president and am currently vice president in charge of internation-
al affairs.

  I would like to preface my written remarks by saying that, as a
woman in a profession that is still dominated by men, I believe
that the nomination of a woman Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court
is about 200 years overdue, and I wish with all my heart that I
could support the nomination of this fellow Arizonan.

  I would like to comment on the Justice Department memoran-
dum that has been mentioned by Senator Denton, a memorandum
from Kenneth W. Starr dated July 7, 1981, summarizing his July 6
telephone investigation of Judge Sandra O'Connor's voting record
in family-related issues during the period that she served in the
Arizona State Senate. The memo reads in part:

  Judge O'Connor indicated, in response to my questions, that she had never been a
leader or outspoken advocate on behalf of either pro-life or abortion rights organiza-
tions. She knows well the Arizona leader of the right-to-life movement, a prominent
female physician in Phoenix, and has never had any disputes or controversies with
her.

  I was not contacted by the Justice Department for a verification.
This statement has been understandably misunderstood by mem-
bers of the legislature and the media to imply that Judge O'Connor
and I share similar beliefs on the abortion issue.

  I have known Sandra Day O'Connor since 1972. Our children
were members of the same Indian Guide group. We attend the
                                         281

same church; we have the same friends. She is a very gracious and
a very gifted lady.

  Quite apart from our social contact, however, we were in an
absolute adversary position during 1973 and 1974 due to Senator
O'Connor's position on abortion-related legislation when she served
as senate majority leader. The Justice Department memorandum is
misleading and incomplete regarding Senator O'Connor's voting
record from 1970 through 1974.

  All of the votes cast on abortion-related bills during this period
have been consistently supportive of legalized abortion, with the
possible exception of senate bill 1333, which actually is interpreted
as a conscience clause allowing physicians and hospital personnel
the right to object on moral or religious grounds. What the Starr
memorandum fails to mention is that this passed 30 to 0, supported
by those on both sides of the abortion question.

  In 1970, house bill 20 proposed to remove all restrictions from
abortions done by a licensed physician without regard to indication
or duration of pregnancy. This bill, which predated the infamous
1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision by 3 years, if passed would have
allowed abortion on demand to term. This was a radical concept
when compared to existing State laws at that time.

  The Justice Department memorandum states that "There is no
record of how Senator O'Connor voted, and she indicated that she
has no recollection of how she voted." Judge O'Connor has so
stated in her testimony. As a reason she gives "the literally thou-
sands of bills" that were presented during her 4 years.

   This bill was controversial. It was news in Arizona. It was op-
posed by the Catholic bishop. It was the subject of editorials. She
voted for it twice, in judiciary and again in the majority caucus.

   Despite the testimony given earlier, as indicated by Senator
Denton there was a choice. There was a bill sponsored by Senator
McNulty which was a more moderate bill. Judge O'Connor has said
that it was too complicated a mechanism. The bill would have
required parental consent for minors, cut off the abortion at AVz
months gestation except for life of the mother, and allowed for
informed consent of the girl.

   The Justice Department memo states in reference to the 1973
Family Planning Act, "The bill made no express mention of abor-
tion and was not viewed as an abortion measure."

   Rather than go on with my testimony which details the errors
and omissions page by page of the Starr memorandum, paragraph
by paragraph, as my time is growing short I will submit the manu-
script. I can say that I came here prepared to tear up my testimony
and to enthusiastically support Judge O'Connor's nomination. I
believed that, as she had promised, that she would speak on sub-
stantive issues, primarily abortion, before this committee. We have
not had that assurance.

   I am aware that despite the commitment given by the present
administration and reiterated in the Republican Party platform
that "We will work for the appointment of judges at all levels of
the judiciary who respect traditional family values and the sanctity
of innocent human life," that there are members sitting here that
do not agree with that. However, I think that all members of this
committee agree that misrepresentation, evasion, and distortion of
                                         282

fact have no place in the selection of a Justice to the U.S. Supreme
Court.

   Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Willke, we will be glad to hear from you.

  TESTIMONY OF DR. JOHN C. WILLKE, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL
                    RIGHT TO LIFE COMMITTEE, INC.

   Dr. WILLKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I am John Willke, physician and current president of the Nation-
al Right to Life Committee. I speak here for that committee, which
is composed of the 50 State right-to-life organizations which contain
almost 2,000 active chapters and an estimated millions of member-
ship.
   We are concerned. We exist as a movement because of the 1973
Roe v. Wade decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. Just as the Dred
Scott decision of 1857 was a civil rights outrage in that century, so
we see Roe v. Wade as a similar blot upon our Nation in this
century. In Dred Scott the Supreme Court ruled that an entire
class of living humans were chattel. This decision denied black
Americans civil rights and equal protection by law.
   Accordingly, let us flash back in time, if you please, to the post-
Civil War era, and ask a question. Suppose a nominee to the U.S.
Supreme Court at that time was being questioned and his qualifica-
tions examined. Suppose that that person as a legislator had previ-
ously voted for the continuation of slavery, not once but twice.
Suppose also that he had voted on a memorial resolution asking
the Congress to pass a constitutional amendment to abolish slav-
ery, and that that nominee had voted against that resolution and
for discrimination, not once but twice.

   Would not then it be a proper question to that nominee to
inquire whether that nominee still held those proslavery convic-
tions? We believe so. We also believe that if such earlier actions
were not totally repudiated by that nominee, that such person
would be disqualified from sitting on the U.S. Supreme Court.

   A century has passed. Another Supreme Court by a similar 7-to-2
decision--Roe v. Wade--has ruled that another entire class of
living humans were to be reduced to the status of property of the
owner--the mother; further, that the mother was given the newly
created right to privacy, a right that allowed her to have her
property--her unborn child--destroyed if she wished. Because of
this ruling and because of the Court's interpretation of the word
"health," we have a body count today of 1.5 million a year.

  There are indeed some single issues which are so fundamental
that they ought to be weighed very heavily in considering any
lifetime appointment to the Federal bench, among these, racial
justice. In 1948, G. Harold Carswell gave a speech in which he said,
"I believe that segregation of the races is the proper and only
practical and correct way of life in our States." During Senate
consideration of his nomination 22 years later, he completely repu-
diated that position, and yet the matter weighed heavily upon the
minds of many Senators, and quite properly so. Concern over that
earlier commitment to racial injustice perhaps played an impor-
tant role in the rejection of his nomination.
                                         283

  We believe that recognition of the right to life of the unborn
child is also just such a fundamental issue. Those who do not
recognize this right, we suggest, should be disqualified from sitting
on the Federal court.

   A nominee now sits before this distinguished body. You must
decide whether she is qualified to sit on the Court, and there are
serious questions. Her record as a State legislator is very disturb-
ing.

   In 1970, as a State Senator, at that time only one-third of the
States had legalized abortion and most laws were highly restrictive.
New York, in that same year, had passed abortion on demand until
24 weeks and was to be the second last State that legalized abor-
tion through statute. Thirty-three States subsequently voted on the
issue and voted down proposed abortion laws. The Nation had been
shocked by this.

   In this climate, Senator O'Connor voted for a bill that would
have legalized abortion on demand in the entire 9 months of preg-
nancy. No statute remotely as radical had been considered else-
where. This was not a casual vote on the floor; this was a vote on a
committee, after having studied it.

   Again, a year after the Supreme Court decision which did legal-
ize abortion in the entire 9 months of pregnancy, she had an
opportunity to vote against that sweeping decision. Again, on two
occasions she voted to maintain what has been abortion permissive
through the 9 months of pregnancy.

   She has recently stated that she is personally opposed to abor-
tion. In no way referring to the nominee, let me merely state that I
have never met an abortion chamber operator or an abortionist
who was not personally opposed to abortion. The simple fact is that
such a personal statement does not in any way relate nor is an
indicator of how such a person may view abortion for others, or in
the case of a public servant, how they will vote or how they will
rule.

   Finally, the last point is that many legal scholars are quite
convinced that the decision of the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade
was in fact raw judicial power and activism. The nominee here has
been held up as a constructionist. It would seem to us that in fact,
if she does not repudite Roe v. Wade, that that fact alone denies
that title and should deny her the nomination.

   Finally, in closing, I want to make one personal remark about
the lady who sits next to me. She is probably no more or no less
perfect than any of us. She probably has her faults. One fault,
however, that she does not have, and none of us who know her
could possibly imagine her having, that is, being vindictive.

   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. Are there any questions by any member of the
committee?
   If so, feel free to proceed. We will start with Senator Dole, I
believe.
   Senator Laxalt, did you have any questions?
   Senator Dole.
   Senator DOLE. Well, as I understand it, except for this one issue
you have no quarrel with the nominee. Is that correct?

87-101 0--81 19
                                                   284

  Dr. GERSTER. We are a one-issue organization, and that issue is
human life. That is, as an organization, our only objection. Yes.

  Senator DOLE. What about your personal opinion, then?
  Dr. GERSTER. AS I said in my earlier letter to the Attorney
General of the United States--to which I received no answer--
criticizing the Starr memorandum, I said that I believe that Judge
O'Connor, then Senator O'Connor, is highly intelligent, capable,
very dedicated, and a likable person.
  That, of course, is beside the point. We are not speaking of
personalities. We are speaking of issues.
  Senator DOLE. I think somebody mentioned to me the other day,
I guess the last time we had a hearing of this kind was in 1973
with Justice Stevens. Was the abortion question raised in that
hearing?
  Dr. GERSTER. NO, it was not, to my knowledge.
  Dr. WILLKE. To our knowledge, no, not to our knowledge.
  Dr. GERSTER. It was not an issue, of course, in 1973 that it is
today. Also, we did receive the commitment. I personally
  Senator DOLE. Excuse me, 1975.
  Dr. GERSTER. In 1975 it certainly was an issue, yes. No, I think
the reason that the--the prominence of the question
  Senator DOLE. The point I make here, you are talking about a
vote she made in 1970; but here in 1975 we had a nominee before
the committee. As I understand there was not a single question
directed to the nominee concerning abortion.
  Dr. GERSTER. That is true.
  Senator DOLE. It was an issue in 1975, at least it was in my 1974
campaign.
  Dr. GERSTER. That is true. You are very correct. In 1973 it was
not the issue that it was in 1975 but it was an issue in 1975. I think
the reason it has become what some individuals have referred to as
a litmus test is because of the assurance that we were given by the
present administration and by the platform. It was made a litmus
test.

  Dr. WILLKE. Senator Dole, I might also suggest that there has
been a considerable enlightenment of the people of this Nation, a
rather substantial, sweeping, slow change in public opinion, and
this has come to the fore in the minds of vast numbers of people
today, as our last election campaign indicated only so well. It was
not such a major issue before the minds of many of the public.

  We have abortion on demand until birth in this Nation today
because of nine Supreme Court Justices. The most crucial nomina-
tion that this group is going to sit for in terms of approval is that
person, those people who sit on that very Supreme Court. They
hold within their hands the power to stop the killing of the unborn
in this Nation, and for this reason it is a major and, we feel, the
most fundamental issue that should be considered.

  Senator DOLE. Right. I guess in essence, then, for your group to
support the nominee it would take a statement by her to in effect
repudiate that decision.

  Dr. WILLKE. Senator, we are quite aware that a person might feel
personally opposed to abortion. We are quite willing to accept that
that same person might feel that laws should be passed to permit
abortion. It would also be possible for that same person, however,
                                         285

to view the Roe v. Wade decision as an extreme and destructive
example of judicial lawmaking and be in favor of the reversal of
that, as a frankly unconstitutional amendment.

  We had hoped that Judge O'Connor would take that position. In
listening, however, for 2V2 days, we have heard nothing that would
give us an indication that that would be so, and we did believe that
she would be willing to speak to that issue. At least to our ears, she
has not.

  Senator DOLE. Again the question is, it would take that, a repudi-
ation of that decision--not a statement about judicial restraint or
strict constructionism or not being a judicial activist--it would take
an outright statement by her that she would in effect repudiate
that decision before your organization would support her. Is that
correct?

   Dr. WILLKE. We would want something of that type of assurance,
and we have received none.

   Dr. GERSTER. I think even the assurance that she now would
have voted differently on any of the other votes other than the
1970 vote--that was an extreme, radical measure, and that is the
only one to which she has addressed actually a regret of the vote. I
think that she has been very clear on other issues as far as busing,
capital punishment, and has stated that the vote in 1970 to 1974
expresses her view today. She said that on a number of other issues
but we have not heard this with abortion.

   Senator DOLE. NOW is that the same requirement you make of
candidates you endorse, that they repudiate Roe v. Wade1?

   Dr. WILLKE. In fairly direct language, we ask--our political
action committee does, as we sit here do not represent--we repre-
sent the National Right to Life Committee, Inc.--we ask that can-
didate to give us a clear statement if possible that they are in favor
of law change or constitutional change that would provide for
equal protection by law for all living Americans, whether they live
inside the womb or not.

   If said candidate feels that they do not wish to disturb the status
quo and will allow the killing to continue, then it is our opinion
that that position disqualifies that person from holding public
office. Just as I drew the analogy with slavery and feel that rightly
so, a proslavery position--regardless of whatever other position a
candidate or a judge candidate would hold--that position was so
ugly and so fundamentally evil that it disqualified that person
from being a public servant, so we feel that a position that allows
the continued killing of innocent unborn is just such a disqualify-
ing issue.

   Senator DOLE. Well, I think my record, my prolife record is good
but I

   Dr. WILLKE. Senator Dole, we are not worried about you.
   Senator DOLE [continuing]. But I am not the nominee. That is the
problem. It is not a problem, probably a benefit.
   However, I can recall situations, though--I might say just as a
matter of an aside--where I was not even permitted to be heard by
the prolife group in Iowa, for example, so I am not suggesting that
any of us are perfect.
   It just seems to me that those of us who sit on this committee
and also will be voting in the Senate certainly are concerned about
                                         286

the very statements both of you have made. I think many of us on
this committee have consistently supported those ideas.

  We consider that to be a very vital matter in our decisionmaking
process but I am not certain we can suggest that, if, for any reason
there is not total repudiation of Roe v. Wade, that we must vote
against the nominee. I cannot subscribe to that. I am not certain
what that does to me but I believe, based on what I have heard,
that she deserves strong support from this committee.

   Dr. WILLKE. Mr. Dole, all we can do is suggest that we feel it is
just that basic an issue. We can only suggest it to the distinguished
members of this body for your consideration, and we can only hope
that you will weigh it heavily enough to give it its just due.

   Senator DOLE. Thank you. I appreciate your testimony but it
seems to me that I would have hoped that you might have, after
2V2 days, found it possible to support the nomination.

  Dr. GERSTER. Senator, I wanted that with all my heart, I really
did. You have no idea of the burden that this has placed on me as
an Arizonan and as an acquaintance of Judge O'Connor. I listened
to every minute of testimony on public television and took exten-
sive notes, looking for some word.

  Highly disturbing to me, particularly was the answer to Senator
Kennedy's question, that intimated that more knowledge had been
gained but not a change of view. I thought that was a very unfortu-
nate answer.

  I felt, in answer to Senator DeConcini, her very strong personal
view was voiced very sincerely that this was personally abhorrent
to her, and then when Senator DeConcini asked if this had been a
recent change of heart and she said no, that this had been a view
she had held for "many, many years" based on her own family and
experience. I am sure that in conversations with her earlier, during
1973 and 1974, this was a view that she held then, that abortion
was personally abhorrent to her, but at the same time, of course,
her legislative record is consistently proabortion. That is what
disturbs me.

   Senator DOLE. However, I think finally that less than 6 years ago
the question was never raised, and today you are suggesting that
not only should it be raised but we should not vote for a nominee
who does not have the right position on abortion. That is a big
change in a 6-year period.

   I assume that nominee Stevens was carefully examined. I was
not on the committee at that time. I do remember the Carswell
nomination. You correctly indicated one of his problems but there
were others, and I supported that nomination. The vote on the
Senate floor, I think, was 55 to 45.

   I guess that is an indication that either somebody was not alert
in 1975 or that we have moved a long way in 6 years to say that if
you are not exactly correct on this one issue you should not sit on
the Supreme Court. Six years ago have the question not raised at
all.

   Dr. WILLKE. Senator Dole, might I suggest that it was being
raised. It simply was not being raised very loudly by very many
people, and it was not being heard. Also, Justice Stevens as I recall
did not have a legislative record and had not ruled on any signifi-
cant prolife or proabortion cases.
                                         287

  I recall being a leader of the movement, as was Dr. Gerster at
that time, and we simply did not have the strength, the organiza-
tion to approach it at that point.

  Dr. GERSTER. I am sorry. If I could just add one comment, I think
were this a Cabinet appointment, were it an appointment to any
other position we would not show the concern that we have. How-
ever, as has been pointed out, the U.S. Supreme Court has taken
unto itself awesome power.

  The power that enabled seven men to strike down the law of all
50 States, including Arizona, that is power, and there is no legisla-
tive recall, not the ordinary form of legislative recall. We may
anticipate 20 to 30 years in this particular position of power. That
is why the Court appointment is so important to us, Senator.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Metzenbaum.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Dr. Willke, it is nice to see you again and
welcome you back to Washington.
  Dr. WILLKE. Thank you, Senator.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Dr. Gerster, it is nice to have you before
us.
  I have concerns, whether it has to do with right to life or any
other single issue, as to what happens to the fabric of our democra-
cy if we are to elect or defeat people, or nominees to the Supreme
Court, based upon any one single issue. When Judge Mikva was
before this committee the issue was gun control. Now Judge O'Con-
nor is before this committee; the issue is right-to-life.

   Both of you are very intelligent people. Both of you, I am sure,
are good Americans, but I truly question whether you or anyone
else should judge any particular individual for elective office or
appointive office based upon one issue. The woman who is up for
appointment does not meet my criteria as to what I think a Su-
preme Court Justice should be. I would not necessarily have ap-
pointed her, but that, in my opinion, is not the issue.

   She has indicated by her comments that she and I differ strongly
on the scope of the first amendment, which I hold very high.
Should I, on that basis, vote against her? She has indicated her
views with respect to capital punishment, busing, a number of
other issues. She was not asked about gun control but, regardless of
what the particular issue is, should any member of this committee
vote for or against this woman and her confirmation based upon
one single issue?

   I asked her in the last couple of days about the question of access
to the courts, I am concerned about whether or not the poor can
get into the courtroom, whether or not they should be denied the
right to be in the courtroom because a case is below $10,000 in
value. She and I are diametrically opposed on that issue. She wrote
an article in which she made that very clear. Should that be a
basis for me to vote against her confirmation?

   She belongs to some clubs that, in my opinion, are discriminato-
ry. Should that be the basis on which I vote against her confirma-
tion? She has different views than I do as to the role of the
Government as it pertains to proper Government surveillance.
Should that be the basis on which I vote against her confirmation?

   More broadly, the polls indicate that there are a substantial
block of Americans--I do not know whether it is a majority, I am
                                         288

told that it is a majority--who approve of abortion under certain
circumstances. Should all of those people be denied appointment to
the Supreme Court of the United States, or be denied the opportu-
nity to be elected, because of the position that your organization
has taken?

  Frankly, it disturbs me, not because I do not respect full well
your right to take any position that you want--to me, that is
fundamental in this country--but what concerns me is that any
group holds itself out and says that on the basis of this issue, this
is more important than any other issue. That, I believe, is enough
to disturb all of us because I think it strikes at the very heart of
the system of government under which we live.

  Since I do respect both of you as good Americans, I find some-
thing un-American about any particular candidate or any particu-
lar appointee being judged on the basis of one issue and one issue
alone.

  Dr. WILLKE. Senator
  Dr. GERSTER. I would like to address myself to that also.
  Dr. WILLKE [continuing]. I think we have to make a distinction
between single issue and disqualifying issue. It is our opinion that
only once or twice in a century does an issue raise itself in our
society that is of such overweening and overwhelming importance,
that strikes so clearly to the very heart of the basis of our society
and the basis of the freedoms that this Nation has been built upon,
the most basic right of all, that unalienable one, to live.

  In the last century I mentioned one that arose, and I am sure we
have no disagreement here. For someone to have been proslavery
after the Civil War was certainly a single issue but I do believe it
would have been a disqualifying issue.

  For someone today, to pick another example, to be in favor of
killing of 2-year-old girls, would disqualify them from holding
public office. We would hold that so evil and abhorrent that we
would say that simply disqualifies a person.

  We have seen members of legislative bodies disqualified for
lesser issues--theft, charges of various irregularities--and our
Nation has turned them out of office on the basis that this issue
was disqualifying. Even certain personal actions, after hours, if you
please, have taken members of various legislative bodies out of
office, have been viewed by the voters as disqualifying issues.

  I would suggest that the killing of 1.5 million innocent unborn
babies a year is such an intolerable evil that it is that once-in-a-
century issue. You must respect--and you have said you do and we
appreciate the respect--that vast numbers of people in this Nation
view that as such an abominable evil, so utterly intolerable, that in
fact while being single issue it is that once-in-a-century issue. It
does in our minds disqualify a person from holding public office.

  Senator METZENBAUM. It does not bother you that the gun con-
trol people think that is the most important issue? It does not
bother you that the single issue prayer-in-the-school people think
that is the most important issue? It does not bother you that there
are so many groups who think that their issue is the only issue?
Now you say that this has become the overriding, the paramount
issue, but the fact is that a majority of people in this country have
not indicated in the polls they agree with you, and seven Supreme
                                         289

Court Justices have not indicated that they agree with you. Yet
you feel that by reason of your position that that is the paramount
issue, and that should disqualify this woman from being confirmed
to the Supreme Court.

  Dr. GERSTER. Could I address myself to that, Senator.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Please do.
  Dr. GERSTER. I think that this can only be supported in the
context of civil rights, in other words, by law, to deny the right to
life, liberty, or the pursuit of happiness to a group of individuals.
Like you, I have many other interests. I am much more interested
in ecology than the present administration would indicate. Like
you, I am opposed to capital punishment, though I see it as a
separate issue.

  There are certainly other issues, very important issues. I would
not call them disqualifying issues. Only a civil rights issue, I think,
is disqualifying.

   I think that you would agree that individuals should be disquali-
fied if they wish to legislate the return to racial segregation. I
think you would agree that an individual who carried the anti-
Semetic feelings so far as to believe in the superiority of one race
over another, with the legal implications that this suggests, those I
think are disqualifying issues.

   There is only one reliable poll, and that is the ballot box. When
you use the exception "for life of the mother" which National
Right to Life and most of the amendments before both Houses
contain, most polls agree that 60 percent of Americans would favor
an amendment that contained a "life of the mother" exception.

   However, what we want is not to impose our morality on the rest
of the Nation. We want the American people to have a right to
choose. We want this out of the committee so our elected legisla-
ture, the House and the Senate, have the right to choose. If two-
thirds so choose, then we want the people of America, three-fourths
of the State legislatures, to have that right to choose.

   We are not trying to impose a law on the Nation, but what we
did was have the imposition of a morality by seven men who
imposed their morality on some 210 to 214 million people at that
time. I think that this is the tragedy, that one individual or seven
individuals or nine individuals have that power. This is an ex-
tremely important position, and we cannot minimize that impor-
tance.

   Senator METZENBAUM. I understand it is an extremely important
position but my question really pertained to the fact that, you see,
I may feel a little stronger than you do about the right to life. I am
talking about those who are living. I am concerned about those
who cannot feed their families and who cannot clothe their fami-
lies and house them.

   I am concerned about that aspect of the right to life for those
who are the living, and yet I do not believe that because this
woman is far more conservative than I and probably would not be
willing to vote for many measures that I would be willing to vote
for, that that justifies on the basis of the right to life--whether it is
your concept of right to life or my concept of right to life--I do not
believe that that justifies my voting against her.
                                         290

  Were we to do that, I am not certain what kind of Supreme
Court we would have. I am not certain who would choose that
perfect person who would be as acceptable to Mr. East and Mr.
Grassley, and Senator DeConcini and Senator Metzenbaum and
Senator Thurmond. I am not sure how you could do that.

  However, what bothers me is that your group feels that this
issue, this issue is so paramount that you have a right--and you do
have a right to testify against her, and I respect that right--but I
do question the Americanism of any group in this country which
says that one issue is enough of a basis to be for or against an
appointee to the Supreme Court or an elected public official.

  Dr. GERSTER. YOU say that you support the rights of living
Americans. Senator, the baby within the womb is living. If the
baby within the womb was not living, it would not be necessary to
kill that baby.

   Now the Court decision has led to a bloodbath of 1.5 million. Of
that, in the last year tabulated, 130,000 were second and third
trimester. Now those are big babies; those are babies you can hold
in your arms. We had 13,000 of those that are babies 21 weeks and
over. These are babies that could survive in a prenatal unit of a
hospital.

  We have had experiments which have been described in medical
journals, 6 months after the Court decision, one of which involved
cutting the heads off 12 babies born alive by hysterotomy abortion
up to 20 weeks. The heads were then connected to a heart-lung
machine; the internal carotid artery was cannulated. The 12 little
heads were kept alive. I do not know how many days. When seven
men on a high court declare a child a nonperson, that places that
child in a separate category, and these individuals then can be
substituted for the rhesus monkey.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Dr. Gerster, I can only tell you that this
Senator does not approve of killing, whether it is of people in El
Salvador, whether it is of children in Colombia, whether it is of
starving children throughout the world, whether it is by some-
body's gunshot or some terrorist's effort. I believe that these, too,
are important issues, but the law does not always go the way I
think it ought to go.

  The country's actions do not always go the way I think they
ought to go, and yet I do not believe that we have the right to say
that any one single issue--whether it has to do with something in
this country or some far-off country--should be the basis on which
you or Dr. Willke or those you represent or I should vote for or
against the confirmation of a nominee. It will not be the determi-
nant for this Senator.

  Dr. WILLKE. Senator, I think it is important to note that the
leaders of this movement are, far and away beyond the norm of
this culture, caring people in the sense that they are concerned and
are activists in many of the concerns about people, welfare, chil-
dren who need homes, and so forth. We share much of that with
you.

  Our problem is that we simply--and let me put it very bluntly--
do not think we can solve poverty by killing the unborn children of
the poor. We do not think that the violence that you speak of,
                                         291

which we are concerned about, can be cured by the violence of the
destruction of the unborn. We must find other ways.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina,
Mr. East.
   Senator EAST. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to
speak very briefly.
   I would like to welcome Drs. Gerster and Willke. We had the
pleasure of having them testify before our subcommittee dealing
with the human life bill, and we are delighted to see you back this
morning.

   Just as one single Senator who is a part of this confirmation
process, I would like to underscore something that they have said,
and try to put it in the context that the distinguished Senator from
Ohio has put it in. I would agree with Senator Metzenbaum that
ultimately Senators on this committee do have to weigh the whole,
as they do in the Senate as a whole body.

   However, having said that and acknowledged it, I would like to
underscore what Drs. Willke and Gerster have said, that on occa-
sion--whether it is this issue or any other--there can be matters
that become of such overriding importance that they could well up
as, if not the litmus test, at least as a critical and decisive test in
making that determination. I am not suggesting for my colleagues
that this is so in this case but I am saying it is not an unreasonable
position to take, and that is the position you have taken.

   For example, if we had a nominee--which we have not had--but
if we had a nominee who had a tainted record, let us say, on their
attitude toward race, or if they had a tainted record in their
attitude on blacks or Jews or any other prominent group in the
great American melting pot, that would be looked upon as deeply
and profoundly suspect and perhaps infecting the whole, and it
would not suffice to come in and say, "Yes, but they are rather
strong on other things," or "They seem to make good sense on
other things." If we had, for example, a nominee here who had
very primitive attitudes in terms of the role of women in American
society, I am sure we would have distinguished colleagues up here
today saying, "That alone is enough to disqualify."

   Now the single issue problem some say today plagues and haunts
American politics, but yet I think Dr. Willke is correct. It is not an
uncommon phenomenon. We know in the sixties the antiwar move-
ment--frequently in a great, pluralistic democracy certain things
well up and people wish to express themselves on it. They feel if it
is not the litmus test, it is a dominant and overriding concern.

   I would like to say that I feel these two very distinguished people
come in that spirit, and with that kind of message. Whether it
solves the problem for any given member of this committee, let
alone for the whole committee, I do not know and I do not profess
to speak to that. However, I would like, as one member of the
committee, to underscore that their putting it in that perspective is
reasonable. It is not wholly inconsistent with American history,
previously, today, or in the future.

   I did want to just make that statement for the record. I know
time presses upon us, Mr. Chairman. I shall cease and desist, and
                                         292

allow my other distinguished colleagues to pursue what line of
reasoning they think is pertinent.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  The Senator from Arizona.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
  Welcome, Dr. Willke and Dr. Gerster. We indeed are pleased to
have you here, to have your expert advice. The research that you
have done and the commitment of your position here I think is
unquestionable.
  I have the greatest respect, Mr. Chairman, for these two individ-
uals, having worked with them in this cause and which many of us
profess and have a deep commitment to. I thank you for your
excellent articulation, Dr. Gerster, of the feelings and of the signifi-
cance behind the right-to-life movement.
  I wonder if, in the process of the testimony that we have had
before us today, realizing your dissatisfaction with the answers
from the nominee, you did give thought to the Arizona Legisla-
ture's very firm position of supporting memorial 2001 with only
three dissenting votes--many of those who cast votes are identifi-
able in their prolife position, and committed people to it. Also, if
you have had an opportunity to assess the significance of that
particular memorial or of the witnesses that have appeared here,
primarily from Arizona, who are identified as prolife?

  I find it a difficult situation, quite frankly, that your organiza-
tion has taken the position it has. I respect that, and yet many
other people for whom I have the deepest respect on that same
issue are coming to the conclusion that Judge O'Connor has made
as firm a commitment, either to them personally and quietly or
before this committee on how she feels about abortion. I wonder if
you understand the reservation that she or any other nominee
would have on saying how they would vote on a certain issue.

  I wonder if you would like to comment on that?
  Dr. GERSTER. Yes. I certainly respect the six members of the
Arizona Legislature that testified. Four of the six are outstanding
prolife leaders in the State, and certainly friends, one of them a
patient. I was listening very closely to their testimony.
  I had previously called Tony West and asked if the abortion
question had been personally communicated to him, that there had
been a change. I think his answer was what you saw reflected,
particularly in answer to Senator Grassley's question, "How do you
believe, based on what you know now, how do you believe that
Judge O'Connor would vote on an abortion-related case coming
before the U.S. Supreme Court?" All three of the representatives to
whom that question was addressed said that they had no idea how
she would vote, so they have literally taken this on faith.
  Senator DECONCINI. Excuse me. I think Tony West made it very
clear that he felt that she would vote a prolife position or he would
not be there, if that
  Dr. GERSTER. Well, no, not in his answer to Senator Grassley's
question. I wrote it down as each one answered. He said that he
hoped that if she had not, thus far, changed her mind, that she
would in the near future change her mind. I know, particularly
with that one representative, this is the paramount issue
                                         293

  Senator DECONCINI. Yes; indeed it is.
  Dr. GERSTER [continuing]. And I respect him greatly. I think that
they have gone on faith and trust and I hope that they are right. I
hope it deep in my heart. However, I really had to have some
assurance other than good will, which is all that they had.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no further
questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Grassley.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Dr. Willke, you stated in your prepared testi-
mony that in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court--and I quote from
your statement--"actually legalized abortion through the entire 9
months of pregnancy." As far as I know, the popularly held belief
is that the case did not go that far, so I would like to have you
elaborate on your statement.
  Dr. WILLKE. Thank you. There is a general misunderstanding,
Senator Grassley, out there, and it is incredulous to us that the
true facts of the matter have not emerged. Everyone agrees that
the Court ruled that there would be abortion on demand in the
first 3 months. This was to be at the request of the mother, who
had to have a licensed physician to do the job; no reason need be
given.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Yes.
   Dr. WILLKE. Their second phase spoke of the time from the end
of the first trimester until viability. The Court at that time esti-
mated viability at being 24 to 28 weeks. In fact, it is down close to
20 weeks now, so that phase of time is roughly from the end of the
first 3 months to about 4.5 or 5 months.
   During that time, the Court allowed the same freedom to request
and to perform the abortion to those two individuals but stated
that the State could insert certain regulations. The thrust of those
regulations had nothing at all to do with any protection for the
unborn child. Again, no reason need be given. The thrust of those
regulations in that phase was to make the procedure safer for the
mother.
   The third phase spoken to in the Court was from viability until
birth, and if my memory serves--and I will quote from memory--
during that time the Court said that the State may if it wishes
proscribe--forbid--abortion but went on then to say that it was not
allowed to forbid abortion if one licensed physician stated that this
abortion was necessary to preserve her life--few would argue--or
her health, and that was very clearly stated. If one physician saw
it necessary to preserve her health, abortion was legal until birth.
   Now the Court went to great pains to define the term "health."
The Court speaks of that particular definition in three different
places. It includes under that the woman's age; it includes under
that--let me see if I even have this particular quote with me. I
think I do. I will quote Doe v. Bolton.

   The medical judgment may be exercised in the light of all factors: physical,
emotional, psychological, familial, and the woman's age, relevant to the well-being
of the patient. All these factors may relate to health.

   In the other decision, the definition of "health" was broadened to
include if she were unmarried, if child care was to be a problem, if
she faced a distressful life and future, and a number of others. In a
                                         294

concurring decision by Mr. Justice Douglas, which does not have
the force of the decision but is certainly read, he included if it
caused her to abandon educational plans, sustain loss of income,
endure the discomfort of pregnancy.

   Now I would submit to you that that definition of health sweeps
so broadly that it can rather be defined as social distress of the
woman as regarded by herself, assuming she can get a physician to
agree with her.

   As evidence of the fact that these late abortions occur, the State
of Colorado, reporting on a 24-month period recently, detailed a
total of 22 abortions in the city of Boulder, Colo., alone that oc-
curred in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy, 2 of them at
38 weeks--that is, 2 weeks before her due date. Those are officially
reported in the health statistics of the State of Colorado.

   Now we do have abortion in all 50 States in the entire 9 months
of pregnancy. All you need is a licensed physician who will do the
job and a woman who wants it done.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Dr. Gerster, in regard to the Arizona State
Judiciary Committee's consideration of what is known as H.B. 20,
could you expand on your knowledge of the committee's delibera-
tions? For example, were there any amendments presented on the
bill or was there a substitute bill considered?

   Dr. GERSTER. That is the 1970 bill, right? Yes. That would have
removed--would have stricken all legal restraints from the Arizona
law which allowed for life of the mother, and left only the words
"done by a licensed physician." Therefore, this would have had no
reference to duration of pregnancy, to indications, and were it
passed would have been the most radical of all State legislation 3
years prior to the Court decision.

   This passed the house and then passed the judiciary, Senator
O'Connor having voted for it. It then went to the rules committee,
where it failed to pass, but she voted for it again in Rules. In
explaining this on the first day of testimony, Judge O'Connor said
that this was the one vote that she did say she regretted, or she
would not have voted today for that particular bill but she did so
then because there was no other bill available.

  We have been given a copy of senate bill 216, introduced Febru-
ary 6, 1970, by then-Senator McNulty, which was a more moderate
bill. It would have limited gestation of pregnancy to 4.5 months. It
would have allowed for informed consent: The details of embryol-
ogy were to be given to the woman. It would have allowed for a
conscience clause, that the operation be done in a hospital, and
that in the case of a girl 15 years or younger, that parental consent
would have been required.

  This was the bill that this morning Judge O'Connor referred to--
acknowledging that she knew of its existence--that mechanically it
was too cumbersome. Now this bill predated the other bill. It went
to the judiciary committee, on which then-Senator O'Connor sat. It
was introduced on February 6, 1970. It was held in judiciary and
then, when the more radical bill came along, it was voted out of
judiciary in April. Having the choice of the two bills, she voted out
house bill 20 which would have removed all restraint through 9
months of pregnancy.

  Senator GRASSLEY. One last question, and you have already re-
ferred to it in your comments to my colleague from Arizona, but I
wanted your individual reaction to what the three members of the
house of representatives said yesterday about their feelings of
Judge O'Connor's opinion on abortion.

  Dr. GERSTER. I think that they truly believe--I know those three
individuals very well, and I think they would not have appeared, as
Senator DeConcini said, had they not believed that she had
changed her mind. I also know very well that they had been given
no indication, regarding the abortion question, that she has. They
were very clear.

  In answer to your question--it was a very good question, by the
way--particularly I thought that the statement of Tony West was
very poignant when he said that if she had not now, that he knew
that she would change her mind. I can only say that I know that
they are being sincere. I know that they spoke absolute truth.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me ask you: Obviously, Representative
West has a very good feel concerning the basic instincts of Judge
O'Connor, and he feels that he has some understanding of those
instincts. Do you share any of those insights?

  Dr. GERSTER. NO. When I talked to him at length, about an hour
and a half, I said, "Tony, please share with me what you have
because I want so badly to support this nomination." I said, "Did
she address herself to abortion when she spoke to you?" He said,
"Well, she couldn't."

   However, she told him words to the effect that she "would not
embarrass him." I think those were the words used. I suppose
if

   Senator GRASSLEY. Isn't there a camaraderie there among friends
and among former colleagues that maybe says more than words
can say? A statement like that, doesn't that impress you at all?

   Dr. GERSTER. NO, not in the light of the testimony here in the
first 2 days. I was very hopeful coming here, and I thought I would
hear in that testimony, and I was extremely disappointed. I felt
that more could have been said. If Roe v. Wade is discounted, and I
know there is much controversy whether she could have addressed
herself to an amendment which is a part of history but which may
come up again--however, I do believe that we could have had
clearer answers to her feeling, for instance, on the memorial of
1974 against the human life amendment even when rape and
incest had been added to "life of the mother." I think we could
have gotten a clear indication of how she would vote today on that
bill. That is what I was hoping for.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, I am finished.
   The CHAIRMAN. Senator Baucus?
   Senator BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Dr. Willke and Dr. Gerster, I want to welcome you back to the
committee. When we last spoke, none of us thought that we would
be back under these circumstances quite so quickly.
   I have two lines of questions, both fairly brief. When Senator
Dole asked questions concerning Justice Stevens, one of the ques-
tions was whether or not he was asked questions concerning Roe v.
Wade. Apparently he was not asked any questions concerning that
decision or concerning his position on abortion.
                                         296

  I am wondering whether in your view he should have been asked
those questions by this committee during his confirmation hearing?

  Dr. GERSTER. Yes, I believe so.
  Senator BAUCUS. If, in answer to those questions, he at that time
did not repudiate Roe v. Wade or did not take a strong position in
opposition to abortion, would it have been your recommendation at
the time that this committee should not have confirmed him?

  Dr. WILLKE. I am sure that that would have been our recommen-
dation, Senator Baucus. I could only repeat what I said a minute or
two ago, and that was that the issue was certainly a much less
discussed issue. The feelings of the Nation had not been nearly as
aroused. We had not gone through the last two election campaigns
in which this issue was decisive in replacing some members whose
previous position had been proabortion.

  I would suggest that there is a time in history when certain
issues--when we can say that their time has come or is coming.
There is certainly no question that the time for being concerned
about the destruction of the civil rights of an entire class, the
unborn, is here. I might suggest that the question will most cer-
tainly be relevant in the future.

  Senator BAUCUS. Dr. Gerster, my second line of questions con-
cerns your opposition to Judge O'Connor. I understand that one
part of your opposition stems from her position on abortion.

  I understand that the second part of your opposition stems from
her lack of candor. Is that correct?

  Dr. GERSTER. Yes. I think it is because she was attempting to be
so honest to the committee, that she answered in the way she did. I
believe that if you listen very carefully to her answers, we have
only one statement of opposition. That would be to a sweeping law
that would remove all restraints whatsoever during 9 months of
pregnancy, the 1970 law she felt was a mistake.

  I really, Senator Baucus, have to discount personal opposition.
We have many Senators that we worked very hard against in our
political action committees during the last election that were sin-
cerely, personally opposed to it. The former President of the United
States was personally opposed, and I really believe he was, person-
ally opposed to abortion.

  However, the distinction has to be made between being personal-
ly opposed and being willing to see restorations of the rights of the
newborn. We are not insisting that an appointee to the U.S. Su-
preme Court be a prolife champion on a white charger. We only
ask that they see the mistake of Roe v. Wade, even as constitution-
al law, and that we return this choice to the people of the United
States, which I think is where the choice should have rested to
begin with.

  Senator BAUCUS. YOU apparently know the nominee fairly well,
at least you are fairly well acquainted with her. In your opinion,
what is her general reputation with respect to candor and honesty?

  Dr. GERSTER. I think it is good. I have never had any reason to
doubt it at all until the Starr memorandum, and I hope that that
was due to the enthusiasm of Mr. Starr to present a good case for
the candidate rather than
                                         297

  Senator BAUCUS. Yes, that was the comment I was going to
make. It is possible that the error was made by the author of the
memorandum.

  Dr. GERSTER. I would hope that is true. I was a little disturbed by
the first few questions regarding the lack of memory of the vote,
those two votes, in so radical a bill. We have no choice but to
accept that but it is astounding that that could be forgotten.

  Senator BAUCUS. Well, I must say in the short time I have been
in the Senate, I would be hard pressed to remember some of the
votes that I have cast in the past year or two. Thank you very
much for your testimony.

  Dr. GERSTER. Thank you.
  Senator BAUCUS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. We have a witness who has to catch a plane
right away. Dr. Willke and Dr. Gerster, would you mind keeping
your seats, and we shall bring the other witness up for a minute or
two?
  The Honorable Joan Dempsey Klein, would you come forward.
We understand you are with the National Association of Women
Judges, and I understand you have to catch a plane right away.
  Would you hold up your hand and be sworn?
  Do you swear that the evidence you give shall be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
  Judge KLEIN. I do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Have a seat, and you may proceed for 5 minutes.

TESTIMONY OF HON. JOAN DEMPSEY KLEIN, PRESIDING JUS-
  TICE, CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS, AND PRESIDENT, NA-
  TIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN JUDGES

  Judge KLEIN. Thank you.
   I understand my comments in their entirety will be made a part
of the record, and so I shall summarize my remarks before this
honorable committee.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, that will be done.
  Judge KLEIN. Thank you.
   It is with extreme pleasure that I appear before this committee
to speak on behalf of the confirmation of the first woman nominee
to the Supreme Court. I am before you in my capacity as president
of the National Association of Women Judges, which is an associ-
ation with which over half of the Nation's Federal and State
female judges have affiliated, along with a number of male judges.
   The purposes of the association include the discussion of legal,
educational, social, and ethical problems mutually encountered by
Women Judges and the formulation of solutions, and of course,
efforts to increase the number of women judges so that the judici-
ary more appropriately reflects the role of women in a democratic
society.
  As you might well imagine, the appointment of a woman to
assume a place on the highest court has had top priority on our
agenda. It seems to have been such a long time coming but, when
considered in a historical perspective, perhaps the 191 years is an
understandable period of time.
  The legal roots of this Nation are in the English common law,
which law classified women in the same category as chattels, chil-
                                         298

dren, and incompetents. As a consequence, women's activities out-
side the home were extremely restricted, including the opportunity
to gain an education.

   Even so, the now-famous lady, Myra Bradwell, qualified herself
to practice law but denying her the right to do so, the Supreme
Court in 1873 said, "The natural and proper timidity and delicacy
which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the
occupations of civil life."

   From the beginning, women have had to wage a constant strug-
gle to participate in that civil life. A constitutional amendment was
required just 61 years ago to allow women to engage in the most
basic and sacred right in a democracy, the right to vote, and
although adopted in 1868, the much-heralded clause in the 14th
amendment guaranteeing all persons the equal protection of the
law did not protect women from laws that discriminate on the
basis of sex. As you have been advised and know, of course, it was
not until 1971 that the Supreme Court for the first time declared
unconstitutional a blatantly sexually discriminatory State law be-
cause it violated the 14th amendment.

   Societal changes in the lives of American women have come
about slowly but surely. Compared to our mean beginnings, the
changes are of staggering proportion. Women now constitute over
42 percent of the Nation's work force and over 50 percent of all
women are gainfully employed outside the home. Women are seek-
ing professional training in law and are participating in political
decisionmaking in ever-increasing numbers. Today's factual knowl-
edge of women indicates that indeed they are engaged in all as-
pects of civil life.

   However, as timely as we consider this appointment to be and as
eager as we are to have such an appointment become a reality, we
are emphatic that the woman selected be of the highest caliber. By
virtue of the fact that so many of us have been the "first woman
judge" or the "only woman judge" in any number of situations, we
are keenly aware of the spotlight focused on our every act and the
scrutiny to which we are continually subjected. Such attention will
be greatly magnified in the case of the first woman Justice on the
Supreme Court. Her performance will reflect on all of us lesser
judicial luminaries, and we want to be assured that she has the
capacity to succeed.

   For these reasons and more, I am pleased to report that the
national association finds the nominee to be exceptionally well
qualified. Certain of our members participated in an evaluation of
her and made the customary inquiries relating to professional com-
petency, judicial temperament, and integrity. In addition, all of our
14 district directors were contacted and enthusiastically supported
my appearance before this committee in her behalf.

  Her integrity and morality we believe are above reproach. She is
a stable, moderate, gracious, well-adjusted woman.

  In conclusion, please allow me to reiterate my pleasure at par-
ticipating in this historical event on behalf of the National Associ-
ation of Women Judges. We urge the immediate confirmation of
Judge O'Connor so that she can be in place and ready to proceed
on the first Monday in October.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, would you tell us the position you hold?
                                         299
  Judge KLEIN. I am a presiding justice of the California Court of
Appeals, sir, and president of this national association.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Are there any questions of this witness?
  Judge KLEIN. It doesn't look like there is anybody here to ask.
[Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. If there are no questions from this witness, we
thank you very much, Judge Klein, for appearing.
  Judge KLEIN. Thank you, sir.

              PREPARED STATEMENT OF THE HON. JOAN DEMPSEY KLEIN

                 It is with extreme pleasure that I appear before this
honorable Committee to speak on behalf of the confirmation of
the first woman nominee to the United States Supreme Court in
its 191 years of existence. It is indeed a glorious occasion
for women everywhere, and in particular for the women judges of
America.

                 I am before you in my capacity as President of the
National Association of Women Judges, an association with which
over one-half of the nation's female federal and state judges
have affiliated, along with a number of male judges.

                 The purposes of the National Association of Women
Judges are as follows:

                       ". . .[T]o promote the administration
                 of justice; to discuss legal, educational,
                 social and ethical problems mutually
                 encountered by women judges and to
                 formulate solutions; to increase the
                 number of women judges so that the
                 judiciary more appropriately reflects
                 the role of women in a democratic society;
                 and, to address other important issues
                 particularly affecting women judges. . . ."

                 As you might well imagine, the appointment of a woman
to assume a rightful seat on the highest court has had top
priority on our agenda. It seems to have been such a long time
coming, but when considered in historical perspective, perhaps
the 191 years is a reasonable period of time.
                                     301

                 The legal roots of this nation are in the English
common law and that law classified women in the same category
as chattels, children and incompetents. As a consequence,
women's activities outside the home were extremely restricted,
including the opportunity to become educated. Even so, Myra
Bradwell qualified herself, but she was denied a license to
practice law by the State of Illinois in 1873. In refusing her
that right, the Supreme Court said:

                       "The paramount destiny and mission of
                 women are to fulfill the noble and benign
                 offices of wife and mother.

                       "The natural and proper timidity and
                 delicacy which belongs to the female sex
                 evidently unfits it for many of the
                 occupations of civil life . . . ."
                 The cherished words of the Declaration of Independence
that "all men are created equal" and are entitled to the
"unalienable rights [of] life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness" -- were written with only white males in mind. From
the beginning, women have had to wage a constant struggle to
participate in "civil life." A constitutional amendment was
required just 61 years ago to allow women to engage in the most
basic and sacred right in a democracy -- the right to vote.
Although adopted in 1868, the much heralded clause in the 14th
Amendment guaranteeing "all persons" the equal protection of
the laws has not protected women from laws that discriminate
against women on the basis of sex. It was not until 1971 that
the United States Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a
blatantly sexually discriminatory state law because it violated
the 14th Amendment.
                  Societal changes in the lives of American women have
come about slowly but surely. Compared to our mean beginnings,
                                      302

the changes are of staggering proportions. Women constitute
over 42X of the nation's work force, and over 50% of all women
are gainfully employed outside the home. Women are seeking
professional training in law and medicine and are participating
in political decision-making in ever-increasing numbers.
Today's factual knowledge of women indicates that indeed they
are engaged in all aspects of "civil life."

                 However, as timely as we consider this appointment to
be, and as eager as we are to have such an appointment become a
reality, we are emphatic that the woman selected be of the
highest caliber. By virtue of the fact that so many of us have
been the "first woman judge" or the "only woman judge" in any
number of situations, we are keenly aware of the spotlight
focused on our every act, and the scrutiny to which we are
continually subjected. Such attention will be magnified in the
case of the "first woman justice on the Supreme Court!" Her
performance will reflect on all of us lesser judicial
luminaries, and we want to be assured that she has the capacity
to succeed.

                 For these reasons and more, I am very pleased to
report that the National Association of Women Judges finds the
nominee, the Honorable Sandra Day O'Connor, to be exceptionally
well qualified.

                 Certain selected Association members participated in
the evaluation of Judge O'Connor and made the customary
inquiries relating to professional competency, judicial
temperament and integrity.

                 In addition, each of the 14 district directors of the
Association from throughout the country were contacted, and
each one commented favorably on Judge O'Connor and urged my
appearance on her behalf before this honorable body.
                                     303

                 The investigation disclosed among other data that
Judge O'Connor is 51 years of age, mature, yet youthful, and
possessed of great vitality and good health. She graduated
from Stanford Law School, one of the most prestigious
institutions of legal education in the world, where she was a
member of Law Review, and graduated Order of the Coif in 1952.

                 Her diversified legal/judicial career includes service
as a deputy county attorney in California, a civil lawyer for
the Quartermasters Corps of the United States Army, private
practice, and an assistant state attorney general in Arizona.

                 Judge O'Connor rather uniquely also served in the
Arizona State Senate, where her colleagues elected her majority
leader.

                 Following her legislative career, she presided as a
trial judge in the superior court until her elevation to the
Arizona Court of Appeals. She was sitting with distinction as
an associate judge on the appellate court at the time President
Reagan made his momentous decision to name a woman to the
highest court. During that time, she authored some 29
opinions, which are described as concise and cogent, orderly,
lucid and logical. I have read several of them and would agree
with that analysis.

                 Judge O'Connor's experience on the appellate bench
serves to prepare her for the work ahead. By contrast, at
 least 15 of the prior 101 Supreme Court justices had no
 judicial experience whatsoever, or a bare minimum prior to
 their appointments. These numbers include three of the
 justices currently serving with distinction.

                  In discussing Judge O'Connor with persons who either
know her personally or who have knowledge of her, certain words
 keep recurring -- brilliant, fair, pragmatic, rational,
hard-working, self-confident, flexible, conscientious, tough,
                                     304

and perfectionist. She has a reputation as an evenhanded,
no-nonsense person with a precise legal mind, given to judicial
restraint.

                 Her integrity is above reproach and she is financially
sound. She is a stable, moderate, gracious, and well-adjusted
woman. With her high degree of professional competency, innate
intelligence and passion for hard work, she has every potential
for becoming an outstanding Supreme Court Justice. As the
first justice with experience in all three branches of
government -- executive, legislative and judicial -- and as a
woman -- she will bring to the high court a valuable
perspective it has lacked to date.

                  In conclusion, I reiterate my pleasure at
participating in this historical event on behalf of the
National Association of Women Judges. We hereby set forth our
evaluation with the finding that Judge O'Connor is
exceptionally well qualified to this honorable Committee for
its consideration. We urge the immediate confirmation of
Judge O'Connor so that she can be in place and ready to proceed
on "The First Monday in October."

Respectfully submitted,

  The CHAIRMAN. In view of the fact that there is a vote on now
and the 5-minute bell will come on any second, Dr. Willke and Dr.
Gerster, we will ask you to come back at 2 o'clock if you will and
continue your testimony at that time.

  We will now take a recess until 2 o'clock.
  [Whereupon, at 1 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene at 2
p.m. the same day.]

                                      AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The Judiciary Committee will come to order.
  We shall now continue with the testimony of Dr. Willke and Dr.
Gerster. Senator Denton of Alabama I believe is next in line for
questioning.

     TESTIMONY OF DR. J. C. WILLKE AND DR. CAROLYN F.
   GERSTER, NATIONAL RIGHT TO LIFE COMMITTEE--Resumed

  Senator DENTON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Good afternoon, Dr. Willke, Dr. Gerster. I would like to begin by
expressing my gratification that the dialog that has been taking
place, that respective points of view on the subject of abortion are
being presented so well, by parties at this dais and by you two.
   I certainly agree with you that it is a basic issue, one which is
about as single an issue as whether or not murder is disqualifying
if one has that habit, but for those who do not see it as you do and
as I do, I certainly do not feel any sense of condemnation. I only
hope that we can keep dialoging about it until we have enough of
us thinking the truth about it, and I am not sure that I come down
in precisely the right spot myself.
   I am sorry that all the Senators did not hear the answers to
some of the questions and some of the dialog, especially between
Senator Metzenbaum and you two, and the answers to Senator
Grassley's questions.
   I have been thrust into this abortion issue since arriving at the
Senate, without any intent on my part to be so involved, by virtue
of being on the Aging, Family, and Human Services Subcommittee,
and in that capacity have had to address family planning, title 10,
and have had a bill which I originated passed, called "Adolescent
Family Life," which sort of reverses the context of the Govern-
ment's up to now involvement in sex education, adolescent preg-
nancy, that sort of thing.
   Whether or not that law gets appropriated in the new crunch
that we have economically is going to be another question, but it
was passed unanimously on Labor and Human Resources Commit-
tee with Senator Metzenbaum and Senator Kennedy and others
voting for it. My problem is in communicating to the other Sena-
tors and Congressmen this situation. It is misperceived. Once they
understand it, everything is fine.
   I share your concern. I have learned in that program, for exam-
ple, in the hearings that we had on that, that a half a million
teenagers are aborting their children per year and the number is
going up every year. Therefore, Judge O'Connor's position that she
disapproves of abortion as a means of birth control unfortunately is
not being applied from within our own Government now because
                                             306

the way title 10 is administered, these girls are counseled to get
abortions. The two diseases are expressed to them as venereal
disease and pregnancy; the two cures are penicillin and abortion.
Therefore, it has been a somewhat dismaying experience, and if my
little bill does not get funded it will be even more dismaying.

  I think Senator Metzenbaum started out the real dialog when he
said that his concern is for the living, and that he felt compassion
for those who were poor and already had enough children and
things like that. You all made the point so well that the child in
the womb is also living, and especially in the case of one which is
old enough or far enough developed to be taken from the womb
and live, it is very difficult not to interpret abortion in that case as
murder.

  It is not too far an extension to that to get to the point where,
well, if you want to take care the poor, if you have four children
and a couple of them are under 2 years old, maybe the best thing
to do is gas them. As you well know, in other societies which are
not based upon compassion, not based upon respect for the dignity
of life and the equality of that life, we do have such manifestations
as in Nazi Germany: abortion first, then euthanasia and infanti-
cide, as we have in this country to a great degree already, and then
the killing of the Jews selectively, the extermination of the mental-
ly retarded, the physically disadvantaged, all of which took place
within the lifetimes of many of us.

  My own special consciousness, probably unique in this room,
comes from the fact that I lived in a similar society for almost 8
years and I saw the result of what happens, human being to
human being, when there is no principle derived from a concept of
God, when there is atheism, when the government is totalitarian. I
saw people killed because of political dissidence. I saw them tor-
tured. I saw a man's eye cut out slowly, a North Vietnamese,
because of his political disagreement with what the North Viet-
namese were doing.

  We now have the horrible tragedy of tens of millions of South-
east Asians enslaved to that system, which is even a greater slav-
ery or a worse form of slavery than that which you referred to, Dr.
Willke, in our own country. As hideous as that form was, it was
not so hideous as to cause the slaves to get on logs, overburdened
boats and flee with less than a 50-percent chance of survival in
terms of their lives.

  My disagreement with Senator Metzenbaum would devolve in a
number of places but particularly when he talks about violence,
say in El Salvador. As I said in my senatorial campaign in Ala-
bama, the Civil War involved the highest rate of casualties per
troop engaged of any war in recorded history. While war is hell, as
Sherman said, there are worse forms of hell. There are forms of
hell that last longer, kill more people, cause more suffering. Slav-
ery was one of those.

  As an Alabamian, as a white person, I believe that the Civil War
to the degree that it was caused by slavery was well worth the
candle. I believe that the war in Vietnam, to the degree that it was
caused by the impulse to try to protect those whom we were
pledged to protect against this kind of slavery, even worse than
that other, was worth the candle. I am sorry that we have become
                                                   307

disoriented in that respect. I hope we recover orientation in that
respect.

  That Soviet or totalitarian, Communist system has no respect for
equality, no respect for human life. I was more sorry for those
among whom I found myself who were so-called free than I was for
my fellow prisoners.

  If we do not realize once and for all what our Founding Fathers
did and get back to seeing free enterprise in all of its senses--not
just economic but the freedom to grow flowers if one wishes, the
freedom to play the violin for one s own enjoyment or the enjoy-
ment of others if one so wishes, the freedom to try to become
President of the United States if one so wishes--and have that all
permitted by a spirit of compassion, consideration for the rights of
others derived from a "love thy neighbor as thy love thyself
concept, not to appreciate that as I grew to appreciate it watching
the suffering of people committed to another system by no will of
their own--were they able to vote, they would vote out of it--it
makes me particularly ill to see our own society losing sight of
what it is that has been passed on to them.

   What is the genius of the Founding Fathers? What is the germ
from which this greatness grew? That is what we are dealing with
when we deal with the subject of abortion, in my opinion. I think
you are entirely justified in saying that it is a once-in-a-century
type issue, very similar to slavery, I think even more basically
fundamental than the issue of slavery.

   I would ask you both--perhaps Dr. Willke first--what do you
think is the effect and what do you think is the significance of the
Roe v. Wade decision as it relates to the power of Congress now to
act perhaps without a constitutional amendment? What do you see
as the power of Congress to right the present situation, in view of
Roe v. Wade? What are the constraints and possibilities that you
see?

   Dr. WILLKE. Senator Denton, clearly Roe v. Wade established by
that edict, we call it, three brandnew issues. The first thing it did
was remove legal personhood on the basis of place of residence. Let
me explain that.

   I mentioned a bit earlier that abortion is legal until birth, and
that is true. A person cannot be convicted of a crime if that
physician kills a baby even while the mother is in labor, but as
soon as that child enters the air world and is detached from the
mother, birth is completed, then all of the civil rights of this
Nation descend to apply and hover about to protect that child, for
the child now is a legal person and has civil rights.

   Therefore, we call abortion discrimination on the basis of the
place of residence. If you will pardon the vernacular, if the kid can
escape from that little house the night before his scheduled execu-
tion, his life can be saved, for the womb has become a tomb. That
was one finding, legal personhood. The loss of that reduced the
unborn child to the status of property of the owner.

   The second major finding of Roe v. Wade was the creation of a
brand new right. That right, called a right of privacy, is perhaps
more accurately described as a right of private killing for it gave to
a mother a right that had never existed before, that was not
written in the 14th amendment but the Justices said that it was
                                         308

meant by the 14th amendment: That was the right to privately ask
for the killing of her unborn, the only restriction being that a
physician had to do it. That right may well be superior even to
personhood, if that were capable of being restored by this Congress.
That issue is controversial; there are differing opinions.

  Finally, there was a third holding that gave the State a "compel-
ling" interest in the maintenance of the mother's "health." About
an hour ago I defined "health" as defined by the Supreme Court.
Therefore, it could well be that a State court, interpreting "health"
in that broadest sense of social distress, might rule on the basis of
Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton, that to maintain a woman's health
there had to be abortion on demand.

  Now the question: What can the Congress do? Clearly the final
answer, the one equivocal answer, the one that is out there and the
one that we all seek is a constitutional amendment so worded that
it will reverse all three of those findings. That is within the power
of Congress to report that amendment out. It takes two-thirds of
both Houses, and this is what we have been asking for.

  There is some disagreement, some controversy as to the wording
of that, and we will shortly have full hearings on that, a fact that
you are only so well aware of. We are going to be further enlight-
ened on that score.

  We plead with the Congress to do that, for at the moment we live
in a Nation that is totally polarized on this issue. Unlike other
issues in the body politic, there is no midground, there is no com-
promise. A baby is either a baby or not, either alive or dead. While
the issue becomes more and more important in our Nation, the
polarizations also rise.

  What exists today in law, through a Court decision, is one ex-
treme polarity of value judgment: Abortion on demand until birth,
in all 50 States. It could not be worse. What we are asking for is
the opposite polarity: Equal protection by law for all living Ameri-
cans from the time their human life begins at fertilization. There is
a yawning gulf between the two.

  We plead with Members of Congress, the House and Senate, to
please quit imposing their morality on the Nation by doing noth-
ing, for by doing nothing they maintain the status quo. You see, a
Member of either House would not necessarily have to be either
pro or con on the issue; all they would have to be is, "I believe the
people should decide, and therefore I will report out the amend-
ment that the right-to-life people want, recognizing it to be that
other polarity."

  That could be a Senator's solemn duty even though they disa-
greed with the amendment. The simple concept would be, send it to
the States, let the people decide. If in fact three-fourths of the
States do ratify, that clearly is the wish of this Nation. If three-
fourths cannot, they have had their chance. We would suggest that
without question is where we hope this will be.

  Senator DENTON. Dr. Gerster, would you care to comment, par-
ticularly with respect to some of the previous glimmerings you
gave us into children being born alive, or, you know, that sort of
gory reality about abortion which Roe v. Wade made possible?

  Dr. GERSTER. I believe that Dr. Willke has really said it all. I
think what has happened is, as Albert Schweitzer once said,
                                         309

"When you lose respect for any part of life, you lose respect for all
of life."

  The National Right to Life Committee is, of course, as involved
in euthanasia and nontherapeutic human experimentation without
informed consent or done on individuals incapable of informed
consent, whether they are prisoners or children or retarded.

  Probably the most dangerous words in Roe v. Wade were the
words "meaningful life," because it opened the doors to reclassifica-
tion of human beings whose lives were other than meaningful. As
you mentioned yourself very movingly the reason for your involve-
ment in this issue, my involvement stemmed from the fact that my
husband was born and raised in Hitler's Germany during the Third
Reich. I for this reason developed a hunger for knowledge about
what happened to the German people and the German medical
community.

  I think the tragedy that is not appreciated in this country is that
the euthanasia program that you alluded to in Germany was
planned, not by Nazis, but by physicians, mostly psychiatrists and
pediatricians. The plans were put forth in a book written in 1920
by Benigen Holke, and the words, "Lebens Unvertichs Leben," life
not worth living, first appear in that book, 13 years before the
world had ever heard of Adolf Hitler.

   By reclassifying human beings it could be predicted, not only the
euthanasia programs that are a reality in America regarding the
born, handicapped children of all ages, but in the realm of human
experimentation, I testified earlier probably the worst example
regarding the premature baby with the decapitation and cannula-
tion of the internal carotid artery of the heads of the infants born
alive, but I recall another group of human beings that were reclas-
sified.

   They were retarded children at Willowbrook, and a very famous
scientist, Dr. Saul Krugman, in developing hepatitis vaccine inject-
ed 25 children at Willowbrook Home for Retarded with living
hepatitis-B. Nobody died. However, the defense, I think, of the
experiment as it appeared, as I recall, in an article in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, was that conditions were so
bad at Willowbrook that the children probably would have devel-
oped hepatitis anyway. I will always remember that, I think, as so
representative of what we term the antilife philosophy. The obvi-
ous, positive solution was to clean up conditions at Willowbrook.

   However, worse than that, I recall the defense of the experiment
in the New England Journal of Medicine. Many may ask what this
has to do with abortion. It has a lot to do with abortion because we
have agreed to take life, knowing that it was life. What I am
describing now is not part of the Neuremberg trials; it is American
medicine in this century.

   At any rate, the comment regarding experimentation on the
retarded that appeared in the New England Journal was--and I do
not have to look at any note. It is engraved on my heart--it was
that if we are about to study disease in children, there is no
substitute for experimentation on children; that the only question
is whether we are to do the initial experiments in children and
adults with potential, or children who are human in form only. I
                                         310

suggest to you that those words are echoes of the Neuremberg
doctors' trials in 1947.

  If I could just close with one sentence, it would be the remarks of
a physician with remarkable foresight. In the midnineteenth cen-
tury, Dr. Hufflin said, "When a physician presumes to take into
consideration in the course of his practice whether life has value or
not, the possibilities are limitless, and the physician becomes the
most dangerous man in the State."

  Senator DENTON. Thank you, Dr. Gerster.
  Dr. Willke, you have had a lot of experience with abortions with
babies born alive. I would ask, before you undertake your mention
of that, I would ask the chairman that an article in the Philadel-
phia Inquirer of August 2, 1981 in the Today Sunday insert, "Abor-
tion: The Dreaded Complications," by Liz Jeffries and Rick Ed-
munds, be entered in the record of these proceedings, sir. I have
the reference here in writing.

  The CHAIRMAN. I just wondered if you want it in the printed
record, or would you just want it in the records of the committee?

  Senator DENTON. The printed record, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. What is the length of it? How long is it? Do you
have a copy of it there?
  Dr. WILLKE. Mr. Chairman, I have a copy here if you care to
examine it. It is perhaps three or four pages in a Sunday supple-
ment here.

  The CHAIRMAN. We are really not having a hearing on abortion;
we are having a hearing on the question of the fitness of the
nominee, and I think it is all right to ask questions, any question
you want to, but I do not want to go into great depth on any one
side issue and fill up the record with that. I am just wondering, if
this is just a short article we might put it in; if it is not, then I
would suggest we put it in the files of the committee, and it could
be reserved there until you do have questions on the subject of
abortion.

  Senator DENTON. The only relevance, Mr. Chairman, that I
would suggest is that the point has been made that this is a single-
issue matter similar to gun control or tobacco tax or something like
that, and I believe that--I do not intend to fill up the proceedings
or the record. It is entered with respect to that issue, to indicate
that it is an issue of a century and perhaps the issue of our history,
if we continue going this way.

  Before you start, Dr. Willke
  The CHAIRMAN. Doctor, what is the length of that article?
  Dr. WILLKE. Your lady is bringing it up there, Senator. I did not
copy the line inches. I do not know. It starts about halfway through
the supplement and, as I recall, it is several pages.
  Senator DENTON. It contributes to placing in scale the degree of
importance of this single issue. I defer to your judgment, Mr.
Chairman. To save time, I would like to relate one quick anecdote
in extension of the remarks made by Dr. Gerster.
  Some of you here may have seen a television program, perhaps a
year ago, showing an interview with a young man, 21 years old,
who was about 38 inches high, had but one eye, one ear, no arm,
was born that way, very deformed; had been left in a garbage can,
                                         311

the offspring of a British prostitute, found and brought into a
home, a public home, to take care of orphans.

  That child developed in that orphan home, felt despised, would
bite people at age 16, spit at them and so forth, in a frenzy of
hatred for humankind. At age 21, 5 years later, after having been
adopted by a loving British couple who were very poor, he was a
star student at Oxford, an extremely accomplished musician, an
orator, won many debating contests in and around London, and
was one of the happiest people I have ever seen in my life.

  I understood that happiness because there were times when I, by
all estimates that I would have made before I was in those condi-
tions, would have considered I could not possibly be happy were I
so disadvantaged, encumbered, and so forth. That young man was
in the same sort of frame of mind. I have not recovered that since I
have gotten back to normalcy but I had almost that degree of
happiness as he had, and I understood that.

   I kind of think it shows something about the relative importance
of what might be called "meaningful life." Who would have defined
what that lad would have been, at age 16? Would he not have been
a leading candidate for experimentation or extermination in a
system which neglects the infinite importance of respect for life?

  Would you care to elaborate on those abortions, and that will be
the last question I ask, Dr. Willke.

  Dr. WILLKE. Senator Denton, the article which is written by two
authors, both of whom admit that their position is in favor of
abortion and continue that at the end of the article, details what is
called the dreaded complication, that being a live birth from an
induced abortion, very well researched.

   It was in the Philadelphia Inquirer in the Sunday section, and
simply what it says is that there is one live birth daily in the
United States from attempted abortions. These are usually midtri-
mester abortions, most commonly of course by prostaglandin,
which induces labor at no matter what stage of the pregnancy the
woman is.

  The point to be made here, I believe, is that this is legal. It is
legal in all 50 States; it is legal in this United States, and I think it
is important to bring that out because of the fact that these hear-
ings are being held, and because of a series of laws that the
nominee voted for which directly permit this sort of thing to
happen. In fact, there was one live birth, very publicized, in Arizo-
na just recently.

   Dr. GERSTER. Yes, it led to a series of articles in the Arizona
Republic, Arizona's leading newspaper. What had occurred was
that a saline abortion had been attempted on a woman 32 weeks
pregnant and the child, a little girl, was born alive at Doctor's
Hospital. The doctor was not present at the abortion, and the
nurse, succumbing to those basic instincts of nurses all over the
world, took the baby to the nursery. The baby was later transport-
ed to St. Joseph's Hospital and was, a few weeks ago, released in
perfect health.

  There is a long string of circumstances that followed that case. A
nurse of the abortionist called us and spoke about human experi-
mentation, so I gave her the number of the reporter that had
written the story.
                                         312

  It turned out that, as reported in the Arizona Republic, a phar-
maceutical company that is usually famous for its vitamin pills,
Squibb & Co., was reported in the Republic as having paid a large
sum of money--reputed to be $10,000--to the abortionist, all legal-
ly, you understand, except for the fact that we have a fetal experi-
mentation law in Arizona which some States do not have.

  A large dose of antihypertensive agent which is being developed
by Squibb was given to pregnant women. Amniotic fluid was drawn
2 to 3 days prior to the abortion. The abortion was to be a prostag-
landin abortion because saline evidently interferes with the study.
At the end of the time, Squibb had requested amniotic fluid, blood
of the baby, blood of the mother, and a piece of the baby's liver.

  I do not want to dwell on these things, and I know that the
chairman has asked if this was not a peripheral issue. However, I
think Senator Metzenbaum--who is no longer present, unfortu-
nately--spent a great deal of time asking us why this to us is a
more important issue than any other. The abortion of that 32-week-
old baby was perfectly legal. There is no question that there are no
criminal charges being brought against the doctor for the abortion.

  In the State of Arizona we have an endangered species law. An
individual that crushes a gila monster egg--this is one of the only
two poisonous lizards left in the world--not the gila monster, only
the egg--is subject to a fine of $750 and 4 months in jail, but you
can kill a baby to 9 months in the State of Arizona with impunity.
I suggest to this committee that when this becomes the law of the
State, this is a sick society.

  There was one bill that Senator O'Connor introduced which
could be interpreted as a prolife bill, and I do not say this with any
degree of levity. It was introduced on January 16, 1973. There was
a great deal of publicity in Arizona, adverse publicity, because we
were shooting buffalo in enclosures with high-powered rifles. It
became the subject of a book by Mr. Swarthout, an Arizona author,
and a famous motion picture called, "Bless the Beasts and the
Children."

  There was all sorts of outcry against this inhumanity to buffalo,
and so Senator O'Connor introduced the following bill relating to
"game fish, the taking of game animals under certain conditions."
The purpose of the act was "to prohibit the shooting or taking of
game animals in an inhumane manner."

  Section A says that:

  Except as provided in subsection (b), the Commission shall not permit the taking
or shooting of any game animal, including but not limited to buffalo, under any
condition in which such animal is restrained in an enclosure of such a size as to
prohibit its escape from the range of the weapon.

  I suggest to you that the baby, if reclassified as a game animal, is
certainly enclosed so as to prohibit escape.

  Senator DENTON. Thank you, too.
  I want to say for the record that I know that this chairman is
not edified by the fact that the Supreme Court committed an act of
judicial activism. I believe he is of the opinion that they should not
have. I regard all of his admonitions toward me as justified. I think
he is the fairest chairman I have ever encountered.
  I would like to thank him for his generosity and graciousness
with respect to a rather prolonged effort to substantiate that abor-
                                         313

tion is an unusual single issue, one which eats away perhaps--at
least in my belief--does eat away at the foundation of the theory
which sustains this country. I believe that the opinions and pros-
pective rulings of a Supreme Court Justice in this matter are
pertinent to anyone's concern about the general welfare, and that
is why I undertook such a long exploration into the subject.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, what did you decide about that article?
Do you want it to go in now or be placed with the records in the
committee? How would you prefer to handle it.
  Senator DENTON. We would like to put it in now, and we are not
going to use it in any other way.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, so ordered.
   [Material supplied follows:]

                                       [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Aug 2, 1981]

                                                           ABORTION

                              (By Liz Jeffries and Rick Edmonds)
   A woman's scream broke the late-night quiet and brought two young obstetrical
nurses rushing to Room 4456 of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. The
patient, admitted for an abortion, had been injected 30 hours earlier with a salt
solution, which normally kills the fetus and causes the patient to deliver a mass of
lifeless tissue, in a process similar to a miscarriage.
   This time, though, something had gone wrong. When nurse Marilyn Wilson
flicked on the lights and pulled back the covers, she found, instead of the still born
fetus she'd expected, a live 2y2-pound baby boy, crying and moving his arms and
legs there on the bed.
   Dismayed, the second nurse, Joanie Fuchs, gathered the squirming infant in loose
bedcovers, dashed down the corridor and called to the other nurses for help. She did
not take the baby to an intensive care nursery, but deposited it instead on the
stainless steel drainboard of a sink in the maternity unit's Dirty Utility Room--a
large closet where bedpans are emptied and dirty linens stored. Other nurses and a
resident doctor gathered and gaped.
   Finally, a head nurse telephoned the patient's physician, Dr. C. J. LaBenz, at
home, apparently waking him.
   "He told me to leave it where it was," the head nurse testified later, "just to
watch it for a few minutes, that it would probably die in a few minutes."
   This was in Omaha, in September 1979. It was nothing new. Hundreds of times a
year in the United States, an aborted fetus emerges from the womb kicking and
alive. Some survive. A baby girl in Florida, rescued by nurses who found her lying
in a bedpan, is 5 years old now and doing well. Most die. The Omaha baby lasted
barely 2J/2 hours after he was put in the closet with the dirty linen.
   Always, their arrival is met with shock, dismay and confusion.
   When such a baby is allowed to die and the incident becomes known, the authori-
ties often try to prosecute the doctor. This has happened several dozen times in the
past eight years, most recently in the case of Dr. LaBenz, who is to go on trial in
Omaha this fall on two counts of criminal abortion. But interviews with nurses,
some of them visibly anguished, uncovered dozens of similar cases that never
reached public attention.
   In fact, for every case that does become known, a hundred probably go unreport-
ed. Dr. Willard Cates, an expert on medical statistics who is chief of abortion
surveillance for the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, estimates that 400 to 500
abortion live births occur every year in the United States. That is only a tiny
fraction of the nation's 1.5 million annual abortions. Still, it means that these
unintended live births are literally an everyday occurrence.
   They are little known because organized medicine, from fear of public clamor and
legal action, treats them more as an embrassment to be hushed up than a problem
to be solved. "It's like turning yourself in to the IRS for an audit," Cates said.
"What is there to gain? The tendency is not to report because there are only
negative incentives."
   One result of the medical community's failure to openly acknowledge the problem
is that many hospitals and clinics give their staffs no guidelines for dealing with
                                         314

abortion live births. Even where guidelines exist, they may not be followed. The
doctor is seldom present when a live birth occurs, because most late abortions--
those done later than the midpoint of pregnancy--are performed by the injection of
a solution (the method used in the Omaha case) that slowly induces delivery of the
fetus many hours later. Crucial decisions therefore fall to nurses and physician
residents with secondary authority over the case.

  Signs of life in the baby may or may not be recognized. At some hospitals a
liveborn abortion baby is presumed dead unless it conspicuously demonstrates other-
wise, by crying or waving its arms and legs. Even then, the medical personnel on
the scene may let the baby die rather than try to save it.

  Because they are premature, these infants need immediate care, including ma-
chine support, in order to live. Given such care, many can survive in good health, as
did a pair of abortion babies born in separate incidents in Wilmington, Del., in the
spring of 1979 and since adopted. Others are too premature to be saved even with
the best care.

  Whether they live or die, these abortion live births--and even successful, routine
abortions of late terms, highly developed fetuses--are taking a heavy emotional toll
on medical staffs across the country. Some physicians say they have "burned out"
and have stopped doing abortions altogether. Nursing staffs at hospitals in Cleve-
land, Grand Rapids, Fort Lauderdale and elsewhere have rebelled at late abortions
and have stopped their hospitals from performing any abortions later than the
midpoint of pregnancy. Some staff members who regularly perform late abortions
report having nightmares about fetuses, including recurring dreams in which they
frantically seek to hide fetuses from others.

  In legalizing abortion in 1973, the Supreme Court said it was reserving the right
to protect the life of a viable fetus--that is, one with the potential to survive outside
the womb. But the court never directly acknowledged the chance of an aborted
fetus' being born alive, and it therefore never gave a clear guideline for dealing
with what Dr. Thomas Kerenyi, a leading New York expert on abortions, has called
"the dreaded complication."

  Twenty states (including Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware) have no laws
limiting late abortions or mandating care for live-born abortion babies. Even where
such state laws exist,
unconstitutional.

  "Everyone--doctors, attorneys, state legislators--is looking for some clear guide-
lines concerning disposition of these infants," said Newman Flanagan, district attor-
ney for the City of Boston. "If a baby has rejected an abortion and lives, then it is a
person under the Constitution. As such, it has a basic right to life. Unfortunately, it
is difficult to protect that right, because there are no guidelines addressed to this
specific issue."

  Medical trends indicate that abortion live births will continue. They may even
become more frequent. For one thing, demand for late-term abortions is undimin-
ished, and with the growing popularity of genetic testing to screen for fetal defects
midway through pregnancy, educated and affluent women are now joining the
young, the poor and the uninformed who have been, until now, the main groups
seeking late abortions.

  Furthermore, estimating the gestational age of a fetus in the womb--a crucial
aspect of a successful abortion--remains an inexact art. In March, doctors at the
Valley Abortion Clinic in Phoenix estimated that one woman was 19 to 20 weeks
pregnant; days later she delivered not an aborted fetus but a 2y2-pound, 32-week
baby. It survived after two months of intensive care at a Phoenix hospital.

  Finally, medical science in the past 10 years has greatly improved its ability to
care for premature babies. Infants are becoming viable earlier and earlier. Those
with a gestational age of 24 weeks and weighing as little as IV2 pounds can now
survive if given the best of care.

  So long as doctors perform abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy (as is legal
everywhere in the United States under the 1973 Supreme Court ruling), it is
statistically certain that some of these borderline cases will turn out to be viable
babies, born alive. It happened again last May in Chicago--a 19-to-20-week estimate,
a live-born 2-pound baby boy.

  By ignoring the problem of abortion live births, the courts and the medical
establishment are choosing to overlook a long, well-documented history of cases:
January 1969, Stobhill Hospital, Glasgow, Scotland: A custodian heard a cry from a
paper bag in the snow beside an incinerator. He found a live baby. It was taken
inside and cared for in the hospital's operating theater but died nine hours later.
The infant's gestational age had been estimated at 26 weeks by the physician
performing the abortion. It was actually closer to 32 weeks. No efforts were made to
check for signs of life before the aborted baby was discarded. No charges were filed.

Because the case had been written about in British medical journals, it was a
matter of record--before abortion was legalized in this country--that such things
could happen.

  April 1973, Greater Bakersfield Hospital, Bakersfield, Calif.: A 4V2-pound infant
was born live following a saline abortion (induced by an injection of salt solution)
performed by Dr. Xayier Hall Ramirez. Informed by phone, Dr. Ramirez ordered
two nurses to discontinue administering oxygen to the baby. His instructions were
countermandated by another doctor; the baby survived and later was placed for
adoption. Ramirez was indicted for solicitation to commit murder. His attorney
argued that a medical order based on medical opinion, no matter how mistaken, is
privileged. Dr. Irvin M. Cushner of the University of California at Los Angeles, later
to become a top health policy official in the Carter administration, testified that it
was normal for Ramirez to expect the delivery of a dead or certain-to-die infant as
the result of a saline abortion.

  July 1974. West Penn Hospital, Pittsburgh: Dr. Leonard Laufe performed an
abortion on a woman who contended she had been raped--though that and her
account of when she became pregnant were later disputed. She had been turned
down for an abortion at another hospital, where the term of her pregnancy was
estimated at 26 to 31 weeks. Laufe put it at 20 to 22. The abortion, induced by an
injection of prostaglandin, a substance that stimulates muscle contraction and deliv-
ery of the fetus, was filmed for use as an instructional film. The film showed the
three-pound infant moving and gasping. Also, a nurse and a medical student testi-
fied that they had noticed signs of life. No charges were filed, however, after a
coroner's inquest at which Laufe testified that the infant sustained fatal damage
during delivery.

   February 1975, Boston: Dr. Kenneth Edelin was convicted of manslaughter for
neglecting to give care to a 24-week infant after a 1973 abortion at Boston City
Hospital. Witnesses said Edelin held the infant down, constricting the flow of
oxygen through the umbilical cord and smothering it. He was the first and only
American doctor ever convicted on charges of failing to care for an infant born
during an abortion. The conviction was overturned by the Massachusetts Supreme
Court on the ground that improper instructions had been given to the jury. Edelin
and his lawyer argued that he had taken no steps to care for the infant because it
was never alive outside the womb.

   March 1977, Westminster Community Hospital, Westminster, Calif.: A seven-
month baby girl was born live after a saline abortion performed by Dr. William
Waddill. A nurse testified that Waddill, when he got to the hospital, interrupted her
efforts to help the baby's breathing. A fellow physician testified that he had seen
Waddill choke the infant. "I saw him put his hand on this baby's neck and push
down," said Dr. Ronald Cornelson. "He said, 'I can't find the goddamn trachea, and
'This baby won't stop breathing.' " Two juries, finding Cornelson an emotional and
unconvincing witness, deadlocked in two separate trials. Charges against Waddill
were then dismissed. He had contended the infant was dying of natural causes by
the time he got to the hospital.

   July 1979, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles: Dr. Boyd Cooper delivered
an apparently stillborn infant, after having ended a problem pregnancy of 23 weeks.
Half an hour later the baby made gasping attempts to breathe, but no efforts were
made to resuscitate it because of its size (1 pound 2 ounces) and the wishes of the
parents. The baby was taken to a small utility room that was used, among other
things, as an infant morgue. Told of the continued gasping, Cooper instructed a
nurse, "Leave the baby there--it will die." Twelve hours later, according to testimo-
ny of the nurse, Laura VanArsdale, she returned to work and found the infant still
in the closet, still gasping.

   Cooper then agreed to have the baby boy transferred to an intensive care unit,
where he died four days later. A coroner's jury ruled the death "accidental" rather
than natural but found nothing in Cooper's conduct to warrant criminal action.

   A common thread in all these incidents is that life was recognized and the episode
brought to light by someone other than the doctor. Indeed, there is evidence that
doctors tend to ignore all but the most obvious signs of life in an abortion baby.

   In the November 1974 newsletter of the International Correspondence Society of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, several doctors addressed a question from a practi-
tioner who had written in an earlier issue that he was troubled by what to do when
an aborted infant showed signs of life.

   One was Dr. Ronald Bolognese, an obstetrician at Pennsylvania Hospital in Phila-
delphia, who replied:

   "At the time of delivery, it has been our policy to wrap the fetus in a towel. The
fetus is then moved to another room while our attention is turned to the care of [the
woman]. She is examined to determine whether complete placental expulsion has

      87-101 0--81 21
                                         316

occurred and the extent of vaginal bleeding. Once we are sure that her condition is
stable, the fetus is evaluated. Almost invariably all signs of life have ceased."

  (Bolognese recanted that statement in a 1979 interview. "That's not what we do
now," he said. "We would transport it to the intensive care nursery.")

  In addition, Dr. William Brenner of the University of North Carolina Medical
School suggested that if breathing and movement persist for several minutes, "the
patient's physician, if he is not in attendance, should probably be contacted and
informed of the situation. The pediatrician on call should probably be apprised of
the situation if signs of life continue."

  Dr. Warren Pearse, executive director of the American College of Obstetrics and
Gynecology, was asked in a 1979 interview what doctors do, as standard practice, to
check whether an aborted fetus is alive.

   "What you would do next [after expulsion] is nothing," Pearse said. "You assume
the infant is dead unless it shows signs of life. You're dealing with a dead fetus
unless there is sustained cardiac action or sustained respiration--it's not enough if
there's a single heartbeat or an occasional gasp."

  These seemingly callous policies are based on the assumption that abortion babies
are too small or too damaged by the abortion process to survive and live meaningful
lives. That is not necessarily the case, though, even for babies set aside and neglect-
ed in the minutes after delivery.

   A nursing supervisor who asked not to be identified told of an abortion live birth
in the mid- 70s in a Florida hospital. The infant was dumped in a bedpan without
examination, as was standard practice. "It did not die," the nurse said. "It was left
in the bedpan for an hour before signs of life were noticed. It weighted slightly over
a pound."

  The baby remained in critical condition for several months, but excellent care in
a unit for premature infants enabled it to survive. The child, now 5 years old, was
put up for adoption. The nursing supervisor, who has followed its progress, said she
has pictures of the youngster "riding a bicycle and playing a little piano."

  In the spring of 1979 two babies were born alive, five weeks apart, after saline
abortions at the Wilmington Medical Center. They were given vigorous care, sur-
vived and were later adopted. One had been discovered by a nurse, struggling for
breath and with a faint heartbeat, after having been placed in a plastic specimen
jar. The second was judged to be a live delivery and was given immediate help
breathing.

  A baby girl, weighing 1 pound 11 ounces, was born in February 1979 after a saline
abortion at Inglewood (Calif.) Hospital. Harbor General Hospital, which is associated
with UCLA and is fully equipped to care for premature babies, was called for help,
but the neonatal rescue team did not respond. The infant died after three hours.

  The Los Angeles Department of Health Services investigated and was told that
there had been confusion over the baby's weight and that it reportedly showed poor
vital signs. It was "very unusual for them not to pick up [an infant] of this size,' Dr.
Rosemary Leake of Harbor General told investigators.

  The administrator of a New York abortion unit, asked what would be done for a
live-born abortion baby, said, "The nurses have been trained in how to handle this.
I'd like to think we would do everything to save it. But honestly I'm not sure."

  These incidents together suggest that life in an aborted infant may or may not be
recognized. If it is, supportive treatment may or may not be ordered.

   Such incidents, when discovered, often provoke prosecutions. A few may seem
something like murder at first blush. But on closer inspection the doctors' actions
have been judged, time and again, not quite to fit the definition of a crime.

  Nowhere was this more vividly shown than in the case of Dr. Jesse J. Floyd, who
was indicted on charges of murder and criminal abortion by a grand jury in
Columbia, S.C., in August 1975. The charges were the result of an abortion a year
earlier of a baby that appeared to have a gestational age of 27 to 28 weeks. It
weighed 2 pounds 5 ounces and lived for 20 days.

   In October 1979 the state dropped its case against Floyd. County prosecutor James
C. Anders later conceded in an interview that South Carolina's abortion law was of
dubious constitutionality. "In the second place," he said, "I had a reluctant witness
[the infant's mother]. That and the passage of time worked against me."

  A detailed record was developed in the case, as part of a federal suit that Floyd
brought against Anders in which he sought to block the state prosecution. The 20-
year-old mother, Louise A., lived in the small town of Hopkins, worked at a mili-
tary-base commissary and had plans to enroll in a technical college. Those plans
made her unwilling to have the baby she was carrying, so she presented herself for
an abortion at Floyd's office in July 1974. Court records indicate that she had been
told erroneously by her hometown doctor's nurse that she was not pregnant, and
that she only slowly realized that she was.
                                             317

  Floyd found her to be past the first trimester of pregnancy, and under South
Carolina law that meant an in-hospital abortion would be required. There were
delays in her raising $450 for the abortion and more delays in admitting her to
Richland Memorial Hospital. She was injected with prostaglandin on Sept. 4 and
expelled the live baby early on the morning of Sept. 6.

  "I started having real bad labor pains again," Louise recalled in her deposition,
"and finally my baby was born. I called the nurse. Then about four or five of them
came in the room at the time. The head nurse came in the same time the other
nurses came in and she told me did I know that the baby was a seven-month baby. I
told her no.

   "One of the nurses said that the baby was alive. They took the baby out of the
room. He never did cry, he just made some kind of a noise."

  The first doctor on the scene, paged from the cafeteria, was a young resident. She
did not hesitate. On detecting a heartbeat of 100, she clamped and severed the
umbilical cord and had the baby sent to the hospital's intensive care unit.

   "It was a shock, a totally unique emergency situation, very upsetting to all of us,"
the doctor, who now practices in California, said in an interview. "Some people have
disagreed with me [about ordering intensive care for an abortion live birth] but that
seems to me the only way you can go.

   "It's like watching a drowning. You act. You don't have the luxury of calling
around and consulting. You institute life preserving measures first and decide about
viability later on."

  Ten days after birth, the baby had improved markedly and was given a 50-50
chance of survival. Then he developed a tear in the small intestine and died of that
and other complications on Sept. 26.

   Louise A. never saw the child. She checked out of the hospital two days after the
abortion and did not return. But she did show a passing interest in the baby's
progress.

   "I kept calling this nurse," Louise said in her deposition. "I would call . . . and
get information from them about the baby, and they told me he was doing fine.
They told me he had picked up two or three pounds. I started going to school, and
one afternoon I called home and they told me the baby had died, but no one told me
the cause of his death."

   Floyd never saw the infant either. On the day of the abortion, his hospital
privileges at Richland were withdrawn, and they have never been restored.

   These circumstances presented prosecutor Anders with a difficult case. Floyd had
had no physical contact with the live-born infant, nor was he issuing orders concern-
ing its care. Nonetheless, Anders thought the doctor could be held responsible for
the infant's death.

   Anders pressed his murder charge using an old English common-law theory.
Under this theory, willfully doing damage to a "vital" infant in the womb could be
considered a crime against the fetus as a person. The abortion itself, Anders alleged,
was an assault.

   The line of argument is not entirely farfetched. For instance, a Camden, N.J.,
man was convicted of murder in 1975 after he shot a woman in the abdomen late in
her pregnancy, causing the dealth of the twins she was carrying. But application of
the theory to abortion had never been tested--in South Carolina or anywhere else.

   South Carolina law in the mid-1970s prohibited third-trimester abortion unless
two other doctors certified that the abortion was essential to protect the life or
health of the mother. No such certifications were made for Louise. However, various
Supreme Court rulings suggested that both the requirement of consultation with
other doctors and the explicit definition of viability (as beginning in the third
trimester) would make that law unconstitutional.

   Floyd's lawyers, George Kosko of Columbia, S.C., and Roy Lucas of Washington,
also filed voluminous expert affidavits on the difficult of estimating gestational age
accurately. At worst, they argued, Floyd had made a mistaken diagnosis. What
proof was there that he had intentionally aborted a viable baby?

   District Court Judge Robert Chapman and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed that the prosecution was based on flimsy evidence and should be blocked.
However, the Supreme Court disagreed, in a ruling in March 1979, and suggested
that judgment should be withheld on constitutional matters until the state prosecu-
tion had run its course. The way was thus cleared for Anders to proceed, but with
witnesses dispersed, memories fading and the legal basis for prosecution still doubt-
ful, Anders chose to drop the case.

   Floyd, 49, continues performing first-trimester abortions at his Ladies Clinic, but
the loss of hospital privileges and the damage to his reputation caused his surgical
practice to collapse, he said.
                                         318

  The long legal proceeding also seems to have had a chilling effect on abortion
practice throughout South Carolina, which Anders concedes was one of his inten-
tions.

   "The main thing is the dilemma it puts the other physicians in," Floyd said in an
interivew. "It's just about dried up second-trimester abortions in this state. I have to
send mine to Atlanta, Washington or New York."

   Asked about late abortions and the risk of live births, Floyd said he thought
abortions performed through the sixth month of pregnancy create "a problem to
which there isn't an answer. We probably need to move back to 20 weeks. I would
be reluctant to do one now after 20 weeks."

  A similar case occurred about the same time in South Carolina, when Anders
obtained a criminal indictment charging Dr. Herbert Schreiber of Camden, S.C.,
with first-degree murder and illegal abortion.

  On July 18, 1976, a month after the charges had been filed, the 60-year-old doctor
was found dead in a motel room in Asheville, N.C. A motel maid discovered the
body slumped in a chair. Several bottles of prescription drugs were recovered from
the room. Two days later the Buncombe County medical examiner ruled the death a
suicide from a drug overdose.

   Schreiber, who left no not, had pleaded not guilty to the charge of having killed a
live baby girl after an abortion by choking or smothering her to death.

  Comparing the Floyd and Schreiber cases, Anders found an irony: Schreiber "just
reached in and strangled the baby," the prosecutor said his evidence showed. "I
charged him with murder, and he committed suicide. If he had been willing to wait,
he probably would have been OK too"

  Not every doctor who performs a late abortion has to confront an aggressive
prosecutor like Anders. But even those abortion live births that escape public notice
raise deeply troubling emotions for the medical personnel involved. "Our training
disciplines you to follow the doctor's orders," explained a California maternity
nurse. "If you do something on your own for the baby that the doctor has not
ordered and that may not meet with his commitment to his patient, the mother can
sue you. A nurse runs a grave risk if she acts on her own. Not only her immediate
job but her license may be threatened."

  Nonetheless, nursing staffs have led a number of quite revolts against late abor-
tions. Two major hospitals in the Fort Lauderdale areas, for instance, stopped
offering abortions in the late 1970s after protests from nurses who felt uncomfort-
able handling the lifelike fetuses.

  A Grand Rapids, Mich., hospital stopped late-term abortions in 1977 after nurses
made good on their threat not to handle the fetuses. One night they left a stillborn
fetus lying in its mother's bed for an hour and a half, despite angry calls from the
attending physician, who finally went in and removed it himself.

  In addition, a number of hospital administrators have reported problems in
mixing maternity and abortion patients--the latter must listen to the cries of
newborn infants while waiting for the abortion to work. And it has proved difficult
in general hospitals to provide round-the-clock staffing of obstetrical nurses willing
to assist withg the procedure.

  One young nurse in the Midwest, who quit to go into teaching, remembers "a
happy group of nurses" turning nasty to each other and the physicias because of
conflicts over abortion. Ond day, she recalled, a woman physician "walked out of the
operating room after doing six abortions. She smeared her hand [which was covered
with blood] on mine and said,'Go wash it off. That's the hand that did it.' "

  Several studies have documented the distress that late abortion causes many
nurses. Dr. Warren M. Hern, chief physician, and Billie Corrigan, head nurse, of the
Boulder (Colo.) Abortion Clinic, presented a paper to a 178 Planned Parent-hood
convention entitled "Waht About Us? Staff Reactions . . . "

  The clinic, one of the largest in the Rocky Mountain states, specializes in the D&E
(dilation and evacuation) method of second-trimester abortion, a procedure in which
the fetus is cut from the womb in pieces. Hern and Corrigan reported that eight of
the 15 staff members surveyed reported emotional problems. Two said they worried
about the physician's psychological well-being. Two reported horrifying dreams
about fetuses, one of which involved the hiding of fetal parts so that other people
would not see them.

   "We have produced an unusual dilemma," Hern and Corrigan concluded. "A
procedure is rapidly becoming recognized as the procedure of choice in late abortion,
but those capable of performing or assisting with the procedure are having strong
personal reservations about participating in an operation which they view as de-
structive and violent."

  Dr. Julius Butler, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of
Minnesota Medical School, is concerned about studies suggesting that D&E is the
                                             319

safest method and should be used more widely. "Remember," he said, "there is a
human being at the other end of the table taking that kid apart.

  "We've had guys drinking too much, taking drugs, even a suicide or two. There
have been no studies I know of of the problem, but the unwritten kind of statistics
we see are alarming."

  "You are doing a destructive process," said Dr. William Benbow Thompson of the
University of California at Irvine. "Arms, legs, chests come out in the forceps. It's
not a sight for everybody."

  No all doctors think the stressfulness is overwhelming. The procedure "is a little
bit unpleasant for the physician," concedes Dr. Mildred Hanson, a petite woman in
her early 50s who does eight to 10 abortions a day in a clinic in Minneapolis, just a
few miles across town from where Bulter works. "It's easier to . . . leave someone
else--namely a nurse--to be with the patient and do the dirty work.

  "There is a lot in medicine that is unpleasant" but necessary--like amputating a
leg--she argues, and doctors shouldn't let their own squeamishness deprive patients
of a procedure that's cheaper and less traumatic.

  However, Dr. Nancy Kaltreider, an academic psychiatrist a the University of San
Francisco, has found in several studies "an unexpectedly strong reaction" by the
assisting staff to late-abortion procedures. For nurses, she hypothesizes, handling
tissues that resemble a fully formed baby "runs directly against the medical empha-
sis on preserving life."

  The psychological wear-and-tear from doing late abortions is obvious. Philadel-
phia's Dr. Bolognese, who seven years ago was recommending wrapping abortion
live-boms in a towel, has stopped doing late abortions.

   "You get burned out," he said. Noting that his main research interest is in the
management of complicated obstetrical cases, he observed: "It seemed kind of
schizophrenic, to be doing that on the one hand [helping women with problem
pregnancies to have babies] and do abortions."

  Dr. John Franklin, medical director of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Penn-
sylvania, was the plaintiff in a 1979 Supreme Court case liberalizing the limits on
late abortions. He does not do such procedures himself. "I find them pretty heavy
weather both for myself and for my patients," he said in an interview.

  Dr. Kerenyi, the New York abortion expert, who is at Mt. Sinai Hospital, has
similar feelings but reaches a different conclusion. "I first of all take pride in my
deliveries. But I've seen a lot of bad outcomes in women who did not want their
babies--so I think we should help women who want to get rid of them. I find I can
live with this dual role."

  The legal jeopardy, the emotional strain, the winking neglect with which "signs of
life" must be met--all these things nurture secrecy. Late abortions take place
"behind a white curtain," as one prosecutor put it, well sheltered from public view.

  Only one large-scale study has been done of" live births after abortions--by George
Stroh and Dr. Alan Hinman in upstate New York from July 1970 through Decem-
ber 1972 (a period during which abortion was legal in New York alone). It turned up
38 cases of live births in a sample of 150,000 abortions.

  Other studies, including one that found signs of life in about 10 percent of the
prostaglandin abortions at a Hartford, Conn., hospital, date from the mid-1970s. No
one is so naive as to think there is reliable voluntary reporting of live births in the
present climate, according to Dr. Cates of the Center for Disease Control.

   Evidence gathered during research for this story suggests, without proving defini-
tively, that much of the traffic in later abortions now flows to the New York and
Los Angeles metropolitan areas, where loose practice more easily escapes notice.

   "The word has spread," the Daily Breeze, a small Los Angeles suburban paper,
said in July 1980, "that facilities in greater Los Angeles will do late abortions. How
late only the woman and the doctor who performs them know."

  This kind of thing is disturbing even to some peole with a strong orientation in
favor of legal abortion. For instance, the Philadelphia office of CHOICE, which
describes itself as "a reproductive health advocacy agency," will recommend only
Dr. Kerenyi's service at Mt. Sinai among the half-dozen in New York offering
abortion up to 24 weeks. The others have shortcomings in safety, sanitation or
professional standards, in the agency's view.

  An internal investigation of the abortion unit at Jewish Memorial Hospital in
Manhattan, showed that six fetuses aborted there in the summer of 1979 weighed
more than 1 Vb pounds. The babies were not alive, but were large enough to be
potentially viable. A state health inspector found in June 1979 that the unit had
successfully aborted a fetus that was well over a foot long and appeared to be of 32
weeks gestation. Hospital officials confirmed in an interview that later in 1979 a
fetus weighing more than four pounds had been aborted.
                                                  320

  "It's disconcerting," Iona Siegel, administrator of the Women's Health Center at
Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn, said of abortions perfomed so late
that the infant is viable. When Ms. Siegel hears, as she says she often does, that a
patient turned away by Kingsbrook because she was past 24 weeks of pregnancy
had an abortion somewhere else, "that makes me angry. Number one, it's against
the law. Number two, it's dangerous to the health of the mother."

  Though one might expect organized medicine to take a hand in bringing some
order to the practice of late abortions, that is not happening.

  "We're not really very pro-abortion," said Dr. Ervin Nichols, director of practice
activities for the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. "As a matter of
fact, anything beyond 20 weeks, we're kind of upset about it."

  If abortions after 20 weeks are a dubious practice, how does that square with
abortion up to 24 weeks being offered openly in Los Angeles and New York and
advertised in newspapers and the Yellow Pages there and elsewhere?

  "That's not medicine," Nichols replied. "That's hucksterism."
  Cates, of the Center for Disease Control, concedes that he has ambivalent feelings
about those who do the very late procedures. There is obviously some profiteering
and some bending of state laws forbidding abortions in the third trimester. But
since late abortions are hard to get legally in many places, Cates puts a low priority
on trying to police such practices. Medical authorities leave the late-abortion practi-
tioners to do what they will. And so, too, by necessity, do the legal authorities.
  The Supreme Court framed its January 1973 opinion legalizing abortion around
the slippery concept of viability. As defined by Justice Harry Blackmun in the
landmark Roe v. Wade case, viability occurs when the fetus is "potentially able to
live outside the mother's womb albeit with artificial aid."
  The court granted women an unrestricted right to abortions, as an extension to
their right of privacy, in the first trimester of pregnancy. From that point to
viability, the state can regulate abortions only to make sure they are safe. And only
after a fetus reaches viability can state law limit abortion and protect the "rights"
of the fetus.
  "Viability," Blackmun wrote, after a summer spent researching the matter in the
library of the Mayo Clinic, "is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but
may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks."
  The standard was meant to be elastic, changing in time with medical advances.
Blackmun took no particular account, though, of the possibility of abortion live
births, or of errors in estimating gestational age.
  In subsequent cases, the high court ruled that:
  A Missouri law was too specific in forbidding abortion after 24 weeks. "It is not
the proper function of the legislature or the court," Blackmun wrote, "to place
viability, which essentially is a medical concept, at a specific point in the gestational
period."
  A Pennsylvania law was too vague. The law banned abortions "if there is suffi-
cient reason to believe that the fetus may be viable." The court said it was wrong to
put doctors in jeopardy without giving them clearer notice of what they must do.
  State laws could not interfere with a doctor's professional judgment by dictating
the choice of procedure for late abortions or by requiring aggressive care of abortion
live births.
  According to a 1979 survey by Jeanie Rosoff of Planned Parenthood's Alan Gutt-
macher Institute, 30 states have laws regulating third-trimester abortions. Some of
these laws prohibit or strictly limit abortions after the fetus has reached viability.
Some require doctors to try to save abortion live-born babies. Only a few states have
both types of laws.
  In addition, a number of these laws have been found unconstitutional. Others
obviously would be, in light of Supreme Court rulings. Virtually all the state laws
would be subject to constitutional challenge if used as the basis of prosecution
against an individual doctor.
  New York and California, ironically, have among the strongest, most detailed
laws mandating care for survivors of abortions. But these laws have proved only a
negligible check on the abortion of viable babies.
  "We've had a number of claims come up that a baby was born live and full effort
was not given to saving it," said Dr. Michael Baden, former chief medical examiner
of New York City. "We've not had cases of alleged strangulation (as with Dr.
Waddill in California) and that surely must be rare. All [the doctor] has to do is
nothing and the result is the same."
  Alan Marrus, a Bronx County assistant district attorney, has investigated several
live-birth cases and the applicable New York law. He has yet to find "a case that
presented us with facts that warranted prosecution. You need an expert opinion
                                             321

that in fact there was life and that the fetus would have survived. Often the fetus
has been destroyed--so there is nothing for your expert witness to examine."

  The incidents only come to light at all, Baden and Marrus noted, if some whistle-
blower inside the hospital or clinic brings them to the attention of the legal
authorities. The credibility of that sort of witness may be subject to attack. And
even if the facts do weigh against a doctor, he has some resources left. Almost
always he can claim to have made no more than a good-faith error in medical
judgment.

   "This is happening all over the place" said a California prosecutor. "Babies that
should live are dying because callous physicians let them die." But he despairs of
winning any convictions. "Nobody's as dumb as Waddill. They're smarter today.
They know how to cover themselves."

  Unfortunately, advances in medical technique may only aggravate the overall
problem. Fetuses are becoming viable earlier and earlier, while the demand for
later abortions shows no sign of abating. Some argue that Justice Blackmun's
definition of viability as "usually seven months" was obsolete the day it was pub-
lished. It clearly is now.

  A decade ago, survival of an infant less than 3 pounds or 30 weeks gestation was
indeed rare, principally because the lungs of smaller infants, unaided, are too
undeveloped and fragile to sustain life. Now infants with birth weights of about 1%
pounds routinely survive with the best of care, according to Dr. Richard Behrman,

   Sometimes even smaller babies make it, and the idea that most of them will be
retarded or disabled is out-of-date, Behrman said. "Most . . . survive intact."

   Even with the medical advances, though, some live-born infants are simply too
small and undeveloped to have a realistic chance to survive. A survey last year of
specialists in neonatal care found that 90 percent would not order life-support by
machine for babies smaller than 1 pound 2 ounces or less than 24 weeks gestation.
And on occasion, a newborn may manifest muscular twitches or gasping movements
without ever "being alive" according to the usual legal test of drawing a breath that
fills the lungs.

   Still, it is no longer a miracle for an infant of 24 weeks development (which can
be legally aborted) to be saved if born prematurely.

   "It is frightening," said Dr. Roger K. Freeman, medical director of Women's
Hospital at the Long Beach Memorial Medical Center in Long Beach, Calif. "Medi-
cal advances in the treatment of premature babies enable us to save younger fetuses
than ever before. When a fetus survives an abortion, however, there may be a
collision of tragic proportions between medicine and maternity. Medicine is now
able to give the premature a chance that may be rejected by the mother."

   In 1970, Freeman developed the fetal stress test, a widely used technique for
monitoring the heart rate of unborn fetuses. Also, he and a colleague at Long
Beach, Dr. Houchang D. Mondalou, have developed a drug, betamethzene, that
matures premature lungs within days instead of weeks. The hospital claims a 90
percent success rate with infants weighing as little as 1 pound 11 ounces.

   At the University of California at Irvine, work is used way on an "artifical
placenta" that doctors there say could, within five years, push the threshold of
viability back even further.

   The life-saving techniques are not exclusive to top academic hospitals, either.
Good neonatal care is now broadly available across the United States. In fact, the
lively issue in medical circles these days is not whether tiny premature babies can
be saved, but whether it is affordable. Bills for the full course of treatment of a two-
pound infant typically run between $25,000 and $100,000. To some, that seems a lot
to pay, especially in the case of an abortion baby that was not wanted in the first
place.

   The only way out of the dilemma, it would seem, would be for fewer women to
seek late abortions. Though some optiomists argue that this is happening, there is
evidence that it is not.

   Studies show that women seeking abortions late in the second trimester are often
young, poor and sexually ignorant. Many either fail to realize they are pregnant or
delay telling their families out of fear at the reaction. The patients also include
those who have had a change of circumstance or a change of heart after deciding
initially to carry through a pregnancy; some of these women are disturbed.

   As first-trimester abortion and sex education become more widely available, the
optimists' argument goes, nearly all women who choose abortion will get an early
abortion. But in fact a new class of older, well-educated, affluent women has now
joined the hardship cases in seeking late abortions.
                                             322

  This is because a recently developed technique, amniocentesis, allows genetic
screening of the unborn fetus for various hereditary diseases. Through this screen-
ing, a woman can learn whether the child she is carrying is free of such dreaded
conditions as Downs syndrome (mongolism) or Tay-Sachs disease, a genetic disorder
that is always fatal, early in childhood.

  The test involves drawing off a sample of amniotic fluid, in which the fetus is
immensed in the womb. This cannot be done until the 15th or 16th week. Test
cultures for the various potential problems take several weeks to grow. Sometimes
the result is inconclusive and the test must be repeated. The testing also reveals the
unborn child's sex and can be used to detect minor genetic imperfections.

  To many women, particularly those over 35, amniocentiesis seems a rational
approach to minimizing the chances of bearing a defective child. A few, according to
published reports, go a step further and make sure the baby is the sex they want
before deciding to bear the child.

  In any case, it is late in the second trimester--within weeks of the current
threshold of viability--before the information becomes available on which a decision
is made to abort or not abort. The squeeze will intensify as amniocentesis becomes
more widely available and as smaller and smaller infants are able to survive.

  The abortion live-birth dilemma has caught the attention of several experts on
medical ethics, and they have proposed two possible solutions.

  The simplest, advocated by Dr. Sissela Bok of the Harvard Medical School among
others, is just to prohibit late abortions. Taking into account the possible errors in
estimating gestational age, she argues, the cutoff should be set well before the
earliest gestational age at which infants are surviving.

  Using exactly this reasoning, several European counties--France and Sweden, for
example--have made abortions readily available in the first three months of preg-
nancy but very difficult to get thereafter. The British, at the urging of Sir John
Peel, an infuential physician-statesman, have considered in each of the last three
years moving the cutoff date from 28 weeks to 20 weeks, but so far have not done so.

  But in this country, the Supreme Court has applied a different logic in defining
the abortion right, and the groups that won that right would not cheerfully accept a
retreat now.

  A second approach, advocated by Mrs. Bok and others, is to define the woman's
abortion right as being only a right to terminate the pregnancy, not to have the
fetus dead. Then if the fetus is born live, it is viewed as a person in its own right,
entitled to care appropriate to its condition.

  This "progressive" principle is encoded in the policies of many hospitals and the
laws of some states, including New York and California. As the record shows,
though, in the alarming event of an actual live birth, doctors on the scene may
either observe the principle or ignore it.

  And the concept even strikes some who do abortions as misguided idealism.
  "You have to have a feticidal dose" of saline solution, said Dr. Kerenyi of Mt.
Sinai in New York. "It's almost a breach of contract not to. Otherwise, what are you
going to do--hand her back a baby having done it questionable damage? I say, if
you can't do it, don't do it."
  The scenario Kerenyi describes did in fact happen, in March 1978 in Cleveland. A
young woman entered Mt. Sinai Hospital there for an abortion. The baby was born
live and, after several weeks of intensive care at Rainbow Babies and Childrens
Hospital, the child went home--with its mother.
  The circumstances were so extraordinary that medical personnel broke the code
of confidentiality and discussed the case with friends. Spokeswomen for the two
hospitals confirmed the sequence of events. Mother and child returned to Rainbow
for checkup when the child was 14 months old, the spokeswoman there said, and
both were doing fine.
  The mother could not be reached for comment. But a source familiar with the
case remembered one detail: "The doctors had a very hard time making her realize
she had a child. She kept saying, 'But I had an abortion.'"

                                     How THINGS SOMETIMES GO WRONG

  Of the various ways to perform an abortion after the midpoint of pregnancy,
there is only one that never, ever results in live births.

  It is D&E (dilatation and evacuation), and not only is it foolproof, but many
researchers consider it safer, cheaper and less unpleasant for the patient. However,
it is particularly stressful to medical personnel. That is because D&E requires
literally cutting the fetus from the womb and, then, reassembling the parts, or at
least keeping them all in view, to assure that the abortion is complete.
                                         · 323

  Ten years ago it was considered reckless to do an abortion with cutting instru-
ments after the first trimester of pregnancy. Now, improved instruments, more
skilled practitioners and laminaria--bands of seaweed that expand when moist and
are used to gently dilate the cervix, creating an opening through which to extract
fetal parts--allow the technique to be used much later.

  D&E is being hailed as extending the safe and easy techniques used for first-
trimester abortions (cutting or vacuuming out the contents of the womb) well into
the second three months of pregnancy. But there are dissenters. Dr. Bernard Nath-
anson, formerly a top New York City abortionist, now an anti-abortion author and
lecturer, says that D&E "is a very dangerous technique in the hands of anyone less
than highly skilled."

  Besides, D&E puts all the emotional burden on the physicians. And there are
other techniques that allow the doctor, as one physician put it, to "stick a Aeedle in
the [patient's] tummy," then leave the patient to deliver the fetus vaginally as in
normal childbirth and nurses to assist and clean up.

  These more common methods for abortion after the midpoint of pregnancy use
the instillation of either saline solution or prostaglandin. In these procedures, some
of the woman's nurturing amniotic fluid is drawn out of the womb by an injection
through her belly and is replaced with the abortion-inducing drug. (The amount of
fluid in the womb is kept relatively constant to make sure the womb does not
rupture.)

   The two instillation substances work in different ways. Saline solution poisons the
fetus, probably though ingestion, though the process is not completely understood.
Usually within six hours, the fetal heartbeat stops. At the same time, the saline
induces labor, though supplemental doses of other labor-inducing drugs often are
given to speed this effect.

   Prostaglandin, on the other hand, is a distillate of the chemical substance that
causes muscles to move. It is thought not to affect the fetus directly but instead is
potent at inducing labor. Fetal death, if it does occur, is from prematurity and the
trauma of passage through the birth canal.

   Each substance also has an undesired side effect. Saline, an anti-coagulant that
increases bleeding, can make minor bleeding problems more serious and in rare
cases even cause death. Prostaglandin, because it causes muscles to contract indis-
criminately, was found to cause vomiting and diarrhea in more than half the
patients in early tests. Claims that it causes fewer major complications, which made
it preferred to saline by many in the mid-1970s, have now been questioned. And the
high incidence of live births (40 times more frequent than with saline, according to
one study) also has lessened its popularity.

   But saline is not foolproof either in preventing live births. Dr. Thomas F. Kerenyi
of Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York, the best-known researcher on saline abortions,
said most live births result from "errors in techniques"--either administering too
small a dosage or getting some of it into the wrong part of the womb.

   A wrong estimation of gestational age can cause either a saline or prostaglandin
abortion to fail. A larger-than-expected fetus might survive the trauma of labor or
might reject a dose of saline (or urea, a third instillation substance sometimes used).

   And on the basis of physical examination alone, studies show, doctors miss the
correct gestational age by two weeks in one case out of five, by four weeks in one
case out of 100, and sometimes by more than that. Pregnancies can be dated more
exactly by a sonogram, a test that produces an outline image of the fetus in the
womb, but because of its cost (about $100) many doctors continue to rely on physical
exams.

   There is one other abortion technique, hysterotomy, but it is the least desirable of
all from several points of view. Because it is invasive surgery (identical to a
Caesarean section), it has a much higher rate of complication than do the installa-
tion techniques. Usually done only after attempts to abort with saline have failed, it
has the highest incidence of all of live births.

   As the infant is lifted from the womb, said one obstetrician, "he is only sleeping,
like his mother. She is under anesthesia, and so is he. You want to know how they
kill him? They put a towel over his face so he can't breathe. And by the time they
get him to the lab, he is dead."

   Over the years, the chief criterion in choosing between abortion methods has been
safety for the patient. Advocates of D&E contend that bleeding, perforation of the
uterus and infection all occur less frequently with D&E than with other methods.
Dr. Willard Cates of the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta prefers D&E. Be-
cause it can be done--unlike instillation--in the early part of the second trimester,
he has said, the need for as many as 80 percent of the very late abortions could be
eliminated.

   How very late are abortions performed?
                                                  324

  His own clinic at Mt. Sinai, Dr. Kerenyi said, screens patients closely to make
sure they are not past the legal 24-week limit. But in theory, he said, there is
nothing to prevent successful saline abortions from being performed "virtually all
the way to birth. At 30 weeks, say, you would just have to draw off and inject that
much more of the solution."

  Most practitioners who were interviewed say they stop doing D&E at 18 to 22
weeks. But again, there appears to be nothing to prevent the technique from being
used much later.

  "You can do it, you can do it," an abortionist, who would talk only if not quoted
by name, said of D&Es late in pregnancy. "Some son-of-a-bitch misreads a sonogram
and sends me a woman 26 weeks. I've done it. You've just got to take your time and
be careful. And you're not going to end up with a live birth."

                              "I STOOD BY AND WATCHED THAT BABY DIE"

  Nurses are the ones who bear the burden of handling the human-looking products
of late abortions. And when an unintentional live birth occurs, they are the first to
confront the waving of limbs and the gasping.

  Reluctant to talk about their experiences, most of those interviewed for this
article did not want their names to be published, and out of professional loyalty,
they did not even want their hospitals to be named.

  They spoke of being deeply troubled by what they have seen of late abortions in
American hospitals.

  Linda is a nurse in her late 50s in Southern California. Hurrying out of a
patient's room one day to dispose of the aborted "tissue," as nurses were taught to
think of it, she felt movement. Startled, she looked down, straight into the staring
eyes of a live baby.

  "It looked right at me," she recalled. "This baby had real big eyes. It looked at
you like it was saying. 'Do something--do something.' Those haunting eyes. Oh God,
I still remember them."

  She rushed the lVfe-pound infant to the nursing station. She took the heart rate--
80 to 100 beats a minute. She timed the respirations--three to four breaths a
minute. She called the doctor.

  "I called him because the baby was breathing," Linda said. "It was pink. It had a
heartbeat. The doctor told me the baby was not viable and to send it to the lab. I
said, 'But it's breathing' and he said, 'It's non-viable, it won't be breathing long--
send it to the lab.' "

  She did not follow the order. Nor did she have resources at her command to
provide any life-saving care. Two hours later the infant died, still at the nursing
station, still without medical treatment. It died in a makeshift crib with one hot-
water bottle for warmth and an open tube of oxygen blowing near its head.

  The nursing supervisor, Linda said, had refused to let her put the baby in the
nursery, where there was equipment to assist premature babies in distress. "She
said to follow the doctor's orders and take it to the lab. I kept it with me at the
station. We couldn't do an awful lot for it."

  This happened eight years ago, in 1973, but Linda is still upset. "I stood by and
watched that baby die without doing a thing," she said. "I have guilt feelings to this
day. I feel the baby might have lived had it been properly cared for."

  Jane, about 50, is the head floor nurse in an Ohio hospital. She and her fellow
nurses successfully petitioned their hospital in 1978 to stop doing late abortions.
Twice before that, she witnessed live births after abortions.

  She recalls vividly the 16-year-old patient who phoned her mother after her
abortion and and said in an agonized voice, "Ma, it's out--but Ma, it's alive."

  That happened in 1975. Jane still speaks of it bitterly, her eyes flashing anger.
  A year earlier Jane saw the second abortion live birth in her experience. "I was
called by the patient's roommate," she recalled. "When I got there the baby's head
was sticking out and its little tongue was wiggling. Everybody felt they couldn't do
anything until they called the doctor. It was a little thing--it only lasted about 15
minutes. But it was alive, and we did nothing. And that was wrong."
  It rankles, too, that she was routinely forced to handle dead fetuses, the size and
shape of well-formed premature babies.
  "Because of my position," she said, "I had to pick them up off the bed and put
them in a bottle of formalin [a preservative fluid]. Sometimes you had to have a
very large container. Our gynecologists seemed to have a very poor ability to
estimate gestational age. Time and again they would say with a straight face, 'This
woman is 20 weeks pregnant' when she was actually 26 weeks."
                                                  325

  Norma Rojo, about 35, is an obstetrical nurse at Indio Community Hospital in
Indio, Calif. She was present the night of May 3, 1980, when a 15-year-old patient
delivered a live baby girl after a saline abortion.

  "Get rid of it" the patient cried hysterically. "I'm sorry. Mama--get rid of it," she
said, the baby alive, kicking and crying between her legs.

  Two weeks earlier the girl had been in a traffic accident that killed four others
and had sought the abortion out of fear that her baby might be damaged.

  The fetus, which in tests had shown a normal heartbeat of 132 to 136 in the
womb, appeared healthy at birth. "She was beautiful." said Mrs. Rojo. "She was
pink. There were no physical deformities. She let out a little lusty cry. She lay in a
basin put there to catch all the stuff. She was waving her arms and legs. You could
tell she was making a big effort to live."

  The nurses cut the umbilical cord, wrapped the infant in a blanket and took her
to the intensive care nursery. She was put in an isolette (a life-support system)
within minutes and was given oxygen.

  Acting on their own, the nurses had the 1 pound 14 ounce baby transferred six
hours later to Loma Linda University Medical Center, one of several hospitals in
the Los Angeles area specializing in the care of very small premature infants. Four
days later the baby was reported stable but had developed a complication causing
hemorrhaging of the brain. Dr. David Deming of Loma Linda said then that its
chances were only 50-50. He added, though, that the abortion had done little
damage. "I would say there is probably no effect on her from the saline."

   Eleven days after birth, the baby died. Family members indicated they were upset
by the nurses' effort to save it.

   "After this experience," Rojo said, "my friend [another nurse] and I are changed.
We realize doctors aren't perfect. . . . I hope this is the last [abortion live birth] I
ever see, but if there are any more, we will do the same thing."

   The CHAIRMAN. Are there any other questions of these witnesses
by any member of the committee?

   [No response.]

                   ABORTION NOT MENTIONED IN CONSTITUTION

   The CHAIRMAN. I want to say this on the subject of abortion.
Abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution of the United States.
This field was never delegated by the States to the Union at the
time the Constitution was written or by any amendment since the
adoption of the Constitution.

   Therefore, I do not hesitate to say that in my judgment the
Supreme Court had no jurisdiction in entering the field of abortion.
In my opinion that field is reserved to the States under the Consti-
tution, but they went into it anyway. They not only went into it,
they have written a law on it, practically, as you have stated here
today.

   Now, however, the testimony of Judge O'Connor as I recollect it
was that she stated how she voted on these matters back yonder,
and then after that the question of abortion became, if you want to
call it, a hotter question, a question more timely and it has re-
ceived a lot more consideration.

   She did not answer about how she would vote on that question
because, if she had done that, then she would disqualify herself
from voting as a member of the Supreme Court on that question,
when it comes before it, if it does. She said she anticipated it would
come before the Supreme Court.

   Therefore, I wanted to just bring out that point, that I do not
think she could be censured necessarily for not saying how she
would vote as a member of the Supreme Court on abortion because
she would disqualify herself from voting on that question if it does
come before the Supreme Court again.

  I want to thank you witnesses here today, Dr. Willke and Dr.
Gerster both. You have made a very fine impression on the mem-
bers of the committee here, I am sure, and we thank you for your

                                          Testimony of
                                   Carolyn Gerster, M.D.

                                            Before the
                              Senate Judiciary Committee

                                      September 10, 1981

            I would like to thank Sen. Strom Thurmond and the members
of the Senate Judiciary Committee for the opportunity to testify
at this confirmation hearing.

            I am an Arizona physician and was the co-founder and first
president of the Arizona Right to Life Committee in October of
1971. I have served as director from Arizona to the board of
directors of the National Right to Life Committee since its
formation in 1973 and am the immediate past president of the
national organization. My current position is Vice President
in charge of International Affairs.

            I would like to comment on the Justice Department memoran-
dum from Kenneth W. Starr, dated July 7, 1981, summarizing his
July 6th telephone investigation of Judge Sandra D. O'Connor's
voting record on family-related issues during the period that
she served in the Arizona State Senate. The memo reads in part:
"Judge O'Connor further indicated, in response to my questions,
that she had never been a leader or outspoken advocate on behalf ·
of either pro-life or abortion-rights organizations. She knows
well the Arizona leader of the right-to-life movement, a prominent
female physician in Phoenix, and has never had any disputes or
controversies with her."

             I was not contacted by the Justice Department for verifi-
cation. This statement has been understandably misunderstood by
members of the legislature and media to imply that Judge O'Connor
and I share similar beliefs on the abortion issue.

             I have known Sandra Day O'Connor since 1972. She is a
                                     328

gracious and a gifted lady. Quite apart from our social contact,
however, we were in an adversary position during 1973 and 1974
due to Senator O'Connor's position on abortion-related legislation
while she served as Senate majority leader.

            The Justice Department memorandum is misleading and incom-
plete regarding Senator O'Connor's voting record from 1970
through 19 74.

            All of her votes cast on abortion-related bills during this
period have been consistently supportive of legalized abortion
with the possible exception of S.B. 1333 which allows physicians,
medical personnel, and hospitals the right to refuse to participate
in abortion procedures on moral or religious grounds. The bill
was actually more related to freedom of conscience than to abortion,
per se. The memo neglects to point out that S.B. 1333 passed
unanimously (30 to 0) in the Senate, supported by those on both
sides of the abortion debate.

             In 1970, H.B. 20 proposed to remove all restrictions from
abortions done by licensed physicians without regard to indication
or duration of pregnancy. This bill, predating the 1973 Supreme
Court decision by three years, would, if enacted, have allowed
abortion on request to term, a radical concept even when compared
to the most permissive of existing state laws in New York.

            The Justice Department memo states that, -"There is no
record of how Senator O'Connor voted, and she indicated that
she has no recollection of how she voted."

            An article by Howard E. Boyce, Jr., appearing in the Arizona
Republic on April 30, 1970, records the vote of all nine members
of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. O'Connor is recorded as
casting one of the six votes for the bill, as she did in the
Senate Rules Committee where the bill later failed to pass fAri zona
Republic, May 1, 1970).

            There were no votes cast by Senator U'Connor in 1971, as
the two proposed abortion bills, H.B. 51 and S.B. 123, were sent
                                    329

to the Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee where they failed
to pass."

            In 1972, no abortion-related legislation was introduced,
as the legislative route was abandoned by abortion advocates in
favor of the judiciary. (The Arizona abortion law was upheld as
constitutional on appeal).

            In 1973, Senator O'Connor co-sponsored the Family Planning
Act (S.B. 1190) which, as originally worded, would have furnished
"all medically acceptable family planning methods and information
to anyone regardless of age," without parental consent. A state
or county physician could refuse to provide "service" on "medical
grounds."

            The Justice Department memo states that, "The bill made
no express mention of abortion and was not viewed by then
Senator O'Connor as an abortion measure.... She recalls no
controversy with respect to the bill and is unaware of any hearings
on the proposed measure."

             In 1973, abortion certainly was regarded by many as a
"medically acceptable method of family planning" and was so
regarded by several state senators as well as the Arizona Republic
 (see attached Senate Public Health and Welfare minutes and Arizona
Republic editorial of March 5, 1973).

             S.B. 1190 passed Public Health and Welfare Committee but
was held up in Rules Committee. Contrary to the Justice Depart-
ment memo, hearings were held and the bill certainly was regarded
as controversial.

             On May 9, 1974, Senator O'Connor was one of nine senators
voting against S.B. 1245 after an amendment had been added in
the House "prohibiting certain abortions at educational institu-
tions under jurisdiction of the board of regents." Senator
O'Connor's vote is explained in the memo as being "on the ground
that the Arizona Constitution forbade enactment of legislation
treating unrelated subject matters... Her reasons for so voting
are nowhere stated on the record."

             In the August 1981 "First Monday," the publication of the
Republican National Committee, and in a August 3rd letter from the
White House to Mrs. Marie Craven of Chicago, Illinois, S.B. 1245
was cited as the only example of Mrs. O'Connor's voting record
on abortion-related subjects. The letter erroneously stated
that the bill was "turned down" by the Senate because the amend-
ment was unrelated. Actually, S.B. 1245 passed 20 to 9, with
one member absent. The amendment was not ruled to be non-germaine.

            The most important piece of pro-life legislation is totally
omitted from Mr. Starr's memorandum.

            In 1974, after a rally of over 10,000 Arizonans and the
submission of 35,000 names of registered voters favoring the
measure, House Memorial 2002 passed the Arizona House of Repre-
sentatives by a 41 to 18 vote. The memorial would have petitioned
the U.S. Congress to pass a Human Life Amendment to the Constitu-
tion restoring legal protection to the unborn child except where
the mother's life was in jeopardy.

            H.B. 2002 passed the Senate Judiciary by a 4 to 2 vote.
Sandra O'Connor is reported in the April 23, 1974, Phoenix
Gazette as voting against it even after amended to include rape
and incest in addition to life of the mother.

            On May 7, 1974, a Phoenix Gazette article quoted Sandra
O'Connor as follows: "I'm working hard to see to it that no
matter what the personal views of people are, the measure doesn't
get held up in our caucus." On May 15, 1974, H.R. 2002 failed
to pass the majority caucus by one vote. Sen. Trudy Camping, a
member of the Caucus, has submitted a notarized statement that
Sen. O'Connor voted against the memorial.

            The President's personal assurance to me on January 17,
1980, at the Hilton Hotel in Rye, New York, was reiterated in
the 1980 Republican platform, as "We will work for the appoint-
ment of judges at all levels of the judiciary who respect
traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human
life."

            I realize that there are some members o-f the Senate who
do not share our beliefs that abortion is the most basic of all
civil rights.

            There is, however, general agreement that misrepresentation,
evasion, and distortion of fact do a disservice to the selection
of a justice to the nation's highest court.

            I have every confidence that this committee will make
a full investigation of this deeply flawed and seriously mis-
leading Justice Department memorandum.

                             Senate Judiciary Committee
             I am here to speak for the National Right to Life Committee.
Our organization is composed of the fifty state right-to-life
organizations which contain almost 2000 active chapters and an
estimated membership in the millions.
             We are concerned.
             We exist as a movement because of the 1973 Roe y._ Wade
decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. Just as the Dred Scott
decision of 1857 was the civil rights outrage of that century,
so we see Roe v. Wade as a similar blot upon our nation in this
century. In Dred Scott, the Supreme Court ruled that an entire
class of living humans were chattel. This decision denied
Black Americans equal protection by law.
             Let us flash back in time to the post-Civil War era, and
ask a question. Suppose a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court
was being questioned and his qualifications examined. Suppose
that person, as a legislator, had previously voted for the
continuation of slavery, not once but twice. Suppose also that
he had voted against a memorial resolution asking the Congress
to pass a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery, again
voting for this discrimination not once but twice.

                                    332

            Would it not be a proper question to inquire whether that
nominee still held to his pro-slavery convictions?

            We believe so. We also believe that if such earlier
actions were not totally repudiated by that nominee, that
nominee would be disqualified from sitting on the Supreme Court.

            A century has passed. Another Supreme Court, by a similar
7-2 decision, ruled (in Roe v^ Wade) that another entire class
of living humans were to be reduced to the status of property
of the "owner" (the mother). Further, the mother was given a
newly created "right to privacy," a right that allowed her to
destroy that property--her unborn child--if she wished.

            Because of this ruling and because of the Court's inter-
pretation of the word "health," we have seen the body count of
unborn babies climb to its present level of 1% million annually.

            There are indeed some "single issues" which are so
fundamental that they ought to be weighed very heavily in con-
sidering any lifetime appointment to the federal bench--among
these, racial justice. In 1948 G. Harrold Carswell gave a speech
in which he said, "I believe that segregation of the races is the
proper and the only practical and correct way of life in our
states." During Senate consideration of his nomination to the
U.S. Supreme Court 22 years later, Judge Carswell completely
repudiated this position. Yet this matter weighed heavily upon
the minds of many senators, and quite properly so. Concern over
Carswell's commitment to racial justice played an important role
in the rejection of his nomination.

            We believe that recognition of the right to life of unborn
children is, likewise, a fundamental issue. Those who do not
recognize this fundamental right should be considered disqualified
for the federal bench.

            A nominee sits before this distinguished body, which will
decide whether she is qualified to sit upon the U. S. Supreme
Court. There are serious questions to ask. Her record as a
state legislator is disturbing.
                                   333

            In 1970, Mrs. Sandra O'Connor was a state senator in
Arizona. Only one-third of the states had legalized abortion,
most laws being highly restrictive. New York had just legalized
abortion-on-demand until 24 weeks, and was to be the second last
state to legalize abortion by statute. Thirty-three states
were to vote on such proposed laws and to defeat them. The
nation had been shocked by the radical New York law and had
already read of babies surviving abortion attempts.

            In this climate, Senator O'Connor voted for a bill that
would have legalized abortion-on-demand in her state for the
entire nine months of pregnancy. No statute remotely as radical
had been seriously considered elsewhere.

            This was not a casual vote on the floor during a busy
legislative session. We can all understand how, in the push
of a busy session, a lawmaker can at times vote without full
knowledge of a bill's dimensions, and we can certainly under-
stand how one might not always remember such a vote.

            But Senator O'Connor was a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee that had studied the bill. Hers was no casual action.
Clearly, it was a deliberate vote cast with full awareness of
the reach of that legislation. Furthermore, she voted for the
bill a second time in a later caucus.

            A few weeks ago, the nation was informed through the
"Starr Memo" that Mrs. O'Connor did not remember her votes on
this bill.

            As events transpired, the Supreme Court in 1973 actually
legalized abortion through the entire nine months of pregnancy.
In 1974, the Arizona House of Representatives, by a wide margin,
passed a memorialization resolution calling upon Congress to
reverse that radical abortion ruling through a Constitutional
Amendment.

            Once again Senator O'Connor, as a member of that state's
Judiciary Committee, had the issue placed before her. Once again,
by voting against that resolution (even after it was amended to
                                     334

 exclude cases of rape and incest), Mrs. O'Connor placed herself
 in favor of abortion, essentially on-demand, through the ninth
month of pregnancy. Again, she repeated her pro-abortion vote
 in caucus.

              But Mrs. O'Connor has more recently stated that she is
"personally opposed" to abortion. I have never met an abortion
clinic operator or an abortionist who was not "personally opposed."
The simple fact is that such a statement often is totally meaning-
less as an indicator as to how such a person views abortion for
others.

             There is another important point. The Supreme Court's
1973 abortion decisions had no authentic basis in the Constitution.
Rather, they constituted the most extreme examples of "judicial
activism" by the Supreme Court which we have seen in this century--
"an exercise in raw judicial power," as Justice Byron White said
in his dissent to Roe v_. Wade. Even many "pro-choice" legal scholars
recognize that these decisions were without constitutional foun-
dation.

             Completely aside from the question of whether or not Mrs.
O'Connor personally believes that abortion should be legal or not,
it is essential that the Judiciary Committee determine how she
views the constitutionality of the Supreme Court's abortion
decisions. If O'Connor regards the 1973 abortion decisions as
constitutional decisions, and as binding precedents, then she is
not in fact a judicial "constructionist," and her nomination should
be rejected for that reason alone.

             We recognize the possibility that a person might state
that she was "personally opposed," that she might favor permissive
abortion laws, but at the same time could still view Roe v. Wade
as seriously flawed, an unwarranted exercise of "raw judicial
power," and an unconstitutional decision that must be reversed.
If in fact such was the case, we would be pleased to reevaluate
our position of opposition to her appointment.
                                      335

                         In closing, I must say that the lady sitting next to me
            (Dr. Carolyn Gerster) is probably no more or less perfect than
           the rest of us. She undoubtedly has her faults. One fault that
            she does not have, however, and none of us who know her could
           even conceive of her having, is that of being "vindictive."

                           ABORTION BILL CLEARS SENATE JUDICIARY PANEL

                                    (By Howard E. Boice, Jr.)
  A long-dormant bill to legalize abortions cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee
over the objections of its chairman yesterday and moved to Rules Committee, where
it could be voted on today.
  The bill, which passed the House Feb. 26, would remove all legal sanctions against
abortions performed by licensed physicians.
  It was the first time the measure appeared on the Judiciary Committee agenda. It
passed by a 6 to 3 vote.
  Chairman John Conlan, R-Maricopa, and Sens. Dan Halacy, R-Maricopa, and
James F. McNulty, D-Cochise, voted against the bill.
  Sens. Chris Johnson, R-Maricopa, Harold C. Giss, D-Yuma, Michael Farren, R-
Maricopa, David B. Kret, R-Maricopa, James F. Holley, R-Maricopa, and Sandra
O'Connor, R-Maricopa, voted in favor of the measure.
  The Judiciary Committee also approved bills to establish a division of children's
services in the State Welfare Department, to permit courts to remove a felony
conviction from the record of a defendant believed to have been rehabilitated, to
overhaul initiative and referendum procedures and to stop the prosecution of per-
sons now subject to criminal charges for acts of self-defense.
  The Senate, meanwhile, passed and sent to the House bills to permit creation of
metropolitan transit authorities with the power to levy taxes to cover operating
losses and to issue revenue bonds up to $2 million for capital outlay, and to
establish a nine-member commission on judicial qualifications with the power to
recommend removal of incompetent judges.
  Also, the Senate Appropriations Committee reversed an earlier action and voted 6
to 4 for $2.75 million to build a maximum security facility at the Arizona State
Hospital. The committee had killed a similar bill earlier this session.
  The Appropriations Committee also approved a bill to provide state aid for public
school kindergartens.
  Several members of the Senate, both Republican and Democrat made floor speech-
es yesterday condemning what they termed political motivation behind recent at-
tacks on the welfare department by Rep. Frank Kelley, R-Maricopa, and Rep.
Burton S. Barr, R-Maricopa.
  Sen. E. B. Thode, D-Pinal, contended that Kelley had used a directive by an
interim committee of which has was chairman to spend $20,000 for a welfare
department "study" that he released before having committee approval.
  She termed the study and subsequent statements by Kelley and Barr about the
report a "witch hunt" directed at Welfare Commissioner John O. Graham.
  Sen. Boyd Tenney, R-Yavapai, said Kelley was using the report, prepared by Prof.
Edmund Mech of Arizona State University, as a "vendetta."
  In another matter, Barr and House Speaker John Haugh, R-Pima, were accused
by Sen Dan Halacy, R-Maricopa, of engineering the "execution" in the House of a
bill that would have lowered the presumptive level of drunkenness from .15 per cent
blood alcohol to .10.
  ". . . Speaker John Haugh decreed the fate of Senate Bill 147," Halacy stated,
"and majority leader Burt Barr was the Lord High Executioner."
  "It is clear to me, and to many who are more expert in these matters than I,"
Halacy added, "that .10 per cent is a needed change. Why did the House leadership
kill it?"

                                         [From the Arizona Republic, Mar. 5, 1973]

                                    EDITORIAL: "DANGERS OF VAGUE BILL"

   The family planning bill being considered by the Arizona Senate, S.B. 1190, is
inexcusably vague, precisely the sort of measure to lead to agonies of judicial
interpretation.

   At the Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee's meeting scheduled today,
members should give closer attention to a bill they've already revised slightly
because of uncertain language.

   The bill says that "all medically acceptable family planning methods and informa-
tion" should be furnished to anyone in Arizona seeking them, "regardless of sex,
race, income, number of children, marital status, citizenship or motive."

   Regardless of motive? Is a prostitute to be guaranteed state contraceptives for her
job?
                                         338

  Regardless of citizenship? Is a tourist state such as Arizona to dole out contracep-
tives to every visitor from near and far who demands them?

  Regardless of marital status? Obviously, the new morality.
  The original wording also said regardless of age, but some senators apparently
realized this could mean the state must approve the facilitation of statutory rape.
  In addition, the bill says that a physician can refuse to provide family planning
methods or information "for medical reasons." Medical, but not moral.
  While the legislature may feel itself inadequate to decide questions of family
planning morality, it should recognize that physicians don't uniformly approve
encouraging sexual relations under every circumstance, even if medically accept-
able.
  The bill does add that private institutions, physicians, and their employees
shouldn't be held liable for refusing to supply the information and methods, al-
though these are treated as every citizen's right. But if they are automatically a
right, could they be legally withheld?
  Late last year in Montana, a judge ordered a Catholic hospital to sterilize a
woman because she considered it her right, even though the hospital and staff
objected.
  Perhaps the most important question, however, has been raised by Sen. John
Roeder who, as even he describes himself, is not the most antiabortion member of
the legislature.
  He fears the vagueness of the bill's reference to "all medically acceptable family
planning methods" could positively put the state into the business of encouraging
abortions.
  Only a decade ago, family planning was commonly accepted as referring to
contraception, but contraception was sharply differentiated from abortion even by
family planning's faithful boosters.
  But now the abortion front has developed dishonest terminology in which abor-
tion isn't even described as "interruption of pregnancy" but "post-conceptive family
planning."
  Planned Parenthood used to be distressed by people who believed contraception
was murder, just like abortion. Yet now PP often blurs the distinction even more
terribly.
  Rather than inhibiting abortion, as some unwise supporters of the bill contend, it
might make it more widespread.
  Why, indeed, is this bill proposed? The state certainly has no policy of discourag-
ing contraception. The bill appears gratuitous--unless energetic state promotion of
abortion is the eventual goal.

                                  MINUTES FROM MARCH 5, 1973 HEARING

  Senator Runyan moved to insert the words "required by a licensed practical nurse
in this state." On line 2, page 5, after the word "qualifications" and then strike the
remainder of the section; the motion carried. He then moved to insert the words
"for a license" on line 10, after the word "applicant" and on line 11 after the words
"meets" to strike the remainder of the section and insert "the qualifications for
licensing specified in Section 32-1637."; the motion carried.

  Senator Runyan then moved the bill be returned to the Senate with a do pass
recommendation as amended, the motion carried. Senator Roeder voted no and
requested a minority report.

                                             SB 1190--FAMILY PLANNING

  This bill had been discussed at the previous meeting and some amendments had
been made. Senator Runyan asked what the status of the bill was at this point. The
chairman stated that copies of the amendments considered at the last meeting were
ready for each member but that they would have to be considered again. Senator
Runyan moved the bill for purpose of amendments. He then moved to strike lines 2
through 6 on page 1.; on page 2, line 2, strike "AGE" and on line 9, strike "IN" and
insert "BY"; on line 10, after "OFFICES" insert a period and strike remainder of
line and strike line 11.

  Senator Roeder stated that the editorial appearing on the morning Republic (2/5/
73) stated far better than he could that the bill before the Committee was useless;
that since the Supreme Court had ruled on Abortion it was not a legislative problem
but a legal problem and that presently abortion was a perfectly proper form of
family planning.
                                             339

  Senator Corbet stated he hoped the members were not equating abortion with
birth control as that was not his understanding of the bill. He did not favor abortion
but felt this bill was an attempt to change some of the practices of the past whereby
birth control information was not available. He further stated that his vote killed
the abortion bill in Committee two years ago and he still feels the same way but
sees a difference in the Supreme Court Ruling and this bill before the Committee.
He stated the Legislature should be one of action and not reaction. He also stated
that while he did not wish to court trouble with the Arizona Republic he did not
agree with their article in the morning paper.

  Senator Alexander stated that the Federal Government (Health Education &
Welfare) has already issued guide lines for block grants and that family planning
plays a big part and this should be considered as Arizona will be affected eventual-
ly. He stated that he felt the time has come when the Committee should adopt a
statewide program providing for limited family planning. He stated he does not
advocate the State providing abortions.

   Senator Runyan moved an amendment to his original amendment on page 2, line
2, strike "OR MOTIVE". A vote was taken on the entire amendment and carried.

   Senator Runyan moved to amend the bill on page 2, line 19, after "SERVICES"
insert ", EXCLUSIVE OF SURGICAL PROCEDURES EXCEPT WHERE RE-
QUIRED FOR DIAGNOSIS". This motion carried with Senators Camping and
Roeder voting no.

   Senator Runyan moved to amend on line 21 after "PARENT" by inserting the
words "IS OBTAINED" and striking the remainder of the paragraph.

   Mr. William Carter of Maricopa County Health Dept. and Mr. Joe Davis of
Phoenix Planned Parenthood both spoke against this amendment.

   Senator Roeder stated the amendment would do away with the basis of the bill
and that is why he felt the Committee should put the bill aside and re-do it in order
to have something the people of Arizona could live with.

   Dr. William Russell stated it was the minors they were trying to help and the
need was now.

   Senator Runyan stated he was aware of the problem but that he had a moral
problem in that he felt the bill was one more step in breaking down the family unit
and he could not see taking control of minors away from the parents.

   Senator Corbet stated he felt very strongly about the family as a unit but that
something had to be done. Dr. Russell stated that the minors most doctors were
seeing had already strayed and that it was not the family that got pregnant.
Senator Camping stated that maybe these youngsters had never heard that it was
wrong.

   Senator Guteirrez stated that the amendments being offered in the bill were not
going to change the family situation, those parents with control of their children
would still have control. Dr. William Moore said the Committee might want to
substitute the word "contraceptive" for family planning. Father M. Calegari called
attention to two contraceptives already on the market.

   Senator Alexander offered a substitute motion to Senator Runyan's, to insert the
words "DESIRABLE WHERE POSSIBLE BUT" on line 22, after the word "IS.", this
motion carried with Senator Runyan and Camping voting no.

  A concurrent Memorial urging an amendment to the Constitution of the United
States establishing that human life with legal personality begins at the time of
conception and that all constitutional rights, including due process of law, apply to
the unborn in the same manner and to the same extent as to all other citizens of
the United States.

  To the Congress of the United States of America:
  Your memorialist respectfully represents:
  Whereas, respect for human life has been a hallmark of civilized society for
millennia; and
  Whereas, a legal threat to the right to life of any individual member of a society
imperils the right to life of every other member of that society; and
   Whereas, respect for and protection of unborn human life has been traditional
with the medical profession since long before the beginning of the Christian era
regardless of prevailing political, religious or social ideologies; and
   Whereas, the moment of birth represents merely an identifiable point along the
course of human development and not the beginning of human life; and
   Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has withdrawn all legal protection
from an entire class of human beings, namely, the unborn.
   Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizo-
na, the
   Senate concurring, prays:
   1. That the Congress of the United States take appropriate action to amend the
Constitution of the United States establishing that with respect to the right to life,
the word "person" in the fifth and fourteenth amendments to our federal constitu-
tion applies to all human beings, including their unborn offspring at every stage of
their biological development, irrespective of age, health, function or condition of
dependency, except in an emergency where a reasonable medical certainty exists
that continuation of the pregnancy will cause the death of the mother.

                                         MEMORIAL ADVANCED BY PANEL

   The Senate Judiciary Committee reported out a House-approved Right to Life
Memorial after hearing comments from both sides.

   The final vote was 4 to 2 with Republican Sens. Sandra O'Connor of Paradise
Valley and John Roeder of Scottsdale voting against the memorial. Roeder told the
committee his response by Phone calls and written message ran 175 to 72 against
the memorial.

   Sen. Hal Runyan, R-Litchfield Park, added an amendment which would permit
abortions where rape, incest or other criminal action was responsible for a preg-
nancy.

   The memorial calls on Congress to extend constitutional propositions to unborn
babies by prohibiting abortions. An exception also would be made where the moth-
er's life was imperiled.

                                      EXCERPTS FROM A LENGTHY ARTICLE

   Mrs. Meyer's interview occurred at a time during which Arizona House Memorial
2002, which urges the U.S. Congress to pass an amendment to the U.S. Constitution
                                             342

giving the fetus all constitutional rights including the right to life from the moment
of conception, is under debate in the Senate majority caucus.

  Sen. Sandra O'Connor (R-Paradise Valley), Senate Majority Leader, is hopeful
that the bill will go to the floor before the end of this legislative session. "I'm
working hard to see to it that no matter what the personal views of people are, the
measure doesn't get held up in our caucus."

  Note: Attached is an affidavit signed by former Arizona State Senator Trudy
Camping, stating that O'Connor voted against the memorial in caucus.

                                       PRO-LIFE HEAD RAPS SENATE GOP

  The president of Arizona Youth for Life has blamed the GOP Senate caucus for
the failure of a legislative memorial against abortion to be passed.

  Margaret Saunders of Scottsdale, head of the 400-member student organization
formed recently, said, "No other measure up for the state legislature's consideration
this session had such an overwhelming demonstration of citizen support."

  She said that more than 10,000 persons attended a prolife rally at the State
Capitol in January and 35,000 persons signed petitions supporting the memorial
introduced in the House, which approved the measure 41-43 in March.

  "Thus the very heavy responsibility for blocking this measure to death rests
squarely with the Senate GOP caucus," which did not schedule the proposal onto
the Senate floor for action. Miss Saunders said.

  She said the group will "increase our determination to electorally remove from
office that insensitive group who blockaded the efforts of so many other conscien-
tious legislators of both parties."

                                                                              PHOENIX, ARIZONA, July 23, 1981.

To Whom It May Concern:
  While serving in the Arizona State Senate from 1971-1974, I was a member of the

Judiciary Committee and a member of the Majority Caucus.
  On April 23, 1974, HCM 2002--extending protection to the unborn, was passed out

of Judiciary Committee. It was amended to allow for incest and rape.
  After that it was considered in the Majority Caucus, possibly on May 1st, but did

not receive the necessary votes for further consideration.
  In both the Committee and the Caucus, Sen. O'Connor voted no--the bill was

killed.

                                                                                         Mrs. TRUDY CAMPING,

                                                                             Former State Senator.

  The CHAIRMAN. Our next witness is Dr. Carl Mclntire, represent-
ing the International Council of Christian Churches. Dr. Mclntire,
come around.

  Dr. Mclntire, if you will speak for 5 minutes and then be subject
to questions, the blue light means you are on; the yellow, there is 1
minute left; and the red, your time is up.

  Will you stand and be sworn, please?
  Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?
  Dr. MCINTIRE. SO help me God.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU may proceed, Dr. Mclntire.

          TESTIMONY OF DR. CARL McINTIRE, PRESIDENT,
       INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF CHRISTIAN CHURCHES

  Dr. MCINTIRE. Mr. Chairman, Members of the U.S. Senate, my
name is Carl Mclntire. I live in Collingswood, N.J. I am pastor of
the Bible Presbyterian Church there. I appear in my capacity as
president of the International Council of Christian Churches. This
                                                  343

is an agency set up by fundamental churches over the world, has a
membership of 334 Protestant denominations in 86 states.

  First, let me identify myself fully with the testimony you have
just heard from Dr. Willke and Dr. Gerster. I am here, however, in
connection with the matters of liberty as they pertain to our
churches in this country. The first amendment guarantees the free
exercise of religion, and our Bible Churches and our fundamental
churches and pastors have suffered incalculable loss at the hands
of the U.S. Supreme Court, which not only refuses to hear our
cases but is responsible for abridging our freedom of religion.

   It had been the hope of many Christians that President Reagan
would give us a new beginning on the Supreme Court, too. Judge
O'Connor has her position stated in William & Mary Law Review;
she has verified it here. We cannot accept it and we cannot accept
her.

   First, I think we must recognize that there has been and is a
religious upheaval in this country, in which the free exercise of
religion is involved. Churches and people are separating from the
major denominations, leaving the National Council of Churches
and the World Council of Churches. When this is done, the rights
of these people are then denied by the courts, in particular the
Supreme Court.

   This covers the whole realm or range of religious activities: Bible
conferences, FCC regulations, IRS legislation, Justice Department
decisions, civil rights taking preference over religious rights, mail-
ing permits for religious papers, the grantings of visas, chaplains in
the armed services, recognition of accrediting agencies, and the
restriction of international congresses and general bureaucratic
harassment. There is hardly a realm of religious activity where
these new and separated religious bodies are not suffering and
being denied their free exercise of religion.

   Justice Connor made her position clear in the Law Review, and
she has accepted an expounds the position of the Burger Court on
abstention, that the Federal court should abstain from intervening
in these State courts as they handle these constitutional matters.

   Senator, I speak from bitter and costly experience, in case after
case and constant court litigation for the past 16 years. After my
church broke away from the United Presbyterian Church because
of its new, modernistic doctrines and apostasy, we started a Bible
conference in Cape May, N.J., called the Christian Admiral. The
city of Cape May refused to give tax exemption to this property.
The State law provided for exemption under the free exercise of
religion.

   The litigation consumed 6 years and cost more than the taxes
would have cost. The highest Tax Court, however, gave full tax
exemption to the Bible Conference. When the appeal was taken up
to the State superior court where the State political pressures
abound, it was reversed. Finally, when the case reached the Su-
preme Court of the United States, it refused to look at it.

   Though the city gave tax exemption to a bingo hall run by the
Roman Catholic Church in the center of town, our Bible Confer-
ence pays taxes on the hall where daily and Sunday religious
services are conducted. There is now no appeal. Judge O'Connor's
view of State court decisions being accepted, prevailed. This is the
                                                  344

only Bible Conference in the State that pays taxes, but we are
separated Presbyterians and in a great deal of trouble.

  Senator, I have sat here during these 3 days and listened to this
testimony. I have not heard of a single Senator asking any ques-
tions in this whole, broad area where our fundamental churches
are having so much trouble with the courts. You, Senator, were the
only one that asked a question about the free exercise of religion;
you brought up the question of prayer, but you did not go into the
question of prayer and Bible reading.

  Senator, I have sat here with frustration. I have heard these
Senators say that if something did come up, it might change their
mind. Here we ftre now, I guess there is only one Senator left--that
is you--and I brought up this whole area that has not even been
looked into. Nothing has been said whatsoever about Judge O'Con-
nor's position in regard to this resolution or this Memorial 2003
back there in April of 1973, in which she succeeded in blocking a
memorial to the President and to the Congress asking for full first
amendment rights to be given to broadcasters.

  We would like to have her questioned on that matter because, as
a result of that, that is the issue, that is the case where we lost our
radio station WXUR. We did not have our full first amendment
rights.

  Senator, I raise this question of radio broadcasters, 8,000 stations
in this country are involved. They are fearful. You cannot get into
controversial issues in these questions because of the Supreme
Court of the United States. When we finally got up there, Senator,
they would not hear us, and we have suffered incalculably.

  There is the question here of church properties, a 5 to 4 decision
back there in September 1979. Who gets the properties of these
churches that are withdrawing from the National Council of
Churches. It is a broad issue all over this country.

  Then we have the question here, Senator, of Shelton College. We
have been 2 years of litigation with the State court taking the
position of Judge O'Connor and the Federal Courts intervening and
saving the college's life from being closed down. That whole thing
has involved already 2 years of litigation, 200,000 dollars' worth of
cost to the college. The issue is coming right up, there is an appeal
before the Supreme Court right now simply on the jurisdiction
question, and when it gets there it is Judge O'Connor's position as
she stated here in this Law Review article from William & Mary,
the same identical thing that she is in favor of, now she is going to
be asked to make a decision on.

  Senator, may I tell you, I have listened here and I saw these
Senators come and say, "If something developed, it might change
our mind." I am talking only to you, Senator. I want to say I object.
A matter of such weight to the churches, a matter of such great
concern to our liberty where we are suffering should be heard by
this entire committee.

  In fact, I would like to request that Judge O'Connor be brought
back and answer questions concerning this overture that she op-
posed. She was the one that led in defeating it in Arizona, that the
radio stations get their full first amendment rights. She was not
for it. It involves our preaching. It involves our Bible Conference. It
involves these things.
                                                   345

  We come down to the end of the road, sir, I think this thing has
been stacked. We have had quite a situation here. The President
said, "Don't talk about it. Wait until we get to the hearing, and if
something comes up at the hearing then you can judge this thing,"
but, sir, I have been here all this time and no one except you has
touched this broad field of religious rights, the first amendment
rights. Our separated churches, our independent churches are suf-
fering. It goes into this question of our schools and whether we can
get a license or teach.

  Senator, I want to protest it. I want to protest coming down to
the end of this hearing and only having you to talk to. I sat here
and listened at every Senator here on the bench, I listened to them,
and a majority have already said they are going to vote for her, so
how in the world could we even change their minds at the present
time with a 5-minute speech.

  Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. Dr. Mclntire, you mentioned a memorial consid-
ered in the Arizona State Legislature which called for the Presi-
dent and Congress to give full first amendment rights to broadcast-
ers in programing. Is there in your mind a distinction between the
scope of first amendment rights guaranteed to the licensee of pub-
licly owned airways and the first amendment rights, for example,
of a newspaper publisher?

   Dr. MCINTIRE. There should be none, sir, absolutely none. The
first amendment is not restricted. One of the good Senators here
said yesterday there was no difference now between--that TV had
become news, and he mentioned the term "the press." I think that
the restraints that have been placed there by the FCC should be
removed and that the entire radio world should have the same
identical freedom as the press, and be subject to the same re-
straints of law such as slander and libel and things of that sort.

   If we had that, I could talk, sir. I have lost 400 radio stations
from my broadcast because of what the Federal Communications
Commission did in killing WXUR. When we went to the U.S.
Supreme Court, they would not hear it. Senator, you yourself made
a statement on the floor of the Senate saying that we had lost our
first amendment rights, and Sam Ervin made a 6,000-word speech
on the Senate floor saying that it should not have been done.

   It has put fear, and it has put anxiety, and radio station owners
will not permit controversial or issue problems to be dealt with for
fear of complaints that are carried to the FCC. The expense is
great, and when they get up there, of course, they could lose their
license. It is the pressure that is brought, and this pressure, Sena-
tor, has been brought by the religious groups.

   It was the United Church of Christ representing the National
Council of Churches that went after radio station WXUR in Phila-
delphia, which Faith Theological Seminary owned, of which I am
the pastor. After 8 years of litigation, we got here to the U.S.
circuit court here in Washington, and Judge Bazelon was the chair-
man. The only thing left at that time after all those hearings was
the question of the programing, before the station ever went on the
air, the original application. It was alleged that it did not record
the full intentions of the station, and therefore it was imperfect.
                                               346

  Senator, Judge Bazelon looked at that. He said the FCC has no
right to require in its license application the knowledge of what
kind of programing they are going to have. He said the station
could live.

  The CHAIRMAN. I recall when you lost your station I thought it
was unjust. I think you were really denied your first amendment
rights when that happened.

  Dr. MCINTIRE. Senator, David Bazelon made a beautiful opinion
in which he said that is what happened, but here we come to Judge
O'Connor. She sat here and there were two things she said, both of
which are in the general area which have afflicted us. Now she
would not give any specifics but the general statements she made
do apply to these practice incidents that we have suffered on.

  For instance, she said that in the Supreme Court's hearing of
constitutional questions, if there were other issues involved in the
case by which the case could be settled, they were handled and the
question of the Constitution was left not decided. Now she made a
statement to that effect. Well, that is exactly what happened in the
WXUR case.

  Bazelon said the first amendment was there. These two judges,
Wright and Tamm, said, "Well, there is this other question of the
application. There is fraud there. We will say that it should not be
continued." We went to the Supreme Court and, of course, they
would not even hear it.

  Our view, Senator, is that when you get to the first amendment
rights of religion, that is primary. The greatest liberty we have is
the liberty to serve God. The whole Constitution is designed to the
end that we will be able to be free to serve God. Our view is that
when cases come into the court procedures, they should have prece-
dence, and if there is a question of a first amendment right of a
religious minority coming before the Supreme Court, that should
take precedence over any lesser questions that are there. Our
religious rights must be first. They are not that at the present
time, and her statement places her in the Court on the same level
as we have been operating. Senator, we wanted a new beginning in
the Court, and we do not have it in this.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I am not too sure about that.
  Now, Dr. McIntire, you have cited in your prepared testimony
and here today you have cited several shocking examples of the use
of the taxing power to pressure and coerce churches and church-
sponsored schools. What action would you recommend that Con-
gress take in curbing governmental interference with the free exer-
cise of religion, and what action do you feel the Supreme Court
ought to take in insuring that litigants seeking protection of the
first amendment are not arbitrarily shut out?
  Dr. MCINTIRE. Well, Senator, the Supreme Court is our guardian.
The Supreme Court should make it very, very clear in these cases
that the tiniest religious minority will be heard. We cannot be
heard. We cannot get in the front door. We have never been able to
get in that Supreme Court. That is No. 1.
  The other aspect of this is, I feel that the Congress of the United
States, every man takes a vow to support the Constitution. They
should look into these matters and correct the possibility of such
abuse in the Federal Communications Commission, in the Internal
                                             347

Revenue, where they are going after religious schools right this
very minute. We have the Bob Jones case that is in the courts right
now.

  There are a good many cases and it is in that area, I believe, that
the Congress of the United States should protect these constitution-
al rights of the religious minorities. Senator, we are shut out
simply on the basis of money. It has cost us $200,000 thus far. Talk
about the poor--we just heard about it over here from the Senator
from Ohio, and he is right--but how about the little religious
minority? They are in the same category. They have no way, and it
is just that I have been able to get on my radio and raise this
money to pay these lawyers fees and to carry this case up, but we
are crushed.

  We are crushed, and if we did not have--now, this idea of Judge
O'Connor, I think is fallacious, I think it is erroneous. I think that
the Federal courts were established in order to protect our consti-
tutional rights. You get down on the State level, as we are in New
Jersey, we are a very liberal State. I have been in that State now
50 years; the pastorate I am in now, I have been there 48 years.
Senator, I have been in every controversial subject that has come
up in the State.

  The liberal element in the State sought to kill our college. They
actually did take away its license. We had to go to Florida. We
came back 2 years ago. We got up to the same trouble again and,
Senator, they told us when we went up to get our license in
Trenton that in order for us to give a degree they would have to
approve of our Bible courses. They would have to approve of our
Bible teacher. We said, well, that is the last.

  Then we fell back on our first amendment rights. We went ahead
and began to operate, and on November 15 or November 14 the
Attorney General's assistant called me and said, "Dr. Mclntire,
tomorrow we are going into the State court, and I am just giving
you a courtesy call."

  I said, "Oh, please don't do that. You are going to tie us up in all
kinds of--let us come and sit down. Let our attorney sit down. Let's
discuss this."

  "No, this is just a courtesy call." We went into the superior court
in Atlantic City the next day, they asked that our college be shut
down that day because we did not have a license, and our students
turned out on the street, and the semester was not over. The judge
accommodated them by saying, "You cannot advertise, you cannot
recruit, and on December 22 you close your college down while we
continue with the hearings."

  It took him a year before he got his decision. In the meantime we
did go, Senator, to the Federal court in Trenton, and the judge
looked at it and he said, "Well, here, they cannot close this college
down," and he gave an injunction against the State court permit-
ting us to continue to exist, but he heeded the O'Connor doctrine
and reserved to the State court the actual consideration of the
merits of the first amendment, the free exercise of religion.

  Senator, the State of New Jersey was so upset by the fact that an
injunction had been placed against this court closing the college
down that they appealed to the Third Circuit Court in Philadelphia
to ask the judges there to rule that the district Federal court

        87-101 O--81 23
                                     348

should not have issued that injunction. The third circuit court
ruled that the Federal district judge was within his discretion in
his injunction.

  The State did not like that so they took the third circuit court's
decision over to en bane. They got up there and they lost 8 to 2.
Now they have appealed and the appeal has now been filed with
the Supreme Court on the State's demand that the Federal court
should not even have interfered to the extent of issuing an injunc-
tion, and Judge O'Connor will be sitting there when this comes up
before it.

  Now, Senator, this is not all the story. The college, Shelton
College, then reappealed the Federal judge in the State, the district
court, reappealed his to the third circuit court on the ground that
he should have just handled the whole case and not involved this
back again in the State. When we got there, the third circuit court
said, "That is right. Your first amendment rights are involved. You
have a right to exist without a license."

  Senator, we went back then, and by this time the State court--
we are in a big fight between the State and Federal courts, has
been going on 2 years, and Judge O'Connor is right in the middle
of this thing with what she says in her article. The State court
then gave its decision in favor of the State board of education; our
college had an injunction against it to close us down, and we could
not operate.

  We then, Senator, went back and the Federal judge heard the
case and has issued an injunction against the State court, and now
we are on the way up through the State court, superior court, the
appeals court, to the Supreme Court, and we will come back
around some day to the Supreme Court. I do not know how many
years it will be, but in the meantime our little college sits here,
suffering.

  Senator, I do wish that we could have gotten this before the
entire committee and let them see. When I hear these men say
that if something special or extra would come up, Senator, Judge
O'Connor is going to be dealing with these things. She would not
give us any specifics but here are concrete illustrations of how the
thing she says she is for has worked in the State of New Jersey.
We want the Federal courts to be there where we can run to them
any time we want to go there, to protect the life of our college.

  I think that gives you--now we are in the midst of that right this
very minute, Senator, and it is costly. It has cost us students; it has
upset our college, and we are suffering.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, maybe you misconstrued her position some.
If she is confirmed, Dr. Mclntire, I think you will find she will be
very fair toward these Christian schools.

  I am glad to have you here. Thank you for coming and thank you
for your testimony.

  Dr. MCINTIRE. Thank you, Senator.

Statement by Carl Mclntire
September 9-11, 1981

                            To the Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate Requesting that
                                    the confirmation of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor be laid aside

Mr. Chairman and members of the United States Senate:
   My name is Carl Mclntire. I reside at 426 Collrngs Ave., Collingswood, N. J. I am pastor of the Bible

Presbyterian Church there. I appear in my capacity as the President of the International Council of Christian
Churches. This is an agency set up by Fundamental churches over the world. The ICCC has a membership of
334 Protestant denominations in 86 nations. One purpose, its constitution says, is: "to maintain and defend by
every proper means the rights of the member bodies and associated bodies against interference with their liberty
to fulfill their God-given calling."

    I am here to deal specifically with the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It declares:
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
abridging the freedom of speech . . ."

    Our Fundamental, Bible-believing churches and pastors m the U.S. have suffered incalculable loss at the
hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, which not only refuses to hear our cases but is responsible for abridging our
religious freedom. It has been the hope and prayer of many Christians that President Reagan would give us a
"new beginning" on the Supreme Court, too.

    Judge O'Connor has made her position in the William and Mary Law Review so clear that we cannot accept it
and her.

    (I request that her article in the Law Review be inserted in the record, if it has not already been done. Also
insert The Memorial to the President and Congress of the Arizona State Legislature, which she successfully in
the State Senate led in defeating. This Memorial called upon the president and Congress to give full First
Amendment rights to broadcasters in "programming.")

    Here are two areas where the Fundamentalists' constitutional rights of free exercise of religion have been
denied.

    What must be recognized is that there is a religious upheaval in the country. Churches and people are
separating from major denominations and leaving the National Council of Churches and the World Council of
 Churches. When this is done, the rights of these people are then denied by the courts and particularly the
 Supreme Court. This covers the whole range of religious activities, religious services, church properties, Bible
Conferences, FCC regulations, IRS legislation, Justice Department decisions, civil rights taking preference over
 religious nghts, mailing permits for religious papers, the granting of visas, chaplains in the Armed Services,
 recognition of accrediting agencies, the restriction of international congresses, and general bureaucratic
 harassment. There is hardly a realm of religious activity where these new and separated religious bodies are not
 suffering and being denied their "free exercise of religion" here in Washington, D.C. The Fundamentalists are in
 trouble down here.

    Judge O'Connor in her Law Review thesis goes into the question of the "friction between state and federal
 courts." She argues in favor of the state courts' handling constitutional questions, with the federal courts' being
 prohibited from intervening. She argues for the acceptance of the state courts'judgments and for the diversity
 of limitations of federal courts. This is not just a matter for Congress, but it is a power in the Supreme Court
 itself to restrict its lower federal courts with the further implementation of the Burger court doctrine of
 "abstention." She argues at great length. In fact her treatise reveals her to be a reformer for both state courts
 and the Supreme Court. She is an activist in this arena.

    I speak now from bitter, costly experience in case after case and constant court litigation for the past 16
 years.

    After my church broke away from the United Presbyterian Church because of its new Modernist doctrines
 and apostasy, we started a Bible Conference in Cape May, N. J., called the Christian Admiral. The City of Cape
 May refused to give tax exemption on this property. The state law provided for exemption under the free
 exercise of religion. The litigation consumed six years and cost more than the taxes would have cost. The
highest tax court of Jie state gave full tax exemption to the Bible Conference. When the appeal was taken up to
                                             350

the State Superior Court where the state political pressures abound, it was reversed. Finally when the case
reached the Supreme Court of the United States, it refused to look at it. And though the city gives tax
exemption to the Bingo Hall run by the Roman Catholic Church in the center of the city, our Bible conference
pays taxes on the hall where daily and Sunday religious services are conducted. There is now no appeal. Judge
O'Connor's views of state court decisions as being accepted, prevailed. This is the only Bible Conference in the
state that pays taxes. But we are the separated Presbyterians with a great deal of opposition.

    A second illustration: I am chancellor of Shelton College, a Fundamentalist liberal arts, Christian college
whose motto is "Training Christian Warriors." The State of New Jersey will not permit any school on the
college level to operate unless it is a part of its "system of higher education" under its planning and direction
with a license required to force this submission. When the college refused, the Attorney General of New Jersey
for the Department of Higher Education entered the State Superior Court in Atlantic City and demanded that it
be closed. The judge ordered the school closed down, December 22, 1979, pending his further hearing. The
college then went to the Federal District Court in Trenton to save its life under 42U.S.C. 1983, the civil n^its
statutes. The Federal District Court enjoined the lower court from closing the college but left to its litigation
the decision whether the college could give degrees and be under the state system of education. But the state,
not satisfied with this measure of victory, went immediately to the U.S. Third Circuit Court in Philadelphia
arguing the position of Judge O'Connor that the Federal Court should have abstained entirely. This would have
closed the college down, which the state was determined to do. But the Third Circuit said that the District
Court was within its discretion to act as it did.

    This developed into a major conflict between the Federal and State courts over the Burger-O'Connor
position. So determined is the State of New Jersey to maintain Judge O'Connor's view of noninterference and
limitation of federal jurisdiction under the "abstention doctrine" being developed by the Burger court that
when the Third Circuit Court refused to enjoin the District Court for enjoining the State Court, New Jersey
appealed to the full Circuit Court "en bane." It lost 8 to 2. Now it has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court
where Judge O'Connor may be sitting. If the Supreme Court accepts the case, then it will have one question
before it, the Judge O'Connor view, whether the federal court should intervene while the state court was hearing
a constitutional question and settling it

    Presently the litigation on the religious rights, their merits, is on appeal from the State Superior Court to the
 State Appeals Court. It must then go to the State Supreme Court and then to the Federal District Court and up
 the line to the Supreme Court. It has already taken nearly two years and five courts, and the cost is nearing
 $200,000. It is the O'Connor position that caused so much trouble and expense.

    The courts are fighting among themselves for power. It was only the Federal Court that saved even the
existence of the College.

    But small religious groups cannot survive this.
    Under no circumstances should Judge O'Connor, with the views she expounded concerning the federal
courts' deferring to the state courts and accepting state court decisions on constitutional matters, be free as a
member of the Supreme Court to help direct its course along this road in future years. Religious freedom is
fighting for its very life. How many times does religious freedom have to be aborted and destroyed before it
becomes a determining factor on who sits on the Supreme Court?
    What I am saying does not pertain or relate to what she said in the Law Review article about Congress's
limiting federal jurisdiction; though in this area of First Amendment rights, it could be perilous, since religious
rights are not in the general consciousness of the Congress or the courts today.
    All this pertains directly to the Supreme Court and its implementing the Burger doctrine of abstention.
   This led the federal district judge at Trenton, when he took the case under section 1983, to restrain himself
from taking the case. He only lifted the injunction which would have killed the college immediately. He saw and
said that the First Amendment nght of the college was involved and that by prior restraint, its life was at stake,
but he still referred the case, rather than handle it himself, back down to the state judge. After a year the state
judge ruled as the state desired, that the college had to be a part of the system of education directed by the
State Department of Higher Education and secure a license. The State Department of Higher Education
maintained that it had to approve the Bible courses and Bible teachers before Shelton could give any degrees as
a college.
                                          351

   Thus the state court issued its permament injunction against the college.
   The college, which also had appealed to the Third Circuit Court in Philadelphia against the State District
judge's not taking the case in hand and settling it, received a favorable decision from the Third Circuit Court,
declaring that the college was religious and was free to operate under the First Amendment without its licenses.
    The college then went back a second time to the Federal District Court in Trenton and secured a second
injunction against the New Jersey Superior Court, which enabled the college to make its appeal and operate
fully as a college, giving its degrees pending its appeal. This injunction does stand pending the lengthy litigation
that is still ahead, when at some future time the First Amendment issue will reach the Supreme Court, where
Judge O'Connor may be sitting. Without federal court intervention, which her position restrains, the political
powers of the State of New Jersey would have their way with a dead college because it was not licensed to their
satisfaction.
    What I am reporting here, Senator, is reality. A Fundamental Christian College is paralyzed and penalized
because of the Supreme Court Just the cost of litigation and the years now involved make it impossible for
these new religious groups, breaking away from the larger denominations which they believe are departing from
 the faith, to get started again. The Puritans and the Presbyterians could never have started Harvard or Princeton
with a Supreme Court like ours today.
    (May I ask that there be inserted in the record the letter I wrote the President, August 20, asking him to
withdraw his nomination^ on the basis of Judge O'Connor's views concerning the state court as it relates to our
 religious minority in which I give further details essential to the full picture.)

     Another area is the entire radio world. Eight thousand radio stations in this country have to be licensed by
 the FCC. Here again is a case where religious freedom and the freedom to preach the the Gospel have been
 destroyed, I say destroyed. Two celebrated cases are WXUR, a Pennsylvania religious station owned by Faith
 Theological Seminary, of which I am the president, and KAYE, owned by a Fundamentalist preacher operating
 in Puyallup, Washington, by the name of Jim Nicholls. Religious interests of the United Church of Christ,
 representing the National Council of Churches, were instrumental in having the FCC remove these stations from
 the air. The radio stations of this country have been intimidated, frightened, and the door has been opened for
 religious opponents, as in the case of the Greater Philadelphia Council of Churches' leading the fight to silence
 WXUR, making it impossible for stations to be free in their programming.

     Here, Senator, I tell you, that after eight years of litigation, the Supreme Court would not hear the case of
 WXUR. When it reached there, the question of First Amendment rights was the main issue. All that was left
 when the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit, finished was the question of the "programming"
 that had been listed on the original application before the station even broadcasted a word to the public. David
 Bazelon, the chief justice, said the FCC had no business under the First Amendment requiring the knowledge of
 programming in the application as a condition for the license. The other two judges dismissed that and
 maintained that the application was defective since it was alleged the station did not reveal the full intention of
 its programming and therefore was fraudulent. When the case went to the Supreme Court, it refused to hear it
 The station died July 5, 1973. Here is the quotation from Judge Ba^elon: "In this case I am faced with a prima
 facie violation of the First Amendment. The Federal Communications Commission has subjected Brandywine
 [WXUR] to the supreme penalty: it may no longer operate as a radio broadcast station. In silencing WXUR, the
 Commission has dealt a death blow to the licensee's freedoms of speech and press. Furthermore, it has denied
 the listening public access to the expression of many controversial views."

     The death of this station caused several hundred stations to drop Fundamentalist broadcasts that dealt with
 "issues," including my own, the 20th Century Reformation Hour, for fear of complaints and the owners'
 unwillingness to take the risk financially and the threat of losing the total investment in their station, as WXUR
 did. The Supreme Court is responsible for this, and the State of Arizona Memorial, which Judge O'Connor
 helped defeat, has only to do with freedom in "programming." May we face it There are political leaders who
 do not want freedom of speech on the radio, and we know that these ecumenical church leaders are determined
 to keep from the public any effective exposure of what they have done to Christianity, how they have been
 helping the Communist cause over the world, in various ways, and by their "liberation theology" and their
 Program to Combat Racism. The Supreme Court of the United States is responsible for the restriction of speech
 for the Fundamentalists. With Judge O'Connor sitting on that bench, the uncertainty which confronts us is
 intolerable.
                                        352

   (I request that my letter to the President of the United States, dated August 13, which gives great detail of
this point, be inserted into the record.

   I also mention another area where Judge O'Connor's decision could turn the whole course of religion in the
nation. She will be there long after most of us are dead. My congregation is one of the churches in this country
that lost its valuable property to which they alone held the deed. We left the United Presbyterian Church, as I
said, because of conscience; we could not have fellowship in a church where different gospels were being
preached. I helped found the Bible Presbyterian Church and led in the separation. On the "implied theory"
which the Supreme Court maintained, the property of our church was given to eight individuals out of 1200 to
the whole denomination. We had to leave and start up again in a tent Our religious faith and conscience
required that we separate. After these years, in September, 1979, the Supreme Court voted 5 to 4, in the case of
the Vineville Presbyterian Church of Macon, Georgia, that the implied trust view no longer governed, but the
reading of the deed determines the ownership.

    Several Episcopal churches in New Jersey have left the denomination over the question of faith, including
ordaining homosexuals. The Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey voted 4 to 3 for the implied trust view
against the deed view. This case is now awaiting acceptance by the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge O'Connor could
be sitting there. Other cases are now coming to the Court asking for a reversal of the 5 to 4 decision. With her
deep commitment to the state side, she could in such constitutional matters turn all this around again. Her one
vote could do it. Freedom should not take this chance. We are back again to these pressures to accept state
judgments as she has advocated in the William and Mary Law Review.

    At stake in all this is the whole future of Christianity and the churches in the United States. But this is not
the business of the U.S. Senate. All we want is a Supreme Court that will protect the free exercise of religion
"without respect" to technicalities, to size, or denomination or pressure or court jurisdictions which will and do
destroy it. O'Connor's view on the state courts is fatal to the Fundamentalists. Federal courts are absolutely
necessary to protect religious freedom at any stage when necessary to run to them. Up to the present the court
has been on the side of the "ecumenical" churches. It has ruled against the Fundamentalists who oppose the
ecumenical movement. Religious leaders despair and do not go to the court. They cannot, so they suffer loss.
The greatest suffering is loss of religious freedom.

    Senator, I cannot express the fmstration, the futility, the incredibility of having to fight for religious
freedom in the United States. Four Federal judges on the lower level have recognized that First Amendment
rights were there. Three of them in the Shelton College case and one in the WXUR case, David Bazelon. That
First Amendment rights are involved concerning Fundamentalists these judges have confirmed it.To add Judge
O'Connor to this court with its far-reaching implications and complications does involve religious freedom.

    Our founding fathers considered religion and the relationship of the people of the country to God their first
priority. This First Amendment reveals that one conviction. The state could not interfere with religion; no law
was possible. But we have a situation where the Supreme Court will not hear or will not give priority to religious
issues. This is more accute because of the breaks now occurring in churches, and separations are on the increase.
And courts are the final battlefield for religious freedom. These are the fresh and new struggles over the land.
The issues raised by New Jersey over Shelton College are indeed a first and will determine the future for
Fundamental Christian colleges in the 50 states and states' power and control over them. The protections in the
Constitution have been dormant and latent. Now with the religious conflict and the apostasy of the National
Council of Churches, they are of the most vital important to the future of the whole country. The
Fundamentalists must have their liberty to stand for their faith, to oppose evil, and to fight for the standards of
morality, in our national life which they believe are required by the Ten Commandments. These constitutional
questions alone are sufficient to lay aside the nomination of Judge O'Connor. I respectfully request that this be
done.

                                    SHIELD FOR NEWSMEN CLEARS PANEL

                                          (By Paul Schatt)
  The Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday approved a bill extending the state
newsmen's shield law to protect confidential notes, tapes and files, but rejected a
memorial urging congress to ban government interferences with broadcast news.
  The shield law amendment, which also retains a reporter's privilege to protect his
confidential sources after he leaves his news job, was approved unanimously after
the word "confidential" was added to limit the law's application.
  Sen. Sandra O'Connor, R-Paradise Valley. Senate majority leader, moved passage
of the bill after sponsoring the amendment to limit the protection to confidential
sources.
  Jonathan Marshall, publisher of the Scottsdale Daily Progress and legislative
committee chairman of the Arizona Newspapers Association, said he had no objec-
tion to the amendment.
  Marshall said the bill would close a loophole in the current shield law by provid-
ing protection for reporters after they leave the employer for whom they obtained
the information by including notes, tapes, photographs and other material of the
trade in the protection.
  The law currently provides that a newsman cannot be compelled to testify or
disclose in a legal or informal proceeding the source of information obtained for
publication or broadcast. But it does not protect his notes, tapes or files.
  Sen. Robert Strother, R-Phoenix, asked Marshall how he justified a reporter's
failure to report a crime he observes in the course of his job.
  Marshall replied that the bill does not apply in such cases, that a reporter would
have a citizen s duty to report a crime he witnessed. But, he added, this is different
from a situation in which a confidential source told a reporter of a crime.
   "Almost every major scandal during the past 20 years was revealed this way,"
Marshall told the committee, "because some little guy talked with a reporter in
confidence because he knew the reporter could protect his source. He would be
afraid to tell the police for fear of losing his job or being killed."
  The memorial on broadcast news freedom was severely criticized by Sens.
Strother and O'Connor.
   "I find, myself unhappily unable to suspect this because of its broad implications,"
Sen. O'Conner said.
   She objected to wording in the bill asking Congress to prohibit any governmental
agency from "dictating, influencing, or regulating in any way programming or
content" of news broadcasts.
   Strother, who said he found television news biased, contended that television
stations should have responsibilities of accuracy in return for their government
licenses to broadcast.
   Sens. O'Connor, Strother and Trudy Camping, R-Phoenix, opposed the bill, Sen.
William Swink, D-San Manuel, was the only "aye" vote, but acting chairman Sen.
John Roeder, R-Scottsdale, said he favored the bill. Sen. Charles Await D-Safford did
not vote.

   This is to certify that the attached copy of "House Concurrent Resolution 2003"
(two pages) and the copies of the "Minutes of Judiciary Committee" for April 9, 1973
and attached herewith were personally received by myself from the Secretary of the
Arizona State Senate. The attached copy of a newspaper article was obtained from
the main branch of the Phoenix Public Library and was copied from their files. It is
from the Arizona Republic dated April 10, 1973.

                                                                                                     Rev. JIM NICHOLLS.
    SEPTEMBER 14, 1981.

                                          [From the Christian Beacon, Oct 6, 1981]

   Mr. Nicholls brought back more than 50 pages of documentation. Concerning
Judge O'Connor's vote on the opposing of the Memorial to the President in Congress
on the First Amendment rights of broadcasters, Mr. Nicholls secured from the
Arizona Republic, April 10, 1973, an account written by correspondent Paul Schatt.
The Memorial passed the lower house, and when it went to the Senate, Judge
O'Connor's vote was decisive in killing and defeating it. Schatt reported the Memo-
rial was severely criticized by Senator O'Connor. Mr. Schatt states Senator O'Con-
                                             354

nor said, "I find myself unhappily to support it because of its broad implication."
She objected to wording in the bill asking Congress to prohibit any government
agency from "dictating, influencing or regulating in any way programming or
content of news broadcasts."

  The vote in the committee on House Congressional Memorial 2003 was 3 against
and 2 affirmative. One refrained from voting. It is reported that she led the
opposition to it and was 1 of the 3. Had she voted for it, it would have gone to the
full Senate for approval and begun its journey to Washington.

  Senator Mathias in the O'Connor Confirmation Hearing stated that the electronic
media was "The Press." This House Concurrent Resolution 2003 and attached
Senate Judiciary Minutes and the newspaper article indisputedly shows that Sena-
tor O'Connor did use her legislative office in an attempt to keep government control
on the programming and news content of the electronic media. In reality Senator
O'Connor voted to deprive the Broadcaster of First Amendment Rights to a free
press. Such action also deprived the public of their First Amendment guarantees,
the "right to know" under a free press.

            HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL 2003--STATE OF ARIZONA, HOUSE OF
          REPRESENTATIVES, THIRTY-FIRST LEGISLATURE, FIRST REGULAR SESSION

  A concurrent memorial relating to American broadcasting; urging congress to
enact legislation extending first amendment freedoms to the constitution to broad-
casting.

  To the Congress of the United States:
  Your memorialist respectfully represents:
  Whereas, the citizens' right to know requires the free and uninhibited flow of
information from the broadcasters as well as from the printed news media to the
public; and
  Whereas, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that
the Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;
and
  Whereas, American free broadcasting has become in its fifty-year history the
practical enlargement of a free American press; and
  Whereas, legislation now pending before the Congress would provide needed sta-
bility to the broadcasting industry in programming, and technological investment,
in turn creating added broadcast service to the citizens.
  Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of the State of Arizo-
na, the Senate concurring, prays:
  1. That the President and the Congress give their most earnest consideration to
the prompt enactment of legislation prohibiting government or any of its agencies
from dictating, influencing or regulating in any way programming or content of
news broadcasts on radio and television stations licensed to operate in the United
States.
  2. That the Honorable Wesley Bolin, Secretary of State of the State of Arizona,
transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the United States, the Presi-
dent of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of
the United States and to each member of the Arizona Congressional delegation.

                                         CONSIDERATION OF THE FOLLOWING BILLS

H.C.M. 2003--First Amendment--Freedoms to Broadcasting
  Mr. F. A. Higgins representing the Arizona Broadcasting Association spoke to the

Committee stating that there is legislation before the Congress that would extend
the licensing from 3 to 5 years. Senator O'Connor asked Mr. Higgins if this memori-
al would try to discourage Mr. Vice President Agnew from speaking out on vital
issues and that he is trying to have the broadcasting industry give a more objective
                                         355

viewpoint of the news. Mr. Higgins stated that Mr. Agnew or anyone else has a
perfect right to speak out against the press.

  Mr. Jonathan Marshall, editor of the Scottsdale Progress, stated that there is a
new executive agency headed by Mr. Whitehead who have instituted some tight
regulations on the broadcasting industry and they are using scare tactics on the
broadcasters.

  Senator Swink moved the bill with a DO PASS recommendation. The bill failed

SENATE BILL 1303--Reporter's Privileged Communication
  Mr. Jonathan Marshall stated that with the provisions in this bill a reporter

could not have a subpoena served against him if he were to leave the employ of a
media service. Senator O'Connor asked Mr. Marshall what would have happened in
the case of the Kennedy and Wallace shootings if the reporter did not wish to turn
over the films of these shootings to the authorities. After a brief discussion, Senator
O'Connor moved the bill and proposed amendments to the bill. The amendments
pass. The bill was moved with a DO PASS recommendation as amended and passed.

SENATE BILL 1267--Implied Consent--License Suspension
  This bill had been in subcommittee chaired by Senator Roeder. John Jones of the

Attorney General's Office spoke to the committee in regard for the need for the
implied consent legislation. Senator Roeder introduced amendments that had been
prepared in the subcommittee. Senator Roeder moved the bill with a DO PASS
recommendation as amended. His motion passed.

President RONALD REAGAN,

The White House,
Washington, D.C

   DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Your nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the
Supreme Court has projected afresh the question of broadcasters First Amendment
rights into the entire religious broadcasting world. The First Amendment guaran-
tees, or it should, the protection of all religious activity and the free speech of all
radio broadcasters. This Amendment reads, "Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech. . . ."

   No judge, who will take an oath to support the Constitution, should ever sit on
the Supreme Court of the United States who has not been in favor of, and who does
not have an unbroken record of full support of the rights of radio broadcasters in
the free exercise of religion, including their programming.

   This Judge O'Connor has been guilty of, tragically guilty, at a moment when the
whole question of broadcaster's rights to the full protection of their speech and
religious activity has been before the country. In presenting this judge for the high
bench, you have invaded an area of religious life and free speech in our country
which has caused untold controversy, suffering and loss, and even the right of the
people to know has been limited.

   I am enclosing a copy of a Memorial to the President and Congress of April, 1973.
This passed the lower house in Arizona and it was Judge O'Connor's leadership that
defeated it in the Arizona Senate. The committee to which it was referred for
approval and recommendation, voted 4 against it, 3 for it, and one abstained. She
led the opposition to this, and was one of the four. Had her vote been in the
affirmative, this resolution would have been approved. You will see it is actually
headed "House Concurrent Memorial 2003. A concurrent Memorial relating to
American broadcasting; urging Congress to enact legislation extending First Amend-
ment freedoms of the Constitution to broadcasting." Its request is: "1. That the
President and the Congress give their most earnest consideration to the prompt
                                                  356

enactment of legislation prohibiting government or any of its agencies from dictat-
ing, influencing or regulating in any way programming or content of news broad-
casts on radio and television stations licensed to operate in the United States."

  The controversy that stirred the radio world at that time was the decision of the
FCC to remove from the air radio station WXUR, owned by Faith Theological
Seminary, of which I am the president. There was not a radio station in this
country that was not aware of what was happening. My broadcast, the 20th Century
Reformation Hour, heard over 600 stations, was dropped by stations all over the
land. This controversy began in 1965 when area groups under the leadership of the
Greater Philadelphia Council of Churches, the New Jersey Council of Churches, a
part of the National Council of Churches, sought to have the station's license
denied. The battle went up through an examiner of the FCC, who gave the license
to the station declaring that the charges against it by the religious leaders and the
Broadcast Bureau itself could not be sustained.

  Mr. President, the House of Representatives of the State of Pennsylvania passed
Resolution 160, December 14, 1965. The House was controlled by the Deomcrats. The
Resolution referred specifically to the 1964 Goldwater campaign, saying that his
ideas had been repudiated by the country and specific references was made to my
ideas which they equated to Goldwater's, saying that they were dangerous to the
country.

  The FCC under Dean Burch, chairman appointed by Mr. Nixon, reversed their
examiner's decision on July 1, 1970. This was in the midst of all the conflict over
the Vietnam War, and I had led the first March for Victory on April 4, and we were
building for the second March on October 3, which Vice-President Ky had agreed to
address. At the height of all this, when I was using my stations over the nation
attacking Hanoi and exposing the yippies' and hippies' support of the Communist
cause to the division of our country, this move was made by Dean Burch, Robert
Lee, who wrote their decision, and Benjamin Hooks, who represented the NAACP
and who has been so active recently against your program.

  We then went to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington. This
court threw out the major claims or the opponents of the station and the FCC itself.
All that was left was the question of programming, that the station in its original
application did not fully reveal its program so that the FCC could determine
whether the station could be licensed or not. David Bazelon, the chief justice,
claimed that there was violation of the First Amendment in requiring these pro-
gram stipulations, and he declared that the station and the broadcasters had been
denied their First Amendment rights. He wrote a magnificent decision in support of
the First Amendment, specifically stating: "In this case I am faced with a Prima
facie violation of the First Amendment. The Federal Communications Commission
has subjected Brandywine to the supreme penalty: it may no longer operate as a
radio broadcast station. In silencing WXUR, the Commission has dealt a death blow
to the licensee's freedom of speech and press. Furthermore, it has denied the
listening public access to the expression of many controversial views."

  This was specifically over the FCC's requirement in its application of the knowl-
edge of the program of the station. The Arizona Memorial to the President and
Congress specifically identified the question of programming, with the request that
it be protected and kept free. O'Connor's opposition was against the exact issue and
almost the same language as the WXUIR case--the FCC had to approve program-
ming before a license could be renewed.

  The Supreme Court, Mr. President, refused to review the case and on July 5, 1973,
the station died. The whole radio world was shaken. Our defenders in the Senate
were Sam Ervin, who gave a 6,000-word speech, Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond.
They all declared that the First Amendment rights of the station were denied in
their speeches recorded in the Congressional Record. See Congressional Record,
November 14, 1973, for Ervin; March 12, 1974, for Thurmond; and February 21,
1974, for Helms.

  Letters immediately reached me from all over the country from radio stations
cancelling my broadcasts. In Washington, D.C., I was heard every morning at 8 a.m.
on WFAX, Falls Church, VA. The owner, Mr. Lamar Newcomb, immediately re-
moved my program, though he had supported my position. He said he could not
take the risk of losing his station or becoming involved in expensive litigation. The
WXUR litigation took 7 years.

  It was station WFAX that so many in high places in Washington listened to,
including the State Department and the Defense Department, and it was this one
station that L. Mendel Rivers, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
listened to.
                                                  357

  He personally contributed to the broadcast. He was the one who called me to
organize the marches for victory in the war in Vietnam. This I did with the help of
thousands in the country.

  I was broadcasting every day in Phoenix, Arizona, and other stations in the state.
It was out of this conflict in Arizona that I spoke in Phoenix a number of times, and
here there arose this very resolution from the state legislature. The Pennsylvania
legislature had taken its stand against the First Amendment rights. Arizona was
taking its stand for First Amendment rights for broadcasters.

  I can assure you that this issue was so acute in the State of Arizona that, at the
hands of the fundamental preachers, there were very few people who were unaware
of the issues involved. Judge O'Connor was in the State Senate at this time. This
was before she went into the court. There she was the leading opponent and fought
the enclosed Memorial to the President and the Congress of the United States that
the First Amendment rights be guaranteed to us broadcasters. This pertained
directly to religious broadcasters such as myself. With me was Mr. Jim Nicholls, of
KAYE of Puyallup, Washington. The same religious groups that led the fight
against me and the Faith Seminary station led the fight against him. He, too, lost
everything.

  It has been my custom to attend every meeting of the National Council of
Churches since the days when it was the Federal Council of Churches back in the
early 30's. The chief spokesman for the NCC in this whole area is and has been the
United Chruch of the Christ Office of Communications, Dr. Everett Parker in
charge. Dr. Parker has prepared the studies, distributed the literature throughout
the churches of the country concerning how they can have objectionable broadcasts
removed, intimidate stations, threatening them with even the loss of their license,
using the death of WXUR as their costly exhibit. Dr. Parker maintained a booth at
the Detroit meeting of the NCC and we were out there with a counter rally
opposing their Modernism and socialism. At their booth they were distributig their
literature and telling the people that this was the way they could have Dr. Mcln-
tire's broadcast removed from their local stations.

   Thus here comes Judge O'Connor, if confirmed to the Supreme Court, who also
lived through those tumultuous days of battling for First Amendment rights for
broadcasters. The denial of freedom became a routing matter and a formula was
devised by the FCC and its liberal companions to destroy speech and to inhibit the
free exercise of religion for the Fundamentalists. Congress cannnot make a law, but
it can make bureaus, and the bureaus' regulations have the force of law.

   The Supreme Court is the last bulwark of freedom in the protection of the First
Amendment rights of religious minorities. Mr. President, a minority can never
become a majority unless it can speak and promote its position. The condition of our
country as far as speech on the radio is concerned is that it is not possible to expose
the National Council of Churches for what it is doing in this area of socialism, its
aid to the Communists and its misrepresentation of Christianity.

   H. Gifford Irion, the original hearing examiner for the FCC, who after nine
months of hearings wrote a 116-page opinion, predicted what would happen. In
favoring the station, he said that WXUR-AM and WXUR-FM "performed what
would normally be considered a wholesome service in providing an outlet for con-
trasting viewpoints on a wide variety of subjects. To impose the fell judgment of
removing WXUR from the air . . . could only have the consequence of admonishing
broadcasters everywhere that they would act at their peril in allowing robust
discussing because penalties would be meted out in rigid compliance with the
exactions of the rules."

   For eight years the station has been preserved with its four towers lighted. We
have been praying and believing that this great injustice to speech and to a reli-
gious minority would be reversed and the station returned to the air. Sam Ervin
said outside political pressures did it. The prayers of thousands is that some day
God will bring to life, perhaps on the Nixon tapes, what these pressures were from
the highest level of government. God knows it all. God is also a protector of liberty
for His people.

   This generation of fear did exactly that to my broadcast, and others dared not
enter this field to enlighten the American people. As the prophet Hosea said, "My
people are destroyed for lack of knowledge."

   Men like myself who have come up out of the Christian churches and have a duty
before God to preach what the Bible says and expose what we believe is evil, not
only in the country but in the churches, find it cannot be done. I am here in
Collingswood, New Jersey, and I have been pastor of this one church for 48 years.
My record is clean. I am of the opinion that this country cannot be saved unless we
are free to expose what we believe are forces inimical and destructive not only to
Christianity but to liberty.
                                         358

  You are placing a judge on the Supreme Court who opposed a beautiful, clean
resolution. You, yourself, could not have written a better one. None can mistake the
"Whereases" that are here.

  The fight for freedom of speech and free exercise of religion on radio is still the
major battle under the Constitution today, and you are having placed on the
Supreme Court a judge who in this particular field has made clear where she stands
and the FCC still has a canopy of control over programming today. With these views
the FCC will have a judge on the court to their liking, and so will Dr. Everett C.
Parker and the National Council of Churches.

  Mr. President, you have come up the hard and difficult road to see this nation
turned about, but to place on of the nine judges on the court, in a day when the
court itself is ideologically divided as you yourself recognize, who did not support
the First Amendment rights of broadcasters in this nation, requires that we request
that you withdraw this nomination. I am confident that you are unaware of this
question concerning her attitude which has come to light as a result of the special
investigation Mr. Nicholls made in Phoenix, Arizona.

  If we had had our First Amendment rights, free exercise or religion, and could
have used it to warn and instruct this country by radio and television, the country
could have been turned about a number of years back. The failure to have this
freedom has contributed to the havoc that the liberals have wrought in our national
life in the economic sphere, the military sphere, and in the whole realm of our
spiritual and moral standards and necessities.

  This fight for our First Amendment rights has taken a terrific toll. The tragedy is
that men in political life, too few to them, are willing to get up and fight for the
rights of a religious minority and even for those with whom they differ but whose
rights are the same as theirs under that blessed Constitution.

  I cannot believe that you yourself are unaware of this major battle for free speech
and religious liberty that has been raging in this country over radio programming
since the early 60's, but I am confident that you were unaware of her opposition and
her part in defeating this Memorial calling for the First Amendment rights of
broadcasters. It was headed, "House Concurrent Memorial 2003." It is interesting
that the Congressional Record, July 31, contains the statement by Senator Barry
Goldwater, introducing "House Concurrent Memorial 2001 to the President and
Senate of the United States of America. Your memorialist respectfully re represents
. . ." this Memorial, which was adopted, commends Judge O'Connor. The one deal-
ing with First Amendment rights was never fully approved. The Senator maintains
that since 2001 was adopted in the Arizona House on July 23, with 51 ayes: only 2
nays and on July 24; in the Senate, there were 29 ayes and 1 nay, that here is an
indication "that the single-issue opposition to Mrs. O'Connor's nomination has virtu-
ally disappeared."

  The "single-issue" refers to the abortion issue. Aside from the fact that this has
not disappeared in the country, the issue that I am raising here is new, is real, and
indeed is of such weighty importance that as a single issue alone it should disqualify
her from a lifetime position on the Supreme Court of the United States.

  Now you, Mr. President, in your inauguration January 20, took the oath of office
required by the Constitution to maintain and defend it. Here comes the question of
the opposition of Judge O'Connor to the full First Amendment rights of broadcast-
ers, and you are in the position of not knowing that she let the battle against a
resolution calling for full First Amendment rights for all broadcasters. This is not
right. Surely I am bringing to your attention a situation that calls for action before
the conscience of the entire nation.

  Last Saturday Senator Strom Thurmond, who has spoken for us over the years at
our Bible Conference in Cape May, N.J., addressed around 500 people. In the
question-and-answer period, has was asked concerning Judge O'Connor s confirma-
tion. He announced that they would begin on September 9 and said that there were
20 men on his committee and that she would be confronted with every conceivable
relative question. He told the congregation that he would presonally see that Dr.
Mclntire would have the opportunity to appear before the committee. I had previ-
ously filed my request to be there as a representative of the International Council of
Christian Churches. I will, of course, raise this very question and expect to make it
known to the Senate.

  I poured out my life over a period of 16 years fighting for our religious liberty on
the radio as a broadcaster. At the time of the death of station WXUR I went out on
the Atlantic Ocean, beyond our territorial limits, opposite our Bible Conference in
Cape May, and erected a 10,000 watt transmitter on a ship on a wave length not
used by American stations and broadcast from Maine to North Carolina. I called the
station Radio Free America on the ship "Columbia." The story made the front pages
of papers all over this country. We wanted the world to know that the most precious
                                         359

rights a human being has were being denied by the FCC and the Supreme Court.
We made the mistake of not securing a ship under foreign registry. We obtained a
former mine sweeper from Florida and brought it up the east coast. Because of its
U.S. registry, the FCC took us to the federal court in Camden, N.J., and had the
judge issue an injunction against me.

  This country cannot survive without free speech, and we. are losing the battle
today because men like myself cannot talk as we believe God wants us to speak as
His chosen servants to preach the whole counsel of God as found in the Holy Bible.

   Speeches made by the prophets Jeremiah, Amos, Isaiah, Hosea, and even our
blessed Lord would have brought them before the FCC of Jerusalem and the license
of their radio broadcasts would have been denied.

   I was in addition to this issue also hoping that in the appointments that you
make, especially in the FCC, that these matters could be taken into consideration, I
am certain now that they were not, since we have received a present pronounce-
ment of the Federal Communications Commission on WXUR.

   I propose to write you another letter dealing with the FCC setup. Mr. President,
we have to have the Constitution honored by the United States Government, by
every official, every representative, every agency, including the FCC. The Constitu-
tion is the supreme law of this land. It is the greatest possession of the American
people, and the most important part of its is the First Amendment. The most
important of that has to do with religion and with speech which is outside the
domain of government, the executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches.

   It is in this area that Judge O'Connor's actions in dealing with the Memorial from
Arizona invaded and transgressed. Again I request that by God's grace you may
withdraw her nomination.

   You have our earnest prayers.
        Very truly yours,

                                                                                                  CARL MCINTIRE,

                                  President, International Council of Christian Churches.

                                             INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF CHRISTIAN CHURCHES,

                                                           Collingswood, N.J., August 19, 1981.

President RONALD REAGAN,

The White House,
Washington, D.C.

   MY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: I wrote you August 11 concerning the free exercise of
religion, protected in the Constitution, against which Congress is in no way to
legislate or prohibit according to the First Amendment. The instance which I
presented was Judge O'Connor's opposition which led to the defeat of a memorial
from the State of Arizona to the President and the Congress in April of 1973. It
called for action by both parties to restore full First Amendment rights to broad-
casters.

   I now come with another major issue concerning First Amendment rights of a
religious minority of which I am definitely a part. It has to do with current
litigation initiated by the State of New Jersey in a state chancery court against
Shelton College, Cape May, N.J., of which I am chancellor and which is an agency
of the denomination of which I am a part, the Bible Presbyterian Church. That
First Amendment rights are involved, the courts we have been in all concede. These
are the New Jersey Superior Court, the United States District Court [District of
New Jersey], the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals and then back again
to the U.S. District Court.

   The state court maintains that the state has an overriding interest because of the
degree Shelton gives, and had ordered the College closed December 22, 1979.

   The State of New Jersey, through its Department of Higher Education, under
instruction from its Governor to its Attorney General on one day's notice, entered a
chancery court in Atlantic City on November 15, 1979, and asked that a temporary
injunction be granted to close the College down that day without even a hearing.
The court actually enjoined the College that day from advertising and recruiting
and said it had to close December 22. This judge then did not issue his final decision
until November, 1980, a whole year minus three days.

   The only thing that saved the College and allowed it to exist, was the intervention
of the U.S. District Court in Trenton under Civil Rights Act, section 1983.

   I give you this brief statement because Judge O Connor's opinion in this area is
well defined and there can be no question about the position she will hold on the
Supreme Court in the years to come. Her William and Mary Law Review article has
been widely heralded in the press as a basis for claiming that she "understands
                                                  360

state problems." In her conclusion she said, "We should allow the state courts to
rule first on the constitutionality of state statutes." She called for "elimination or
restriction of federal court diversity jurisdiction, and a requirement of exhaustion of
state remedies as a prerequisite to bringing federal action under section 1983." She
is actually a champion of this new setup which she said would be "a step in the
right direction to defer to the state courts and give finality to their judgments on
federal constitutional questions. . ."

  Under these circumstances our Shelton College would now be dead. The state
wanted it closed even during the hearing. The judge under state appointment,
nominated by the Attorney General, accommodated him.

  If we had not had access to the Federal Court, there would be no Bible Presbyteri-
an college in New Jersey today.

  The State Superior Court, that ordered the College closed, actually found in its
opinion that "the conduct and beliefs of the Shelton student and the theological
doctrines which form the content of the academic program are at total variance
from secular and most church-sponsored colleges and universities." Judge Philip
Gruccio in the same statement said, "Every academic subject is taught from a
perspective of the religious point of view of the fundamentalist denominations,
whether it be history, art, economics, chemistry or English literature."

  In spite of these findings, he closed the school down because it did not have a
license from the state and refused to be a part of the "system" of higher education.

  It is being argued that Judge O'Connor's position, which calls for the acceptance
of the judgment of the state court, would eliminate extensive litigation in criminal
cases where constitutional rights are alleged to be involved.

  But where do the First Amendment rights come in, the free exercise of religion of
a Fundamentalist Christian college, which is accredited and which is preparing
leaders and "Christian Warriors," as the motto says, for our churches?

  The State of New Jersey, that is the Attorney General, the Department of Higher
Education under the Governor's direction, took the College to the U.S. Third Circuit
Court of Appeals in Philadelphia. Here the issue was that the Federal District Court
in Trenton had no right to interfere in the state's litigation while it was in process.
They called it "abstention." A jurisdictional battle developed, with a state court
including in its opinion a major defense of its authority, credibility and capability.
The Federal court, exercising its discretion, which it believed it had, stepped in to
save the life of the College, deferring to the state court whether the College could
give its degree for the credits that the College was providing for its students while it
continued to exist. The Federal District Court actually retained the jurisdiction
pending the final outcome as a cover to protect the College after it gets through
with the litigation that is now in the State Appeals Court and has to go to the State
Supreme Court. Mr. President, here are five courts, and here sits our little college
with irreparable and unimaginable suffering and damage to our religious cause and
rights.

  Now the state's Attorney General is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court with
their papers to be filed by September 2, asking the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that
the Third Circuit Court was in error in sustaining the Federal District Court in
using its discretion to lift the injunction of the state court and permitting the
College to exist.

  If Judge O'Connor is confirmed, she will be sitting on this court to decide the
question brought before it, and this is only the question of jurisdiction, and her
views on this very point are spelled out in the William and Mary Law Review
article.

  The Third Circuit Court, however, in ruling on the question of the District Court's
discretion, did go in on the merits of the case of the free exercise of religion. Here a
beautiful statement is made concerning the right of the College to exist and carry
on its work without the control by the process of licensing and without being
regulated as a part of the state system of education.

  So here we sit today, the first case of its kind in the history of the United States.
In the State of New Jersey today, no course in an institution, college or university
level, can be taught--no single course--neither can a teacher teach that course
without his or her qualifications being approved by the State Board of Higher
Education.

  The thing that really brought this to a head, when the College was trying to work
out the state's terms of licensing, was when the state declared that even the Bible
courses taught in the College would have to be approved by the state before the
credit could be used for a degree. Even the Bible teachers who taught in the College
would have to have their qualifications approved by the state before they would be
permitted to teach.
                                             361

  This was the breaking point, and we decided as a college that we would throw
ourselves back on our constitutional rights. So here we are, almost two years have
passed and we are only one court above the State Superor Court. We are now in the
Court of Appeals.

  If the U.S. Supreme Court accepts the Attorney General's appeals on the jurisdic-
tion matter, we will soon be in the U.S. Supreme Court, too, with a little college
paying all the legal expenses for a major jurisdictional fight between the Federal
Court and the State Court, with Judge O'Connor already on record in favor oi
deferring to the State Court and prohibiting any Federal intervention, under section
1983 of the Civil Rights Act, until all the state's processes have been completed.

  We have always believed that the Federal court system was set up to protect the
free exercise of religion of any religious group or minority from any interference by
the state legislative requirement or attack from federal legislation, and now I must
add the regulations of the bureaus.

  To think of Judge O'Connor sitting on that court, first, in hearing the question of
jurisdiction and, second, in hearing the question of the right of the College to exist
in the state without the license, when she is so clearly on the side of the state
jurisdiction and power is to us a grave danger.

   Should not our religious rights, First Amendment rights, take precedence over all
other considerations? The framers of the Constitution thought so when they framed
the First Amendment with these words placed first, "Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
abridging the freedom of speech. . . ." There is nothing more important than our
religious freedom. It has now been denied us by the State Superior Court. The state
is of the opinion that if they can destroy the Federal Court's judgment on the
technicality of jurisdiction, the College will then be dead, pending the further
litigation on the state level.

   Mr. President, you have been a governor and you know the power of a governor
and his appointments.

   I have spent my entire life as a preacher in this state--two and one-half years in
Atlantic City and 48 years in Collingswood. I have been most outspoken as a
Fundamentalist. I have opposed about everything that has come down the road; the
race track, bingo, the Atlantic City casino, sex education, abortion on demand,
taking prayer and Bible reading from the schools. I have been active in the religious
field exposing the liberals, and the ecumenists. We are a part of a religious move-
ment that calls upon God's people not to support the things that deny the Gospel
and cast doubt upon our blessed Saviour, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His death,
His resurrection, His ascension and His coming again. We have been exceedingly
vocal, for the Bible says, "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and
shew my people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins" (Isa. 58:1).

   To do this is costly, but the liberty to do so is priceless. Everywhere we have
turned we have met opposition from the political forces that have power. We opened
a Bible Conference in Cape May. After four years of litigation, the state's highest
tax court said that we were entitled to tax exemption on our Bible Conference
property, but these government officials went into the state courts and had it
reversed. When we knocked on the door of the Supreme Court, they would not look
at it. We are the only Bible Conference in the State of New Jersey that has to pay
taxes. The tax court said No, but the state courts said Yes. We no longer have any
appeal except to God.

   Now we are going up the same route with our Christian college. Mr. President, we
have to have a college. Our churches are entitled to have a college. We cannot build
our churches, our doctrine, our position in the religious world without a college.

   Does not one small college count anymore when it comes to liberty?
   On July 4, 1962, President Kennedy stood before Independence Hall and made his
address on Interdependence which contravened our Declaration of Independence
and specifically called for the surrender of some of our sovereignty. There was a
great outcry against this at that time.
   His retreat at the Bay of Pigs was also a national issue. I was among those who
believe that once putting the hand to the plow, we should have dealt with Castro
and liberated Cuba. All the mischief that he has caused was because of the nature
of Communism, we were certain. If Kennedy had gone ahead, he would have
enabled us to honor the Monroe Doctrine.
   As far as I was concerned, we were dealing with these matters on our radio.
President Kennedy was to speak to the National Council of Churches in Philadel-
phia. His views were in line with theirs and he was to give them great prestige and
coverage. We opposed it. I arranged for a large counter rally at the same time in
which General Edwin A. Walker had agreed to speak on the issues of our standing
up to the Communists. He was against detente and so were we.
                                                  362

  Just five days before this, Kennedy was assassinated.
  It was out of this that Ralph Dungan came forth. The Governor of our state,
Richard J. Hughes, was tied in very closely with the Kennedys. He brought Dungan
to New Jersey, a man not qualified to be the head of the Department of Higher
Education. It was political pure and simple, and then Dungan went after our
College to stop the training of Christian warriors.
  Hughes was then appointed to be Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court
and that tells a story. We have lost every time we went up there.
  This drive of the state to take Shelton College to the Supreme Court of the United
States on this "abstention" issue against the Federal Court has gone to the very
limit. The Third Circuit, I said, refused to nullify the action of the Federal District
Court in lifting the injunction. The state then appealed to the Third Circuit en bane
for a review of its own decision. It lost 8 to 2. It is from this that they are appealing
to the Supreme Court where Judge O'Connor may be sitting.
  Mr. President, the State of New Jersey is desperate in its determination to keep
this power in its hand through their court. We are dealing with the ideological
conflict that has divided our country and which you yourself have declared to be on
the side of a new beginning, returning us to the basic concepts of freedom.
  I tell you that men are interested in power, courts are the last arena for the
exercise of that power in their final victories.
  This is why we are so careful and so insistent in regard to Judge O'Connor's
confirmation. Do not let the courts be taken away from us. We have a generation
that has risen up, baptized in this halo of liberalism. Just look at the decison of
Judge Gruccio and see how he had to crucify the Constitution in order to confer the
crown of victory to the state's liberals. He did it and a small religious minority is
the victim.
  This matter is going to cost us at least a half million dollars before we are
through, if we can save the College. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for
new religious minorities, coming out of the separations and conflicts in the church
world, to get started with their schools. We cannot do what our Pilgrim Fathers did,
have a new beginning when they came to this new world. We are ready to die for
this new beginning and liberty. Please look at these matters. This condition has
been developing and evolving over these years, where the liberals have been in
ascendancy.
  Our trouble started when Dr. Ralph Dungan became head of the newly formed
Department of Higher Education in New Jersey. He had been John F. Kennedy's
aide in the White House, who was there the day he was assassinated. Johnson sent
Dungan to Chile as an ambassador. There he supported Allende. The Chileans
called him the "pinko ambassador." We have Fundamental churches in Chile:
Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, Christian and Missionary Alliance and independ-
ent, which belong to the International Council of Christian Churches, of which I am
the president. Dungan got to know these churches and what they stood for. They
opposed Allende's Marxism.
  Dungan had only been in New Jersey a few months before he launched his attack
against Shelton College. It had held a state license and had carried on its work.
Dungan initiated hearings and when he was through, he had the College's license
revoked in 1971. It fled to Florida. When it returned in 1979, it ran into the same
opposition again.
  What I am trying to tell you is that in these state levels, there is room for
pressures, mischief, the designs of men to get at an institution and individuals that
they do not like or they fear. To leave the state courts in the position of independen-
cy free from any protective interference by the Federal courts is intolerable. We do
not see that Judge O'Connor should be on that court with these questions and
doubts. The constitutional rights which we have from God are too precious to take
any risk.
  She made her case in that Law Review article from William and Mary College in
Virginia.
  I have not mentioned anything yet to you about the financial impossibility. The
State of New Jersey was able by its attack upon the College to initiate litigation
where its side of it is paid out of the state treasury but our side of it has to come
from the churches and individual Fundamental believers who see that the issues are
religious liberty. Harvard, Yale, Princeton, the Ivy League, were all started in the
same way, and for the same purpose that Shelton College was started--by religious
leaders, to provide education for the leaders of the colonies' churches.
  Our country was a haven for the Pilgrims, Puritans, for those who fled religious
oppression from the old world the Anglicans, the Lutherans with their state
churches, and those who fled from the Roman Catholic hierarchy of France and
                                         363

other European states. William Penn came to Pennsylvania because he wanted the
kind of religious freedom that Shelton College is fighting for today.

  Have we become so insensible, so numbed, so blinded, and so intolerant, that a
tiny religious college cannot exist in a state where the state officials are determined
to close it down unless they direct it as a part of the system of education that the
state legislature has given them total control over?

  Our sufferings are real. Our losses are irreparable. But, Mr. President, our faith
in that Constitution is our one hope for free America. Unless we can preserve that,
our nation will be gone.

  There are fifty states, and if in only one of these states, the State of New Jersey,
the constitutional rights of a religious minority are denied, that is sufficient to keep
a questionable judge from the Supreme Court, where her decisions will affect all
fifty states. I plead with you, please withdraw the nomination. She has written only
fifty opinions in the appeal court in Arizona. Give us a judge who will support the
Federal system and protect us all from any repetition of what has happened in the
State of New Jersey. Please let us end this jurisdictional fight between the state
courts and the Federal courts which Shelton College is having to pay for, to the
tragic loss of building our churches. How large does a religious denomination have
to be or a college enrollment before it can have the protection of the entire country
in support of its liberty? I do not believe that this should be ignored.

   Please withdraw the nomination and find another judge who favors the Federal
judication of religious constitutional rights.

   The struggle of our people to keep this country from going socialist or surrender-
ing to the Communists is not only over the presidency and seats in Congress but
over the Supreme Court, where the judges there by judicial interpretation may
change the country and even the Constitution. O'Connor's appointment could not
possibly be more important to the liberty of Fundamental Christians and churches.

   We have not been able to get our story into the press. This Sunday the Atlantic
City press did carry a story. You will be interested in reading it.

   You have our prayers as the chief magistrate of this land. We are commanded by
God to pray for you in all your responsibilities as His servant as the Bible says, "to
us for good." You are indeed a minister of God to us for good. You are there for the
punishment of evildoers.

        Very truly yours,

                                                                                                          CARL MCINTIRE.

   The CHAIRMAN. Our next witness is Ms. Arnette R. Hubbard,
National Bar Association.

   Are you the president of the National Bar Association?
   Ms. HUBBARD. I am, Senator.
   The CHAIRMAN. Hold up your hand.
   Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

   Ms. HUBBARD. I do.

   The CHAIRMAN. YOU may proceed.

 TESTIMONY OF ARNETTE R. HUBBARD, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL

                               BAR ASSOCIATION

   Ms. HUBBARD. Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, I am Arnette Hubbard, a practicing
lawyer from Chicago, 111. I am pleased to participate in your hear-
ing today on behalf of the National Bar Association, now entering
its 57th year.

   As the 30th president of the oldest and largest association of
black lawyers in this country, and as the first female attorney ever
to hold this office, I have particular pride and honor in making this
appearance to testify in support of the first woman nominated to
serve on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. At
the same time I am also humbled and distressed by the fact that no

      87-101 O--81 24
                                             364

other major bar association has ever had a woman to serve as its
president.

  As you may recall, representatives of the National Bar Associ-
ation have appeared before this committee on many occasions to
address the issues of competence and commitment to equal justice
of candidates nominated to serve on the courts of this country.
Needless to say, the National Bar Association has acute interest in
the appointment of any nominee to the Supreme Court of the
United States of America.

  The history of blacks in the legal profession has, in some re-
spects, loosely paralleled the involvement of white women in the
profession. Just a century ago blacks, newly freed from legal slav-
ery in this country, looked to the law as a protection and a tool to
effectuate their newly established rights. Negative case law, prac-
tice, and State legislative action limited the use of the law in
initially securing equal rights, equal protection, equal opportunity,
as well as equal obligations.

  It is noteworthy and paradoxical at the same time Congress and
the Nation added constitutional amendments to clarify the citizen-
ship of former slaves and formalize their freedom, at that moment
women sought unsuccessfully to convince the courts that they
should be permitted to practice law.

  Fortunately, blacks and women, often represented by and repre-
senting the finest in the legal profession, have moved forward from
the negative case law and practices of a century ago. A black now
serves with distinction on the highest court of the land, and he and
his colleagues will be joined by a woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, if
confirmed.

  Judge O'Connor's nomination and her anticipated confirmation
mark an historic development in the history of the Court and in
the long chronicle of minority and women's rights. Judge O'Connor
will be the 102d Justice to be appointed and the first woman to
serve on the Supreme Court in its 191-year history.

  The National Bar Association has reviewed Judge O'Connor's
background and qualifications. We have acquainted ourselves with
her career as a lawyer, legislator, prosecutor, and judge. Our crite-
ria for assessing this candidate for the Supreme Court of the
United States of America have mirrored criteria used to determine
whether we supported or challenged persons nominated and consid-
ered for the U.S. courts of appeal and district courts.

  We have reviewed as well Judge O'Connor's 29 appellate court
decisions and her law review article in the William & Mary Law
Review to gain additional insight into her future performance as a
Justice of the Court. While we have found that much is notewor-
thy, we have been unable to ascertain Judge O'Connor's position on
several thorny constitutional issues which we deem of crucial im-
portance. We are not entirely troubled, however, by what appears
to be an absence of a clear pattern that would help to predict her
position on these questions, given our belief in the inherent wisdom
of a process which elevates standards of judicial competence and
integrity above those of personal ideology.

  The National Bar Association believes that Justice O'Connor has
demonstrated--excuse me, Judge O'Connor, I anticipate the ap-
pointment--has demonstrated those qualities needed in all judges:
                                                   365

that is, competence and professionalism, integrity, judicial tem-
perament, and commitment to equal justice under law. Her record
suggests that she will be a welcome addition to the Court.

  Although the National Bar Association supports Judge O'Con-
nor's nomination, we would be nonetheless remiss not to remind
her of specific concerns of our constituency which we deem to be of
the greatest priority. These concerns include not only and are not
limited to the following: continued access to the Federal courts on
behalf of the poor and politically unpopular groups; invidious at-
tempts at gerrymandering political voting district, which have the
effect of diluting minority representation in both State and Federal
legislatures; lastly, continued concern for the protection of minor-
ity interests through a fair and aggressive interpretation of the
13th and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

  Judge O'Connor's sensitivity to the full range of interests to be
protected in her role as Justice is vital. The National Bar Associ-
ation supports her elevation to the position of Justice of the U.S.
Supreme Court of America.

   We look forward to appearances before this committee as you
consider other nominees for judicial appointments. It is, of course,
our expectation that these nominees will include blacks and other
ethnic minorities and women.

   Today we join many of our colleagues in the law in saluting the
choice of Justice O'Connor--Judge O'Connor--and wishing her
well. There have been questions about the significance of Judge
O'Connor being a woman. We think she is not only a qualified
person but she is needed, sir.

   Decades ago, a burning question was, if the ability of a person is
the only criterion, why are the Supreme Court Justices all white
males? Mr. Justice Thurgood Marshall's appointment in 1965, 175
years since the creation of the Supreme Court, changed the ques-
tion to, Why is it all male? The appointment of Judge O'Connor
will eliminate the question entirely and permit us to address more
deserving issues.

   To the 40 percent of heads of households in this country who are
women, to the approximately 50 percent of children born in Amer-
ica who are female, Judge O'Connor's appointment will say, yes,
justice in America is for all Americans; yes, in America we believe
you should be limited only by ability and determination. We then
urge this committee to act expeditiously in bringing the nomina-
tion of Judge O'Connor to the Senate, and to support her confirma-
tion.

   The CHAIRMAN. MS. Hubbard, I believe you are not only presi-
dent of the National Bar Association but you are a member of the
American Bar Association.

   Ms. HUBBARD. That is correct, sir.
   The CHAIRMAN. YOU are also a member of the Illinois State Bar
Association

    Ms. HUBBARD. Yes.

   The CHAIRMAN [continuing]. And the first female president of the
Cook County Bar Association.

   Ms. HUBBARD. That is right, Mr. Chairman.
   The CHAIRMAN. YOU are a member of the Chicago Bar Associ-
ation and the California Association of Black Lawyers.
                                                   366

  Ms. HUBBARD. That is true.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have a rather impressive record. I just want
to congratulate you. We thank you for your presence and your
testimony.
  Ms. HUBBARD. I appreciate that, and thank you for the opportu-
nity to appear.
  Dr. MCINTIRE. Senator, I understand that my printed text will be
included in the record, as well as what I said.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, Dr. McIntire, we will include
your statement in the record.
  Dr. MCINTIRE. I wanted to make sure but I also ask that the
resolution from Arizona that we talked about--and I have that
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, we will put that in the record,
if you will just hand it to the reporter there.
  Dr. MCINTIRE. I have the two letters that I wrote to the Presi-
dent on this. They are not too long. I would like to have them in,
too.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, we will put those in.
  Dr. MCINTIRE. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Our next witness is the Honorable Dick C. P.
Lantz, judge, 11th Judicial Circuit of Florida and president-elect,
American Judges Association. If you will come around, Judge
Lantz, hold up your hand and be sworn.
  Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?
  Judge LANTZ. I do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Have a seat, Judge Lantz, and you may proceed.
You understand how these lights work--when it gets red, your
time is up.
  Judge LANTZ. I have been here all day and I have been watching
very admirably, and I think I understand the rules.
  The CHAIRMAN. Our time is running short.

TESTIMONY OF HON. DICK C. P. LANTZ, JUDGE, 11TH JUDICIAL
  CIRCUIT, AND PRESIDENT-ELECT, AMERICAN JUDGES ASSO-
  CIATION

  Judge LANTZ. Mr. Chairman, honorable members of the Commit-
tee on the Judiciary, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Judge Dick
Lantz of the Circuit Court of Dade County, Miami, Fla., 11th Judi-
cial Circuit. I have served as a municipal judge, county judge, and
circuit court judge since 1972.

  I have the honor of being the president-elect of the American
Judges Association, and will be installed as president on October
29, 1981 at the annual convention which will be held in Washing-
ton, D.C. The American Judges Association consists approximately
of 2,000 judges who presently sit at all levels of the judiciary. They
include members of the Federal bench, State supreme and appel-
late courts, municipal, county, and circuit court judges throughout
the United States and Canada.

  One of the paramount objectives of the American Judges Associ-
ation is to strive for the improvement of the quality of members of
the bench, as well as the conditions of the office, including tenure,
retirement, workload, emoluments, and physical facilities. Further,
                                             367

the association seeks to educate its members in modern approaches
to jurisprudence, and in innovative programs we attempt to instill
respect for the law in the public at large and in students and youth
in particular.

  Our association has over a dozen working committees. One of
these national committees is the selection, retention, and retire-
ment committee. This committee has been involved in the develop-
ment of judicial qualifications and selection guidelines. However,
this is the first time it has involved itself in a Supreme Court
confirmation hearing.

  By correspondence and conference, this committee at my request
addressed itself to the nomination of Judge Sandra O'Connor to the
U.S. Supreme Court. I am happy to report that the consensus of
this committee is that Judge O'Connor is an eminent jurist with an
impeccable professional, social background. Her judicial opinions
are found to be concise, scholarly, well-reasoned, and well-founded
in the law.

  Additionally, I have undertaken a personal review of Judge
O'Connor based upon my nationwide professional and personal
acquaintanceships with judges. My inquiry led to similar findings
and opinions. As a matter of fact, not a single negative finding nor
criticism in any respect was the result.

  The American Judges Association applauds the fact that Judge
O'Connor is a woman. However, we support Judge O'Connor be-
cause she is a qualified jurist who has paid her dues by hard work
and devotion to the judiciary, and because she is worthy of the
high office to which she has been nominated--not because she is a
woman.

   It is therefore the finding and opinion of the American Judges
Association that Judge O'Connor is extremely and uniquely quali-
fied to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.
As the American Judges Association's incoming president, I strong-
ly endorse the nomination of Judge Sandra O'Connor and urge this
committee to confirm her appointment.

   I thank the Committee on the Judiciary, and particularly the
chairman, for the opportunity to appear, and request that the
American Judges Association be invited to appear in the future
whenever it may be of service to the committee, whether in rela-
tion to future nominations to the Supreme Court or any other
matter concerning the judiciary.

   Thank you on behalf of the American Judges Association and
personally. It has been a privilege and an honor to appear here
before you today.

   The CHAIRMAN. Judge, thank you very much for your presence
and your testimony on this occasion.

   Judge LANTZ. Mr. Chairman, I have a request that this report be
made a part of the printed and permanent record of this commit-
tee.

   The CHAIRMAN. HOW long is the report?
   Judge LANTZ. It is very concise; it is 2V2 pages.
   The CHAIRMAN. Every typewritten page we have put in this
thing is $3.50, and I want to save the Government all the money I
can.
   [Laughter.]
                                         368

  Judge LANTZ. Well, if you make it single space it is about a page
and a half but it is very important to us, inasmuch as the Ameri-
can Bar Association report is going to be part of it and

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, we will put it in at your
request.

  Judge LANTZ. Thank you so much.
  Mr. Chairman, I have had the privilege of watching you all day,
and I know that you have not only acted in good faith but I do not
know if I could have done the job that you have done all day in
being fair and equitable to all the witnesses, irrespective of their
background or irrespective of their opinion. I have to commend you
for that.
  Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you for your kind remarks.
  The next witness here has to catch a plane soon, so we will call
him up now: Father Charles Fiore, representing the National Pro-
Life Political Action Committee. Father Fiore, will you come
around? Is he here?
  If you will raise your hand, some priests desire to use "affirm"
rather than "swear." I will put both; use either one you want to.
  Father FIORE. AS you wish, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you affirm or swear that the evidence you
give in this hearing shall be the truth, the whole truth, and noth-
ing but the truth, so help you God?
  Father FIORE. I do.
  I do not mind swearing, Senator, under these circumstances,
since God is my witness.

      TESTIMONY OF FATHER CHARLES FIORE, CHAIRMAN,
       NATIONAL PRO-LIFE POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE

  Father FIORE. First of all, Senator, I have submitted a text of my
remarks which, with your permission, I would like inserted into
the record, and I will spend the time allotted to me synthesizing
those remarks if I may.

  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Without objection, so ordered, but try
not to duplicate.

  Father FIORE. I will. Thank you, Senator.
  Mr. Chairman, I thank you and the members of the committee
for this opportunity to appear before you as founder and chairman
of the National Pro-Life Political Action Committee, and on behalf
of the tens of thousands of our supporters in all States and right-to-
lifers everywhere who oppose the nomination of Judge Sandra Day
O'Connor to the U.S. Supreme Court.
  As you well know by now, Mrs. O'Connor's nomination by Presi-
dent Reagan has been the occasion of virtually unanimous disap-
pointment on the part of rank-and-file right-to-lifers because it
represents a breach of the 1980 Republican platform on which he
ran, and on the basis of which he convinced millions of blue collar,
traditionally Democratic ethnic, Catholic, and fundamentalist and
evangelical Protestant voters to switch parties and vote for him.
  I say these things at the outset not because they have any
bearing on Mrs. O'Connor's qualifications but because they have
something very much to do with the larger processes of representa-
tive government which are also at stake in these hearings.
                                         369

  Now the facts of Judge O'Connor's legislative and judicial careers
are matters of public record and they have been amply set forth for
examination by other witnesses who have already appeared before
the committee, so I will not belabor that part of my testimony.

  I had listened for the past 2 days to Mrs. O'Connor's explana-
tions of her proabortion votes while a member of the Arizona State
Senate, and I was especially interested to hear last evening from
six members of the Arizona State Legislature. I must say I was
impressed and moved by their testimony but it would have to
come, I am sure, under the heading of being character witnesses
for her probity and her good character.

  However, Senator Biden yesterday underscored our reaction and
puzzlement when he told Mrs. O'Connor that she had not answered
most of the questions which had been posed to her. Senators
Denton, East, Grassley, and Hatch, despite their best efforts, could
not get Judge O'Connor to admit that she was anything more than
"personally opposed" to abortion.

   Now I appreciate her personal opposition to abortion but, for the
record, those words since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision have
become a catch phrase used by many making public policy in our
State legislatures and in the Congress, who on the other hand do
not wish to do anything to protect the innocent unborn.

   Senator, if I may digress for a moment, I would like to thank you
for your statement a little bit earlier this afternoon in which you
spoke to the fact that in your opinion the Supreme Court really did
not have jurisdiction to do what they did on the Roe v. Wade
decision. I am not a lawyer, I am not a Member of Congress,
obviously, but I concur heartily in that judgment, as you know
indeed many constitutional attorneys do.

   Judge O'Connor rightly said she could not speak to how she
might rule in any future case to come before the Court. She also
said that she would not comment on the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision
of the Court because, her explanation was, that matter might once
again come before the Court as the subject of litigation.

   On the other hand, busing might again come before the Court as
a matter of litigation, and Judge O'Connor categorically said that
she opposes busing. The death penalty might once again come
before the Court as a matter of litigation, and Judge O'Connor said
she favors the death penalty.

   However, on the grounds that the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision
might again come before the Court, in other words, on the same
grounds, she again and again refused to give any direct or categori-
cal comment on the legal or substantive aspects of the Roe v. Wade

  ecision, or even on the matter of abortion itself. She would only
say she was personally opposed.

   Now what does that mean for one who will adjudicate laws that
the legislatures will make? Is she opposed to abortion for other
people, and not merely personally?

   Mr. Chairman, we see no evidence of a change of heart or of
'nind on the part of Judge O'Connor from the proabortion stance
that admittedly dominates her public record in the Arizona State
Senate. We do now know what questions the President asked of her
in his private meeting, or the questions that were posed to her by
members of this committee in their private meetings with her.
                                               370

  I understand Mrs. O'Connor's ambition and desire to become the
first woman Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, a
perfectly valid ambition. I find, however, her philosophy as exem-
plified in her record as a legislator and leader in the State Senate
of Arizona clearly proabortion, and so on the basis of criteria set
forth by the platform of the majority party in the Senate and by
the President who nominated her, she would appear to be unquali-
fied.

  One final comment: All of us in public life must realize at times
like these that our judgments are themselves subject to reexamina-
tion. I sincerely hope, as has been implied by members of the
Arizona State Legislature, that she has changed her opinion on
abortion. With Dr. Gerster, I hope that that is the case. In fact, I
might even say I pray for that.

  However, all of us will be subject to reexamination by the one
judge who alone is just and to whom all of us must finally submit
our thoughts and hopes, our words, our deeds, our very lives, all of
which and each part of which ultimately will be germane. Mr.
Chairman, Members of the committee, I ask that the Members of
the Senate and in particular the members of the Judiciary Com-
mittee not confirm the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor,
unless and until such time as she comments on these matters of
her public record.

  I thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. I do not believe there are any questions because
there are no other Senators here, and I do not believe I have any
questions. We thank you for your appearance here and for your
testimony.
  Father FIORE. I thank you, Senator.

ethnic Catholics and fundamentalist-evangelical Protestants -- to switch
parties and vote for him.

        As a result, in the first six months of his incumbency, President
Reagan may have seriously alienated major portions of the "social issues
conservatives" who comprised the pro-life/pro-family coalition that helped
elect him last November. Those same voters are intently watching these
hearings, and will long remember and note well the final "ayes" and "nays"
as the full Senate determines Judge O'Connor's qualifications to sit with
the Court. As voters they perceive the members of the House and Senate not
as party functionaries, but as their representatives first of all; just as
they also perceive party platforms and election pledges not as "litmus
tests," but as implied contracts to be fulfilled by those elected.

        I say these things at the outset, not because they have bearing on
Mrs. O'Connor's qualifications, but because they have very much to do with
the larger processes of representative government, which are also at
stake in these hearings.

        The facts of Judge O'Connor's legislative and judicial careers are
matters of public record, even though it appears that the Administration
paid scant attention to them when evaluating her qualifications for the
Supreme Court, even as late as the now-infamous Starr Justice Department
memorandum hurriedly compiled a day or so before the nomination was made.

        Briefly, as they pertain to the abortion issue, the facts are:

         1. As a State Senator in 1970, Mrs. O'Connor twice voted for HB 20,
to repeal Arizona's existing abortion statutes -- three years before the
U.S. Supreme Court legalized abortion-on-demand, throughout the nine
months of pregnancy, in all 50 states.

         2. In 1973, Senator O'Connor co-sponsored a so-called "family planning"
Act (SB 1190) which would have allowed abortions for minors without the
consent of parents or guardians. The bill was considered by all observers
in Arizona to be an abortion measure, and the Arizona Republic (3/5/73)
editorialized, "The bill appears gratuitous -- unless energetic promotion
of abortion is the eventual goal."

         3. In 1974, Senator O'Connor voted against a bill (HCM 2002) to
"memorialize" Congress on behalf of passage of a Human Life Amendment to
the Constitution protecting the unborn.

         4. In-1974, she voted against an amendment to a University of
Arizona funding bill that prohibited use of tax-funds for abortions
at University hospital, because Mrs. O'Connor claimed it was "non
germane" and thus violated the state constitution. However, the bill
passed with the amendment, and its constitutionality was upheld by
the State Supreme Court.

         It seems rather peculiar to us that Mrs. O'Connor, in discussing
her legislative record on abortion with Mr. Starr of the Justice Depart-
ment, could not remember her position on the first three votes, since
they all represented dramatic departures from the existing laws and
aroused national media attention. Yet she was apparently able to recall
the far less significant fourth vote and her precise reason for it.
Stranger still, was her attempt in the Starr memorandum to portray herself
as a friend and intiiaate of Dr. Carolyn Gerster, M.D., Phoenix, titular
head of the state right-to-life organization, when Dr. Gerster says it
was well-known that she and Mrs. O'Connor had long been in heated
opposition on these very votes.

         The question looms large over Mrs. O'Connor's qualifications to
sit as a member of the Supreme Court: Did she deliberately seek to
mislead investigators for the Justice Department and/or the President
as to the facts of her legislative record on this vital issue; did
she give false or selective information in an attempt to portray her
clearly pro-abortion legislative record as something else?

         And if she did, what does that say about her ambition to accede
to the high Court...and her moral strengths once part of it?

         What price glory?

         I raise these blunt and impolite questions because the matter of
the right to life of the unborn is fundamental and critical to the
health of our society. "The right to life," as also the rights to
 "liberty and the pursuit of happiness" are not "minor" or peripheral
issues in our political process. Nor are they "private" any more than
373

homicide i s a "private" act if the unborn are human, as indeed every
medico-scientific test affirms.

          Because of the complicated and sensitive issues involved, at the
very least we expect you to fully explore her philosophy and opinions
on t h i s issue of l i f e versus death. I_f t h i s judge be_ not guilty of_ the
pro-abortion charge, l e t her proclaim her innocence loudly and clearly.
Indeed, if she has changed her views, National Pro-Life PAC would be f i r s t
in line to reconsider our opposition to this nomination.

          As Professor William Bentley Ball, former Chairman of the Federal
Bar Association's Committee on Constitutional Law, and one who has argued
a number of religious liberty cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, recently
wrote apropos of Mrs. O'Connor's nomination:

          "Some zealous supporters of the O'Connor nomination...have made the astonishing
statement that, on the Supreme Court oj the United States, ideology doesn't count. They
say...that it would be of no significance that a candidate would have an actual and proved
record of having voted or acted on behalf of racism or anti-Semitism or any other philosophic
point of view profoundly opposed by millions of Americans. These concerns are not dispelled
by a recital that the candidate is 'personally' opposed to such a point of view. Why the
qualifying adverb? Does that not inply that, while the candidate may harbor private disguat
over certain practices, he or she does not intend to forgo support of those practices?

"Philosophy is everything in dealing with the spacious provisions of the First Amend-

ment, the due process clauses, equal protection, and much else in the Constitution. It is

perfect nonsense to praise a candidate as a 'strict cons truetionist' when, in these vital

areas of the Constitution, there is really very little language to 'strictly'  construe...

          "It is likewise meaninglehb to advance a tjioen candidate as a 'conservative'
(OP as a 'liberal'). In the matter oj Mrs. O'Connor, the label 'conservative' has
unfortunately been so employed an to ob\u^^aie a very real isbue. The scenario goes
like thus:

          "Comment: 'Mrs. O'Connor is said to be yro-abortion. '
         Response: 'Really? But she is a staunch conservative. '

          "Just as meaningful would be'

          "Comment: 'John Smith is said to be a mathematician. '
          Response: 'Really? But he is from Chicago. '

          "Whether Mrs. O'Connor is labeled a 'conservative' is irrelevant to the question
respecting her views on abortion. So would it be on any other subject. " (Emphasis a d d e d .
Cf. Appendix for complete text, "The O'Connor Supreme Court Nomination: A
Constitutional Lawyer Comments," from THE WANDERER, St. Paul, MN, Vol. 114,
No. 31; July 30, 1981).

          "Philosophy i s everything..." says Professor Ball. And we concur.
With these facts of her record in mind, and in the light of President
Reagan's pro-life promises before, during and after the campaign, logically
only three conclusions can be drawn:

          1. Either Sandra Day O'Connor has changed her views, and i s no
longer a pro-abortion advocate ("personal opposition" does not necessarily
translate into "public" opposition to abortion), or

          2. President Reagan appointed Mrs. O'Connor without full knowledge
about her public record, or

          3. President Reagan was fully informed about Mrs. O'Connor's public
record as pro-abortion, but chose to disregard i t and the solemn pro-life
promises he had made.

          If, as i t appears, Judge O'Connor and some of her supporters have
attempted to cloud over or to minimize the importance of her pro-abortion
record for the sake of these hearings, what does that say about her record?
More, what does i t say about her probity and candor?

          Far from being unimportant, these questions are absolutely essential
in judging the qualifications of one nominated to the Supreme Court of our
land.

          Mrs. O'Connor, although she has already testified and submitted her-
self to your queries, technically is s t i l l before this Committee, and may
be recalled for further questioning by yourselves or other Senators.

          She must be asked directly if she has changed her views on abortion
since her votes in the Arizona State Senate. She must be asked specifically
                                      374

about each of those votes. She must be asked about Roe vs. Wade and Doe vs.
Bolton, about parental consent to medical procedures on mTnors, and the other
excellent questions Professor Ball raises in his article (o£. cit.).

        Should this Committee and the Senate fail to raise these questions
with Judge O'Connor now, as previous Judiciary Committees did not
hesitate to question Judges Haynesworth and Carswell on their records
and philosophies, her nomination if confirmed will always be tainted,
and history will record that the Senate rushed to confirm her for
specious reasons and not her legitimate qualiflcdtions for the 30b.

        Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, we see no evidence of
a change of heart or mind on the part of Judge O'Connor from the pro-
abortion stance that dominates her public record. We do not know what
questions President Reagan asked Mrs. O'Connor in his private meeting
with her, and so we do not know the practical value, if any, of her
newfound "personal opposition" to abortion. On the contrary, we find
evidence that one week after her conversation with the President (and
before her nomination) she gave partial and misleading information on
these very issues as they arise in her record, to an investigator for
the Attorney General of the United States, at a time when she knew full
well that she was being considered among the finalists for this
nomination.

        I understand Mrs. O'Connor's ambition and desire to become the
first woman Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

        I find her philosophy as exemplified in her record as a legislator
and leader in the State Senate of Arizona clearly pro-abortion and so,
on the basis of criteria set forth by the Platform of the majority
party in the Senate, and by the President who nominated her, she is
unqualified.

        But all of us in public life must realize at times like these
that our judgments are subject to re-examination, first of all by the
public record which follows, and ultimately by the one Judge Who alone
is Just, and to whom all of us must finally submit our thoughts, hopes,
our words, our deeds, our very lives--all of which and each part of
which will be "germane."

        Quite simply, gentlemen, abortion goes beyond partisan platforms
and political promises -- it is morally unjustifiable. For that
fundamental reason, we urge all of you -- Democrats and Republicans
alike -- to vote against the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to
the U.S. Supreme Court.

representing the California Women Lawyers.

  Are you the president, Ms. Cochran?
  Ms. COCHRAN. The incoming president.
  The CHAIRMAN. The incoming president.
  Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

   Ms. COCHRAN. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU may proceed.
  The yellow light is here and the red light is there. The yellow

    TESTIMONY OF EILEEN CAMILLO COCHRAN, PRESIDENT-
                ELECT, CALIFORNIA WOMEN LAWYERS

  Ms. COCHRAN. After 3 days, I know.
  Thank you, Senator Thurmond, honorable committee members.
  My name is Eileen Camillo Cochran, and I am president-elect of
California Women Lawyers. I am here today to testify in support of
the appointment of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the U.S. Su-
preme Court.
  California Women Lawyers is the largest statewide organization
of women attorneys in the United States. We represent the inter-
ests of the more than 10,000 women lawyers in the State of Califor-
nia. Our membership includes a cross section of the practice of
law--corporate, government, and private practice, as well as the
judiciary.
   Moreover, our organization also includes a dozen affiliated bar
associations, and I am also speaking on behalf of these organiza-
tions. They are Sacramento Women Lawyers; Women Lawyer's
Association of Los Angeles; Queen's Bench of San Francisco; Law-
yers' Club of San Diego; the Association of Northern California
Black Women Lawyers; Southern California Black Women Law-
yers; Orange County Women Lawyers; the Women Lawyers' Associ-
ation of Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties; San Fernando
Valley Women Lawyers; Inland Counties Women at Law; Women
Lawyers of San Joaquin County; and Tulare County Women Law-
yers.

   Earlier you heard Justice Joan Dempsey Klein, presiding justice
of the California Court of Appeals, Second District, Third Division,
testify on behalf of the National Association of Women Judges.
Justice Klein was the founding president of California Women
Lawyers.

   The primary purposes of our organization are to advance women
in the legal profession; to improve the administration of justice; to
better the position of women in society; and to eliminate inequities
based upon sex. In keeping with our stated purposes, California
Women Lawyers had been urging President Reagan to make this
country's highest court truly representative of the Nation's entire
population by nominating a woman Justice. Nevertheless, we
stressed the equal importance that the candidate selected be one of
impeccable credentials who was exceptionally well-qualified for ap-
pointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.
                                             376

   California Women Lawyers commends President Reagan for his
selection of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor. Such a nomination dem-
onstrates the administration's commitment to equal justice under
law and recognition of the importance of an independent judiciary.

   Sandra Day O'Connor will bring to the Court a unique combina-
tion of experience as a legislator, a government lawyer, a trial
judge, and an appellate judge. The quality and breadth of her legal
background evidence her outstanding credentials for this appoint-
ment. An honors graduate of Stanford University Law School, her
entire legal career has been a progression of distinguished records
of achievements and accomplishments. Her record reflects a com-
mitment to the principle of equal justice under law.

  California Women Lawyers supports the confirmation of Judge
O'Connor because she is a highly capable and eminent jurist of
outstanding quality. Sandra Day O'Connor is a person of intelli-
gence, integrity, and discipline. Her presence as a Justice of our
Nation's highest forum will serve as a model for all persons and
will inure to the profound benefit of our society.

  The CHAIRMAN. I do not believe there are any questions.
   I want to thank you for appearing here today on behalf of your
organization and presenting testimony. Thank you very much. You
are now excused.
  Our next witness is Gordon S. Jones, representing United Fami-
lies of America.
  Mr. Jones, come around. Mr. Jones, you have 5 minutes.
  Hold up your hand and be sworn in.
  Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

   TESTIMONY OF GORDON S. JONES, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,
                     UNITED FAMILIES OF AMERICA

   Mr. JONES. I do.

  Mr. Chairman, my name is Gordon Jones. I am the executive
director of United Families of America. I do have a prepared
statement which I would like to have included in the record, and
then I would like to make some separate statements, if that will be
all right.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, that will be done. Try not to
duplicate.

  Mr. JONES. I will try not to duplicate.
  Mr. Chairman, I also would like to congratulate you on the
forthright statement you made about the propriety of the Supreme
Court's action in 1973 in rendering the Roe v. Wade decision. I am
a little bit afraid that you have disqualified yourself as a potential
Supreme Court nominee, however, on the basis of testimony that
we have heard over the last 3 days.
  I confess, Mr. Chairman, that I am somewhat disappointed at the
direction the hearings have taken, the apparent acquiescence in
the idea that nominees to the Supreme Court should not be re-
quired or do not need to express their views on important constitu-
tional and social issues.
   In my prepared testimony I discussed some public polling data
which indicate that the American people as a whole have lost
                                                  377

confidence in the Federal judiciary. The data in the poll, which was
a recent poll conducted by the Sindlinger Corp., indicate that 90
percent of the American people do not think that the Federal
judiciary reflects their views. As many as 80 percent would like to
see jurisdiction withdrawn from the Federal courts in such sensi-
tive areas as busing and abortion. Almost 70 percent would like to
see Supreme Court Justices elected, and nearly three-quarters
would favor seeing Justices of the Supreme Court stand for recon-
firmation.

   The performance of this committee and Judge O'Connor during
the nomination proceedings can only, in my opinion, widen that
gap between the people and their judges. In fact, it appears to
United Families of America that the committee is in the process of
completing a total abdication of final policymaking authority to the
Federal courts in the United States.

   Judge O'Connor asserted during her hearing that it would be
inappropriate for her to comment on the most important issues
facing the American people and their policymakers today. To a
very great extent, that simple assertion has been enough to dis-
courage even the most tenacious cross-examiner on the committee,
including former district attorneys.

   That principle has been asserted in the past, of course, by other
nominees, though I find it nowhere justified in the Constitution, in
statutes, or in canon, but never in the past has it been acquiesced
in so completely. In the case of past nominees, either there was an
adequate public record so that close questioning was not really
needed, or members of the committee persisted anyway in examin-
ing the nominee until they got the answers that they wanted after
all.

   During the hearings in the last 3 days, Judge O'Connor refused
to answer Senator Metzenbaum as to the constitutionality of anti-
trust policy. She refused to answer Senator Laxalt about the consti-
tutionality of the exclusionary rule. She refused to answer Senator
Hatch's questions about the constitutionality of affirmative action.
She refused to answer Senator Grassley's questions about the legis-
lative veto.

   Senator Dole asked her about the rights of aliens, and she de-
clined to give an opinion on the constitutionality of limitations on
the rights of aliens. Senator Specter talked about setting bail, and
she declined to answer questions in that respect. She declined to
answer anybody's questions about Roe v. Wade, with the possible
exception of Senator Mathias who apparently asked her during a
private visit to his office what she thought about that, and she--
according to the New York Times--told him that she would abide
by that precedent.

   The fact is, Mr. Chairman, that Federal judges are policymakers.
They are policymakers, moreover, who sit totally outside the demo-
cratic process. We cannot vote on them. They are appointed essen-
tially for life, and once they are there, they are beyond our reach.
Our only hope is that Senators during the confirmation process
will ask them the kinds of questions that will elicit from them
their policy views on the important issues which they will deal
with on the Supreme Court.
                                     378
  If Senators will do that and nominees will be forthcoming about
their views, then the American people can determine whether the
Senators are acting responsibly in voting to confirm those nomi-
nees. When you allow nominees to refuse to answer questions of
this type, you deny us the opportunity to render a political judg-
ment on the only possible object of that judgment, Senators seeking
reelection.
  In the very brief time that remains, I would like to distinguish
between a nominee's personal views and what her views or his
views are of what the Constitution says. I do not care what Judge
O'Connor thinks about abortion. Frankly, she can run an abortion
clinic on the side and it will not bother me, so long as she cannot
find in the Constitution an absolute right to abortion, which is
what the Supreme Court did in 1973.
  I reiterate that the issue is not abortion but judicial activism.
Roe v. Wade happens to be the worst example of judicial activism
in this century but there are many other examples of it. What we
need to know is what Judge O'Connor thinks about the Constitu-
tion. How does she regard that? What previously undiscovered
rights does she find there that nobody noticed in the last 200
years?
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Jones, for your appearance here
and the testimony you have given. You are now excused.

                      STATEMENT OF GORDON S. JONES, Executive Director
                                         UNITED FAMILIES OF AMERICA

Mr. Chairman:

I am Gordon Jones, Executive Director of United Families of America. UFA
is a grass-roots lobbying group concerned with the entire range of social
policy affecting the American family. We very much appreciate this oppor-
tunity to appear before your Cc">>nittee, to discuss the nomination of
Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court of the United States, the present
state of the federal judiciary, and the relationship between the two.

To begin with, Mr. Chairman, we submit that the federal judiciary is in
trouble. A public opinion poll conducted in May by the Sindlinger organization
reveals almost shocking mistrust of the federal judiciary by overwhelming
majorities of the American people. In fact, that poll reveals that only 10%
of the American people think that federal judges reflect their personal
views.

The federal bench is, of course, the least democratic of our governmental
institutions. Its members are appointed by the President, typically confirmed
after only cursory examinations of their credentials by the Senate, an
examination which almost never touches on their broad political and social
philosophy, after which they serve essentially for life, unchecked by any
other institution, unreachable by the citizens whose lives they so closely
regulate. Theoretically, the federal judiciary is an anomaly in the American
Republic, and has been recognized as such from the beginning. It is not
surprising that the American people should feel so cut off from their ruling
class of judges. It is perhaps surprising to learn to what lengths they are
prepared to go to correct their alienation.

For example, according to the Sindlinger Poll, nearly three-quarters of
all Americans would like to see federal judges reconfirmed from time to time;
nearly 70% would actually like to see them elected, as many State judges are.
Better than 80% would like to see jurisdiction over such sensitive issues as
abortion, school busing, and school prayers withdrawn from the federal courts;

87-101 0--81 25
                                       380

80% would prevent the Supreme Court from overturning federal or State laws
by less than a two-thirds vote; and a solid majority of 55% would like to see
Congress be able to overturn Supreme Court decisions by a two-thirds vote.

These views of the American public clearly indicate the seriousness of the
loss of faith experienced by the federal courts in recent years. Attacks on
the Supreme Court are nothing new, of course, and I am not going to take the
Committee's time to review them. That job has been done by such scholars
as Louis Boudin, Sidney Hook, and Edwin S. Corwin, much better than I can do
it, and I am sure the distinguished members of this Coi.i.nittee are already
familiar with the philosophical issues here.

Nor would I like to suggest that United Families of America supports election
or reconfirnation of federal judges. At this point, we are not suggesting
remedies, merely pointing out that a dangerous situation exists, one that
needs to be corrected before more drastic measures are taken against a judiciary
which, unchecked, exercises intimate influence over the most basic institutions
of our society. The influence of the courts, and in partiuclar the Supreme
Court, is both direct and indirect, but it is pervasive. Writing in the
current issue of The Public Interest, Mr. Edward A. Wynne describes the
tenuous, but real, connection between decisions of the Court and the social
attitudes of the American people. "Ultimately," he writes, "...the courts
are significantly responsible for the present distressing situation in our
schools. Courts, and judges, surely realize that their decisions not only
shape case law, but also often determine climates of opinion. Those climates
do not always bear a one-to-one correspondence to formal court decisions, but
the relationship is usually traceable."

What Mr. Wynne says about the schools can be said, and has been said, about
criminal law, about medical law, about regulatory law, and about every aspect
of our increasingly legalistic society.

Thus it will always be when the makers of law are not responsible to those on
whom the law must be enforced. And the federal courts are now the supreme
makers of law in the United States, with all due deference to the members of
this Committee, and the members of this Senate. In fact, it is largely due
                                     381

to the deference of this body, this national legislature, that that situation
has come about. Through acquiescence by Congress (not always silent), the
Supreme Court has come to be the Supreme Lawgiver, and now sits as a sort of
continuing Constitutional Convention shaping and re-shaping the supreme law of
the land to fit the prejudices of the day, or rather, the prejudices of a
majority of the Justices. Members of the Court itself have made that case
even more strongly than I do today.

If we are not to resort to the drastic structural changes in the Court
mentioned as desirable by respondents to the Sindlinger Poll, how are we
to re-establish some connection between the average person and the rarefied
atmosphere of the federal bench? One way is through confirmation hearings
such as this one. But the hearings will have to be conducted properly: they
will have to concentrate on the essentials, which are much more philosophical
and social than technical and experiential.

Since the American people cannot vote on their federal judges, it is imper-
ative that they be given some way to judge the Senators who do vote on them.
If the American people want judges who are tough on criminals, the Senators
have to be willing to ask questions of nominees which will expose their views
on criminal law. Then if the Senators vote to confirm a nominee whose views
are squishy soft, that Senator can be brought to account at the polls.

If the American people want judges who will be restrained in the creation of
new constitutional rights, the members of this Committee have an obligation
to ask questions about the nominee's judicial philosophy. They have an
obligation to insist on answers to those questions. If the answers reveal
a particularly inventive nominee, and the Senate wants to confirm anyway, the
vote of the Senators in favor can be used by their future opponents at the
polls, which is where we normally exercise political control over government.

Nominees must not be allowed to refuse to answer specific questions. No one
is suggesting that a nominee actually promise a vote on any specific issue.
But I think the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are astute enough
to frame issues that will elicit the desired information. It is the will
                                      382

that has been lacking in the past.

The quintessential question for the purpose of revealing latent judicial
activism is, of course, the Court's decision in The Abortion Cases, and
that is why so much attention has been lavished on it during these hearings
and since the nomination of Judge O'Connor. Roe v. Wade, handed down in
1973, is arguably the worst decision in the history of the Court; certainly
it is the worst-reasoned, worst-argued decision of this century. That opinion
is held not only by opponents of abortion, but by many of its supporters as
tsell. Roe v. Wade has essentially no defenders as a matter of law, though it
·has many as a matter of policy.

But that is the point: Roe v. Wade was not a matter of law, but a matter of
policy. In a policy determination the Supreme Court simply decided that there
should be no restrictions on the liberty of abortion in the United States. It
Was a classic case of judicial legislation which remains a blot upon the books.
>In the case of a legislature which so egregiously misread the preferences of
the American people, the recourse would be to the polls. But there are no polls
which can reach Mr. Justice Blackmun. The author of this law sits beyond the
reach of the people who pay his salary, who accord him deference, and who are
forced to live (or in this case die) under his decree.

Roe v. Wade is an abortion case, but that is only incidental. The extension
of judicial power would be as indefensible if the case involved contract law.
In Roe v. Wade the Court simply invented a right that had not previously
existed anywhere except in the wildest dreams of the National Abortion Rights
Action League.

For those reasons, Mr. Chairman, UFA would argue that questions about
Roe v. Wade are entirely appropriate. Not only are they appropriate, they
are essential. We can tell more about the judicial philosophy of a nominee
to the federal bench by the answers he or she gives to questions about Roe
v. Wade than we can from answers to any other questions.

Specifically, Judge O'Connor should be asked whether Roe v. Wade was cor-
rectly decided. That question is just as legitimate as a question about the
                                      383

correctness of the Dred Scott decision, or Plessy v. Ferguson, or Brown v.
Board of Education. The intent of such a question is not a focus on a "single
issue," unless the attitude of a nominee towards judicial lawmaking is a
"single issue." If it is, it is certainly a "single issue" with which this
Committee should be'very much concerned.

If Judge O'Conner responds that Roe v. Wade was correctly decided, United
Families of America would have to oppose the nomination. Moreover, we think
it would be the duty of all the members of this Committee to oppose the
nomination. Such an answer would reveal in Judge O'Connor the very kind of
penchant for judicial activism and irresponsibility which produces polls such
as the one mentioned earlier. It would tell us far more about her than she
reveals in saying that she is "personally opposed" to abortion. That statement
is totally irrelevant. We are, and you should be, far more concerned about
what she thinks the Constitution says about abortion than about what she thinks
about it.

Should she make such a response, the Right to Life movement would have
an obvious obligation to hold responsible at the polls those Senators then
voting to confirm Judge O'Connor's nomination. That much is obvious. Less
obvious is the fact that every group and individual concerned about limitations
on the federal judiciary would have an obligation to hold those Senators
responsible. That is so because as I said, Roe v. Wade is only incidentally
an abortion decision. It is the leading case on judicial activism.

Should Judge O'Connor respond that Roe v. Wade was incorrectly decided, it
would remain to ascertain how she feels about the doctrine of stare decisis.
While there is much merit in respect for precedent in many areas of the law,
there is no place for it in matters of basic constitutional law, and decisions
distorting the Ccnstitution should not be left unchallenged arjuncorrected.
That is as true for Roe v. Wade as it was for Dred Scott, and I pair the two
cases advisedly.

Finally, Mr. Chairman, United Families of America would like to urge this
Committee to adopt this line of questioning for all nominees to the federal
judiciary. One does not hire employees without some examination of their

87-101 O--81  26
                                      384

suitability for the job. In the case of the federal bench, particularly the
Supreme Court, the qualifications are restraint, conservatism, and an under-
standing of the organic, fragile nature of large and complex polities. Formal
training and experience are interesting, but not determinative. Questions of
social philosophy and economics are at the basis of the controversies imposing
strains on the American Republic now, as throughout our history. Attitudes
towards those questions cannot be ascertained by looking at law school records
and decisions on employee compensation. In fact, where these questions
are concerned, Sandra O'Connor's actions as a State legislator may be far
more revealing. Certainly they are troubling to many of us concerned about
the direction the federal bench has taken. Absent any development of her
views, which can only be demonstrated under questioning by this Committee,
we are forced to reach conclusions about her suitability on the basis of
that record.

Farther down the road, this Committee should give serious attention to the
nature of the crisis in the judiciary. Pending in Congress right now are
several measures which would impose restrictions of one type or another on
the federal judiciary. These measures are reactions to a judiciary gone
wild, unchecked in the expression of its will, and without effective counter-
weights. If the Congress does not impose those counterweights, the fragile
bond holding our polity together will come unglued, just as it did in 1776.
The tyranny is not dissimilar. In both cases it was imposed by a governing
body out of reach of its subjects.

If we stand in the current crisis as Sam Adams did in the earlier one, it is
within the power of members of this Committee to act the part of William Pitt.
May you be more successful than he was.

Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Our next witness is Anne Neamon, representing
Citizens for God and Country, and Truth in Press, Inc.

  Come around, Ms. Neamon. You will hold up your hand and be
sworn.

  Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

TESTIMONY OF ANNE NEAMON, NATIONAL COORDINATOR,
  CITIZENS FOR GOD AND COUNTRY, AND TRUSTEE, TRUTH IN
  PRESS, INC.

  Ms. NEAMON. I do, so help me God.
  Senator, I want to thank you for your undertaking, and in view
of the fact that some of these matters have not been addressed to
the candidate, would you kindly find opportunity to address them
to her, please, in view of the omissions of every member of this
body?
  The nomination of Justice O'Connor occurs with continuing out-
cries from those who elected Reagan, mandating change, not com-
promise--restore U.S. Constitution, Christian law priority. Every
nominee's background and intentions are vital at these times.
Public right to know seeks answers.
  Free nations are guided in law and jurisprudence by founding
religious principles. Traditional Biblical morality, Christian ethics,
guide good government and moral order against invasions by un-
constitutional, shifting political whims, to secure all rights includ-
ing diversity by individual rights, private means.
  Quoting reassertions of the U.S. Supreme Court: "We are found-
ed to legislate, propagate, and secure general Christian faith, which
is and always has been our common law. Nothing be done to hurt
Christianity. Bring infidels and savages unto human civility for a
quiet and settled government. Morality of the Nation is deeply
ingrafted in general Christian faith. We are a Christian Nation.
Secularism is unconstitutional. It is the duty of government to
deter no-belief religions. Government facilities '--and this includes
abortions or whatever moral issue--"government facilities do not
offend, commit inhibition, hostility, jeopardy, handicap, prohibition
to Godly belief. Authority which can establish Christianity, with
emphasis in exclusion of all other religions, as guides to good
government. . . . Separation was never required. Scrupulous
Christian neutrality was the issue." Our legislation and our secu-
rity should be based on such values. (Holy Trinity, U.S. 143; Ever-
son, U.S. 330; Engel, U.S. 469; Abington, U.S. 142, 119; Roemer, 74-
730; Stone v. Graham, 80-321 (1980).)

   Over 90 percent of taxes come from Christians, yet over 90
percent of deceptive, anti-Christian, anti-Semetic programs are con-
verting U.S. Constitution, Christian law priority, to Soviet Consti-
tution and "Communist Manifesto:"

   Propagate worldwide atheism, separation of church and state, classless society,
communistic morality, centralized education, workers of the world unite.

   Since the original U.S. Constitution has been recently and ille-
gally altered, and misrepresented by foreign ideology, not only the
nominee but every member of this committee is obligated to reaf-
                                     386

firm in this public record loyalty to U.S. Constitution-Christian law
priority.

  By public right to know, then, the urgency to restore the original
Constitution and address the moral crisis: One, will the nominee
address the public pleadings of none other than President Carter
and the late Senator H. Humphrey?

  We must all abandon corruption and greed and dedicate ourselves to family and
morality in the interest of national security. Values, values, values.

  Two, will the nominee challenge Court status of plaintiffs whose
policies advocate foreign ideological changes to our Constitution,
such as some members of the left-thinking membership of ABA,
ACLU, and others who propagate communistic worldwide atheism?
Will the nominee refuse to accept honorariums from such anti-
Christian, anti-Semetic sources?

  Three, return Bibles to courts, since Biblical morality guides law
and jurisprudence and scriptural guides identify Justices as minis-
ters of God--black robes a reminder? Will she address militant
atheists who have no constitutional standing, since they disturb the
moral order, safety, and peace of society? Quoting the U.S. Su-
preme Court: "They"--atheists--"do not interfere. There is nothing
compatible. They go their own way. Nothing be done to hurt Chris-
tianity." What knowledge, obligation, loyalty does an anti-Chris-
tian, anti-Semetic have to "legislate, propagate, and secure general
Christian faith"?

  Four, address attacks against family and morality. Place
women's rights in perspective with family rights, restoring the
constitutionally guaranteed moral order; securing homes against
TV invasions to indoctrinate Marxist paganism, and securing
schools and churches against illegal coercions of international athe-
ism?

  Five, will she in Court action, and in duty above and beyond
secure youth against official disorientation into crime, youth preg-
nancies, drug, alcohol, and social diseases?

  Six, address media and other invading hostilities on falsehoods of
U.S. Supreme Court cases, which do permit both legislated and
unlegislated prayers for love of country, belief in God, for disci-
pline, harmony, unity, and enhancing of teachers' authority,
prayers and Bible for ethics, Biblical ethics, Christian ethics by
nonsectarian Bible reading and prayers?

  Seven, confine freedom of press and speech within the scope of
the U.S. Constitution, Christian ethics as mandated by the intent
of the Constitution--justice, tranquillity, and blessings of freedom,
not vices?

  Eight, in poorly structured cases, will the nominee defend
against future harm by obligation due society, perceive disinforma-
tion strategies of the press for paganism, review legislative history
of 36 U.S.C. 172, one Nation under God, "to protect our babes from
rabid communism"? So identified in the legislative history of this
law.

  Nine, restore purity of free elections, denouncing totalitarian
teacher-power and student-power, upholding first amendment neu-
trality to Godless belief, article 4, section 4, "guarantee republican
form of government, and secure against invasions"?
                                         387

  Ten, will nominee acknowledge political brutalities of appellate
power for labor unions, resulting in crime and violence, denial of
human right to work, free enterprise, and consequences of critical
inflation? Will she enforce strong warnings of former Attorney
General Bell against appellate power for school prayers, threaten-
ing all liberties? State courts have proven not only incapable but
unworthy, to wit, Kentucky Supreme Court, 10 Commandments
case, Justices Lukowsky, Palmore, Sternberg, denouncing Biblical
ethics and advocating atheism as guides to public administration.
In such cases, will the nominee admonish such impeachable of-
fenses, deny Court status for ACLU for its national policy to har-
rass all our institutions out of Christian law priority, by its nation-
al policy for Soviet constitutional separation of church and state?

  Will over 90 percent of the Christians in this Christian Nation be
assured of loyalties to President Reagan's intent to restore and
defend Christian law priority?

  The CHAIRMAN. We wish to thank you, Ms. Neamon
  Ms. NEAMON. Senator, since these matters were never brought
out by any member of the committee, in justice to the national
outcries, the moral crisis, and the President's anxiety to restore
U.S. Constitution and our ethics, could you find opportunity to
address these questions to the nominee?
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you have made your statement. That will
be available to all the Senators.
   Ms. NEAMON. I wonder if they will find the time to really,
collectively address it, and will the nominee have the opportunity
to respond to their addressing of this matter?
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you see, the nominee now is through with
her testimony, and it is too late to address questions in these
proceedings.
   Ms. NEAMON. Can she be recalled?
  The CHAIRMAN. NO; we cannot recall her. We are giving every-
body an opportunity. We have had 3 days of hearings.
   Ms. NEAMON. Thank you very much. I would appreciate it if
there was anything you could do to extend your concerns, at least.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
   Our next witness is Stephen Gillers, representing the Committee
for Public Justice, who is coming at the request of Senator
Kennedy.
   You will hold up your hand and be sworn.
   Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

TESTIMONY OF STEPHEN GILLERS, COCHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE
                             FOR PUBLIC JUSTICE

   Mr. GILLERS. I do.

   Mr. Chairman, I have also prepared a statement which I have
given to the staff and which I ask be made part of the record. I will
make some nonduplicative comments in addition to that, if I may.

   The CHAIRMAN. YOU want this statement entered in the record in
full?

   Mr. GILLERS. Yes, sir.
                                               388

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, that will be done. Now any-
thing you say now, say it in addition to what is there because we
do not want to duplicate.

  Mr. GILLERS. I will not duplicate it, sir.
  Sitting through the testimony today, it is obvious that the wit-
nesses, aside from disagreeing on whether or not Judge O'Connor
should be confirmed, also disagree on the questions that the Senate
should properly consider in deciding whether or not to confirm a
nominee. That is, the scope of the Senate's responsibility seems to
be, in exercising its confirmation power, a matter of some dispute.
  It would be good, I suppose, if the scope of that power could be
clarified, not during the rush of confirmation, and perhaps that
possibility will be considered. But here we are and we have a
nomination to confirm or not to confirm.
  It is particularly important, Senator Thurmond, that the scope of
the responsibility in deciding whether or not to confirm be as-
sessed, because we stand at the beginning of a decade when we are
likely to see five or six additional Supreme Court nominations
made. That is a fact of timing; it is very likely to happen that we
will be here again in the next 10 years another five or six times.
  I would like to emphasize one aspect of my written testimony
which deals with the Senate's responsibility at confirmation hear-
ings. I do not believe the Senate sits as a body whose function is to
enforce IOU's that one-issue constituencies feel the President gave
them when he was elected but has now failed to honor. They may
have real gripes--I understand that--but it does not seem to me
that they should be able to use the confirmation process as the
means by which his promise or his failure to keep his promise is
enforced.
  I believe the Senate is institutionally incapable of pinning down
a nominee on each of the many areas of emerging constitutional
law that its shifting majorities, its various Senators, may consider
important. I realize that the people speaking against abortion
today feel very strongly about that issue, and I was personally
moved as a human being by the content of their testimony.
  However, we are talking about a confirmation process, a consti-
tutional process. As a law professor at New York University Law
School, who has taught courses on Federal courts and in constitu-
tional law, I believe it would be dangerous to our constitutional
government and would ultimately seriously weaken the Court if a
nominee's willingness to be pinned down on future votes on mat-
ters that are likely to come before the Court could be used as a
condition for approval or disapproval of a nomination. Certainly it
could raise questions of ethics should that nominee then proceed, if
confirmed, to sit on a case in which he or she has already made a
commitment.
  In addition, whatever is the pressing issue of the day may be
long gone as an issue by the time a nominee is half into his or her
career on the Court. People sit on the Court for 10, 20, some in
excess of 30 years. A nominee who is pressed with regard to an
issue that may be emerging today, may be sitting on the Court
long, long after that issue is forgotten. It seems to me that it is
shortsighted in the extreme to emphasize a particular current issue
                                         389

over a nominee's character, history, intellect, judgment, and other
qualities discussed in my written statement.

  In sum, Senator Thurmond, it seems to me that the use of the
confirmation process as a means to change emerging Supreme
Court rulings is really a substitute for the amendment process
which the Constitution itself prescribes for its change.

  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would like to ask you, I do not believe you have
said yet whether you favor or oppose the nominee. How do you
stand, or do you stand?
  Mr. GILLERS. I, and the Committee for Public Justice for which I
speak, favor confirmation of Judge O'Connor.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.

                                    STEPHEN GILLERS,

                         COMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC JUSTICE

                  I am an Associate Professor of Law at New York
University. I am testifying on behalf of the Committee
for Public Justice, of which I am a co-chairman. The
Committee for Public Justice, formed in 1970, is a group
of writers, lawyers, scientists, educators and other socially
interested persons whose primary purpose is to call attention
to dangers to public justice in American society. It has
conducted studies of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
the Central Intelligence Agency, the Justice Department,
the use and abuse of grand jury power, government secrecy,
and the judicial appointment process. Since 1977, the
Committee has published an occasional report entitled
Justice Department Watch, which is read in and outside the
Justice Department and excerpts from which have been
printed in many newspapers and periodicals nationwide.
One of the Committee's current projects is Supreme Court
Watch, under which it will monitor appointments to the
United States Supreme Court. It is in conjunction with
that project that I testify here today.

                  I am testifying in support of the confirmation of
Sandra Day O'Connor to the United States Supreme Court.
On the other hand, if the Committee will indulge a fine
distinction, I do not so much testify in support of Sandra
O'Connor personally, but rather in support of the proper
exercise of the Senate's institutional role in giving the
President's appointment its "Advice and Consent."

                                    A Brief History

                  The Senate has not been consistent in the standards
it has used for weighing Supreme Court nominations. About
the only definable trend which a reading of history reveals
is that the rate of denial of confirmation has decreased
markedly in this century.

                  There have been 101 men who have sat on the United
States Supreme Court. There have been 51 nominations and
47 confirmations this cer.tury. four appointees -- John J. "
Parker in 1930, Abe Fortas (to Chief Justice) in 1968,
Clement F. Haynsworth m 1969, and G. Harrold Carswell in
1970 -- have not been confirmed. In other words, there has
bivn one rejection or withdrawal for every 12 confirmations.

                  Prior to 1900, the story was different. In this
earlier period, 53 men were confirmed to sit on the Supreme
Court, but 20 nominations were re:used. Sometimes the refusal
occurred as an actual rejection .v. tor a vote. At other times
the nominee's name was withdrawn ,«!ion it became apparent that
there would not be a confirmation. At still other times, the
vote on confirmation was postponed indefinitely.

                  But the critical fact is that prior to 1900 there were
two failures to confirm for every five confirmations, a markedly
higher ratio than has occurred in this century.
                                      391

                 As I have said, it is not easy to find a discrete
pattern in the Senate's refusals to confirm. Sometimes the
apparent reason was enmity between the Senate, which was
controlled by one party, and the President, who was a member
of another party. Occasionally there was personal or
political hostility to a particular nominee. There is a
higher rejection rate for nominations coming in the final
year of a President's term. A candidate's perceived
mediocrity or lack of integrity has sometimes been a
contributing factor in the refusal to confirm. But it does
not appear that a nominee's position on particular, current
issues of constitutional law has played an express role in
the Senate's decision to reject. This conclusion is certainly
true in this century.

                  In sum, there have been 24 rejections and 101
confirmations. Prior to 1900, rejections occurred at a rate
more than five times as frequently as they have thereafter.
Of the 24 rejections, half represented nominations by five
Presidents (Tyler, Fillmore, Grant, Cleveland, and Nixon),
each of whom had two or more nominees rejected.

                  The Constitutional Convention did not clearly
articulate the role the Senate was expected to play in
exercising its advice and consent power. The decision to
have the President appoint and the Senate confirm was an
apparent compromise oetween those who wanted the appointment
power to lie with the President alone and those who wanted
to give it solely to the Senate. Until the very end, it
seemed that the Convention was moving toward the latter position,
In his diaries, Madison says that the requirements of confirma-
tion would protect against "incautious or corrupt nomination"
and against "flagrant partiality or error." In the Federalist
Papers, Hamilton wrote that the Senate could be expected to
weigh a nominee's "merit" and reject the appointment of "unfit
characters." Although the quoted language is not self-evident,
neither co.nmentator seemed to envision an expansive role for
the Senate.

                                  The Senate's Role

                  In the balance of my testimony, I would like to
discuss three subiects. I will first identify wh.it I consider
to be the clear areas of senatorial concern in deciding whether
to vote to confirm a person as a Justice of the United States
Supreme Court. I will then attempt to identify wh.it I
consider to be a "gray area," an area in which each Senator
must conscientiously exercise his or her best judgment
consistent with the Senate's institutional responsibility
as a "confirming" body and not a "nominating" body. Finally,
I wish to stress why I believe, particularly at this time
 in our nation's history, it is important that the Senate
act with institutional responsibility on the nomination
before it.

                   I believe there are five appropriate areas of
inquiry. Four are fairly clear and are not likely to
encounter much disagreement. They are:

                          The age and physical health of the nominee.
                          The Senate has a right to assure itself that
                          the nominee is of an age and a state of
                          health that makes it likely that he or she
                          will serve a reasonable term. The Supreme
                                   392

                        Court would suffer terribly from a series of
                        short-terra appointments. The great and ongoing
                        constitutional debates in which it must engage
                        depend on continuity of service. The remarkable
                        success of this institution is due in part to
                        the fact that, in its nearly 200 years, there
                        have been only 101 justices, or a new appoint-
                        ment on the average of every two years. While
                        I have not computed the median tenure of a
                        Supreme Court Justice, it is worth noting chat
                        eight members of the current Court have been
                        sitting for at least nine years. You have to
                        go back to 1955, 26 years ago, to come up with
                        a Court entirely different from the one we
                        now have.

                        Intellect and judgment. These attributes are
                        self-evident, although their assessment is not
                        always easy. A nominee's professional career
                        as a lawyer and, if he or sne lias been one, a
                        judge, must be scrutinized. The nominee's
                        standing among his or her peers at the bar
                        should have some weight. Of course, the nominee
                        need not be the most brilliant of the possible
                        choices, but neither should he or she be mediocre.
                        The job is too important for less than superior
                        intellectual competence and judgment.

                        Temperament. This category subsumes emotional
                        stability, graciousness under pressure,
                        resilience in defeat, humility in strength,
                        collegiality, the ability to listen,and the
                        ability to change one's mind. Assessment of
                        a nominee's character demands investigation
                        of his or her standing among colleagues,
                        subordinates, superiors, and adversaries.
                        Furthermore, inquiries should go back at
                        least to positions the nominee has held since
                        graduation from law school.

                        Propriety or its appearance in a nominee's
                        professional or public life. By propriety,
                        I include integrity, nonesty, law-abidingness,
                        and a sensitivity to the appearance of each
                        of these. On the other hand, technical or
                        minor lapses, especially those occurring long
                        ago in a nominee's career, are not, in my
                        view, a basis to reject.

                 The fifth area of senatorial inquiry, the hardest,
is the nominee's position on issues of constitutional law.
I want to be emphatic about this. When it comes to current
or emerging questions of constitutional law, it is decidedly
not the Senate's function to enforce the IOUs that single-
issue constituencies believe the President has given them
and failed to honor. Those groups, if they wish to play a
role in the selection of a Supreme Court Justice, may attempt
to catch the President's ear before the nomination. If that
fails, their only recourse is the ballot. The President
exercises a much broader political discretion prior to
nomination than does the Senate on confirmation.

                 Predictions about a nominee's position on emerging
issues of constitutional law are for the President to attempt
if he can. As we all know, presidents have often tried to
select nominees based on anticipated attitudes toward consti-
tutional questions. But these predictions are perilous. The
                                     393

positions a nominee may have taken in the trade-offs that
accompany a public career are often reassessed in the cloister
of life tenure.

                 Does the Senate, then, have any role to play in
assessing a nominee's views on constitutional issues or his
or her ideology? I think it does.

                 As Felix Frankfurter noted in 1930, cases before the
Supreme Court involve "the stuff of politics." There are a
number of constitutional rules which govern us and which,
though dressed as rules of law, have been so far endorsed
by other of our institutions that they are also a part of
our common understanding as a people. That the "separate
but equal" treatment of minorities is wrong; that an indigent
accused is entitled to free counsel; that courts have power
of judicial review; that states have broad authority to
legislate for the health and welfare of their citizens; and
that the First Amendment protects communication from prior
restraint are a few clear examples of these abiding values.

                 The Senate may properly assure itself that a nominee
will not seek to undercut these and other fundamental political
arrangements through the guise of constitutional interpretation.
In making this assessment, the Senate should seek information
from the nominee and from others. A nominee's entire public
life and career may properly be explored to test his or her
commitment to these abiding political values. On the other
hand, the Senate must be alert that men and women who become
actively involved in the issues of their time -- even the
unpopular ones -- should not suffer for their activism. It
will be a sad day should it ever come, as some have suggested
it already on occasion has, that a requirement for reaching
the Supreme Court is to remain aloof from political and economic
debate and to refrain from antagonizing important interest
groups.

                 Finally, I believe that ideological insensitivity
to the reasonable concerns of the nation's legitimate interest
groups may, in an appropriate case, be a basis to deny
confirmation. This basis need not be further explored today
because it has no possible application to the nomination of
Judge O'Connor.

                 There is a separate category of constitutional
inquiry which I suggest falls outside the Senate's jurisdiction.
This category is composed of emerging or current constitutional
issues, those presently before the Court. There are several
reasons why the issues in this category ought to be excluded.

                  First, as noted above, there is minimal utility in
eliciting a nominee's views on current matters of constitutional
law. Any commitment a nominee might be willing to give,
directly or in veiled terms, could be reassessed, and would
in any event be unenforceable, once the nominee is confirmed.

                  Second, the Senate is institutionally incapable of
passing on the various current issues of constitutional law
which its shifting majorities may consider to be a matter of
present political import. In Judge O'Connor's case, for
example, just as some conservative Senators may pause over
her perceived support of a constitutional right to abortion,
liberal Senators may be troubled by her apparent willingness
to restrict federal court jurisdiction in cases charging a
violation of civil liberties or civil rights. If each of
these groups, and several others which may have their own
areas of concern, felt institutionally free to insist on a
                                     394

nominee who agreed with its view on the particular matter,
it is doubtful that anyone could be confirmed.

                 Third, even if a sizeable number of senators did
concur on a current constitutional issue, insistence on a
nominee who would agree -- directly or otherwise -- to adopt
the same view in future cases would be unseemly and could
arguably preclude participation, after confirmation, in cases
raising that issue. Even more important, it ignores due
constitutional process in a way I address shortly.

                 It is instructive, I believe, that in virtually
none of the prior Senate rejections of presidential nominations
to the position of Supreme Court Justice (and certainly none
this century) has an expressed senatorial motive been the
nominee's expected position on an emerging constitutional
issue.

                 I recognize that there is no clear line between
settled and emerging constitutional issues. Nor is either
category static. Over time, issues once thought settled
are questioned anew. Over time, too, a consensus develops
about emerging issues and they become settled. In close cases,
each Senator will have to decide for himself or herself, as
each conscientiously weighs how to vote. But we need not
spend a great deal of time attempting to splice the definition
of "a close case." It is clear that the O'Connor nomination
does not present one.

                            The O'Connor Nomination

                 If preliminary press reports are any guide, a central
issue in the opposition to the O'Connor nomination will be her
position on a constitutional right to abortion. I do not
myself know her position. Apparently, groups and individuals
opposing a constitutional right to abortion believe she
supports one. If so, this xs not a defensible reason to reject
her nomination. Support of a constitutional right to an
abortion is well within the mainstream of American law.
Much judicial and scholarly authority recognize such a
right. By a 7 - 2 vote, the Supreme Court agreed with this
view eight years ago. It would be no more appropriate to
deny Judge O'Connor's nomination for this reason than it
would be were she to oppose or support other emerging
constitutional principles, such as in the areas of the
exclusionary rule, standing to sue, double jeopardy, or
the definition of obscenity.

                  I recognize that there are persons and groups who
do not believe there should be a constitutional right to
an abortion. They have avenues to advance their cause. They
can seek to persuade the Supreme Court that precedent in the
area should be overruled or limited. Failing that, they may
attempt to amend the Constitution. But the advice and consent
power must not be used as a substitute for the amendment
process, as an indirect means to reverse disagreeable Supreme
Court positions.

                  Whether or not Judge O'Connor is fit to sit on the
Supreme Court does not turn on whether or not she will
promise to or can be expected to vote in a particular way
in a future case raising a particular issue.

                    The Effect on Future Nominations

                  Finally, I would like to say something about why the
line I attempt to draw in this testimony is so critical rinnt
now. As I said earlier, we have had 101 Justices in I V years.
This comes to an appointment, on the averaao, every oi!.< r
year. We .have, however, had only one appoint lent in the last
nine years. Five of the current Justices were born be'.ucen
1906 and 1908. It is not unreasonable to expect that Mi. re
will be five additional Court so.iL? to fill before th: ,;(vr.ie
is through. Going further, the current President and '.In- next
three persons to be elected president can be expected irly
to rename the entire Court.

                  This speaks to the Senate's institutional role. No
one now knows who the president will be four, eight,or 12
years from now. No one now knows which party will control
the Senate at any of these times. Precedent established with
the current nomination will be invoked when future presidents
nominate future men and women to sit on the Supreme C o m t . It
would be extrenely unfortunate if that precedent revealed a
Senate willing to use the confirrr.ation process to reject a
nominee because she refused to adopt a particular position
on an emerging constitutional question. Adoption of such a
senatorial role would seriously weaken the Court and, eventually,
the nation.

                  Thank you very much.

  The CHAIRMAN. Our next witness is Ms. Eleanor Smeal, repre-
senting the National Organization for Women.

  Ms. Smeal, will you hold up your hand and be sworn?
  Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing shall be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

   Ms. SMEAL. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU may proceed, Ms. Smeal. Do you want to
submit a statement for the record or do you want to speak off the
cuff.

  Ms. SMEAL. I want to submit a statement for the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Without objection, that will be includ-
ed. Then try not to duplicate it because there is no use, if your
statement is printed, then we do not want what you say to dupli-
cate that.
  Ms. SMEAL. I will try not to duplicate it too much but
  The CHAIRMAN. If you want to summarize it

       TESTIMONY OF ELEANOR CUTRI SMEAL, PRESIDENT,
                NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN

  Ms. SMEAL [continuing]. Highlight it and summarize it, yes.
  As president of the National Organization for Women, I am
representing today the largest organization dedicated to the ad-
vancement of equal rights for women in the United States. On
behalf of our membership I would like to urge this committee to
confirm the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor.
  This nomination, of course, is truly historic and is a major victo-
ry for women's rights. We believe it is both important symbolically
                                         396

and important actually. We believe that the long fight for women's
rights is why we are here today. When we, the National Organiza-
tion for Women, joined in this fight just 15 years ago, women were
totally tokens in law schools and in participation as lawyers in the
courts.

  We think that Judge O'Connor's performance and her qualifica-
tions are more outstanding when you consider how extraordinary
they are for a woman of her time and for the pervasive discrimina-
tion in the judiciary, in the law practice, during her whole career.

  I would like to call attention, and I do not think anybody else
has, not only to her experience in the law but to the fact that she
has been a homemaker. We believe that this experience as a home-
maker and a community volunteer, which is not unique for a
woman, will add a unique and vitally new perspective to the Su-
preme Court.

  There has been much made of her legislative record vis-a-vis
social issues. We believe that her record indicates a commitment to
equal justice under the law, and we believe that her record of
sensitivity to women's rights issues is important. We have studied
this record and we believe that it shows accomplishments in her
concern for women over her total career.

  We do not contend that the National Organization for Women
agrees with all of the legal and political views of Judge O'Connor.
As a matter of fact, we know that our own State organization,
Arizona NOW, did oppose Judge O'Connor in some of her positions
in her career as a Senator. However, we do not think that total
agreement is necessary and we believe that there has been overall
a commitment and an understanding of discrimination.

  In fact, we think that it would be preposterous if she did not
have such an understanding of discrimination because, as the first
woman appointment, she will have a unique burden before the
Supreme Court. The first black appointment, we would expect,
would have been--and is, as a matter of fact--sensitive to discrimi-
nation against blacks. We think there should be no less expectation
for the first woman appointment.

  We believe, on the basis not only of an understanding of her
record but upon interviewing many, many people who have worked
with her throughout her lengthy career, that she indeed under-
stands discrimination and that she is sensitive to the whole prog-
ress of women and minorities under the law.

  By the way, we join in the other statements by professional
women's organizations and the legal associations representing
women. In fact, we also salute Judge O'Connor for her work
through these organizations to eliminate sex discrimination. She
has been a charter member of the National Association of Women
Judges, the Arizona Women Lawyers, and Charter 100, which is a
business and professional women's network group. Such groups
work to the advancement of women in the professions.

  We believe that Judge O'Connor's appointment is extremely im-
portant for the advancement of women, and in establishing the
principle that there is no such thing as a "woman's place.' We
know that the opponents to Judge Sandra Day O'Connor say that
they are for women's rights and the advancement of women but we
warn that they are not. They have opposed women's rights almost
                                         397

at every significant turn, and we are not surprised by their opposi-
tion to Judge O'Connor.

  In fact, we think that their questioning of her family values on
one limited issue shows their own myopic views of the family. We
firmly believe that the first woman Justice before the Supreme
Court must by definition not be a traditional woman. However, we
do believe that it is in the finest traditions of equality and justice
for all.

  Therefore, for all these reasons we urge her appointment. We
would like to further urge that this committee look at the other 65
vacancies on the Federal district and appellate courts which to
date, of the 46 individuals that have been named or confirmed,
only 2 are females. We hope that Judge O'Connor is not to be
tokenized but is one of many females, for equal justice under the
law demands full representation of females in the Court.

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you for your appearance.

                                           Testimony of
                                   Eleanor Cutri Smeal
                President, National Organisation for Women

         As President of the National Organization for VJcmen, I
am representing today the largest ireribership organization in
the United States dedicated to the advancement of equal
political, legal, and economic rights for v:omen. On behalf
of N O W s membership, I would like to urge this Committee to
confirm the nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor for the
position of Associate Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court.

         The nomination of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor to the
Supreme Court is truly an historic and a major victory for
women's rights. After 191 years and 101 male justices, the
appointment of the first woman to the Supreme Court is important
both symbolically and actually.

         The National Organization for Women has long been fighting
for equal opportunity for women in law school and in the
judiciary. When we began this fight some 15 years ago, women
were outnumbered by men 23 to 1 in law school and less than 3%
of the lawyers were female. Today some 32% of law-school students
are female, and over 7^% of all attorneys are female. In the
post docade, the percentage of females in the judiciary has
increased from 1% to approximately 7%.

         The National Organization for vrornen has appeared before
this committee before to voice our concerns about sex discrimin-
ation in the law, in the judiciary, and in appointments. The
appointment of Judge Sandca Day O'Connor narks an end to the
191 year exclusion of females from the Supreme Court. Further,
it not only opens an important door for women, but it also
establishes a landmark in the journey tov.ard full political and
legal cqu.ilivy for women.

         \.*e believe that the appointment of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor
 is a result of years of work by wo:.vn's rights advocates who will
not accept the tortured reasoning that equal jostice under the
                                      399

law is possible while women are excluded or have merely token
representation in the ranks of the judiciary. We hope that the
appointment of Judge Sandra Day O'Connor will be the first among
many wonen to the Supreme Court, so that in the not too distant
future the sex of an appointee will not be a consideration.
Of course, that day is not here, and today's nominee is merito-
rious both because of her individual achievement and because
she is the first woman appointment.

         In fact, Judge Sandra Day O'Connor's achievements are even
more remarkable considering the sex discrimination she had to
face as a woman. The honors that she achieved in the Stanford
law school class of 1952, as a law editor and high honor of the
Coif, are impressive in their own right and even more outstanding
to have been won by a'woman in 1952. Her varied career is
nothing short of renarkable considering the pervasive sex dis-
crimination against wouion in the lew profession during the
 1950's, '60's, and '70's. As Deputy County Attorney, a
civilian lawyer for the Army, a lawyer in private practice,
an Assistant Attorney General in Arizona, the Majority Leader of
the Arizona Senate (the first woman), as Superior Court Judge,
and as an Arizona Court of Appeals Judge, she has a wide range
of professional experience, unusual and nearly unobtainable for
women at that time. Her experience as a hoinemaker and community
volunteer, although not unique for a woman, will add a unique .
 and vitally needed perspective to the Supreme Court.

         Much has been made of the legislative record of Judge
O'Connor vis-a--vis social issues. Her record indicates a commit-
ment to equal justice under the law.

          Her sensitivity to women's rights, we believe, is
 particularly noteworthy and important. Surely it would be
 a mockery of justice if the first female appointment to the
 Supreme Court -- the first woman to have so fully benefited
 from the work of those who have fought so hard for women's

  87-101 O--81 27
                                      400

rights -- would be a woman who was not concerned with the
advancement of women. Our investigation of Judge Sandra Day
O'Connor's record clearly shows that she has demonstrated a
sensitivity to discrimination against women and that she has
worked to advance the legal status of wovten. Among her legis-
lative accomplishments, many concerned woTMen. For example,
she:

         -- introduced and accomplished major revisions in
              community property law, e.g., abolishing busband
              management of the marital property.

         -- introduced and accomplished "sex-neutralizing"
              code language; state equal pay act.

         -- introduced end accomplished cec-oal of protective
              labor law limiting hours wc.iion could work.

         -- voted for bill allowing distribution of family
              planning information to ninoLS without parents'
              approval (1.973, SB 1190).

         -- introduced and accomplished divorce law reform,
              allowing no-fault; making child's best interest
              controlling; establishing conciliation court.
              Laws 1973, Ch. 139.

         The National Organization for Women does not purport to
agree as an organization with all of Judge O'Connor's legal
and political views. For example, Arizona NOW opposed some of
the changes in divorce reform Judge O'Connor sponsored while in
the Arizona Senate. We believe, however, that discrimination
she suffered, her life experiences, and her understanding of
discrimination provide a necessary perspective to the Court. If
she did not have such an understanding, it would be a travesty.
No one would expect that the first Black appointment would be
insensitive to discrimination against Blacks. Nor should one
expect less of the first woman appointment.

         Judge O'Connor has also demonstrated her concern for women's
rights through support of professional associations working to
eliminate sex discrimination. She is or has been a charter member
of the National Association of Women Judges, the Arizona Women
                                      401

Lawyers, and Charter 100 (a h:-i\.irss cuvi ^ro'essionsl women's
network group) . She has been appointed ns o:ie of the few non-
ac^o^v.ics to serve on a state panel of the American Council on
Fdncaiion, which was organized to identify and promote top
wo'.vn to r'V'iiiJ:;i i,M ive positrons in colleges and universities.
And, as a victim of ci ipleyi c.it discrimination hcrsalf, she has
deplored such unjust pcactices. In a 1971 interview, she said:

         "A woman with four years of education earns typically
         $6,694 a year while her ina] e counterpart earns $11,795
         for the naioe job. The more education a woman has, the
         wider the gap between r,en and women's earning-3 for the
         same work."
         Judge O'Connor's appointment is <-x; re .oly important for
the advancement of all wo;?Gn and enshrines the principle that
there is no such thing as a "woman's place." The opponents of
Judge Sandra Day O'Connor's appointiront, we warn, are really
opposed to women's rights and the advancement of women. They
have been opposed to every major proposal that would allow for
significantly more opportunity for women. We are not surprised
by their opposition to Judge O'Connor. The opposition to Judge
Sandra Day O'Connor on the basis that she does not "respect
traditional family valuee" only exposes its own myopic views
of the family. We believe that many of those opposing her are
doing so precisely because she is a woman who did not know her
place. A female judge by definition is not a traditional woman.
The first woman appointed to the Supreme Court cannot be and is
not a traditional woman. In fact, she represents a wide depar-
ture from tradition. We believe, hov/ever, she also represents
the bast of American traditions which for too long has been
ignored when it comes to females: Equality and^ Justice for All.

        We urge your confirmation of a most remarkable woman whoso
record speaks for itself, and because her appointment i3 a long
overdue victory for women's rights. Let no one hero forget that
it has taken the combined efforts of thousands, beginning with
Myra Bradwell, and some 191 years, for a woman to be placed in
nomination for Associate Justice of the United Statoa Supreme
Court.

   The CHAIRMAN. Our next witness is Lynn Schafran, representing
the Federation of Women Lawyers' Judicial Screening Panel.

   Do you swear that the evidence you give in this hearing will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

   Ms. SCHAFRAN. I do.

   The CHAIRMAN. Have a seat, Ms. Schafran.
   I understand you are one of the most astute lawyers in New
York, so we will be glad to hear from you.

TESTIMONY OF LYNN HECHT SCHAFRAN, ESQ., NATIONAL DI-
  RECTOR, FEDERATION OF WOMEN LAWYERS' JUDICIAL
  SCREENING PANEL

   Ms. SCHAFRAN. That is very kind.
   I am a lawyer from New York, and I am here in my capacity as
national director of the Federation of Women Lawyers' Judicial
Screening Panel.
   The Federation was organized in 1979 to evaluate the demon-
strated commitment to equal justice under law of all individuals,
women and men, under consideration for appointment to the Fed-
eral bench. It is not our task to duplicate the efforts of the ABA's
Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Rather, we are con-
cerned that in addition to demonstrating ability, integrity, and
judicial temperament, a nominee also have given tangible evidence
of commitment to equal justice for those groups which historically
have been legally disadvantaged. To date, this organization has
provided the Senate Judiciary Committee with evaluations for
more than 120 judicial nominees.
   In evaluating Judge O'Connor, we were particularly impressed
with her record as a legislator. Her practice on the bench was such
that she was not dealing with civil rights and other issues which
are usually taken to indicate a judge's position on equal justice
matters. We note that as a legislator she took a strong leadership
position in areas that addressed the questions of inequity under the
law for women, minorities, the disabled, and the poor.
  With respect to women's rights, she revised community property
laws, labor laws, and many other statutes which were clearly dis-
criminatory. She also took the leadership role in completely revis-
ing the Arizona mental health statutes to provide protection for
individuals undergoing both voluntary and involuntary treatment
for mental disorders, to protect their civil rights, and to bar dis-
crimination against them in housing and employment. Because of
her efforts, the Arizona mental health law is now looked on as a
leading model for State commitment codes.
  Judge O'Connor's concern for the problems of minorities and the
poor were further demonstrated by her support for bilingual educa-
tion and workers' compensation for migrant farm workers, a State
supplement to Federal SSI, and the establishment of medicaid in
Arizona. This is certainly an outstanding legislative record demon-
strating commitment to equal justice.
  We would like to note one area of strong concern to us, and that
is the area that was addressed extensively by Senator Metzenbaum
in the previous 2 days of hearings. It concerns the views expressed
by Judge O'Connor in her now infamous and endlessly discussed
                                                  403

Law Review article pertaining to the litigation in Federal courts of
civil rights suits brought against State officials under 42 U.S.C.
1983.

  As you have all heard by now, Judge O'Connor has suggested
that Congress cut back on this kind of litigation in the Federal
courts by limiting or disallowing recovery of attorneys' fees. What
has not received as much attention is the fact that she believes
that there should be a requirement of exhaustion of State remedies
as a prerequisite to bringing a Federal action under section 1983.

  I would remind this committee that in its own report on the Civil
Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards Act in 1976, as well as in the report
of the House Judiciary Committee, there was a great stress on the
fact that the vast majority of victims of civil rights violations
cannot afford legal counsel, and that absent attorneys' fees these
civil rights would become, I quote, "hollow pronouncements."

  What Judge O'Connor proposes is that we have a massive shift of
section 1983 litigation into the State courts by making it possible to
recover attorneys' fees only in State courts. I would suggest, with-
out wishing to cast any aspersions on the very many fine State
court judges in this country, that this ignores litigants historically
valid reluctance to pursue their remedies in State courts, and that
it ignores completely the history of the enactment of section 1983
which shows a clear policy preference for Federal enforcement of
federally guaranteed rights.

  Now this is an area that it is up to Congress to act in and,
although I know that Congress will take Judge O'Connor's words
and her suggestions very seriously, we are perhaps even more
concerned with the question of exhaustion because as a Supreme
Court Justice, if confirmed, she will have an opportunity to speak
on exhaustion.

   Exhaustion is a well-chosen word. If you have to work your way
through State administrative and State court processes before you
can get to the Federal courts, you will be exhausted. Requiring
exhaustion will dissuade individuals from seeking the relief that
section 1983 has promised.

   However, we recognize that Judge O'Connor made these sugges-
tions and wrote this article from the perspective of an extremely
able and independent State court judge. We trust that as a Su-
preme Court Justice with a national perspective, she will realize
that regrettably not all State court judges are as capable and
independent as she, and that vindication of constitutional rights
requires that section 1983 plaintiffs be able to choose their own
forums and proceed to a swift resolution of their claims.

   Despite this concern, I would reiterate that the Federation of
Women Lawyers' Judicial Screening Panel believes that Judge
O'Connor's legislative record and organizational activities clearly
demonstrate her commitment to equal justice and her awareness of
many of the problems confronting those segments of our society for
whom the struggle for equal justice has been most difficult. These
are attributes we seek in every judge but they are essential in a
Justice of the Supreme Court, to whom we look for the ultimate
protection and vindication of our constitutional rights.

   The Federation of Women Lawyers' Judicial Screening Panel
supports the confirmation of Judge O'Connor, and we trust that
                                             404

she will continue to demonstrate this commitment and awareness
during what we expect will be many long years of distinguished
service as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  Senator Thurmond, I thank you, and I would ask that the full
text of my statement be inserted in the record.

  The CHAIRMAN. We want to thank you, Ms. Schafran, for your
appearance here and the testimony you have given on this occa-
sion.

TESTIMONY OF LYNN HECHT SCHAFRAN, ESQ., NATIONAL DIRECTOR OF THE
FEDERATION OF WOMEN LAWYERS' JUDICIAL SCREENING PANEL, AT THE
CONFIRMATION HEARING OF SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE

                             OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
        My name is Lynn Hecht Schafran. I am an attorney and National
Director of the Federation of Women Lawyers' Judicial Screening
Panel. The Federation was organized in 1979 to evaluate the
demonstrated commitment to equal justice under law of individuals
under consideration for appointment to the federal bench. The
Federation does not seek to duplicate the efforts of the ABA
Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary which evaluates
nominees' legal skills and temperament. Rather, we are concerned
that in addition to demonstrating ability, integrity and judicial
temperament, a nominee must also have demonstrated commitment to
equal justice under law for those groups which have historically
been legally disadvantaged. To date the Federation has conducted
detailed investigations of, and has provided evaluations to this
Committee for, more than one hundred and twenty judicial nominees.

         It is a particular pleasure to participate in these historic
confirmation hearings for the first woman nominated to become a'
Justice of the United States Supreme Court. As an organization
concerned with equal justice, we are acutely aware that women are
 among those for whom equal justice has often been most elusive.
Nothing could better illustrate that sad reality than the fact
 that it was just over one hundred years ago that the Court to\
 which Judge O'Connor has been nominated denied a woman a license
 to practice law solely because of her sex , and that, if confirmed,
 Judge O'Connor will be the first woman to sit on the Supreme Court
 in its 191 year history.

          Even as we celebrate the historic nature of these hearings,
 we are aware that women still constitute less than seven per cent
 of the federal judiciary, and that no woman other than Judge
 O'Connor has been nominated to the federal bench during the nine
 months the current administration has been in office. We look
  forward to the day when the appointment of women and minorities
  to the bench will be commonplace, reflecting a true merit selection
 process by which all those who are qualified are considered, not
                                     406

just those who are qualified and are also white men.
        The United States Supreme Court is our court of last resort,

empowered to provide the ultimate interpretation of federal
statutes and constitutional rights, and to nullify state and
federal statutes which violate those rights. "Equal Justice
Under Law" is the credo inscribed on the lintel above its entrance.
It is thus fitting that we scrutinize with particular care the
adherence to that credo of a nominee to the high court. To profess
a commitment to equal justice is easy. But no one can predict with
certainty what a judge will do on the bench, especially with life-
time tenure and under the unique circumstances of the Supreme
Court. To attempt to ascertain beforehand, therefore, whether a
nominee is indeed committed to equal justice under law, we are
obliged to examine his or her record for tangible evidence of
sensitivity to those groups for which equal justice has been a
scarce commodity-women, minorities, the handicapped and the poor-
to determine whether the nominee in his or her professional or
personal life has taken concrete action, in a legal setting or
elsewhere, to advance the status of these groups.

        Since 1975, Judge O'Connor has been both a trial and appellate
level judge. She is known for her absolute impartiality and
meticulous devotion to the law. Because the practice before
Judge O'Connor was such that she has not established a record
which one1 can examine in cases respecting civil rights, employment
discrimination and other areas of the law which are frequently
cited as revealing a judge's commitment to equal justice, the
Federation of Women Lawyers' Judicial Screening Panel has directed
its inquiry primarily to an examination of Judge O'Connor's life
experience, her record as a state legislator and the organizations
in which she is involved. Although our inquiry has revealed some
areas of concern, on the whole it reveals considerable evidence
that in both her professional and personal life Judge O'Connor
has demonstrated a sensitivity to the pervasive inequities in our
society and a commitment to equal justice under law.

        As a state senator from 1969 to 1973 and senate majority
                                      407

leader from 1973 to 1974, Judge O'Connor demonstrated this sen-
sitivity and commitment by exerting leadership to address many of the
problems confronting women, minorities, the disabled and the poor.
With respect to women's equality under law. Judge O'Connor accom-
plished major revisions in the Arizona community property law ,
which had placed women at a great disadvantage. Prior to these
revisions, women had no management rights to the assets of the
marriage. Husbands had sole authority to manage the community's
property, to bind the community through contracts for credit, etc.
and to sell the community's personal property. Judge O'Connor
was also responsible for revising discriminatory language in
state statutues which, in their perpetuation of stereotyped views
of women and the family, worked substantive harm to women - She
initiated repeal of so-called "protective" labor laws which, by
limiting women to an eight hour work day also limited their oppor-
tunities for employment in high paying jobs and management, and
supported full constitutional equality for women under the proposed
 federal Equal Rights Amendment.

         While a senator, Judge O'Connor was acutely aware of employ-
ment discrimination against Arizona women. In a 1971 interview
with Phoenix magazine she stated, "A woman with four years of
college earns typically $6,694 a year while her male counterpart
earns $11,795 for the same job. The more education a woman has,
 the wider gap between men's and women's earnings for the same work."
Judge O'Connor's ongoing cormrn with career opportunities for women
and the need for women to join together to seek equality and appro-
priate recognition for their talents is demonstrated by her par-
 ticipation in the National Association of Women Judges and Arizona
Women Lawyers, and her service on the Arizona panel of the American
Council of Education's program to enhance opportunities for women
college administrators.

         Judge O'Connor's sensitivity to the real world experiences
 of women and equal justice issues are perhaps traceable to her
 personal experience with discrimination. After graduating from
                                     408

Stanford Law School in 1952 near the top of her class and with
every honor, Judge O'Connor was refused employment as an attorney
by law firms in Los Angeles and San Francisco solely because of
her sex. One firm, ironically that of Attorney General William
French Smith,offered her a job as a legal secretary.

        As we have noted. Judge O'Connor's demonstrated commitment
to equal justice under law has not been limited to the rights of
women. One of her major undertakings as a senator was a sweeping
reform of the Arizona mental health statutes respecting individuals

                                                                                                                       5
undergoing voluntary and involuntary treatment for mental disorders.
Spurred by a 1971 volume of the Arizona Law Review devoted to a
year long study of Arizona's commitment laws and her experiences
with the state hospital system while an assistant attorney general.
Judge O'Connor spearheaded the development and enactment of legis-
lation which tightened the substantive requirements for commitment
and required that mental patients be made aware of their rights,
be reexamined every ninety days and have an independent evaluator
present at their hearings. Other provisions of this lengthy
statute protect the civil rights of individuals undergoing mental
treatment and bar discrimination in housing and employment against
a person who is being or has been treated for a mental disorder.
The Arizona mental health law is now looked on as a leading model
for state commitment codes.

         Judge O'Connor's concern for the problems of minorities and
 the poor are demonstrated by her support for bilingual education
 and workers' compensation for migrant farm workers, her sponsor-
 ship and enactment of a state supplement to federal Supplemental
 Security Income payments and her efforts to establish a Medicaid
 program in Arizona.

         In the face of this substantial evidence of concern for equal
 justice issues, we are troubled that through her participation
 as a family member, Judge O'Connor supports two Arizona private
 clubs that discriminate against women. The Paradise Valley
 Country Club does not permit women to hold membership in their
 own right or to retain their husbands' memberships after the
                                     409

death or divorce of that spouse. Both the Paradise Valley and
Arizona Clubs have restaurants segregated for men only.

        Both clubs are practicing a form of invidious discrimination
which is highly disadvantageous to women in their professional
advancement and which, if practiced against a religious or minority
group, would be immediately condemned. Recognizing the equal
justice issues raised by these kinds of clubs, the United States
Judicial Conference has endorsed the principle "that it is in-
appropriate for a judge to hold membership in any organization
which practices invidious discrimination."'' We assume that as a
member of the Supreme Court Judge O'Connor will adhere to this
standard and withdraw from participation in these clubs until they
discontinue their discriminatory practices.

         The Federation of Women Lawyers' Judicial Screening Panel is
also concerned about the implications for equal justice of the
positions advocated by Judge O'Connor in her recent article, "Trends
in the Relationship Between the Federal and State Courts from the
Perspective of a State Court Judge," respecting civil rights

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Q

challenges to the acts of state officials pursuant to 42 USC §1983.
Judge O'Connor suggests that Congress cut back on section 1983
litigation in federal courts "by limiting or disallowing recovery

                                                                  Q

of attorneys' fees" and urges "a requirement of exhaustion of
state remedies as a prerequisite to brinaing a federal action

                                   10
under section 1983."

         The Reports from the Senate and House Judiciary Committees
on the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 stress that
 "a vast majority of the victims of civil rights violations cannot
afford legal counsel," and that absent attorney's fees awards
 "our civil rights laws [will] become mere hollow pronouncements
which the average citizen cannot afford to enforce..."" Curtailing
these awards in federal courts would deny equal access to justice
 to section 1983 litigants because rich plaintiffs will have their
choice of forums while poor plaintiffs will be forced to litigate
 in state courts or not at all.
                                     410

        Suggesting a massive shift of section 1983 litigation into
state courts ignores litigants' historically valid reluctance
to pursue their remedies in courts established, staffed, operated
and funded by the state whose officials' acts are being challenged.
Moreover, the history behind the enactment of section 1983 reveals
a policy preference for federal enforcement of federally guaranteed
rights. Shifting section 1983 cases into state forums would deny
litigants the consistency of interpretation that follows from
reliance on nationwide precedents and serves as a disincentive
to protracted and unrealistic litigation.

        With respect to exhuastion, requiring a section 1983 plaintiff
seeking vindication of fundamental constitutional rights to work
her way through a state administrative process and then through a
state court proceeding before allowing her into federal court is
a hideous burden. Forced subjection of such litigants to the
time consuming, often ineffective and inadequate procedures afforded
by varying jurisdictions can only dissuade them from seeking the
relief section 1983 promised. It is a truism that justice delayed
is justice denied.

        We recognize that Judge O'Connor made these suggestions from
the perspective of an extremely able and independent state court
judge. We trust that as a Supreme Court Justice with a national
perspective, she will realize that not all state court judges are
as capable as she, and that vindication of constitutional rights
requires that section 1983 plaintiffs be able to choose their
own forums and proceed to a swift resolution of their claims.

        Despite the concerns raised in this testimony, the Federation
of Women Lawyers' Judicial Screening Panel believes that Judge
O'Connor's legislative record and organizational activities
clearly demonstrate her commitment to equal justice and her aware-
ness of many" of"the problems confronting those segments of our society
for whom the struggle for equal justice has been most difficult.
These are attributes we seek in every judge, but they are essential
in a Justice of the Supreme Court to whom we look for the ultimate
protection and vindication of our constitutional rights. We trust
                                      411

 that Judge O'Connor will continue to demonstrate this commitment

 and awareness during what we expect will be many long years of

 service as an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

    TESTIMONY OF MS. RITA WARREN OF WASHINGTON, D.C.
  Ms. WARREN. Senator, I want to thank you very much--I will not
even try to take the 5 minutes--for having me testify. I do fully
support the appointment of the Justice for the Supreme Court,
Mrs. O'Connor.
  I do share with Senator Metzenbaum the feeling that all of the
groups that have been here speaking in regard to the unborn child
are very serious, but I am more concerned about the child that is
here already, and that is starving to death. Living under the Nazi
regime in Italy, I know the suffering of hunger, and I would rather
die than see a child suffering of hunger. We have many children
                                         412

that are starving to death; we have retarded children neglected;
and all these groups are so concerned about the unborn.

  I do not support the abortion but I do not feel that we have any
right to force upon other people, on their moral life, how to live. If
the church leaders and if many of the other community organiza-
tions would do their job properly to encourage morality, we would
not have so much problem with abortion.

  Therefore, I really feel it is wonderful to have a woman in the
Supreme Court. I hope that I can live to see the day when we can
see a woman in the White House also because, as you know, we
women do keep a house clean very well, and I am sure we could
keep the White House really sparkling white, in and out. I hope
that someday we can see that too.

  I hope that this committee will give Mrs. O'Connor the chance to
become a Justice of the Supreme Court because in our democratic
system that I love so much, everyone has a right to become and to
serve publicly in this country, regardless of whether it is a Justice
of the Supreme Court or President of the United States.

  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you for your appearance.
  Judge O'Connor has responded to some questions by Senator
Levin, and if there is no objection we will place those in the record.
  This completes the nomination hearings on Sandra O'Connor.
We have tried to give an opportunity to the people who favored her
and the people who opposed her. I wish to express my appreciation
to all the witnesses who came and testified, pro or con. I wish to
thank the press for their attendance, and I wish to express my
appreciation to those in the audience for the fine attention that
they gave to the hearing.
  The committee now stands adjourned.

 Honorable Carl Levin
 United States Senate
 Washington, D.C. 20510

 Dear Senator Levin:

          I have received from your office the following
 question: "During your private meetings with public
 officials since your appointment, did you make any state-
 ments relative to your position on the substantive issues
 which may come before the Court? If so, please describe
 those statements."

          Since my nomination I have not made any statements
 concerning my position on substantive issues which may
 come before the Court, either in private meetings with
 public officials or public testimony. Nor did I do so
 during the selection process leading up to the nomination.

          I believe judges must decide legal issues within the
 judicial process, constrained by the oath of office, presented
 with a particular case or controversy, and aided by briefs,
 arguments, and consultation with other members of the panel.
 I also believe it would be quite improper for a nominee to
 take a position on an issue which may come before the Court
 in order to obtain favorable consideration of the nomination.

          Thank you for the opportunity to set forth ray views in
 response to your question.

                                                              Sincerely,

                                                     Sandra D. O'Connor

                       THE CASE AGAINST WOMEN IN CERTAIN OCCUPATIONS

              (By Willel W. G. Reitzer, private citizen, Washington, D.C.)
  A century ago, Justice Joseph Bradley of the U.S. Supreme Court wrote in a
decision upholding the right of a State to deny a woman a license to practice law:
"The harmony, not to say identity, of interests and views which belong or should
belong, to the family institution is repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a
distinct and independent career from that of her husband" (Bradwell v. State, 1872).
  This is not a wild harebrained notion such as sometimes slips into our highest
court's opinions. Rather it was a fundamental precept firmly fixed in the common
law--that respectable system of jurisprudence which underlies our national founda-
tion.
  But it did not originate there. Interestingly, those who rail against this precept do
not seem to know where it did originate. Some ascribe it to romantic paternalism;
others to a male conspiracy to perpetuate male ascendancy. The fact is, it goes clear
back to Creation.
  Holy Writ informs us that after God created a man, and then made a woman "out
o f him and "for" him, He said: "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh" (Genesis 2:24).
One flesh means one entity: one mind, one interest, one aspiration. Jesus Christ
Himself upheld the authenticity of this precept--as well as the historicity of this
event (Matthew 19:4,5).
  No wonder Justice Bradley went on to say: "So firmly fixed was this sentiment in
the founders of the common law that it became a maxim . . . that a woman had no
legal existence separate from her husband, who was regarded as her head and
representative in the social state; and notwithstanding some recent modifications of
this civil status, many of the special rules of law flowing from and dependent upon
this cardinal principle still exist in full force in most states" (e.s.). Hence women
had no separate right to make contracts, to vote, to hold public office, to enter the
priesthood and certain other occupations.
  What happened in 100 years to bring about so great an erosion? It is the Garden
of Eden syndrome all over again. Believing the forbidden fruit to more fulfilling, the
woman reached out for it and ate. And she offered it to the man, and he ate also. It

keeps recurring in history. In the 8th century B.C., prophet Isaiah lamented a
national spiritual decline in ancient Israel: "As for my people, children are their
oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause
thee to err. . . ." (Isa. 3:12).

  Here is grievous error indeed: direct tampering with the Creator's design for His
beloved creatures, implying He was either inept or deliberately deprivative. Restruc-
turing it disparages His wisdom and justice and goodness.

  And for what? For blanket equality of roles for men and woman. Why is this so
superior? This does not exist even among the angels--nor among the three Persons
of the blessed Trinity. For it is not a matter of ability or opportunity, but of
organization. Every creature has its God-given role. Therefore each has its particu-
lar endowments. The male-female distinction is so basic to planet earth it pervades
also the animal, fish, and fowl realm. It serves to reflect a subordination principle
that also pervades the supernatural realm, and is not only for instruction. It also
facilitates efficient human function, as well as the acquisition of virtue--particular-
ly the greatest of them: not equality, but love (which is much more noble and
meaningful between superiors/subordinates than between equals). In God's plan the
basic social unit is the family, not the individual or the state. So fathers are to be
breadwinners and mothers--and grandmothers--homemakers (1 Tim.3:14; Tit. 2:8-
5). The percept of authority in the male perforce is exclusive; women are not even to
put themselves into positions of teaching or commanding men outside the home (1
Tim.2:12-15). Thus it was wise of our juridical forefathers to incorporate this design
into law, thereby affording the marriage institution needed protection against temp-
tations to undermine it.

  Equality is not proving itself superior in practice. On the contrary. As more
women go into more occupations, divorce rates keep climbing, male unemployment
and instability keep increasing. The hard fact is: Mrs. O'Connor is putting another
man out of work. She is setting and example and precedent that will put other men
out of work. Women in certain occupations put greater strain on men: pyschological-
ly, sexually, in other ways. All this in turn puts a greater strain on family members,
on the family as an institution, and on society as a whole. The result is the social
fabric keeps developing new tears--and the innocent in some measure having to
suffer adversity along with the guilty.

  What then is the bottom line? It is the same the Apostle Paul made on Mars' Hill
in Athens when he confuted the sophistry of the Greek philosphers who had
perverted basic truths that regulated paramount human conduct (Acts 17:30,31):
Cease and desist, for there is a Judgment Day coming when everyone will have to
give an account of what he has done here on earth whether it be good or evil.
