 ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

               OF THE UNITED STATES

                          MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1987

                                                                            U.S. SENATE,
                                                      COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                               Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m., in room SR-
325, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,
chairman of the committee, presiding.
  Also present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley, Specter, and Hum-
phrey.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge Kennedy, welcome. We are delighted that
you are here and are anxious to get this hearing under way.
  I would like to at the outset indicate how we are going to pro-
ceed. It has been the custom of the committee to not have a singu-
lar custom; that is, that ofttimes we have started with opening
statements of Senators and then had those who were going to in-
troduce the nominee introduce, and then move to the nominee. But
in the interest of accommodating our colleagues, Senator Wilson
and our colleagues from the House, what I would like to suggest we
do before I make an opening statement is: I would ask Senator
Wilson and my House colleagues if they would make opening state-
ments. Then we will allow them to sit and listen to all of us, if they
wish, for the next 1Vz hours. Or if they have other business, we un-
derstand. Then I will make an opening statement, and all of us will
endeavor to keep our statements relatively short. Then we will go
to you, Judge; you will be sworn, go to you for an opening state-
ment. If we are lucky, we will be able to do most of that before we
break for lunch.
  We are now planning on breaking from roughly 12 until 1, and I
do not expect to go beyond 6 o'clock this evening. We will resume
again tomorrow at 10 o'clock.
  I want the record to show--I am told this is being televised--that
all three of your children, those of whom are missing finals today,
are in attendance. They have good reason not to be at their finals.
I hope they are listening in California.
  With that, let me yield, if my ranking member and colleague,
Senator Thurmond, agrees, to Senator Wilson for an opening state-
ment, and then move to our House colleagues.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I think that is fine to hear
these people so they can be released if they do not care to stay.

                                                         (1)
Now, if they want to stay around and gain some wisdom from the
Senators, that will be fine, too.

  Thank you very much.
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, before you start, could I just note
one thing, because a number of us are going to be doing this? So I
will not have to be answering all kinds of phone calls from my
office, a lot of us are on various committees of conference, and I
think different ones will be going in and out during this hearing. I
thought I would note that so that Judge Kennedy does not think
that we suddenly left in dismay.

  The CHAIRMAN. The Judge has some extensive experience in
California, in the California legislature, and I know he knows how
legislative bodies work. That is a good point to make. I know some
of my Republican and Democratic colleagues will have to be absent
at part of the hearing throughout. I know Senator Metzenbaum
has business he has to attend to this afternoon. I know that you
and many others are on a conference.

  So, Judge, if, in fact, Senators are moving in and out, it is not
out of lack of interest. It is additional responsibilities in the Senate
that require them to do so.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, we will be glad to excuse any
of them, of course, just so they are here when the time comes to
vote for Judge Kennedy. That is all that counts.

  The CHAIRMAN. AS usual, my colleague from South Carolina
beats around the bush a lot.

  Let me yield now to our colleague from California, Senator
Wilson. Welcome, Senator.

 STATEMENT OF HON. PETE WILSON, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE
                            STATE OF CALIFORNIA

  Senator WILSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I will
avail myself of the opportunity to drink deep from the wisdom. I do
have some time this morning, and I look forward to it.

  I am particularly pleased--in fact, I feel privileged--to be able to
introduce a long-time friend, but much more importantly an excep-
tional judge, one who gives promise of giving truly distinguished
service on the Supreme Court of the United States. The committee
is in possession of his background, his record, which is an extraor-
dinary one. You know that he was a brilliant student, both as an
undergraduate at Stanford, graduating Phi Beta Kappa, having
completed all of the work required for his graduation by the end of
his junior year so that he took his senior year at the London School
of Economics. You know that he was a cum laude graduate of the
Harvard Law School; that he was born and raised in Sacramento
and, after his father's death, returned, having served 2 years with
one of the best known, most prestigious San Francisco firms, to
take over his father's practice in Sacramento. I will not dwell at
length on that.

  I was privileged to first know Tony Kennedy some 20 years ago
when we were both young men--still, I hope, young at heart. He
was a young lawyer practicing in Sacramento. I was a young
member of the State legislature. A small part of his practice con-
sisted of legislative advocacy, and it was in that role that I first
                                                    3

knew him. He was a very different kind of legislative advocate. He
came to my office, and without my soliciting him to do so, he in-
formed me not only who was for the legislation that he was propos-
ing, but who was opposed to it and why in both cases. He anticipat-
ed my questions. He did not offer to buy me a drink. He did not
offer to take me to dinner. He was a very good legislative advocate
and, I think, an effective one, though I have read that it was not
particularly a part of his practice that he enjoyed. But for those of
us who were exposed to him, we quickly learned that this was a
young man who obviously knew what it was that he was talking
about, who disclosed everything, and who concealed nothing.

  Judge Kennedy's excellent reputation as a lawyer became so well
known in 1975 President Ford named him to the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Ninth Circuit. He was only 38 years old, one of the
youngest lawyers ever honored by a Presidential appointment to
the nation's second highest court. It was as a member of the ninth
circuit that Judge Kennedy has authored hundreds of opinions, ma-
jority opinions, as well as some very important dissents, one of
which I will dwell upon in a moment.

  He has, through all the years of maintaining a very heavy judi-
cial docket, found time to serve on a number of administrative
panels for the improvement of the functioning of the federal judici-
ary, as well as upon the Committee on Pacific Ocean Territories.
He has been a director of the Federal Judicial Center and a Na-
tional Correspondent for Crime Prevention and Control with the
United Nations.

  Beyond his work on the bench, Judge Kennedy's dedication to
the law has inspired him to teach at the McGeorge School of Law
of the University of the Pacific, where he has been a distinguished
professor since 1965.

   It would be a gross understatement to say that Judge Kennedy
has been well received by his students. Not only have they found
him to be, in the words of one former student, "an excellent teach-
er" who commands a "brilliant intellect," but they also know him
to be a very creative instructor. He reportedly has taken to con-
ducting a lecture on the Constitutional Convention having assumed
the persona of James Madison--complete with period garb.

   What I was looking for a moment ago was the exact quote of one
of his students, a Mr. Norm Scott, and I will have to paraphrase
Mr. Scott. He said that it was clear that Judge Kennedy enjoyed
the interchange, the interaction with his students, enjoyed teach-
ing them to think. It was also true that, while he told them that
they should respect the pronouncements of the Supreme Court,
they should not accept them as gospel.

   I think that it is clear from those who have known Judge Kenne-
dy in one persona or another--whether as teacher or as a judge
during his 12 years on the Court of Appeals--that he has demon-
strated the highest intellect, a truly judicial temperament, great
compassion.

   I think, too, that it is clear from those that have known him,
either as teacher or judge, that he has exhibited, in the courtroom
as well as in the classroom, the belief that the Founding Fathers
exercised the greatest care that the national government, and espe-
cially our federal courts, should play a properly limited role in the
lives of our citizens. We should expect no less care of any candidate
for our nation's highest court, and in Judge Kennedy you will find
that expectation fully met.

   When a judicial candidate's qualifications are considered, one
ever-present question is whether he or she possesses compassion.
But too often, the test of compassion is focused too heavily on the
candidate's concern for the accused, with little or no regard for so-
ciety and little or no regard for the victim.

  Justice does not simply demand protection of the rights of the ac-
cused; it demands as well the protection of the rights of those
harmed. Until a verdict has been returned, the accused in a crimi-
nal case obviously is just that--the accused. But whether the ac-
cused being tried is ultimately adjudged guilty or innocent, we
cannot ignore the fact that an innocent victim has been harmed:
either deprived of property or, in the most egregious circumstance,
forced to suffer the violence of rape or robbery or other assault, or
even death.

  Unfortunately, in the effort to respond to some past abuses of
those accused by our criminal justice system, we have almost lost
sight of the need to safeguard the rights of victims. Judge Kennedy
has never lost sight of the need for our criminal justice system to
seek justice for all those affected by crime, as he made clear in a
speech delivered earlier this year in New Zealand. As he stated
forthrightly, "[A] decent and compassionate society should recog-
nize the plight of its victims."

  In fleshing out this basic truth, Judge Kennedy went on to say
that, "An essential purpose of the criminal justice system is to pro-
vide a catharsis by which a community expresses its collective out-
rage at the transgression of the criminal."

  Clearly, that is what law-makers do in enacting criminal codes.
We proscribe antisocial conduct and prescribe a penalty for the
commission of a prohibited act; and we entrust the application of
the laws to judges. That is why the role of judges is so important.
As Judge Kennedy noted in his speech, "It does not do to deny the
same catharsis to the member of the community most affected by
the crime. A victim's dissatisfaction with the criminal justice
system, therefore, represents a failure of the system to achieve one
of the goals it sets for itself."

  This failure which Judge Kennedy has noted occurs most often
at retail, in the courts, when the application of the law achieves
not justice, or the legislative intent of deterrence and catharsis, but
frustration and distrust in the victim and in the public.

  It is little wonder that victims often fail to report crimes, Judge
Kennedy notes, for the criminal justice system's failure to care
about victims is too well known and too often inspires in the public
doubt that true justice will be done. Ultimately, victims and wit-
nesses become indifferent to the need of the criminal justice system
for their cooperation in the belief that the system has become indif-
ferent to them.

  Judge Kennedy's concern is appropriate not only for those of us
entrusted with making the law, but also for judges who apply it.
Certainly, it is appropriate for those whose duty it is to test it
against the Constitution.
  If the proper protections of the Constitution are stretched to the
point where the criminal law provides inadequate and uncertain
protection to the public, if our criminal justice system is perceived
to be unjust, the demoralizing effects may well breed distrust, dis-
respect for the legal process, and a desperate resort to vigilante ac-
tions. The Bernhard Goetz case comes to mind.

  Broadly stated, our exclusionary rule requires that if the consta-
ble blunders, the criminal goes free. The sad fact is that too often
when the constable has made no willful blunder, the criminal has
still gone free, even where evidence of guilt was entirely reliable.

  And, again, the result in such cases has been that in seeking to
curb and penalize unlawful police practices, our criminal justice
system, through largely court-made law, has released the clearly
guilty, to the outrage of the victim and to the peril of the public.
This situation has been one that cries out for judicial application of
a rule of reason to limit abuses.

  Enter now Judge Kennedy--and reasonable balance.
  In an exceptional dissenting opinion in the case of United States
v. Leon, Judge Kennedy argued that a truly good-faith mistake by
police should not lead to a criminal's release. What makes the
opinion exceptional is that its persuasiveness ultimately led to its
adoption by the Supreme Court.
  It is this strict approach to the application of the fourth amend-
ment that is necessary to restore effectiveness, fairness, and true
compassion to our criminal justice system.
  There are many issues that will be raised by the members of this
committee during these confirmation hearings, drawing deep from
the well of American law. But as the committee carries out its con-
stitutional responsibilities, it will look, I am sure, to see whether or
not Judge Kennedy's service on the Supreme Court will serve the
interests of justice--which, in my judgment, it surely will--but as
the committee seeks justice, it should also do justice both to the
nominee and to the confirmation process.

  At the President's announcement of his nomination, Judge Ken-
nedy told reporters that this committee and the entire Senate have
a duty to give the most careful scrutiny to his candidacy, and that
he welcome such scrutiny. Mr. Chairman, I take pride in joining
him in inviting that scrutiny.

  Tony Kennedy's record as a lawyer, as a judge, as a teacher, as a
human being, is an open book, and it is a story of an individual
who has charted a judicial course of such distinction and sound-
ness, of such consistency and reliability, that there should be little
question of his exceptional qualifications to serve on the Court--as,
indeed, the American Bar Association has found in giving him its
highest rating. Therefore, I urge the committee to complete its
work with both deliberation and alacrity, so that the Senate may
consider Judge Kennedy's nomination at the start of the new year.
I know that is the Chairman's intention. I congratulate him upon
his having moved expeditiously to convene these hearings as early
as he has.

   Mr. Chairman, I wi1! simply say that I think when you have com-
pleted your deliberations, and when the Senate has voted, we will
have given the Supreme Court a distinguished new member, one
who will reflect credit upon us and upon the President in having
                                                    6

made this nomination. More importantly, he will be a valuable ad-
dition. He has long years of service to give. His, I think, will be a
truly extraordinary career, as it has been already.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                          STATEMENT OF SENATOR PETE WILSON
                                           OF CALIFORNIA

                      BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY
                   UNITED STATES SENATE -- DECEMBER 14, 1987

                          NOMINATION OF ANTHONY M. KENNEDY
                TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

       Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am extremely
pleased to appear here today to introduce Judge Anthony M.
Kennedy, who has been nominated by the President to serve as
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

       My state of California has been blessed with an abundance
of legal talent, and the public has been well served by the
willingness of the very best to serve there as judges.

      Among the very distinguished judges at all levels of the
judiciary in California, it has been known far and wide for
many, many years that there is no more distinguished and
talented member of this varied fraternity than Judge Anthony
Kennedy.

       Anthony Kennedy was born in Sacramento, California, on July
23, 1936. The son of a noted lawyer in the state capital, he
grew up in Sacramento and then attended Stanford University.

      At Stanford, Judge Kennedy was an excellent student. Not
only did he graduate "with great distinction" in 1958, he was
also elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Sigma Alpha, the
national political science honor fraternity.

       During his senior year at Stanford, Judge Kennedy already
had fulfilled the principal requirements for graduation and
attended the London School of Economics and Political Science
at the University of London.

       Deciding to follow his father into a career as a lawyer,
Judge Kennedy attended Harvard Law School, where during his
final year he served as a member of the Board of Advisors of
the law faculty. He received his law degree, cum laude, in
1961.

      Judge Kennedy began his legal career at the noted San
Francisco law firm of Thelen, Marrin, Johnson & Bridges. In
1963, upon his father's death, Judge Kennedy returned to
Sacramento to assume his father's business law practice. Four
years later, he formed a partnership, Evans, Jackson &
Kennedy,
                                              Page 2

       Judge Kennedy's Sacramento law practice was broad in
scope. During his years as a solo practitioner, he handled
twenty to thirty litigation matters per year, including
criminal and probate cases. After forming his partnership in
1967, Judge Kennedy's practice for major clients was extensive,
including corporate, tax, administrative, real estate, and
environmental law, as well as legislation, estate planning and
probate, and international legal transactions.

      Judge Kennedy's excellent reputation attracted the
attention of President Ford, who named him in 1975 to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. At the
age of 38, Judge Kennedy was one of the youngest lawyers ever
honored by a presidential appointment to the Nation's second
highest court.

      As a member of the Ninth Circuit Court, Judge Kennedy has
authored more than 300 majority opinions, as well as 100
concurring and dissenting opinions.

      While maintaining a full judicial docket, Judge Kennedy has
also served on a number of administrative panels of the federal
judiciary, including the Judicial Conference's Advisory
Committee on Codes of Conduct and its Committee on Pacific
Ocean Territories. He is also a director of the Federal
Judicial Center and a National Correspondent for Crime
Prevention and Control with the United Natxons.

      Beyond his work on the bench, Judge Kennedy's dedication to
the law has inspired him to teach at the McGeorge School of Law
of the University of the Pacific, where he has been a professor
since 1965. He has been a distinguished teacher of the law.

       It would be a gross understatement to say that Judge
Kennedy has been well received by his students. Not only have
they found him to be, in the words of one former student, "an
excellent teacher" who commands a "brilliant intellect", they
also know him to be a creative instructor. He reportedly has
taken to conducting a lecture on the Constitutional Convention
having assumed the persona of James Madison -- complete with
period garb.

       I have been privileged to know Tony Kennedy for more than
20 years, since we first met in Sacramento -- where, as I
noted, he was born and raised, and where I had come to begin my
political career in the state Assembly.

      During his 12 years on the Court of Appeals, and indeed
during his entire life, Tony Kennedy has shown himself to
possess the highest intellect, temperament, and compassion.
                                              Page 3

      Furthermore, as the Committee considers Judge Kennedy's
nomination to serve on the Supreme Court, your review of his
service on the Court of Appeals will leave no doubt that he
subscribes to the conservative principles which the framers of
our Constitution adopted 200 years ago.

      He knows that our Pounding Fathers exercised great care
that the national government, and especially our federal
courts, should play a properly limited role in the lives of our
citizens. We should expect no less care of any candidate for
our Nation's highest court, and in Judge Kennedy you will find
that expectation fully met.

      When a judicial candidate's qualifications are considered,
one everpresent question is whether he or she possesses
compassion. But too often the test of compassion has focused
too heavily on the candidate's concern for the accused, with
little or no regard for society, and with little or no regard
for the victim.

       Justice does not simply demand protection of the rights of
the accused. Justice also demands the protection of the rights
of those harmed. Until a verdict has been returned, the
accused in a criminal case is just that -- the accused. But
whether the accused being tried is ultimately adjudged guilty
or innocent, we cannot ignore the fact that an innocent victim
has been harmed -- either deprived of property, or in the most
egregious circumstances, forced to suffer the violence of rape
or other assault, or even death.

       Unfortunately, in the effort to respond to some past abuses
of those accused by our criminal justice system, we have almost
lost sight of the need to safeguard the rights of victims.

       Judge Kennedy has never lost sight of the need for our
criminal justice system to seek justice for all those affected
by crime, as made clear in a speech he delivered earlier this
year in New Zealand. As he stated forthrightly, "[A] decent
and compassionate society should recognize the plight of its
victims."

       In fleshing out this basic truth, Judge Kennedy went on to
say that, "An essential purpose of the criminal justice system
is to provide a catharsis by which a community expresses its
collective outrage at the transgression of the criminal."

       Clearly that is what law-makers do in enacting criminal
codes. We proscribe anti-social conduct and prescribe a
penalty for the commission of prohibited acts -- and we entrust
the application of the laws to judges. That is why the role of
judges is so important. As Judge Kennedy noted in his speech,
"It does not do to deny that same catharsis to the member of
the community most affected by the crime. A victim's
dissatisfaction with the crxminal justice system, therefore,
represents a failure of the system to achieve one of the goals
its sets for itself."
                                     10

                                              Page 4

       This failure occurs most often at retail, in the courts,
when the application of the law achieves not justice, or the
legislative intent of deterrence and catharsis, but frustration
and distrust in the victim and in the public.

       It is little wonder that victims often fail to report
crimes, Judge Kennedy notes, for the criminal justice system's
failure to care about victims is well known, and too often
inspires public doubt that true justice will be done.

       Ultimately, victims and witnesses become indifferent to the
need of the criminal justice system for their cooperation, in
the belief that the system has become indifferent to them.

       Judge Kennedy's concern is appropriate not only for those
of us entrusted with making the law, but also for judges who
apply it. Certainly it is appropriate for those whose duty it
is to test it against the Constitution.

       If the proper protections of the Constitution are stretched
to the point where the criminal law provides inadequate and
uncertain protection to the public, if our criminal justice
system is perceived to be unjust, the demoralizing affects may
well breed distrust, disrespect for the legal process, and a
desperate resort to vigilante actions. The Bernhard Goetz case
comes to mind.

       Broadly stated, our exclusionary rule requires that if the
constable blunders, the criminal goes free. The sad fact is
that too often when the constable makes no willful blunder, the
criminal has still gone free, even where evidence of guilt was
entirely reliable.

      And again, the result in such cases has been that in
seeking to curb and penalize unlawful police practices, our
criminal justice system, through largely court-made law, has
released the clearly guilty -- to the outrage of the victim and
the peril of the public. This situation has been one that
cries out for judicial application of a rule of reason to limit
abuses.

       Enter now Judge Kennedy -- and reasonable balance.

       In an exceptional dissenting opinion in the case of United
States v. Leon, Judge Kennedy argued that a truly good-faith
mistake by police should not lead to a criminal's release.
What makes the opinion exceptional is that its persuasiveness
ultimately led to its adoption by the Supreme Court.

       It is this strict approach to the application of the Fourth
Amendment that is necessary if we are to restore effectiveness,
fairness, and true compassion to our criminal justice system.

      There are many issues that will be raised by the members of
this committee during these confirmation hearings, drawing deep
from the well of American law. But as the Committee carries
out its constitutional responsibilities, it should not only
look to see if Judge Kennedy's service on the Supreme Court
will serve the interests of justice -- which it surely will --
but as the Committee seeks justice, it should also do justice,
both to the nominee and to the confirmation process.

      At the President's announcement of his nomination, Judge
Kennedy told reporters that this Committee and the entire
Senate have a duty to give the most careful scrutiny to his
candidacy -- and that he welcomed such scrutiny. I take pride
in joining him in inviting that scrutiny.

      Tony Kennedy's record as a lawyer, as a judge, and as a
human being is an open book, and it is a story of an individual
who has charted a judicial course of such distinction and
soundness that there should be little question of his
exceptional qualifications to serve on the Court. Therefore, I
urge the Committee to complete its work with both deliberation
and alacrity, so that the full Senate may consider Judge
Kennedy's nomination at the start of the new year.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Representative Fazio, thanks for coming to the other body. We
appreciate it. It is interesting to note that your Republican col-
league from the Senate is here, and you, a Democrat, are here,
both to speak on behalf of Judge Kennedy. Please go forward.

      STATEMENT OF HON. VIC FAZIO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

   Mr. FAZIO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Members of the committee, it is a great pleasure and an honor to
join my colleagues, Congressman Bob Matsui and Senator Pete
Wilson, in presenting Judge Anthony M. Kennedy for your consid-
eration to fill the current vacancy on the Supreme Court.
  I come before you as Judge Kennedy's friend, a former neighbor,
and as one of two members of Congress who have the privilege of
representing the city of Sacramento where Judge Kennedy grew up
and where he has resided for the last 24 years.
  I also represent Solano County, California, which produced the
last Supreme Court nominee from the Ninth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals, Judge Joseph McKenna. Judge McKenna was nominated to
the Supreme Court by President McKinley and confirmed for ap-
pointment to the high court in January of 1898. Judge Kennedy,
who is quite a historian, has informed me that Judge McKenna, a
former district attorney, promptly repaired to the Columbia Uni-
versity Law School for a refresher course. One wonders how the
ABA might have reacted in 1988 to that kind of activity by a pro-
spective member of the Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. AS long as they came east, they probably would
have been satisfied.

  Mr. FAZIO. East of the Mississippi.
  Judge Kennedy, in my view, has long possessed all of the quali-
ties and qualifications needed to make an outstanding Associate
Justice.
  As a youth, Tony Kennedy displayed an early interest and appre-
ciation for the law and our judicial system. At the early age of 10,
he began working around his father's law office and began accom-
panying his father to trials throughout northern California.
  I do not have to recount his academic record. Senator Wilson has
outlined it for you. But it is important to point out that during his
time on the bench and in the classroom, Judge Kennedy has
earned the respect of his peers and the admiration of his students
for his commitment to excellence, his spirited eloquence, and his
unparalleled understanding of the Constitution. He has also proven
himself to be an active and concerned member of our community,
active in organizations and projects from his local Catholic Church
to Little League Baseball, while performing pro bono legal work for
a number of entities, including Plaza de Las Flores, a project of the
Sacramento Mexican-American community.
  A highly respected local attorney, the former President of the
California State Bar, and principal partner of the firm Diepen-
brock, Wulff, Plant and Hannegan of Sacramento, Forest A. Plant,
perhaps summed up Judge Kennedy's overall qualifications best
when he wrote:
                                          13

   Judge Kennedy is extremely industrious; he is highly intelligent; . . . he has a
profound knowledge of the evolving Constitution as evidenced not only by his deci-
sions but by his years of teaching the subject at the law school level; he is objective
and even-handed in decision-making and is sensitive to the concerns of all parties
involved in the particular litigation. He is not doctrinaire or inflexible in the dis-
charge of his judicial duties. Above all, he has exhibited a profound faith in our ju-
dicial system and the central importance of the Constitution in that system.

   In my view, if confirmed, Judge Kennedy will show judicial re-
straint on the Supreme Court just as he has for the last 12 years
on the court of appeals. But that does not mean that he is hostile
to individual rights. The kind of judicial restraint which typifies
Judge Kennedy's record in the court, his lectures in the classroom
and his statements in both public and private, respects precedents
which some feared previous nominees would ignore; it respects our
institutions and expects change to occur not always through the
courts but through the efforts of the people and their representa-
tives as well.

  The rights which we all take for granted, the rights of privacy, of
freedom of expression and freedom from arbitrary government
action, are all well established under current law and, I believe,
would be safeguarded and honored by Judge Kennedy.

  But Tony Kennedy, nonetheless, is a conservative. He is a man
with common sense value, a middle class lifestyle, and a traditional
sense of judicial restraint.

  Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, it is a pleasure for me
to give Judge Kennedy my highest recommendation and to convey
to you the sense that the community in which Judge Kennedy has
worked and lived for most of his life takes great pride in his accom-
plishments and has great hope for his elevation to the highest
court in the land.

  At this time, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record
a letter from Gordon Schaber, Dean of the McGeorge Law School of
the University of the Pacific, where, as has been indicated earlier,
Judge Kennedy has taught for the last 23 years. Dean Schaber, an
active Democrat, gives Judge Kennedy his strong recommendation,
and states that Judge Kennedy would, as an Associate Justice,
"serve this country in the highest tradition."

Honorable Vic Fazio          FEDERAL EXPRESS
Member of Congress
1421 Longworth Building
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Vic:

        I write to you to restate my personal support for the
confirmation of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy as a member of the
Supreme Court of the United States.

        I knew about Anthony Kennedy before he was solicited by me
for an adjunct teaching position at the McGeorge School of Law of
the University of the Pacific some twenty-three years ago. As a
youngster, his curriculum in his elementary school could not hold
him and'absorb all of his intellect and energies. At the age of
ten years, he began to work almost full time in the State Senate
as one of the first pages to be employed in California.
Simultaneously, he began accompanying his father to trials
throughout the northern part of the State and worked around the
law office. He did a great deal more of this prior to the time
he attended college.

       He gathered an outstanding scholastic record at Stanford
University and during his course of law study at the Harvard Law
School.

       When his father passed away, I know that he faced an
important decision as to whether to remain in the well-known San
Francisco law firm in which he had already made a mark, or
whether to come to his home, not only to settle family affairs
but to continue the private practice of his father. The law
offices were located in the same building where I was practicing
                                    15

law prior to my service as the Presiding Judge of the Superior
Courts of California for Sacramento County.

      I had the opportunity to observe his skills in private
practice. He was known for his grasp of an immense scope of
legal subjects and tremendous capacity in an era when the
generalist lawyer was much more common than is the case today.
Further, he proved to be a skilled trial lawyer. Distinguished
members of the bar associated him for that purpose. He en-gaged
in the practice of administrative law, participated in
transnational practice for corporations doing business abroad,
and wrote complex Wills and Trusts, not only for his own clients
but by referral from other lawyers.

       It was a comfort to see that at the time of his appointment
as a Judge of the Court of Appeal for the Ninth Circuit he came
to it with a demonstrated capacity in the private practice of
law.

      Of course, having been aware of his intellect and talents, I
early siezed upon his return to Sacramento to solicit interest in
teaching. During these past twenty-three years, that decision
has proven to be one of my finest. The factors for approval of
law schools of the American Bar Association promote the notion of
members of the bench and bar participating in the teaching
program." His participation has demonstrated his superior
intellect, his capacity for scholarship, his profound knowledge
of the evolving Constitution, his objectiveness and his even-
handed manner in decision making, and his sensitivity to the
concerns of all parties in a particular case.

      He has a tremendous intensity about his teaching and his
work. Our students regularly applaud his presentations during
the course of the academic year. Both in the classroom and in
public arenas, he is simply one of the best public speakers that
I have had the privilege to hear. At the recent dedication of
the new Courthouse for the Ninth Circuit in Pasadena, California,
                                   16

a number of judges present said that his speech was the best of
its kind that they had ever heard.

       His reputation for judicial temperament and personal
qualities is excellent. I think the enclosed article from the
Sacramento Bee of Sunday, November 29, 1987 says a great deal
from a person in a vantage point similar to ours as Democrats.

       At the time of his installation as an Appellate Court Judge,
I stated that he was a gentle family man, a public contributor
and an intellectual who could have his head high in the clouds
but that at all times he had his feet firmly planted on the
ground, with empathy for the problems of all of our citizens. He
would serve this country in the best tradition. As I see it, he
will become a consensus builder, consider issues case by case,
and have an abiding respect for legal precedent.

           Very sincerely yours,

           Goroon D. Schaber, Dean

  Mr. FAZIO. In addition, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for
the record an article published in the Sacramento Bee by John
Oakley, a self-described liberal, a Democrat, and a professor at the
University of California's Martin Luther King Law School in
Davis. Mr Oakley writes that Judge Kennedy's "opinions show
great concern for consensus and consistency, for the will of the
community made public and coherent through the medium of the
law." My friend John Oakley concludes: "Judge Kennedy will fit
solidly in the center of the Supreme Court. That is right where we
need him, and right where he belongs."

nice person is widespread and deserved My own

dealings with him began when I was barely 30 years

- old. My academic work led me to be named to a com-

mittee on judicial administration on which Judge ''
Kennedy also served. He was just past 40, bright, en-
ergetic and enthusiastic. He occupied a very powerful \

position, and was the envy of lawyers decades his se-

""fflor in age Yet he wore the mantle with humility and
humor.

  Mr. FAZIO. I believe it is time to unite the Senate, and thereby
the country, behind a man who has proven himself to his profes-
sion and his community, the capital of California. He has earned
the respect and support of Sacramento, just as I am sure that Jus-
tice Lewis Powell earned that of the people of his State's capital,
Richmond, during his many years of practice there. Anthony Ken-
nedy is the right man to take up the responsibility that Justice
Powell has set down. I urge you to send his nomination to the full
Senate with your unanimous endorsement.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Congressman. The two references
you made will be placed in the record as if read.

  Mr. FAZIO. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Congressman Matsui, welcome. Nice to have you
here. Please proceed.

STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT T. MATSUI, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
             CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

  Mr. MATSUI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  I would like t,. join my colleagues, Senator Wilson and Repre-
sentative Fazio, in introducing Judge Kennedy and also give him
my highest endorsement for his nomination to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
  I noticed an editorial in the New York Times this morning that
made reference to the two nominees that preceded Judge Kennedy,
Judge Bork and Judge Ginsburg. It is too bad that two individuals
preceded Judge Kennedy for this nomination. I say it is a shame
because we should not be here today comparing Judge Kennedy to
his two previous nominees.
  Judge Kennedy in and of himself is a superb candidate for the
U.S. Supreme Court, and comparisons do not do this gentleman jus-
tice. He has a deep compassion for the law, as many of you know.
He is highly intelligent; from his academic record, we can discern
that. His experience, 12 years on the appellate court in California,
demonstrates a level that very few nominees to the U.S. Supreme
Court demonstrate.
  Obviously, Judge Kennedy is a conservative, and Representative
Fazio and myself are here as Democrats. We support him because
of our personal knowledge of Judge Kennedy. I look back to Sacra-
mento County, where he and I grew up, and I can talk to any of
the 1 million people in Sacramento and not one of them would
have anything negative to say about this candidate. One individual,
when asked by a reporter what they thought of him, said they no-
ticed a lack of an observable ego. Judge Kennedy is a man of hu-
mility; he is a man of compassion. He is an individual that really
has no ego and who will understand the plight of the common man
when matters come before this court.
  I would also have to say that even though he is a conservative
and Representative Fazio and I are moderates to liberals, we have
a great deal of confidence in Judge Kennedy in terms of what he
will do on the U.S. Supreme Court. If one looks at his opinions, one
will notice that he demonstrates judicial restraint. But in 1987,
that makes a lot of sense. It means that he probably will not be
overturning many of the decisions of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and
                                              22

1980s. As a result, you will have stability on the court, which I
think all of us in the United States desire today.

   Let me make one further observation. In the next few days, you
will hear testimony from a gentleman for whom I have a great deal
of admiration. The gentleman is from Sacramento. His name is Na-
thaniel Colley. Nathaniel Colley is a black lawyer. He was former
general counsel of the NAACP. He was born in Alabama, came to
Sacramento, opened up his law practice, and became truly one of
the prominent lawyers in the United States and one of the great
trial lawyers in the State of California. I would like you to read or
listen to his testimony when he gives it because that testimony will
demonstrate the regard that lawyers, law students and ordinary in-
dividuals have for Judge Kennedy.

  I heartily endorse his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.
You could not make a better selection.

  Thank you.

time you have to absent yourself, we understand. We want to
thank the three of you for coming over and being so eloquent in
your support of Judge Kennedy.

  This committee last assembled to consider the Supreme Court
nomination on the eve of the 200th anniversary of the Constitu-
tion's drafting, and our discussion with the previous nominee and
other witnesses was vigorous, educational and, I believe, ultimately
enlightening. In sum, it was a discussion that I and most of my col-
leagues believe was worthy of the momentous anniversary that we
were at that very moment celebrating.

  Today, there is a calmer atmosphere. The confrontational spirit
that characterized the last two nominations has passed as well. But
make no mistake about it: at this moment in history, the Senate's
decision on this nomination is every bit as important as our deci-
sion on the nomination of Judge Bork or anyone else. For if we are
to do our job, and if you are to be confirmed, Judge Kennedy, you
will occupy the same position of responsibility and power to which
Judge Bork and Judge Ginsburg were nominated.

  Our tradition of evolving liberty is just as much at stake today as
it was when Justice Powell resigned in July. So once again, we
meet to discuss the meaning of the majestic phrases of our greatest
document, the Constitution; phrases that Justice Harlan knew
cannot "be reduced to any formula"; a document that Chief Justice
Marshall foresaw was "intended to endure for ages to come and
consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs."

  Through that document, the Supreme Court holds far-reaching
power over the constitutional rights and the daily lives of every
American citizen. Accordingly, our role of advice and consent de-
mands from every Senator a thorough and careful review, even
with nominees of sterling character and qualifications, as you obvi-
ously have, Judge Kennedy. This careful review is not an expres-
                                                   23

sion of doubt about you, or any nominee, but a recognition of our
obligation under the Constitution.

  As someone said this morning, as I turned on the television: "I
hope we have ended, once and for all, the debate as to whether or
not this committee has the right to delve into the judicial philoso-
phy and constitutional grounding of any nominee."

  In the past, I, and many other Senators of both parties, had been
frustrated with the confirmation process for some Supreme Court
nominees. The Senate was being asked, in effect, to waive through
nominees to the highest tribunal in America, largely on faith,
sometimes on the assertion that the President wanted the person,
and surely, in my opinion at least, the framers did not intend this
institution in the United States Senate to bestow such monumental
powers after such cursory examination.

  In contrast, when we considered the last nomination, every one
of us, literally every one of us on this committee, carefully re-
viewed the nominee's full record of constitutional and judicial
thinking. And the heart of that review took place during the com-
mittee's hearings. Each Senator on the committee reached his own
conclusion about what those views are, and are not; what they
were and were not; whether they are or whether they are not ac-
ceptable for a Supreme Court Justice to hold.

  And that review process begins again with your nomination,
Judge. We have spent the past month reviewing all 438 of your
opinions that you wrote, and close to a thousand opinions that you
were a part of, if not the author, and the twenty speeches delivered
by you.

  These hearings will extend that review, and should provide a
rich body of information that will answer the question: Who is An-
thony Kennedy and what does he stand for, and how does he, how
does he view the Constitution and its role in our society?

  The Bork hearings set high standards for this committee, the
Senate, and the President, in the appointment of a Supreme Court
Justice.

  From those hearings have emerged lasting principles for the
nomination and confirmation of members of the Supreme Court.
First, the President exercises better judgment when he considers
the prevailing views of the Senate, and the American people before
making a nomination. This has always been the case for 200 years.

  Second, if the President does consider the views of the Senate
and the people in making the nomination, the Senate may not
need to act as such a forceful constitutional counterweight.

  Thus, the Senate must carefully judge whether the President has
nominated someone who is simply philosophically compatible with
him, or someone who would bring a political agenda to the Su-
preme Court. And third, we, in the Senate, still have a constitu-
tional duty to make our review a thorough one.

  That means we must know the nominee's constitutional views,
and state clearly to the nominee our own perspective on constitu-
tional interpretation. To uphold these standards, we must begin by
insisting that every Supreme Court nominee understand and
accept a number of basic constitutional principles, among them the
separation of powers, unenumerated rights, equal protection for
                                                   24

minorities and for women, for all citizens, and due process of the
law, and the precious rights protected by the first amendment.

  It seems to me the Senate should, properly, explore further each
of these issues, and it is equally reasonable to expect every nomi-
nee to state to the Senate the general--I emphasize general--crite-
ria that he, or she, would use to apply these fundamental princi-
ples.

  Without the criteria to apply them, fundamental principles may
shrink to the status of noble but empty rhetoric. Therefore, in
these hearings, Judge Kennedy, I intend to ask you questions in
the following five areas.

  I will ask you questions intended to determine whether your
view of the Constitution has a narrow code of enumerated rights.
To me, the idea of unenumerated rights expresses a larger truth, a
truth which I believe the President alluded to when he introduced
you.

  The American people have certain rights, not because the gov-
ernment gives them those rights, or because the Constitution spe-
cifically names them, but because we exist, simply exist as children
of God. That our rights can expand with America's proud and
evolving heritage of liberty, a heritage founded in the Constitution,
that is, in the words of Justice Harlan, quote, "A living thing."

  I will ask you questions about the nature of what you have called
the "unwritten Constitution," which restrains the exercise of
power among all branches of government, and about how the doc-
trine of precedent restrains the exercise of power by the Supreme
Court in particular.

  I will ask you questions about your views on civil rights and
gender discrimination, and your understanding of the role of Con-
gress, and the courts, in providing remedies for past acknowledged
discrimination.

  I will ask you questions on the constitutional balance that should
be struck between the procedural protections guaranteed to those
accused of criminal acts, and the consideration that should be
given to the safety of society and the victims of crime.

  In discussing these areas, I--and I expect most of my col-
leagues--will not ask you to predict what your vote will be, or to
say how you would decide a specific case in the future. I want in-
stead, to understand the approach you will use, the general criteria
you will bring to constitutional claims on these issues, a discussion
that is critical, if the committee is to perform its constitutional role
properly.

  It is somewhat presumptuous of me, Judge, but I suggest that
you might adopt the role of professor, rather than judge, in answer-
ing those questions.

  Discuss with us how you arrive at your views on the Constitu-
tion. Educate us a little bit as to who Tony Kennedy is. Some out-
side this committee misunderstood this very vital distinction
during our last hearing.

  Indeed, there are reports that the administration, and even some
of my colleagues, have not observed the distinction, either. In my
view, these reports are a matter of grave concern.

  So finally, I will also ask you whether the administration, or any
member of this body, have sought any commitments from you on
                                      25
matters that might come before the Supreme Court. For just as it
is, in my view, inappropriate for us to seek those commitments, it
would be highly inappropriate for anyone else, in determining
whether or not you are appointed, or whether or not they will vote
for you, to seek similar commitments.

  In September, both my conservative and liberal colleagues, as
well as the previous nominee, were emphatic, that no campaign
promises were sought or secured in the judge's testimony before
this committee. None will be sought or secured at this hearing
either.

  I expect, however, that within reasonable limits of propriety, you
will respect the Senate's constitutional role of advice and consent,
by being as forthcoming and responsive as possible. As I am sure
you remember from our conversations in private, Judge, the com-
mittee fully expects a thorough discussion of your constitutional
philosophy, because while your judicial record is impressive, it does
not address many constitutional issues.

  And though your speeches are stimulating, they raise, in many
cases, as many questions as they answer, and, consequently, Judge,
the committee would very much appreciate--and quite frankly we
expect--forthcoming answers that will shed light on your constitu-
tional philosophy.

  I expect this to move very swiftly, and fairly, and I hope--and I
mean this sincerely--I hope you enjoy the experience. This is not
anything other than an attempt to have a dialogue with you as to
who you are, what you stand for, why you want to be on the Court,
so we have a sense of what we are about to vote on.

  Most everyone on this committee look--I think everyone on this
committee looks very favorably on your nomination, but most of us
have an open mind. As one of my colleagues said this morning, the
most important witness in this hearing will be Judge Kennedy, and
Judge, we welcome you, we look forward to hearing from you, and
with that, let me yield to my colleague from South Carolina for his
opening statement.

                                    MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1987

          This committee last assembled to consider a Supreme Court
nomination on the eve of the 200th anniversary of the
Constitution's drafting. Our debate with Judge Bork and the other
witnesses was vigorous, educational, and ultimately enlightening.
In sum, it was a debate that I and most other Senators believe was

          And it is equally reasonable to expect evary nominee to
state to the Senate the general criteria that he or she would use
to apply those fundamental principles. For without the criteria
to apply them, fundamental principles may shrink to the status of
noble but empty rhetoric.

          Therefore, in these hearings, Judge Kennedy, I intend to ask

of civil rights and gender discrimination, and your understanding
of the role of Congress and the courts in providing remedies for
past discrimination.

          I will ask you questions on the constitutional balance that

those accused of criminal acts and the consideration that should
be given to the safety of society and the victims of crime.

          In discussing these areas, I will not ask you to predict

          Welcome Judge. I look forward to hearing from you.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, today the committee begins
consideration of the nomination of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy to
be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

  As we begin the hearing process, we must remain keenly aware
that a Supreme Court appointment is unique, not only because it
grants life tenure, but more specifically, because it invests great
power in individuals not held accountable by a popular election.

  Along with this power comes a greater responsibility to the
people of this nation, to the concept of justice, and to the Constitu-
tion. Judge Kennedy, it is very fitting that the Senate consider
your nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
at a time when we are celebrating the 200th anniversary of the
Constitution of the United States.

  It is also fitting that we take a moment to reflect not only on the
wisdom of our forefathers in preparing this magnificent document,
but also on the tremendous responsibility it confers on the Senate.
The Constitution assigns the Senate and the House equal responsi-
bility for declaring war, maintaining an armed forces, assessing
taxes, borrowing money, minting currency, regulating commerce,
and making all laws necessary for the operation of the Govern-
ment.

  However, the Senate alone holds exclusive authority to advise
and consent on nominations, and this, without doubt, is one of the
most important responsibilities undertaken by this body.

  It is one that takes on an even greater significance when a nomi-
nation is made to the highest court in the land. The Senate has as-
signed the task of reviewing judicial nominations to the Judiciary
Committee.

  This responsibility is critical to the nomination process. The com-
mittee's consideration must be equitable, thorough, and diligent.
The Judiciary Committee must be ever so mindful that a nomina-
tion to the Supreme Court affects all the people of this nation, and
not just a select group.

  The role of the Supreme Court in America's development has
been vital because the Court has faced many difficult issues. Using
its collective intellectual capacity, precedent, and constitutional in-
terpretation, the Court must address issues related to criminal law,
abortion, privacy, church-state relations, freedom of speech, free-
dom of the press, the death penalty, civil rights, and much, much
more.

  Throughout the course of this nation's history, the Court has
been thrust into the center of many difficult controversies.

  As Justice Holmes stated, "We are quiet here, but it is the quiet
of a storm's center."

  Due to the broad range of controversial issues which must be re-
solved by the Court, and the impact these decisions will have, great
responsibility is placed upon each Justice, and an Associate Justice
must be an individual who possesses outstanding qualifications.

  In the past, I have reflected upon these qualifications, and I will
only briefly reiterate that I feel a nominee should possess integrity,
courage, wisdom, professional competence, and compassion.

  An individual with these attributes cannot fail the cause of jus-
tice. In his 12 years of service on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit, Judge Kennedy has displayed these qualities.
                                      31

  His proud judicial service, and his distinguished background
make him eminently well-qualified to serve on the nation's highest
Court.

  He attended Stanford University from 1954 to 1957, and was
awarded the degree of bachelor of arts, with great distinction, in
1958.

  During the year 1957 to 1958, after he had already fulfilled the
principal requirements for graduation from Stanford, he attended
the London School of Economics and Political Science at the Uni-
versity of London, where he studied political science and English
legal history, and also lectured in American Government.

  He graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1961.
Judge Kennedy practiced law for several years before his appoint-
ment to the ninth circuit, where he now ranks among the most
senior judges on the bench.

  He has vast judicial experience, participating in over 1400 deci-
sions, and authoring over 400 published opinions. In addition,
Judge Kennedy has been a constitutional law professor at the
McGeorge School of Law at the University of the Pacific for more
than 20 years.

  A review of Judge Kennedy's 400 written opinions indicates that
he is among the leaders of thoughtful jurisprudence. Judge Kenne-
dy's published opinions have earned him the reputation reserved
for our most distinguished jurists.

  His opinions clearly show that he is an advocate of judicial re-
straint. Judge Kennedy has already had a major impact on Ameri-
can jurisprudence. In 1980 he ruled against the so-called legislative
veto, a once common practice under which Congress would grant
certain authority to the executive branch, would reserve to itself
the right to disapprove particular sections exercised under that au-
thority.

  Judge Kennedy declared that the practice violated the constitu-
tional separation of powers. The Supreme Court adopted Judge
Kennedy's position.

  In a 1983 dissent, in the case of U.S. v. Leon, Judge Kennedy
argued that a court should admit evidence seized by law-enforce-
ment officers under a search warrant, that they believed to be
proper. The Supreme Court ultimately reversed a majority opinion,
and adopted a good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.

  Generally, the opinions written by Judge Kennedy take a law-
and-order position. However, Judge Kennedy has made it clear that
if law-enforcement officers overstep legal bounds, he will not hesi-
tate to limit overreaching.

  While the constitutional rights of criminal defendants must be
protected, Judge Kennedy will not ignore the rights of victims or
law-abiding citizens.

  I am confident that he will take a practical, common-sense ap-
proach to criminal cases, protecting the constitutional rights of
criminal defendants, but upholding the right of society to be pro-
tected from those who commit criminal wrongdoings.

  A review of other opinions written by Judge Kennedy shows that
he examines viewpoints and arguments from all sides. His opinions
show that he is openminded, fair, and independent. He does not,
                                              32

before he has the facts, in reviewing the appropriate law, develop
preconceived ideas about what the ultimate result should be.

  I will also note that Judge Kennedy's opinions show compassion,
and why Judge Kennedy has upheld tough sentences. He has
shown the fortitude to reverse a criminal conviction if an individ-
ual has been treated fundamentally unfair, or his constitutional
rights have been violated.

  In summary, a complete and thorough review of Judge Kenne-
dy's background indicates that he is competent, fair, and just, and
furthermore, that he is exceptionally well-qualified to serve as an
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.

  His vast experience as a practicing attorney, professor of consti-
tutional law, and many years of service on the federal bench pro-
vide the ideal background and qualifications for confirmation to
the nation's highest Court.

  Judge Kennedy, we welcome you to the committee, along with
your wife Mary, and the rest of your family, and congratulate you
on the honor that President Reagan has bestowed upon you.

STATEMENT BY SENATOR STROM THURMOND (R-S.C.) BEFORE THE SENATE
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY. REFERENCE NOMINATION OF JUDGE
ANTHONY M. KENNEDY TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED
STATES, MONDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1987, 10:00 A.M.

MR. CHAIRMAN:
         Today the Committee begins consideration of the nomination

of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy to be an Associate Justice of the
United States Supreme Court. As we begin the hearing process,
we must remain keenly aware that a Supreme Court appointment is
unique, not only because it grants life tenure but, more
specifically, because it vests great power in individuals not
held accountable by popular election. Along with this power,
comes a greater responsibility to the people of this Nation, to
the concept of Justice, and to the Constitution.

         Judge Kennedy, it is very fitting that the Senate consider
your nomination to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
at the time we are celebrating the two hundredth anniversary of
the Constitution of the United States.

         It is also fitting that we take a moment to reflect not
only on the wisdom of our forefathers in preparing this
magnificent document, but also on the tremendous responsibility
 it confers on the Senate. The Constitution assigns the Senate
 and the House equal responsibility for declaring war,
maintaining the armed forces, assessing taxes, borrowing money,
minting currency, regulating commerce, and making all laws
 necessary for the operation of the government. However, the
 Senate alone holds exclusive authority to advise and

consent on nominations, and this, without doubt, is one of the
most important responsibilities undertaken by this body. It is
one that takes on an even greater significance when a
nomination is made to the highest Court in the land. The
Senate has assigned the task of reviewing nominations to the
Judiciary Committee. This responsibility is critical to the
nomination process. The Committee's consideration must be
equitable, thorough, and diligent. The Judiciary Committee
must be ever so mindful that a nomination to the Supreme Court
affects all the people of this nation and not just a select
group.

         The role of the Supreme Court in America's development has
been vital because the Court has faced many difficult issues.
Using its collective intellectual capacity, precedent, and
Constitutional interpretation, the Court must address issues
related to criminal law, abortion, privacy, church-state
relations, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the death
penalty, civil rights, and much, much more. Throughout the
course of this Nation's history, the Court has been thrust into
the center of many difficult controversies. As Justice Holmes
stated: "We are quiet here, but it is the quiet of a storm
center. "

         Due to the broad range of controversial issues which must
be resolved by the Court and the impact these decisions will
have, great responsibility is placed upon each Justice. An
Associate Justice must be an individual who possesses
outstanding qualifications. In the past, I have

reflected upon these qualifications and I will only briefly

reit erate, that I feel a nominee should possess: Integrity,

Courage, Wisdom and Compassion. An individual with these

attributes cannot fail the cause of Justice.

In his twelve years of service on the U.S. Court of

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Judge Kennedy has displayed

these qualities. His prior judicial service and his

distinguished background make him eminently well-qualified to

serve on this Nation's highest court. He attended Stanford

University from 1951 to 1957 and was awarded the Degree of

Bachelor of Arts with great distinction in 1958. During the

year 1957-1958, after he had already fulfilled the principal

requirements for graduation from Stanford, he attended the

London School of Economics and Political Science at the

University of London where he studied political science and

English legal history, and also lectured in American

Government. He graduated cum laude, from Harvard Law School in

1961. Judge Kennedy practiced law for several years before his

appointment to the Ninth Circuit where he now ranks among the

most senior  judges on the bench. He has vast judicial

experience, participating in over fourteen hundred decisions

and authoring over four hundred published opinions. In

addition, Judge Kennedy has been a constitutional law professor

at the McGeorge School of Law at the University of the Pacific

for more than 20 years.

        A review of Judge Kennedy's 400 written opinions indicates
that he is among the leaders of thoughtful jurisprudence.

Judge Kennedy's published opinions have earned him the
reputation reserved for our most distinguished jurists. His
opinions clearly show that he is an advocate of judicial
restraint.

         Judge Kennedy has already had a major impact on American
jurisprudence. In 1980, he ruled against the so-called
legislative veto, a once common practice under which Congress
would grant certain authority to the Executive Branch but
reserve to itself the right to disapprove particular ae^-4-etrs
exercised under that authority. Judge Kennedy declared that
the practice violated the constitutional separation of powers.
The Supreme Court adopted Judge Kennedy's position.

         In a 1983 dissent in the case of U.S. v. Leon, Judge
Kennedy argued that a court should admit evidence seized by law
enforcement officers under a search warrant that they believed
to be proper. The Supreme Court ultimately reversed the
majority opinion and adopted a "good faith" exception to the
exclusionary rule.

         Generally, the opinions written by Judge Kennedy take a
law-and-order position. However, Judge Kennedy has made it
clear that should law enforcement officers overstep legal
bounds, he will not hesitate to limit overreaching. While the
constitutional rights of criminal defendants must be protected,
Judge Kennedy will not ignore the rights of victims or
law-abiding citizens. I am confident that he will take a

                                                -4-
                                 37

practical, common sense approach to criminal cases, protecting
the constitutional rights of criminal defendants, but upholding
the right of society to be protected from those who commit
criminal wrongdoings.

        A review of other opinions written by Judge Kennedy shows
that he examines viewpoints and arguments from all sides. His
opinions show that he is open-minded, fair and independent. He
does not, before hearing the facts and reviewing the
appropriate law, develop preconceived ideas about what the
ultimate results should be. I also note that Judge Kennedy's
opinions show compassion. While Judge Kennedy has upheld tough
sentences, he has shown the fortitude to reverse a criminal
conviction if an individual has been treated fundamentally
unfair or his constitutional rights have been violated.

         In summary, a complete and thorough review of Judge
Kennedy's background, indicates that he is competent, fair, and
just, and furthermore that he is is exceptionally well
qualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court. His vast experience as a practicing attorney, professor
of constitutional law, and many years of service on the Federal
bench provide the ideal background and qualifications for
confirmation to the Nation's highest court.

         Judge Kennedy, we welcome you to the Committee, along with
your wife Mary and the rest of your family, and congratulate
you on the honor President Reagan has bestowed upon you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator. Senator Kenne-
dy.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I also
want to join in welcoming Judge Kennedy and his family to these
hearings. It is always nice to see a Kennedy nominated for high
public office.

  The vacancy on the Supreme Court is no less important today
than it was 6 months ago when Justice Powell resigned. His depar-
ture left a large opening, and the person who fills it will have a
large role in defining the scope of the fundamental rights and lib-
erties of the American people for years to come.

  The events since Justice Powell's resignation have provided a
clear demonstration of what the American people expect of a nomi-
nee to the nation's highest court.

  They want a Justice who understands that the Constitution is
not just a parchment frozen under glass in 1787. It is the living,
growing embodiment of our history, traditions, and aspirations as a
free people.

  They want a Justice who appreciates that the Supreme Court is
not just a tribunal for the intellectual resolution of lawsuits. It is
the institution that protects our constitutional rights and liberties
from the prejudices of the moment, and from excessive intrusions
by the Government.

  And they want a Justice who will not be a mouthpiece of the ide-
ology of a single constituency or group. They want a Justice for all.

  In reviewing Judge Kennedy's opinions and speeches, I have seen
some hopeful signs, and some troubling ones.

  I am impressed by one of his opinions recognizing that the Con-
stitution prevents law-enforcement officers from bribing a 5-year-
old child to be an informant against his mother.

  I am impressed by another opinion vigorously applying the first
amendment to protect controversial speech in political debate.

  And he deserves credit for his landmark opinion in the Chadha
case, in which he correctly anticipated the Supreme Court's resolu-
tion of the complex issues of separation of powers between Con-
gress and the President with respect to the legislative veto.

  But I am troubled by the narrow interpretation that Judge Ken-
nedy has given civil rights in a number of cases. In some of these
cases, his interpretations were flatly rejected by the Supreme
Court. And I am also concerned by his past membership in clubs
that discriminated against minorities and women.

  These hearings will help us to determine whether Judge Kenne-
dy is sensitive to the constitutional rights of the American people,
and if he is, he will deserve to be confirmed by the Senate. Thank
you.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
   My colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch.
   Senator HATCH. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, like the
others, I am happy to welcome you, Judge Kennedy, and your
family to these hearings.
   I have been very impressed with you as we have met for exten-
sive periods of time, and as we have chatted, and I just want to tell
you it is nice to see this day arrive.
   It is indeed an honor to welcome you, an individual, who I think
is eminently qualified to serve in the nation's premier judicial
office.
   You have the highest qualifications given you by the American
Bar Association. Unanimously. I think that is a great thing after
what I saw Judge Bork go through, and I want to give some credit
to the Washington Post for the good editorials that they have writ-
ten with regard to the rating system of the ABA, recognizing its
importance, but also recognizing that there is an obligation there,
too.
  And I think that they have lived up to their obligations with
regard to you, and I am very pleased about that.
  You have had 14 years experience as a practicing attorney, 20
years as a professor of constitutional law, and more than 12 years
on the circuit court that defines federal law for nine States and 37
million people. I think this has prepared you for the trust that we
are about to place in you, and the trust displayed in you by Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan.
  Indeed, as this hearing progresses, I think President Reagan's
trust will soon be shared by the people of the United States.
  As we all know, it would be difficult to find an aspect of Ameri-
can life that has not been touched by the Supreme Court. I might
say, in approximately the time that you have served on the ninth
circuit, a President has resigned, the world's largest telecommuni-
cations company has disintegrated, or at least has been changed,
rules for criminal trials have changed, and even a town's ability to
display a creche during the holiday season has been established, all
because nine individuals in our society have found enduring princi-
ples in the Constitution itself.
  But as we well know, it has recently become an issue whether
the Supreme Court must find the principles for its decisions in the
Constitution.
   Some legal scholars and even some judges have contended that
judges need not base their decisions on the words of the Constitu-
tion. Instead, they contend that judges may go outside the Constitu-
tion to decide cases on the basis of the judges' understanding of
human dignity, or some other vague and unlimited principle.
  The problem with this argument is that it permits unelected
judges to override democratic laws created by the people them-
selves without constitutional justification.
   For example, judges have overturned capital punishment laws in
34 States--even though the Constitution itself, in four or five in-
stances, mentions the death penalty--and this is known generally
as judicial activism.
   In my mind, judges who take upon themselves to overrule the
people's laws without clear warrant from the Constitution, overstep
                                      41

their authority. Of course, all judges are not so bold. Most judges
do practice judicial restraint, which is another way of saying they
refrain from using extra-constitutional principles to decide cases.

  The reason for judicial restraint is I think well-illustrated in a
statement by a distinguished jurist:

  The imperatives of judicial restraint spring from the Constitution itself, not from
a particular judicial theory. The Constitution was written with care and delibera-
tion, not by accident. Its draftsmen were men skilled in the art and science of con-
stitution writing. The constitutional text, and its immediate implications, traceable
by some historical link to the ideas of the Framers, must govern judges.

  Marbury v. Madison states the rule: "It is apparent that the Framers of the Con-
stitution contemplated that instrument as a rule for the government of the courts,
as well as the legislature."

  Now this eminent jurist with profound respect for the Constitu-
tion is none other than Judge Anthony Kennedy in an address to
the Canadian Institute for Advanced Legal Studies, more than a
year ago.

  To those who classify judges who practice judicial restraint as
conservative, Judge Kennedy I think has the best response. As he
stated, judicial restraint is neither conservative or liberal, but a re-
quirement of the Constitution and a natural predicate for the doc-
trine of judicial review.

  Now Judge Kennedy is a champion of judicial restraint. It is easy
to understand why he has won President Reagan's trust, and it is
easy to understand why he will win the trust of the American
people as well.

  After all, he will let the American people govern themselves, and
refrain from imposing his own predispositions from the bench. If
the people legislate a death penalty, for example, I think he will
apply it because the Constitution is clearly no bar.

  In that regard, Judge, I just want to make a recommendation to
you. There are a lot of comments about how you will have to go
into philosophy here, and you are going to have to go into judicial
theories, and concepts, and that you can treat them any way you
want to.

  Let me just say this: I think we, as a committee, have to refrain
from delving into your personal views with regard to constitutional
doctrine.

  First of all, I think it is unfair to future litigants before the Su-
preme Court. So, if you do want to answer some of these questions,
choose with care how you do it because you may have that case
before the Supreme Court at some future time, and you do not
want to prejudice your right to decide that case, or have them criti-
cize you after the fact, which certainly will occur.

  The very ones who raise it here will be the most critical if you do
not agree with them in the future. I think future litigants need to
know that Judge Kennedy is open to their arguments, not predis-
posed against them. That he is going to be open to whatever the
arguments and facts of the case really are.

  And I think you have to show that you will not be prejudiced for
or against any doctrines, and that is a very delicate, difficult line
to traverse. So I want to just recommend to you, don't be bullied or
badgered into thinking you have got to answer every question that
we ask up here.
                                              42

  Some of them you simply cannot answer, and some of them you
will simply have to say, this is a matter that is presently in the
courts of this land or may come before the Supreme Court, and I
have to be concerned about whether or not I prejudice my right to
sit on that particular case in the future, and besides, I do not know
what the facts are going to be in future cases that come before the
Court.

  So, there are limitations to what even you distinguished Senators
can ask in your very time-honored and constitutional function of
investigating for purposes of confirming, or not confirming, and
your function of advising and consenting.

  I do not think you can offer an informed view of doctrines until
they really appear in the form of a case. Before a judge can make a
determination on the merits of certain doctrines, I think he, or she,
needs to read the briefs, hear oral argument, discuss the matter
with colleagues, and see the issue in the context of the specific
facts of that case.

  And a judge should not presume to short-circuit this process with
any prior opinions. Now that does not mean you cannot give your
opinion, but certainly, you have to take that into consideration,
and I think people here will respect such a decision.

  The judiciary is an independent branch. Congress should not at-
tempt to dictate the outcome of future cases, or even meddle in the
processes of another branch, by extracting any kind of promises at
any kind of confirmation hearing, least of all this confirmation
hearing for one of the most important positions in our country's
history.

  So judges are independent. They are not subject to political pres-
sure from Congress, and you do not have to be subject to it,
either--I just want you to know that--in this very important set of
hearings that we will have, where you will have an opportunity to
really be a major participant.

  I think it is totally unnecessary to delve into inquiries that you
might have to have come before you at a future time. You have
written over 430 opinions. You have participated in many, many
more opinions, over a thousand opinions in addition to that, and I
think this is an adequate body of evidence, and the best body of evi-
dence, to ascertain how you will perform as a Supreme Court Jus-
tice.

  So don't feel like you have to do something like that. By the way,
I think it is good to see a Republican Kennedy in this environment.
I just want you to know that, and I have noticed how well you have
been treated by the press in this matter.

  You know, some members of the press have treated you so fairly,
that basically, they may have overlooked which branch of the Ken-
nedy clan you come from, and I just want to tell you that I am glad
to have you here.

  And I also have deep respect for my colleague. We have been on
as many as three committees together. So it is good to have you
here.

  I could say many more laudatory things about you. You are a
wonderful family man from what I see. You have a profound deter-
mination to fight crime, and your opinions indicate that.
                                                   43

  That is exactly what President Reagan said he would do, in
trying to appoint people to the bench. And you want to fight it
with appropriate legal tools. You have devoted much of your life to
education and to teaching. These are very important things to me.

  And I think the highest compliment a judge can receive, is that
you know that ours is a government of laws, not of men, and that
you have really been a stickler for abiding by the law, and I think
that is important.

  I think you deserve many more compliments than that. I think
you have been a very appropriate model of judicial restraint on the
bench, and I think that your service will serve to remind other
judges of their duty to uphold the Constitution as written.

  So these are important things, and I just want to compliment
you for the efforts you have made in the past, for the reputation
that you have gained, and of course for the good person that you
are, and I hope that you will enjoy this appearance before the com-
mittee, and I know that you will enjoy your service on the Su-
preme Court in the future. Thank you.

             Mr. Chairman. It is indeed an honor to welcome an individual who is
  eminently qualified to serve in the nation's premier judicial office.
  Fourteen years as a practicing attorney, twenty years as a professor of
 constitutional law, and more than twelve years on the circuit court that
 defines federal law for nine states and 37 million people have prepared
 Judge Anthony Kennedy well for the trust placed in him by President Ronald
 Reagan. Indeed as this hearing progresses, I think President Reagan's
 trust will soon be shared by the people of the United States.

            As we all know, it would be difficult to find an aspect of American

the peoples' laws without clear warrant from the Constitution overstep
their authority.

         Of course, not all judges ace so bold. Most judges practice
 judicial restraint, which is another way of saying they refrain from using
 extraconstitutional principles to decide cases. The reason for judicial
 restraint is stated well by one distinguished jurist: "The imperatives of

         To those who classify judges who practice judicial restraint as

Constitution and a natural predicate for the doctrine of judicial review.

         Judge Kennedy is a champion of judicial restraint. It is easy to
understand why he has won President Reagan's trust. And it is easy to
understand why he will win the trust of the American people as well. After

         I could say many more laudatory things about this excellent American
-- he is a wonderful family man, he has a profound determination to fight
crime with appropriate legal tools, he has devoted much of his life to
education and teaching, and so forth -- but perhaps the highest compliment
a judge can receive is that he knows ours is a government of laws, not of
men. Judge Kennedy deserves that compliment and more. He is a model of
appropriate judicial restraint and will serve to remind our other judges of
their duty to uphold the Constitution as written.

        I look forward. Judge Kennedy, to your appearance before this
committee and your continued service to our nation.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. The Senator from Ohio,
Senator Metzenbaum.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   We begin these hearings almost 6 months after Justice Powell
announced his retirement. I believe all of us on the committee are
optimistic that the long struggle to fill this vacancy is nearing its
conclusion. Nevertheless, this committee owes it to the Senate, and
the American people, to conduct fair and thorough hearings, and I
am confident we will do so.
  I did not intend to address myself to this particular point, but my
distinguished colleague from Utah I think was advising you not to
answer some questions and to resist the temptation to explore with
us some of the issues that we on the committee will inquire about.
  I would hope that you would disregard that advice, and that you
would follow your own judgment, which has been previously stated
to many of us, and that is that the answers will be forthcoming.
  I think, indeed, we have not only a right, but an obligation to
inquire of your philosophy, and your approach, and your thinking.
We do not have a right to ask of you how you will vote in connec-
tion with any particular case, or how you would have voted.
  Judge, you are clearly qualified by ability and temperament to
sit on the Supreme Court. In addition, the record suggests that you
are a traditional conservative in your approach to constitutional
and statutory interpretation.
  I will be frank with you. I do not necessarily agree with all of
your decisions. I would have been happier if you had reached dif-
ferent results in certain cases. I would have been pleased if you
had resigned earlier from clubs that excluded women, though it is
fair to point out that you did take affirmative steps, somewhat be-
latedly perhaps, to change the policy of those clubs.

  In short, I am not going to say to you, Judge Kennedy, that you
are my ideal nominee. But the choice is not ours in the Senate to
make. On the basis of what we now know, you appear to be an ac-
ceptable nominee. Only after the hearing is concluded can we
make that final assessment.

  We have undergone a lengthy and exhausting struggle over who
will become the next Supreme Court Justice.

  The public is entitled to ask, "Has it really been worth this much
trouble?" Without question, it has. We have had a national referen-
dum on the kind of Constitution this country wants. The result has
been an overwhelming endorsement for the one we have now.

  The Senate and the American people rejected a nominee who be-
lieved individual freedoms can be found only in the fine print of
the written Constitution. The Senate and the American people
reaffirmed the value of broad constitutional protections for individ-
ual liberties, and strong guarantees of equal protection.

  If this hearing demonstrates that you do indeed support these
fundamental values--and I fully expect that it will--these months
of struggle will pay rich dividends far into the future for our coun-
try.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

           ON THE OTHER HAND, I DO NOT NECESSARILY AGREE WITH ALL OF
JUDGE KENNEDY'S DECISIONS. I WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER IF HE HAD
REACHED DIFFERENT RESULTS IN CERTAIN CASES. I WOULD HAVE BEEN
                                    48

PLEASED IF HE HAD RESIGNED EARLIER FROM CLUBS THAT EXCLUDED WOMEN,
THOUGH IT IS FAIR TO POINT OUT THAT HE TOOK AFFIRMATIVE STEPS TO
CHANGE THE POLICY OF THESE CLUBS. IN SHORT, HE WOULD NOT BE MT IDEAL
NOMINEE. BUT THE SIGNS ARE THAT HE IS AN ACCEPTABLE NOMINEE, AND
THAT IS ALL WE ARE ENTITLED TO ASK OF THE PRESIDENT.

           WE HAVE UNDERGONE A LENGTHY AND EXHAUSTING STRUGGLE OVER WHO
WILL BECOME THE NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. THE PUBLIC IS ENTITLED
TO ASK -- HAS IT REALLY BEEN WORTH THIS MUCH TROUBLE? WITHOUT
QUESTION, IT HAS. WE HAVE HAD A NATIONAL REFERENDUM ON THE KIND OF
CONSTITUTION THIS COUNTRY WANTS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN AN OVERWHELMING
ENDORSEMENT FOR THE ONE WE HAVE NOW.

           THE SENATE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REJECTED A NOMINEE WHO
BELIEVED INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS CAN BE FOUND ONLY IN THE FINE PRINT OF
THE WRITTEN CONSTITUTION. THE SENATE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
REAFFIRMED THE VALUE OF BROAD CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR
INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES AND STRONG GUARANTEES OF EQUAL PROTECTION. IF
THIS HEARING DEMONSTRATES THAT JUDGE KENNEDY DOES SUPPORT THESE
FUNDAMENTAL VALUES ~ AND I FULLY EXPECT THAT IT WILL -- THESE
MONTHS OF STRUGGLE WILL PAY RICH DIVIDENDS FAR INTO THE FUTURE FOR
OUR COUNTRY.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Senator. Senator Simpson
from Wyoming.

  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your
very steady and sure handling of this nomination, for indeed, we
must be about our business.

  It is a rich pleasure to have you here today, Judge Kennedy. I
trust you are looking forward to these hearings. I mean that. I
think the Chairman is correct.

  Here is where we have the opportunity to publicly interrogate
you with respect to issues of great importance. While that word, in-
terrogation, sometimes, perhaps often, has some rather negative
connotations, I am very certain that our Chairman will maintain
proper order and decorum in this process, and assure that you are
treated with all of the respect due to your high office and to your
nomination.

  But before I go further, I need to clarify something which I said
during the Bork nomination, which has proven to be in total error.
A little bit, really, off the rail.

  And so I will eat crow--legs, beak and all here--because on occa-
sion, I expressed my opinion during some of the wretched excesses
of the Bork hearing--and there were some--that if Judge Bork
were not to be confirmed, then the next nominee would be some
nameless, faceless, witless, and terminally bland soul who I re-
ferred to as Jerome P. Sturdley.

  Now, I said that, and suffered a foot-in-the-mouth disease, be-
cause I was wrong, so very wrong. You are living proof of my error,
because, indeed, you are a splendid and remarkable new nominee,
and your record of public service and professional life is absolutely
outstanding.

  I will not go into your background. Senator Biden has covered
that, and Senator Thurmond. But it is extraordinary, beginning at
the age of 38 on the bench, Stanford, graduation cum laude, Phi
Beta Kappa, London School of Economics, election to the Harvard
Law School board of student supervisors, your private practice,
your pro bono efforts.

  That distances you about as far away from my mythical charac-
ter as one could possible get. So we are going to review your record,
and we have reviewed this for some time now. The committee has
reviewed it. Others are very interested.

  Specifically, now, we know of the unanimous recommendation of
the American bar in providing you with the highest possible rating,
that of well-qualified.

  I will leave for another time a discussion of how the ABA came
to its decision, but they eventually got it right. It is important to
note that. They were certainly disappointing doing the last nomi-
nation. Four of their remarkable crew are still cloaked somewhere
in anonymity. We do our business in the light here.

  It is important to note, from the outset, that you received the
nomination you so clearly deserve. Well, Senators give you advice
on how to answer questions. I heard that. But if you want to choose
a course, why, try the one that the last three successful nominees
picked. Those questions of the committee were answered like:

  How I am to resolve a particular issue, or what I might do might make it neces-
sary for me to disqualify myself, and that would result in my inability to do my
                                              50

sworn duty. I do not think I should, Senator, respond to the question, because that
may well be an issue argued before the Court, and I do not want to be in a position
of having a connection, as a condition of my confirmation.

  As any nominee will in the future, and have always in the past,
say, "I just cannot do it." Now those were the remarks of Justices
O'Connor, Rehnquist and Scalia. You would want to follow that
good counsel there, I think somewhat, anyway.

  It is well worth pursuing. I think it is very important to remem-
ber that that worked, and Judge Bork of course got into the full
panoply of effort because he had no choice. He had no choice. You
do. You have not been hammered flat before you got here.

  So, as we proceed here, we will want to know about your judicial
philosophy. I am certain there are those who would believe it to be
too conservative to the extent that that label, conservative or liber-
al, really means much. It never has in my life, to add a bit of di-
mension or light to a situation--but that is not the inquiry.

  The inquiry is whether you possess the integrity, temperament,
and ability to be on the Supreme Court. The inquiry is also wheth-
er your judicial philosophy, without consideration of your political
philosophy, is worthy of representative on the Supreme Court, and
I very much believe it is.

  I hope that we will do that fairly. I have disagreed with the spe-
cific judicial philosophy which nominees possess--and I have done
this before, so this is not a case, you know, of sudden enlighten-
ment. And again, I bring to the floor the case of Judge Pat Wald,
who serves absolutely superbly, and was being criticized for the
most superb and banal activities I have ever heard of. And she's
there on the bench. She's doing a marvelous job, and I supported
her.

  And I've supported other nominees of Jimmy Carter, so that's
the way that is. I just hope that when I'm in the minority, and a
president is presenting a nominee, that I will be as fair as I hope
others would be.

  It's called fairness. I know that is naive, but I still like to try
that. And it would be eminently defeating to our national goals if
we ever have another situation--it doesn't matter who it is--simi-
lar to Robert Bork's process.

  Additionally, even though you hold these particular philosophies,
we also know there is no predictability as to how you'll act when
you get on the high court bench.

  That has proved to be troublesome to some in the past. And it is
so important for all of us to remember that you will be only one of
nine. To form a majority, you would have to be joined by at least
four of your colleagues, just as you were joined when you wrote
your majority opinions on the ninth circuit.

  It seems to me around here we focus on the nominees as single
entities, as though they're the sole arbiters of justice, discounting
the importance and impact of the other eight justices on the Court.

  That dazzled me in the last exercise. Because Bork, to carry out
his "heinous" agenda, was evidently this Pied Piper who would
lead four dull witted colleagues off the edge of the pier. That's
what he would have had to have done. How deceptive that was.

  So I look forward to the hearings, working with you. I enjoyed
our visit. I found your treatment of the Bork nomination, Mr.
                                          51

Chairman, to be under all the circumstances equitable. I say that
to you, Mr. Chairman. You always command my utmost personal
regard and appreciation, just as under the chairmanship of Ted
Kennedy and Strom Thurmond in this committee, we brought forth
an appreciation for your efforts, your honest attempts.

  And I commend you, Mr. Chairman, as to how you personally
handled that at a time of great personal distress to you. So I know
it will be fairly done.

  And I said under the first procedures at the inception of the
Bork nomination that his confirmation or rejection would be
brought about by use of a deft blend of emotion, fear, guilt and
racism.

  Yes, I overuse that phrase, I do. But it proved to be so. My pre-
diction was borne out.

  I know that we will be avoiding all that kind of stuff in this nom-
ination. And we seem to be off to a much better start.

  Of course, let me conclude, we remember again that you were
unanimously confirmed by this Senate previously. And since that
time you have served with great honor and distinction.

  I'm sure that your current and former students at McGeorge
Law School will be watching intently to see just how you answer
these questions on constitutional law.

  They will think, "I remember he fired those questions at me.
How will he do?" It will be the law students' primal joy to watch
you in these proceedings. No doubt you will handle yourself with
great aptitude and dignity.

  I look forward to hearing your views, indeed I do. And I say, as I
have said always, that there are not many of us here, at this table,
who would like to be at that table where you sit in your position.
We could not pass the test that we now give to you and to others.
In no way, none of us.

  And as I have said before, I would hate to have someone rifling
through the collected utterances, mumblings and scratchings of Al
Simpson. It would be a bizarre array of stuff.

  But once again, America will be watching to see how we do our
business of advice and consent. The Senate obviously has no objec-
tive criteria.

  I think we learned much from the past one. We have no stand-
ards, no criteria by which to honestly measure the qualifications of
Supreme Court nominees.

  Each Senator simply makes up his or her mind. And they make
up their own criteria, which is even more fascinating. And often,
sometimes, even before the hearings, which is ever sublimely fasci-
nating.

  And then they come to their conclusions.
  I know you're going to handle things beautifully. You will be a
splendid addition to the Supreme Court.
  I intend to participate fully, Mr. Chairman, and I await your
presentation with great interest and anticipation.
  Welcome to you, sir, and to your fine family. And I thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. I say to my colleague, I
thank him for his kind remarks about me.

   90-878 0 -
                                                52

  And Judge, just like none of us would like to be where you are
right now, we probably would find a majority up here would like to
be on the Court.

  And just as you would probably not like to stand for election, you
probably would not be offended to be appointed to the United
States Senate.

  So we all go through similar proceedings, we in a general elec-
tion, and you before us.

  And lastly, it is true, you are only one of nine. But I think a case
that's just been handed down a few minutes ago by the Supreme
Court on one of the most controversial issue in America today that
tied four to four indicates why your nomination is so critical.

  I yield to my colleague from Arizona.
  Senator DECONCINI. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I want to add my
congratulations for the way you have handled the Judiciary Com-
mittee in general, and in specific, as to the Supreme Court nomi-
nees.
  Judge Kennedy, we welcome you and your family here today.
You are sitting with some of the most respected Members of Con-
gress, Senator Wilson profound in his statement in support of you,
and Representatives Fazio and Matsui. No one is more respected by
this Senator, and I think by this committee, than the friends that
you have by your side.
  I want to first address the subject of advice. I'm not going to give
you any advice, Judge Kennedy. I am going to say that I hope you
do respond to questions as to your own feelings. In my judgment,
that's the only way we know what you think about the law and the
Constitution.
  And contrary to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I
think it would be a mistake to not do that. No one is going to ask
you how you would have voted on the four-to-four decision that the
Senator from Delaware just mentioned, dealing with abortion.
  No one is going to be so presumptuous as to expect you to come
forward and give opinions on matters that will be pending before
the Court, or may be before the Court at the time.
  But it is important for us to find out how you view the Constitu-
tion, and to question some of the decisions that you have made con-
cerning stare decisis and other areas.
  So Mr. Chairman, we are gathered together, once again, in this
historic room, to begin what I think is perhaps our most important
responsibility as a body.
  I have said many times, confirmation of members to the Su-
preme Court, and perhaps, God forbid, having to declare war, are
the two most important decisions a Senator is called upon to make.
  The nomination of Judge Robert Bork divided this committee, as
well as the Senate and the nation as a whole. I am hopeful that the
nomination of Judge Anthony Kennedy will bring us back together,
with the common purpose of determining objectively whether
Judge Kennedy should be confirmed as an associate justice to the
Supreme Court.
  During the committee's and the Senate's consideration of Judge
Bork, I found myself at the center of a bitter debate over the role
of the Senate, and about the acceptability of Judge Bork as a jus-
tice.
                                                   53

  Many on both sides of the Bork debate saw that nomination as
an opportunity to advance their political goals. Judge Bork's sup-
porters saw the nomination as a chance to create social and legal
changes that they had been unable to create through other means.

  Judge Bork's opponents saw the nomination as an opportunity to
reverse the decline of their influence that had occurred under
President Reagan's term.

  Both sides used the nomination for fund raising, membership ex-
pansion, and personal attack on Members who happened to dis-
agree with their side of the issue.

  I found the rhetoric on both sides of this unfortunate circum-
stance not only inappropriate but very dissatisfying, distracting,
and distasteful.

  I accept it as part of the system. I make no criticism of anybody
who engaged in such activity. I just expressed my view that I
thought it was inappropriate.

  I attempted to divorce political considerations from my decision-
making. I urged my colleagues to wait until the record was com-
plete before making up their minds.

  I attempted tr us* the hearing to learn, and to gather informa-
tion, rather than to bolster a preconceived notion about that nomi-
nee.

  I have been pleased to receive a good deal of mail and in-person
support for me deliberate approach I took to the Bork nomination.
And while there are those, of course, who are still trying to make
political hay out of the defeat of Judge Bork, I am glad that most
have moved on, and approached the Kennedy nomination in what I
consider to be a very appropriate manner.

  We do not have everyone jumping out on this issue, and on this
nomination, as we did before, for or against. We are more deliber-
ate as a body and as Members. So I think the bad has turned into
good; we all learned something, certainly this Senator did.

  The nomination of any individual to the Supreme Court is of the
highest importance. Even though we begin these hearings at the
end of the congressional session, and during the holiday season, we
must be careful, and be as thorough as possible in our consider-
ation of the nominee.

  I have had an opportunity to visit with you, Judge Kennedy. I
appreciate the short time we had to discuss constitutional issues,
and how you feel about them.

  I have read over dozens of your opinions. I have read several
transcripts of speeches that you have given. And I have talked to
many attorneys and judges in the ninth circuit about your qualifi-
cations.

  And I have had the personal pleasure of being in your company
at ninth circuit judicial conferences, on occasion.

  I do, however, have unanswered questions that I intend to ask
you, Judge Kennedy, as a witness. I want to assure myself that you
will apply the law of this nation, and our Constitution, in a consist-
ent way.

  I want to be sure that Judge Kennedy will be able to separate his
personal views and philosophies from his judicial decisionmaking.

  I want to know what those personal views may be, and I want to
know how they may be applied. I want to satisfy myself that your
                                                     54

record as an appellate court judge does indeed display a separation
of your personal and legal views when issuing opinions.

   I am interested in learning how you intend to approach the dif-
ferent responsibilities of the Supreme Court, vis-a-vis the court of
appeals.

   I will be particularly interested, Judge Kennedy, in discussing
with you your views on discrimination, equal protection, privacy,
criminal procedures, and access to the court.

   I want to hear your opinions on the roles that precedent and
stare decisis play on the Supreme Court. And I am hopeful, Judge
Kennedy, that you will answer these questions as forthrightly as
you can, without intimidation, without feeling put on the spot, or
mat there is somebody out to get you, because there is no one here
that I know of who is approaching this hearing in that way.

   We are out to do our responsible duty, and I am very pleased
that you have been chosen for the position. I am also very pleased
that your attitude is one of a willingness to work with us, so we
may come to a conclusion that will fill the vacant seat on the Su-
preme Court, and enable the country to move ahead.

  Thank you, Judge Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
   Our colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Kennedy, let me add my welcome to you and your family.
I particularly want to congratulate you on being chosen by Presi-
dent Reagan to serve on the Supreme Court.
  Three months ago this committee convened for the purpose of as-
sisting the Senate's advice and consent responsibility. Badly, in my
judgment, the committee and the Senate managed to transform a
narrow constitutional function into a full blown fear and smear
campaign.

  The advice and consent function, located as it is in the Executive
Branch Article of the Constitution, simply cannot mean that the
Senate's last word is to be the only word.

   I begin these hearings full of hope that this nomination will
return the Senate to its more traditional and appropriate role.

   In the past, I have set out what I believe is a principled, three-
part standard for evaluating a nominee. First, does a nominee pos-
sess knowledge of and respect for the Constitution as the precious
inheritance that it is for all Americans, and as the sole rule of deci-
sion in constitutional cases?

   Second, does the nominee have full appreciation of the separate
functions between the unelected judiciary and the political
branches?

   Thirdly, will the nominee exercise self restraint? Self restraint,
which makes a judge resist the temptation to revise or amend the
Constitution according to that individual's view of what is good
policy.

   Mr. Chairman, I believe that this is a good occasion to repeat
some often cited history about the third branch.

   First, according to the framers, the judiciary was to be the "least
dangerous" branch to the political rights guaranteed in the Consti-
tution.
  Second, courts are to make decisions based on the law rather
than personal preference.

  Courts derive their legitimacy and authority from this restric-
tion. They lose both when they go beyond it,

  As Justice Frankfurter once expressed it, and I quote: The ulti-
mate touchstone of constitutionality is the Constitution itself; not
what we have said about it, unquote.

  Much of the furor of the past few months only underscores the
fact that some prefer a judiciary that obliterates the delicate bal-
ance struck by the framers in the Constitution's first three articles;
a judiciary whose acts have no roots in the text or history of the
Constitution and laws; a judiciary with little regard for the consent
of the governed or separated powers.

  Of course, good intentions will be pleased by the defenders of an
untethered judiciary. But good intentions ought not to prevail over
the Constitution itself, if we are to be truly a nation of laws, not
men.

  Following the Bork hearings, a constituent of mine reminded me
of the words of a former Iowa Congressman, John W. Gwynne. His
words explain it quite plainly, and I quote: A constitution is a docu-
ment written by people in their better moments * * * to protect
themselves in their worst moments.

  A constitution is not only to protect man from his enemies * * *
but also from his friends, unquote.

  Mr. Chairman, I thank you for scheduling these hearings as
early as you did, and I look forward to them as I evaluate this
nominee on the vital questions concerning the judicial branch.
Thank you.

                      ON THE NOMINATION OF ANTHONY M. KENNEDY

              TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

                                           DECEMBER 14. 1987

         JUDGE KENNEDY, LET ME ADD MY WELCOME TO YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY. I'D LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING CHOSEN BY
PRESIDENT REAGAN TO SERVE ON THE SUPREME COURT.

         THREE MONTHS AGO THIS COMMITTEE CONVENED FOR THE PURPOSE
OF ASSISTING THE SENATE'S ADVICE AND CONSENT RESPONSIBILITY.
SADLY, IN MY JUDGMENT, THE COMMITTEE AND SENATE MANAGED TO
TRANSFORM A NARROW CONSTITUTIONAL FUNCTION INTO A FULL-BLOWN,
FEAR AND SMEAR CAMPAIGN.

         THE ADVICE AND CONSENT FUNCTION ~ LOCATED AS IT IS IN THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH ARTICLE OF THE CONSTITUTION -- SIMPLY CANNOT
MEAN THAT THE SENATE'S LAST WORD IS TO BE THE ONLY WORD. I
BEGIN THESE HEARINGS FULL OF HOPE THAT THIS NOMINATION WILL
RETURN THE SENATE TO ITS MORE TRADITIONAL, AMD APPROPRIATE
ROLE.

         IN THE PAST, I HAVE SET OUT WHAT I BELIEVE IS A
PRINCIPLED, THREE-PART STANDARD FOR EVALUATING A NOMINEE:

         (1) DOES THE NOMINEE POSSESS KNOWLEDGE OF AND RESPECT FOR
THE CONSTITUTION AS A PRECIOUS INHERITANCE FOR ALL AMERICANS,
AND AS THE SOLE RULE OF DECISION IN CONSTITUTIONAL CASES ?

         (2) DOES THE NOMINEE HAVE FULL APPRECIATION OF THE
SEPARATE FUNCTIONS BETWEEN THE UNELECTED JUDICIARY AND THE
POLITICAL BRANCHES ? AND

         (3) WILL THE NOMINEE EXERCISE SELF-RESTRAINT ?
SELF-RESTRAINT WHICH MAKES A JUDGE RESIST TKt TEMPTATION TO
REVISE OR AMEND THE CONSTITUTION ACCORDING TO THAT INDIVIDUAL'S
VIEW OF WHAT IS GOOD POLICY.
                                  57

         MR. CHAIRMAN, I BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD OCCASION TO REPEAT
SOME OFTEN-CITED HISTORY ABOUT THE THIRD BRANCH.

         FIRST, ACCORDING TO THE FRAMERS, THE JUDICIARY WAS TO BE
THE "LEAST DANGEROUS" BRANCH TO THE POLITICAL RIGHTS GUARANTEED
IN THE CONSTITUTION.

         SECOND, COURTS ARE TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON THE LAW
RATHER THAN PERSONAL PREFERENCE. COURTS DERIVE THEIR
LEGITIMACY AND AUTHORITY FROM THIS RESTRICTION. THEY LOSE BOTH
WHEN THEY GO BEYOND IT. AS JUSTICE FRANKFURTER ONCE EXPRESSED
IT: "THE ULTIMATE TOUCHSTONE OF CONSTITUTIONALITY IS THE
CONSTITUTION ITSELF, NOT WHAT WE HAVE SAID ABOUT IT."

         MUCH OF THE FUROR OF THE PAST FEW MONTHS ONLY UNDERSCORES
THE FACT THAT SOME PREFER A JUDICIARY THAT OBLITERATES THE
DELICATE BALANCE STRUCK BY THE FRAMERS IN THE CONSTITUTION'S
FIRST THREE ARTICLES . . . A JUDICIARY WHOSE ACTS HAVE NO ROOTS
IN THE TEXT OR HISTORY OF THE CONSTITUTION AND LAWS . . . A
JUDICIARY WITH LITTLE REGARD FOR THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED OR
SEPARATED POWERS.

         OF COURSE, GOOD INTENTIONS WILL BE PLEADED BY THE
DEFENDERS OF AN UNTETHERED JUDICIARY. BUT GOOD INTENTIONS
OUGHT NOT TO PREVAIL OVER THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF, IF WE ARE
TRULY TO BE A NATION OF LAWS, NOT MEN.

         FOLLOWING THE BORK HEARINGS, A CONSTITUENT OF MINE
REMINDED ME OF THE WORDS OF A FORMER IOWA CONGRESSMAN, JOHN
WILLIAMS GWYNNE. HIS WORDS EXPLAINED IT QUITE PLAINLY:

         "A CONSTITUTION IS A DOCUMENT WRITTEN BY PEOPLE IN THEIR
         BETTER MOMENTS . . .

         TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IN THEIR WORST MOMENTS.

         A CONSTITUTION IS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT MAN FROM HIS ENEMIES
          . . . BUT ALSO FROM HIS FRIENDS."

         MR. CHAIRMAN, I THANK YOU FOR SCHEDULING THESE HEARINGS,
AND LOOK FORWARD TO THEM AS I EVALUATE THIS NOMINEE ON THE
VITAL QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. THANK YOU.
                                          58

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
   The Senator from Vermont.
   Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I am pleased to welcome Judge Kennedy and his family to the
Judiciary Committee this morning in this historic room.
  Today, the committee is gathering for the second time in less
than 3 months to undertake one of our most important tasks: to
hear the testimony of the President's nominee to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
  Our work here over the next few days actually is going to reflect
the performance of three important duties.
  First, we have a duty to the Senate to develop a complete and
detailed record on all issues pertaining to the fitness of Judge Ken-
nedy to serve on the Supreme Court, and to recommend to the
Senate, based on that record, whether it should give its consent to
this nomination.
  Second, we have a duty to the Constitution, that magnificent
charter whose 200th anniversary we celebrated this year. The men
who wrote the Constitution recognized that the appointment of a
Justice of the Supreme Court is too important a decision just to
leave to one branch of government alone. They gave the President
the power to nominate, but they entrusted the Senate with the
power to withhold or give its consent. The fulfillment of this second
duty also requires that we examine this nomination with extraordi-
nary care.

  Finally, of course, we have a duty to the American people. The
decisions of the Supreme Court touch the lives of every citizen of
our republic. We depend upon the Supreme Court as the ultimate
guardian of our liberties. Whoever succeeds Justice Powell on the
Supreme Court is going to play a pivotal role in defining the shape
of those liberties, not only for us, but for our children; in your case,
well into the next century. So our duty to the American people also
requires us to act on the basis of a complete record that discloses,
as well as it can be disclosed, what this nomination might mean for
the future of those freedoms.

  We have already begun to fulfill these three duties--to the
Senate, to the Constitution, and to the American people--by study-
ing Judge Kennedy's distinguished record as an attorney, as a pro-
fessor of constitutional law, and, for the past 12 years, as a circuit
court judge. The hearings that begin today are the next important
step.

  Three months ago--and we have had a lot of discussion about
this today--this committee convened to carry out these same duties
with respect to another nomination to the Supreme Court. The
hearings on the nomination of Judge Robert Bork established three
precedents that should guide our work in the days ahead.

  First, the Bork hearings were wide-ranging, they were thorough,
they were intensive. The hearings starting here today will share
those features. I hope that every relevant aspect of the nominee's
record is going to be thoroughly explored. Too much is at stake for
the committee to falter in its obligation to develop a complete
record, a complete record, on which to base its recommendation to
the Senate.
                                          59

  Second, the Bork hearings focused on the judicial philosophy of
the nominee: his approach to the Constitution, and to the role of
the Supreme Court in discerning and enforcing its commands. The
hearings today should have the same focus. No issue is more cen-
tral to a decision on the appointment of a Justice of the Supreme
Court; after all, it is the Court which under our system has the last
word on what the Constitution means.

  Now, one Senator today said, Judge, you are not to be badgered
into answering improper questions. Well, those improper questions
are not going to occur. But if they did, I do not think anybody on
this panel thinks you could be badgered into anything.

  Now, I met with you, and I know from our conversation, our pri-
vate conversation, I think I know how you will answer. My advice
is the same as I gave you then: Just answer honestly and candidly.
Ignore any other advice of how you should or should not answer.
Just be yourself. Be honest and be candid. Nobody is going to
badger you; and even if they did, you are able to take care of your-
self. As I said before, I cannot believe you could be badgered into
anything. And you should not be able to be.

  You are going to be asked about many aspects of your judicial
philosophy, as reflected in your previous record. You will also be
asked about many topics on which you have not previously spoken
in public. Your responsiveness to these questions and your candor
and your completeness, they are going to be important factors in
the committee's ultimate recommendation.

  Finally, these hearings, like the Bork hearings, will be fair.
Judge Kennedy is going to be given every opportunity to explain
his judicial philosophy, to put his record in context, and to respond
to any criticisms that may be leveled. That is going to give this
committee and the Senate and the American people the chance to
see the whole picture before a decision is made on this nomination.

  The hearings on Judge Bork's nomination set a precedent in an-
other way as well. Never before in our history have the American
people been so engaged and so involved in the debate not over one
nomination but over the future of the Supreme Court. The public
debate that accompanied the Bork nomination had its excesses and,
as Senator DeConcini mentioned earlier, its low points, like every
public debate in a democratic society. But on the whole, it was a
positive example of our democratic system in government. It cer-
tainly was a positive example of the checks and balances.

  Now, the decision on Justice Powell's successor remains the most
important decision in the field of constitutional rights and respon-
sibilities of this decade. It has been, and it must continue to be, a
public decision, made on the basis of a public record and with the
input of a concerned public. I hope that the high level of public in-
terest continues. Debate on a nomination to the Supreme Court is
in the best traditions of American citizenship.

  I look forward, over the next few days, to learning more about
Judge Kennedy's judicial philosophy and about his qualifications to
serve on the Supreme Court.

  Most importantly, these hearings carry out our duty to the U.S.
Senate, to the Constitution and to the American people. We fulfill
that duty if we are fair and thorough, and we fail our fellow Amer-
                                              60

icans, the Constitution and the Senate if we are not. So I look for-
ward to that challenge.

  Finally, the most important witness, Judge Kennedy, is going to
be yourself. Your testimony and really no one else's--either for or
against you--will determine whether you become a Supreme Court
Justice. Only you could stop eventual confirmation. I rather sus-
pect you will not.

  Mr. Chairman, I am going to have to leave for a few minutes for
the reconciliation conference, and I will be back in time to hear the
nominee. I thank you for your courtesy.

                 U. S. SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
HEARINGS ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY
TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT

                   DECEMBER 14, 1987, 10:00 A.M.
    OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK J. LEAHY
                                      62

          I am pleased to welcome Judge Kennedy and his family to
the Judiciary Committee this morning.

         Today, the Committee gathers for the second time in less
than three months to undertake one of our most important tasks:
to hear the testimony of the President's nominee to the United
States Supreme Court.

         Our work here over the next few days actually will reflect
the performance of three important duties.

         First, we have a duty to the Senate, to develop a complete
and detailed record on all issues pertaining to the fitness of
Judge Kennedy to serve on the Supreme Court, and to recommend
to the Senate, based on that record, whether it should give its
consent to this nomination.

         Second, we have a duty to the Constitution, that
magnificent charter whose 200th anniversary we mark this year.
The men who wrote the Constitution recognized that the
appointment of a Justice of the Supreme Court is too important
a decision to leave to one branch of government alone. They
gave the President the power to nominate, but they entrusted to
                                       63

the Senate the power to give or withhold its consent. The
fulfillment of this second duty also requires that we examine
this nomination with extraordinary care.

         Finally, we have a duty to the American people. The
decisions of the Supreme Court touch the lives of every citizen
of our Republic. We depend upon the Supreme Court as the
ultimate guardian of our liberties. Whoever succeeds Justice
Powell on the Supreme Court will play a pivotal role in
defining the shape of those liberties, not only for us, but
also for our children, well into the next century. So our duty
to the American people also requires us to act on the basis of
a complete record that discloses, as well as it can be
disclosed, what this nomination might mean for the future of
our freedoms.

         We have already begun to fulfill these three duties -- to
the Senate, to the Constitution, and to the American people --
by studying Judge Kennedy's distinguished record as an
attorney, as a professor of constitutional law, and, for the
past twelve years, as a United States Circuit Judge. The
hearings that begin today are the next important step.

         Three months ago, this Committee convened to carry out
these same duties with respect to another nomination to the
Supreme Court. The hearings on the nomination of Judge Robert
                                       64

Bork established three precedents that should guide our work in
the days ahead.

          First, the Bork hearings were wide-ranging, thorough, and
intensive. These hearings will share those features. I hope
that every relevant aspect of the nominee's record will be
thoroughly explored. Too much is at stake for the Committee to
falter in its obligation to develop a complete record on which
to base its recommendation to the Senate.

         Second, the Bork hearings focused on the judicial
philosophy of the nominee: his approach to the Constitution,
and to the role of the Supreme Court in discerning and
enforcing its commands. These hearings should have the same
focus. No issue is more central to a decision on the
appointment of Justice of the Supreme Court, the court which
under our system has the last word on what the Constitution
means.

         Judge Kennedy will be asked about many aspects of his
judicial philosophy, as reflected in his previous record. He
will also be asked about many topics on which he has not
previously spoken in public. His responsiveness to these
questions, and the candor and completeness of his answers, will
be important factors in the Committee's ultimate
recommendation.
                                       65

          Finally, these hearings, like the Bork hearings, will be
fair. Judge Kennedy will be given every opportunity to explain
his judicial philosophy, to put his record in context, and to
respond to any criticisms that may be leveled. That will give
this Committee, the Senate, and the American people the chance
to see the whole picture before a decision is made on this
nomination.

         The hearings on Judge Bork's nomination set a precedent in
another way as well. Never before in our history have the
American people been so engaged and so involved in the debate
over the future of the Supreme Court. The public debate that
accompanied the Bork nomination had its excesses and its low
points, like every public debate in a democratic society. But
on the whole, it was a positive example of our democratic
system in action.

         The decision on Justice Powell's successor remains the
most important decision in the field of constitutional rights
and responsibilities of this decade. It has been, and it must
continue to be, a public decision, made on the basis of a
public record and with the input of concerned citizens. I hope
that the high level of public interest continues. Public
debate on a nomination to the Supreme Court is in the best
traditions of American citizenship.
                                           66

          I look forward, over the next few days, to "learning nsore
r bout Ji.dge Kenr.edy's judicial philosophy and i>cut his
qualifications to t&rve on the Srpro :e Court.

         ffost importantly - these hearings carry out our duty to
the United States Senate, to the Constitution and to the
American people. Ue fulfill that duty if we are fair and
thorough - we fail our fellow Americans, the Constitute en r.^d
the Senate if we are not. I look forward to the chal.1p-vje.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Kennedy, I join my colleagues in welcoming you here.
These hearings have already been described as harmonious, per-
haps routine, and maybe less important than previous hearings. I
frankly disagree with that for a number of reasons:
  I believe that these hearings are very important to explore key
issues on your record and your views; secondly, to proceed to devel-
op the Senate's judgment on the proper scope of inquiry into a
nominee's judicial philosophy; and, third, somewhat differently, to
discharge the Senate's constitutional duty to scrutinize a Supreme
Court nominee and make an independent judgment on the nomi-
nee's qualifications.
  I disagree with those who have described your judicial approach
as bland or vanilla. I yet do not know what flavor it is, but I am
convinced that it is not vanilla. And we will have to wait until the
final outcome of the hearings to see precisely where you fit into the
tradition of constitutional jurisprudence.
  In reading many of your opinions, in reading many of your
speeches, I note very profound philosophical strains running
through your approach to constitutional law. Those subjects that I
think are appropriate and really very important for inquiry. I have
noted your comment on executive power, for example, that Presi-
dents have significant degrees of discretion in defining their consti-
tutional powers. Today, there are many important issues on execu-
tive power which confront the nation, and specifically confront the
Congress.
  You have written landmark opinions on the good-faith exception
to the exclusionary rule, a dissent which started the Supreme
Court in that track. You have written a major opinion on the
Chadha decision. You have written about legal realism and origi-
nal intent. And during the course of the questioning, I think it is
important to see just where you are in the tradition of constitution-
al jurisprudence.
  When you and I talked privately, I commented on Chadha with
respect to whether that might reflect your underlying view about
the inadequacies of Congress's own action, and called your atten-
tion at that time to a very interesting statement, hardly bland,
where you said in one of your speeches that:

  The ultimate question, then, is whether the Chadha decision will he the catalyst
for some basic congressional changes. My view of this is not a sanguine one. I am
not sure what it will take for Congress to confront its own lack of self-discipline, its
own lack of party discipline, its own lack of principal course of action besides the
ethic of ensuring its re-election.

  I do not necessarily disagree with that conclusion, but the impor-
tance in an analysis of judicial philosophy is to what extent that
underlying approach had an effect on your decision in Chadha.
You have made a very interesting statement about original intent,
a subject of really great importance in terms of where the court is
going to go and how free Justices are to decide important constitu-
tional issues, free perhaps, to some extent, at least from original
intent. And you and I discussed this, again, at some length. I
intend to pursue it, but your comment on a symposium was,
                                       68

"There must be some demonstrated historical link between the
rule being advanced in the court and the announced declarations
and language of the framers." I think that is a subject which really
requires some analysis.

  You have moved from that position in a very erudite and philo-
sophical speech on constitutional law on the right of privacy and
the right to travel and the right to vote, and in that speech dealing
with the right to privacy, recognize that right perhaps in fairly em-
phatic terms. I do not want to draw any conclusions. The speech
speaks for itself. That will obviously be a subject of inquiry.

  But one of the very profound statements that you made in that
speech was your comparison of "essential rights in a just system or
essential rights in our constitutional system." Then you say that
the two are not coextensive, and I believe that that is a subject
which requires some examination as to whether there really is a
difference between a just system and our Constitution which
speaks to a just system.

  In that same speech, you made a reference to other constitution-
al provisions beyond the due process clause in a very interesting
way, and inquired into the subject as to whether equal protection
may have a broader application to homosexual rights than due
process, which was the basis of the Supreme Court's decision in the
Bowers case.

  Then in conclusion, you had made a fascinating reference to ar-
guable rights--you did not adopt them--as to education, nutrition,
and housing; and you really looked away from them as rights em-
bodied in the Constitution. But I do believe that your writings and
your decisions--decisions on school desegregation, on comparable
worth, on a large representation--pose really breadth of under-
standing and, as I read them, a balance and essential elements of
judicial restraint, but not judicial restraint to the extent of being
musclebound, in your interpretation of the Constitution. But there
is a great deal in your record which I think warrants inquiry in
our proceedings.

  On the subject of judicial philosophy, our introductory state-
ments today have already negated to some extent the conclusion of
harmony in these hearings. You have already heard a fair differ-
ence of views. And the first question I asked of you when you and I
sat down to talk--and I thank you for the almost 3 hours we spent
together in two extensive sessions. The first question I asked you
was whether you thought that judicial philosophy was an appropri-
ate subject for inquiry. You said you thought that it was, and we
proceeded to talk. And I did not ask you about your views on any
specific cases, and I would not in private or in public. But I do be-
lieve that there are broad parameters which are appropriate for
discussion. The only advice that I am going to give you on this sub-
ject is not to take any advice on this subject.

  That was the first question I asked of Judge Bork as well, wheth-
er he thought judicial--we were talking about judicial ideology at
that time, and Judge Bork said in response that he did not like the
term "ideology" because it had some political connotations, but he
thought judicial philosophy was an appropriate subject for inquiry.

  And it is true that some nominees have answered to a lesser
extent than have others. There was a very important article on
                                      69
this subject written by a lawyer named William H. Rehnquist back
in 1959, our current Chief Justice, when he took the Senate to task
in Judge Whittaker's confirmation proceeding for not asking Judge
Whittaker questions about due process of law and equal protection
of the law, because Lawyer Rehnquist thought that that was indis-
pensible in the Senate's discharge of its constitutional duties.

  When the subject came up with Justice Rehnquist on his confir-
mation proceedings for Chief Justice, he did answer a fair number
of questions in terms of the jurisdiction of the court and first
amendment rights; and, of course, Justice Scalia answered very few
questions, leading a number of us on this committee to consider a
sense of the Senate resolution on the appropriate scope of the in-
quiry. And Judge Bork's proceedings led to an extensive examina-
tion of judicial philosophy. My own sense is that within appropri-
ate parameters on generalized subjects it is appropriate. At least
speaking for myself, I intend to pursue it very much as we did in
our private discussions where no objection was raised to any of the
questions which I had asked at that time.

  The subject about our own independent role I think is one which
warrants a comment or two. There is widespread misunderstanding
about the Senate's role with many people thinking that it is a
party matter for an automatic approval as to what nominee the
President sends to the Senate. Some analogize it to the nomination
of a Cabinet officer. My own sense is that it is fundamentally dif-
ferent from a Cabinet officer who serves the pleasure of the Presi-
dent and during the term of the President.

  These proceedings constitute really the apex of the separation of
power under our Constitution. All three branches are involved. The
President makes the nomination; it is up to the Senate to consent
or not; and then the nominee who is successful goes to the court
and has the final word over both the executive branch and the leg-
islative branch. So there are really very important issues involved.

  I believe that the Senate has learned significantly from the con-
firmation proceedings as to Judge Bork. Prior to those hearings,
many on this committee had expressed conclusions. As of this
moment, that has not taken place. I think the Senate also learned
the error of the so-called rolling vote; that when some 51 Senators
had announced positions that then there was a call for Judge Bork
to withdraw. To his credit--and I said so contemporaneously with
his statement that Friday afternoon that he would not withdraw--
he did not. But the proceedings as to Judge Bork lacked the Sen-
ate's deliberative process because so many Senators expressed con-
clusions without the benefit of a Judiciary Committee report and
without the benefit of the debate. I think that we have learned
from that.

  As Judge Bork urged, voices should be lowered, and I think they
have been lowered. So I think progress has been made on all sides.

  It is an inexact process, I think. We all have a great deal to learn
from it, and I think that the great public attention and the great
public focus on these nominations is very much in the national in-
terest.

  In conclusion, I think it worth just a brief comment about one of
your concluding statements to me when we finished our brief dis-
cussion about 10 days ago, when you said did I think it was appro-
                                              70

priate under the advice and consent function for the Senate to give
advice to a nominee. And I responded that I thought that was up to
the nominee. But in the informal sessions which you have had with
all of us--and you had expressed this to me--you saw a keen sense
of interest by the Judiciary Committee, and it is reflected in the
entire Senate. And what we say to you both privately and publicly
reflects our own views which are distilled significantly from repre-
sentation, the majoritarian position we have as elected officials.

  So I do think there is something that we all learn from these
processes, and that an appropriate range of discussion--and I em-
phasize the word "appropriate." We should not go too far, but we
should go far enough. That is what, speaking for myself, I will at-
tempt to do.

  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. One thing you can be assured of, Judge, is you
will find the spectrum covered in this committee on the type of
advice you get. And it is all cost free.
  The Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, I commend you for moving rap-
idly in regards to these hearings. On November the 11th, Armistice
Day, Veterans' Day, Judge Kennedy was nominated. Here, 34 days
later, we are conducting his hearings. They have been set in the
closing week of this session of Congress when much activity is
going on in various matters and their will, of course, require the
presence of members of this committee on the floor and in other
places.
  Nevertheless, I feel that the Supreme Court needs the ninth
member, and I congratulate you on the effort to bring these hear-
ings to a speedy focus and on the effort for us to proceed.
  Two hundred years ago, the framers of the Constitution captured
the spirit of a struggling new nation in 52 words. These words form
the Preamble of the Constitution. I think most of us are familiar
with it, but just to set the tone for it I will quote a little of it.

  We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, estab-
lish justice, ensure domestic tranquility.

  I think we ought to look at the first three words of the Preamble,
"We the people." That is what this nation is all about, and that is
why the Constitution is so important, because it protects the rights
of all people: conservatives and liberals, extremists and moderates,
young and old, men and women, rich and poor. Some may argue
that the ability of the Constitution to be all-encompassing is its
greatest weakness. I would argue, therein lies its greatest strength.

  The Constitution is the cornerstone of our democracy, and if we
are to protect it, we must entrust it to men and women who will
respect its principles and its parameters. That is our function
today: to determine the fitness of this nominee for a lifetime posi-
tion on the Supreme Court. As Senators, we have a constitutional
mandate to provide advice and consent on this nomination.

  Judge Kennedy, in your questionnaire, you listed what you con-
sider to be the attributes of a good judge: compassion, warmth, sen-
sitivity, and an unyielding insistence on justice. I could not agree
with you more. But let me add two additional criteria: an under-
standing of the proper role of the judiciary as expressed in the Con-
                                      71

stitution, and a deep belief in and an unfaltering support for an in-
dependent judiciary.

  Judge Kennedy, in these hearings you will be questioned on your
views of the Constitution, your judicial philosophy, your commit-
ment to equal justice under the law. Your speeches will be scruti-
nized, and some of your opinions will be criticized. It is my hope
that you will respond to our questions as thoroughly as possible in
order that we may be better able to understand not just Judge
Kennedy, the lawyer or the judge, but Judge Kennedy, the man.

  In fulfilling my responsibility of advice and consent, I will keep
an open mind as I have endeavored to do in every other judicial
confirmation hearing. I believe the confirmation process should be
exercised in a judicial manner, without pre-decision leanings,
biases, or allegiances. To act otherwise makes the hearing proce-
dure a waste of time or a perfunctory process.

  My decision will be based on my own, and no one else's, assess-
ment of your commitment to the judicial system, the American
people and the Constitution. I am in full agreement with the late
Senator Sam Ervin when he said:

  Our greatest possession is not the vast domain; it is not our beautiful mountains
or our fertile prairies or our magnificent coastline. It is not our great productive
capacity; it is not the might of our Army or Navy. These things are of great impor-
tance. But in my judgment, the greatest and most precious possession of the Ameri-
can people is the Constitution.

  Judge Kennedy, if confirmed, you will be charged with safe-
guarding this most precious possession. The words in the Preamble
of the Constitution are not mere words in a document; they are our
lifeline. Judge Kennedy, it is a lifeline that you will be charged
with protecting, and one that must be extended to all. Judge Ken-
nedy, it is a life line--one that must be extended to all--that you
will be charged with protecting.

  Following the rejection of Judge Bork and the self-withdrawal of
Judge Ginsburg, the spotlights of the Justice Department, the
media, the various Bar Associations, outside partisan and special
interest groups, and the investigative forces of this committee have
focused on you. Thorough and exhaustive investigations have been
conducted. Your life history has been carefully dissected during the
past 34 days. Your opinions have been reviewed under a searching
judicial microscope. Your speeches have been read, re-read, and
read between the lines. Every closet in your life has been opened; a
few skeletons have been found. But thus far, none of the bones are
rattling.

  You are off to a good start, and I wish you good luck.

                         STATEMENT OF SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN
                ON THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY
 TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

                                        DECEMBER 14, 1987

MR. CHAIRMAN:

         I COMMEND YOU FOR MOVING RAPIDLY IN REGARDS TO THESE
HEARINGS. ON NOVEMBER THE 11TH, ARMISTICE DAY. VETERANS' DAY,
JUDGE KENNEDY WAS NOMINATED. HERE, 34 DAYS LATER, WE ARE
CONDUCTING HIS HEARINGS. THEY HAVE BEEN SET IN THE CLOSING
WEEK OF THIS SESSION OF CONGRESS WHEN MUCH ACTIVITY IS GOING ON
IN VARIOUS MATTERS AND WILL, OF COURSE, REQUIRE THE PRESENCE OF
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ON THE FLOOR AND OTHER PLACES.

         NEVERTHELESS, I FEEL THAT THE SUPREME COURT NEEDS THE
NINTH MEMBER, AND I CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE EFFORT TO BRING
THESE HEARINGS TO A SPEEDY FOCUS AND FOR US TO PROCEED.

         TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE FRAMERS OF THE CONSTITUTION
CAPTURED THE SPIRIT OF A STRUGGLING NEW NATION IN FIFTY-TWO
WORDS. THESE WORDS FORM THE PREAMBLE OF THE CONSTITUTION. I
THINK MOST OF US ARE FAHILIAR WITH IT, BUT JUST TO SET THE TONE
FOR IT I WILL QUOTE A LITTLE OF IT. "WE THE PEOPLE OF THE
UNITED STATES, IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, ESTABLISH
JUSTICE, INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY."
                                 73

         I THINK HE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THE FIRST THREE WORDS OF THE
PREAMBLE: WE THE PEOPLE. THAT IS WHAT THIS NATION IS ALL
ABOUT. AND THAT IS WHY THE CONSTITUTION IS SO IMPORTANT --
BECAUSE IT PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE -- CONSERVATIVES
AND LIBERALS. EXTREMISTS AND MODERATES, TOUNG AND OLD. MEN AND
WOMEN. RICH AND POOR. SOME MAT ARGUE THAT THE ABILITY OF THE
CONSTITUTION TO BE ALL ENCOMPASSING IS ITS GREATEST WEAKNESS.
I WOULD ARGUE. THEREIN LIES ITS GREATEST STRENGTH.

        THE CONSTITUTION IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND
IF WE ARE TO PROTECT IT. WE MUST ENTRUST IT TO MEN AND WOMEN
WHO WILL RESPECT ITS PRINCIPLES AND PARAMETERS. THAT IS OUR
FUNCTION TODAY. TO DETERMINE THE FITNESS OF THIS NOMINEE FOR A
LIFETIME POSITION ON THE SUPREME COURT. AS SENATORS WE HAVE A
CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE TO PROVIDE ADVICE AND CONSENT ON THIS
NOMINATION.

         JUDGE KENNEDY. IN YOUR QUESTIONNAIRE YOU LISTED WHAT YOU
CONSIDER TO BE THE ATTRIBUTES OF A GOOD JUDGE: "COMPASSION,
WARMTH, SENSITIVITY AND AN UNYIELDING INSISTENCE ON JUSTICE."
I COULD NOT AGREE WITH YOU MORE. BUT LET ME ADD TWO ADDITIONAL
CRITERIA: AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPER ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY
AS EXPRESSED IN THE CONSTITUTION. AND A DEEP BELIEF IN. AND
UNFALTERING SUPPORT FOR. AN INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY.
j  74

            JUDGE KENNEDY. IN THESE HEARINGS YOU WILL BE QUESTIONED
   ABOUT YOUR VIEWS OF THE CONSTITUTION, YOUR JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY.
   AND YOUR COMMITMENT TO EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW. YOUR
   SPEECHES WILL BE SCRUTINIZED. SOME OF YOUR OPINIONS WILL BE
   CRITICIZED.

            IT IS MY HOPE THAT YOU WILL RESPOND TO OUR QUESTIONS AS
   THOROUGHLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO
   UNDERSTAND, NOT JUST JUDGE KENNEDY, THE LAWYER OR THE JUDGE.
   BUT JUDGE KENNEDY THE MAN.

            IN FULFILLING MY RESPONSIBILITY OF ADVICE AND CONSENT, I
   WILL KEEP AN OPEN MIND AS I HAVE ENDEAVORED TO DO IN EVERY
   OTHER JUDICIAL CONFIRMATION HEARING. I BELIEVE THE
   CONFIRMATION PROCESS SHOULD BE EXERCISED IN A JUDICIAL MANNER
   WITHOUT PRE-DECISION LEANINGS, BIAS OR ALLEGIANCES. TO ACT
   OTHERWISE MAKES THE HEARING PROCEDURE A WASTE OF TIME OR A
   PERFUNCTORY PROCESS. MY DECISION WILL BE BASED ON MY OJ*U AND
   NO ONE ELSE'S ASSESSMENT OF YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE JUDICIAL
   SYSTEM, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE CONSTITUTION.

            I AM IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH THE LATE SENATOR SAM ERVIN
   WHEN HE SAID:

            "OUR GREATEST POSSESSION IS NOT THE VAST DOMAIN, IT'S NOT
            OUR BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS, OR OUR FERTILE PRAIRIES, OR OUR

        MAGNIFICENT COASTLINE. IT'S NOT OUR GREAT PRODUCTIVE
        CAPACITY. IT IS NOT THE MIGHT OF OUR ARMY OR NAVY. THESE
        THINGS ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE BUT IN MY JUDGEMENT. THE
        GREATEST AND MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION OF THE AMERICAN
         PEOPLE IS THE CONSTITUTION."

         JUDGE KENNEDY. IF CONFIRMED. YOU WILL BE CHARGED WITH
SAFEGUARDING THIS MOST PRECIOUS POSSESSION.

        THE WORDS IN THE PREAMBLE OF THE CONSTITUTION ARE NOT MERE
WORDS IN A DOCUMENT. THEY ARE OUR LIFELINE. JUDGE KENNEDY,
IT IS A LIFELINE THAT YOU WILL BE CHARGED WITH PROTECTING, AND
ONE WHICH MUST BE EXTENDED TO ALL.

        FOLLOWING THE REFECTION OF JUDGE BORK AND THE
SELF-WITHDRAWAL OF JUDGE GINSBURG, THE SPOTLIGHTS OF THE
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. THE MEDIA, THE VARIOUS BAR ASSOCIATIONS,
OUTSIDE PARTISAN AND SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, AND THE
INVESTIGATIVE FORCES OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE FOCUSED ON YOU.
THOROUGH AND EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED.
YOUR LIFE HISTORY HAS BEEN CAREFULLY DISSECTED DURING THE PAST
34 DAYS. YOUR OPINIONS HAVE REVIEWED UNDER A SEARCHING
JUDICIAL MICROSCOPE. YOUR SPEECHES HAVE BEEN READ. RE-READ.
AND READ BETWEEN THE LINES. EVERY CLOSET IN YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN
OPENED; A FEW SKELETONS HAVE BEEN FOUND. BUT THUS FAR. NONE OF
THE BONES ARE RATTLING.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator, for that colorful description.
[Laughter.]

  Maybe the Senator from New Hampshire can conclude and put
some flesh on the bones for us. Senator Humphrey.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Kennedy, congratulations on your nomination, and wel-
come to you and each member of your family. My colleagues have
said, I think, all that needs to be said at this point--perhaps more
than needs to be said at this point. I will make a contribution to
efficiency rare around this place by putting my statement in the
record.

                             SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
        HEARINGS ON THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE ANTHONY KENNEDY

                             FOR THE U.S. SUPREME COURT
                                     DECEMBER 14, 1987

                  STATEMENT OF SENATOR GORDON J. HUMPHREY

        JUDGE KENNEDY, WELCOME TO THESE COMMITTEE HEARINGS.
        I BELIEVE IT TAKES SPECIAL CHARACTER AND COMMITMENT TO
SUBMIT TO A PROCESS WHICH HAS NOW BECOME A PUBLIC ORDEAL. I
APPLAUD YOUR WILLINGNESS TO GO THROUGH THIS GRUELLING PROCESS
FOR THE GOOD OP THE COUNTRY AND THE COURT.
        I WILL MAKE NO SECRET OF THE FACT THAT I DEEPLY REGRET
THE SENATE'S REFUSAL TO CONFIRM JUDGE BORK FOR THIS VACANCY.
HE WAS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO
THE COURT'S WORK AND THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LAW. HE
WOULD HAVE BROUGHT A PROFOUND APPRECIATION FOR THE LIMITS OF
THE JUDICIAL ROLE TO THE HIGH COURT -- LIMITS WHICH THE
COURTS TOO FREQUENTLY IGNORE IN THIS ERA OF JUDICIAL POLICY-
MAKING.
        IT IS A GENUINE HISTORICAL TRAGEDY THAT THE PUBLIC
DISTORTION OF JUDGE BORK'S RECORD KEPT HIM FROM THE SEAT
WHICH HE SO CLEARLY DESERVED TO FILL.
        BUT THAT BATTLE IS OVER, FOR NOW, AND IT IS TIME TO MOVE
ON. IF NOTHING ELSE, I HOPE THAT LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE EX-
CESSES OF THE BORK HEARINGS WILL LEAD TO MORE RESTRAINED
TREATMENT OF JUDGE KENNEDY AND THE NOMINEES OF FUTURE YEARS.
        I HAVE CAREFULLY EXPLORED JUDGE KENNEDY'S EXTENSIVE
JUDICIAL RECORD, AND IT IS A SOUND AND RESPONSIBLE ONE. IT
SHOWS PROPER RESPECT FOR THE LANGUAGE AND PRINCIPLES OF THE
CONSTITUTION, AND FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PREROGATIVES OF THE
ELECTED LAWMAKERS. IT GENERALLY SHOWS KEEN APPRECIATION FOR
FOR THE OBLIGATIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF THE JUDICIAL ROLE.
        HIS OPINIONS IN THE CRIMINAL LAW AREA ARE ESPECIALLY
COMMENDABLE. IN SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CRIMINAL LAW
CONTROVERSIES OF THE DAY, JUDGE KENNEDY'S OPINIONS AND
DISSENTS HAVE LATER BEEN FOLLOWED BY THE SUPREME COURT. HIS
SOUND REASONING HAS LED HIM TO REJECT ATTEMPTS TO HAMPER LAW
ENFORCEMENT WITH ARTIFICIAL BARS TO THE USE OF RELEVANT
EVIDENCE AGAINST DANGEROUS CRIMINALS. AT THE SAME TIME, HE
HAS TAKEN STRONG STANDS TO UPHOLD THE RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED
AND REVERSE CONVICTIONS WHERE THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES.
        IN A DIFFERENT AREA, JUDGE KENNEDY'S OPINION IN THE
COMPARABLE WORTH CASE OF AFSCME V. STATE OF WASHINGTON WAS
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COURT OF APPEALS DECISIONS OF THE
DECADE. THAT DECISION PROPERLY REJECTED AN EXTREME
INTERPRETATION OF TITLE VII WHICH WOULD HAVE COST THE STATE
OF WASHINGTON NEARLY ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND UNDERMINED THE
MOST FUNDAMENTAL PREMISES OF A RATIONAL, COMPETITIVE LABOR
MARKET. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT UPHELD THE PRINCIPLE THAT
LEGISLATURES, NOT COURTS, SHOULD MAKE THE POLICY DECISIONS
GOVERNING OUR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC WELFARE.
                                          78

             I CANNOT AGREE WITH ALL OF JUDGE KENNEDY'S OPINIONS. IN
    A PEW CASES -- SUCH AS HIS EXPANSIVE DISCUSSION OF
    SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS IN THE CASE OF BEI.LF.R V. MIDDENDORF
    -- HE HAS SEEMED TO STRAY SOMEWHAT FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF
    JUDICIAL RESTRAINT WHICH HE USUALLY FOLLOWS. BUT EVEN IN THAT
    CASE HE REACHED THE CORRECT RESULT, AS LATER CONFIRMED BY THE
    SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN BOWERS V. HARDWICK.

             ON THE WHOLE, HIS JUDICIAL RECORD IS EXEMPLARY AND
    SOUND. ANY ATTEMPT TO SUGGEST THAT JUDGE KENNEDY IS NOT
   WITHIN THE SO-CALLED "MAINSTREAM" IS IMPLAUSIBLE. EVEN THOSE
    OF HIS OPINIONS WHICH HAY BE CRITICIZED BY HOSTILE WITNESSES
    -- SUCH AS HIS COMPARABLE WORTH OPINION AND HIS DECISION
   UPHOLDING THE NAVY'S RIGHT TO DISCHARGE HOMOSEXUALS IN THE
   BEI.LER CASE -- APE CONSISTENT WITH RESULTS REACHED BY
    NUMEROUS OTHER FEDERAL APPEALS COURTS.

             THE TEST FOR ME, THOUGH, IS NOT WHETHER HE IS WITHIN
    SOME SELECTIVE NOTION OF THE "MAINSTREAM"; IT IS WHETHER HE
    IS FAITHFUL TO THE CONSTITUTION AND THE LIMITS OF THE
   JUDICIAL ROLE.

             FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AND READ SO FAR, JUDGE KENNEDY
   SHOULD PASS THAT MORE IMPORTANT TEST. I HOPE HIS TESTIMONY
   AND HIS ANSWERS TO MY COLLEAGUES' QUESTIONS WILL REENFORCE
   THAT BELIEF.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  The Senator from Ohio.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Following Senator Humphrey's lead, Sen-
ator Simon asked me to put his statement in the record as well.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sure they will be compatible. Without objec-
tion, both will be entered.
  [The statement of Senator Simon follows:]

                           Opening Statement of Senator Simon

         Judge Kennedy, I would like to welcome you and your family
this morning.

         If you are confirmed as the next Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court, you will be asked to decide some of the most
sensitive and controversial issues of American life. The
Supreme Court has a special role in making good the promise of
liberty in our Constitution. The words that say it best have
been carved across the entrance to the Court itself: "Equal
Justice Under Law." That is what the Supreme Court represents,
and so should every Justice of that Court.

         Unlike most of my colleagues on the Committee, I am not a
lawyer, so I will not be asking about technical legal rules or
doctrines. My concern is this basic one--will Judge Kennedy be
fair? Will he be sensitive to individual rights? Will he
safeguard the constitutional protections of all Americans?
Will he pay particular regard to the rights of women, to the
rights of minorities, sometimes ignored in our nation's
history? Will he represent "Equal Justice Under Law"?

          I want a nominee who is open-minded, not a man with a
mission; a judge who will listen carefully to every argument
and decide on the basis of law, not philosophy. I want a
Supreme Court Justice who understands and applies not only the
letter of the Constitution, but its spirit as well. These are
the qualities I looked for in Judge Bork, and they are the
criteria I will apply to any Supreme Court nominee.

          Judge Kennedy, I have reviewed your record on the federal
bench and I see some very positive signs. But I do have some
concerns, and some questions. I look forward to your
 testimony.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, it is 12:00 o'clock. I think rather than
swear you right now, Judge--which I was going to do--to the great
disappointment of the photographers--who I enjoy disappointing
on occasion in light of the pictures I see of myself in the press--I
think what we will do is we will wait until 1 o'clock, bring you
back, swear you in, and then I will ask you to introduce your
family, make your opening statement. Then we will begin the first
round of questioning.

  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will reconvene at 1 o'clock. The hearing is
recessed until then.
  [Whereupon, at 11:58 a.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 1:00 p.m., the same day.]

                                        AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  I yield to my colleague from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, Senator Bob Dole has sent
over a statement to be placed in the record favoring Judge Kenne-
dy's confirmation to the Supreme Court. I ask unanimous consent
it be put in the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be placed in the record.

              CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR JUDGE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY

MR. CHAIRMAN:

       IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF JUDGE ANTHONY
M. KENNEDY, WHO HAS BEEN NOMINATED TO SERVE AS AN ASSOCIATE
JUSTICE ON THE SUPREME COURT.

       FILLING THIS SEAT, AS EVERYONE IS WELL AWARE, HAS BEEN A
TRIAL -- SO TO SPEAK. BUT IN JUDGE KENNEDY, I BELIEVE PRESIDENT
REAGAN HAS NOMINATED A JURIST WHO FULFILLS ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT
REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH AN IMPORTANT POSITION..

       JUDGE KENNEDY IS A GRADUATE OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, AND HAS STUDIED AT THE LONDON SCHOOL OF
ECONOMICS. HE PURSUED A SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN PRIVATE PRACTICE,
AND HAS SERVED AS PROFESSOR OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AT THE MCGEORGE
 SCHOOL OF LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC.

        SINCE 1976 .JUDGE KENNEDY HAS SERVED AS A MEMBER OF THE
 UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE 9TH CIRCUIT, WHICH
 INCLUDES ALASKA, ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, HAWAII, IDAHO, MONTANA,
 NEVADA, OREGON, AND WASHINGTON. DURING HIS TENURE AS AN
 APPELLATE JUDGE HE HAS HANDED DOWN LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF
 OPINIONS. THOSE, COMBINED WITH HIS WRITINGS, PROVIDE AN LARGE

                                                       - 2-

BODY OF WORK TO ILLUSTRATE JUDGE KENNEDY'S JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY.
AND NONE OF THESE POSITIONS ARE SO EXTREME THAT THEY FELL OUTSIDE
THE MAINSTREAM OF AMERICAN OPINION.

       IN FACT, JUDGE KENNEDY'S WORK IS OF SUCH A CALIBER THAT THE
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION UNANIMOUSLY VOTED HIM ITS HIGHEST
APPROVAL RATING.

       MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE HAS BEEN AN EMPTY SEAT ON THE SUPREME
COURT SINCE SUMMER. ALREADY THIS TERM, THE COURT HAS HAD TO
AFFIRM A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CASES BECAUSE OF SPLIT DECISIONS.
THIS IS NO WAY FOR THE HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND TO FUNCTION. IT
IS A DISSERVICE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND TO OUR SYSTEM OF
JUSTICE.

        IN JUDGE KENNEDY WE HAVE A JURIST WITH IMPECCABLE
PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL CREDENTIALS -- A CONSERVATIVE IN THE
FINE TRADITION OF JUDGE LEWIS POWELL, THE JUDGE HE IS REPLACING.
 I WOULD NEVER ADVOCATE EITHER THIS COMMITTEE OR THE SENATE AS A
WHOLE RUSHING THROUGH THE CONFIRMATION PROCESS. BUT WE DO NEED
TO ACT EXPEDITIOUSLY. AND WITH AS QUALIFIED A CANDIDATE AS JUDGE
 KENNEDY IT SHOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO DO.

        SO, MR. CHAIRMAN I HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE, AND THE ENTIRE
 SENATE, WILL CONFIRM THE KENNEDY NOMINATION, SO THAT HE CAN TAKE
 HIS PLACE ON THE BENCH SHORTLY AFTER THE NEW YEAR AND SO THE
 SUPREME COURT CAN MOVE FORWARD TO CARRY OUT ITS IMPORTANT
 RESPONSIBILITIES.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, would you stand to be sworn?
  Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give will be
the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
  Judge KENNEDY. I do so swear.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Judge. Welcome back.
  Do you have an opening statement you would like to make?

      TESTIMONY OF HON. ANTHONY M. KENNEDY TO BE AN
            ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator; if I may make just a few
remarks.

  The CHAIRMAN. Take as much time as you like.
  Judge KENNEDY. I most appreciate the gracious welcome from
the members of the committee this morning, from Senator Wilson
and from the two distinguished Congressmen from their districts in
Sacramento, all three of whom I have known for a number of
years.
  This is an appropriate time for me to thank the President for en-
trusting me with the honor of appearing before you as his nominee
for Associate Justice of the United States. My family shares in ex-
tending our deep and great appreciation for this or his confidence
in me.
  I wish also to thank the members of your committee, Mr. Chair-
man, for the most interesting and impressive set of meetings that I
have had with you and Members of the Senate as a whole over the
last 4 weeks. These are denominated "courtesy calls" in the
common parlance, as I understand it. It seems to me that that is
perhaps a somewhat casual term for what is a very important and
significant part of the advice and consent process.
  In a number of these advise and consent discussions, Mr. Chair-
man, you or your colleagues indicated that you wanted to explain
to me your own views, your own convictions, your own ideas, your
own concerns about the Constitution of the United States. You
have indicated that no reply or response was expected from me.
And in every case, Mr. Chairman, I was profoundly impressed by
the deep commitment to constitutional rule and the deep commit-
ment to judicial independence that each Member of the United
States Senate has.
  I wish your workload were such that you could give the experi-
ence that I have had to every nominee for appointment to the
courts in the article III system.
  Now, Mr. Chairman, I understand that it is appropriate, and at
your invitation, to introduce my family who are here with me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Please do.
  Judge KENNEDY. My oldest son, Justin, is a recent graduate of
Stanford and is now an assistant project manager for a major cor-
porate relocation in Sacramento. We are delighted to have him
home with us in Sacramento.
  His brother, Gregory, our other son, is a senior at Stanford, and I
am authorized to assure the committee that he has taken the
LSAT test and is on his way to law school.
  Our youngest child is Kristin, who is now a sophomore at Stan-
ford majoring in liberal arts, particularly English-and history.

   Finally, my wife Mary, who has the love and admiration of our
family and also of her 30 students in the Golden Empire School in
Sacramento. They most appreciate your invitation to be with us
here today, Mr. Chairman.

  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. We welcome you all here. I surely do not envy
your tuition bill. [Laughter.]
  Judge KENNEDY. I am glad that is part of the record, Mr. Chair-
man.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is a sacrifice you are making, and I mean that
sincerely.
  Please move forward, Judge, if you would like.
  Judge KENNEDY. That concludes my opening remarks, Mr. Chair-
man. I am ready to receive questions from you and your committee
members.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, let me explain to you, and to my col-
leagues, how the ranking member and I would like to proceed
today. That is, as has been the custom in the recent past, we will
allow each Senator to question you up to a half an hour, hopefully
to have some continuity to the questions, and allow both you full
time to answer the questions and they to flesh out the line of ques-
tioning they wish to pursue.
  It is my hope, although not my expectation, that we will com-
plete one round of questioning today. We will stop, though, at 6
o'clock, or as close to 6 o'clock as we can get. And at approximately
3:15, we will take a break for 15 minutes or so to give you an op-
portunity to stretch your legs and maybe get a cup of coffee or
whatever you would like.
  Judge, I will begin my first round here by telling you at the
outset that I would like to pursue or touch on three areas in my
first round. One is the question of unenumerated rights, and if
there are such, if they exist under our Constitution. Secondly, as a
matter, quite frankly, more of housekeeping and for the record,
with you under oath, I would like to question you about your meet-
ings with Justice Department, White House and other officials, and
whether or not any commitments were elicited or made. I quite
frankly must tell you at the outset I have had long discussions and
full cooperation from the White House in this matter, and I am
satisfied; but I think we should have it under oath what transpired
and what did not.

  Thirdly, if time permits--which it probably will not--I would
like to discuss with you a little bit about your views on the role of
precedent as a Supreme Court Justice. Ofttimes, it is mentioned
here that we unanimously voted for you when you came up as a
circuit court appointee, and that is an honor. You are to be con-
gratulated. But as you well know, we unanimously vote for almost;
everybody who comes up. Ninety-eight percent of all those that
come before the Congress are unanimously approved of. That is in
no way to denigrate the support shown to you by us in your previ-
ous appearance here, but it is to indicate that, as you know better
than most of us, the role of a lower court judge and the role of a
Supreme Court judge are different. They are both to seek out and
find justice under the Constitution, but lower court judges are
bound by precedent. They do not have the authority, the constitu-
                                          85

tional authority to alter Supreme Court decisions. But as a Su-
preme Court Justice, you obviously will have that authority, and I
would like at some point to discuss to what extent you think that
authority resides in a member of the court.

  Judge Kennedy, let me begin, though, with the unenumerated
rights question, which occupied a great deal of our time in the
prior hearing--not your prior hearing, but the prior hearing with
Judge Bork.

  Judge Kennedy, in your 1986 speech on unenumerated rights
which, if I am not mistaken--I have a copy of it here--was entitled
"Unenumerated Rights and the Dictates of Judicial Restraint," in
that speech you place great emphasis on the specific text of the
Constitution as a guidepost for the court. You said, for example--
and I quote from the concluding page of that speech--

  I recognize, too, that saying the constitutional text must be our principal refer-
ence is in a sense simply to restate the question what that text means. But uncer-
tainty over precise standards of interpretation does not justify failing to attempt to
construct them, and still less does it justify flagrant departures.

  What we finH out today, or at least I do, is how you go about at-
tempting to cox., ti. ~n, such standards of interpretation. As I read
your speech vou we?" "cerned that unenumerated rights articu-
lated by the Pui-remc Court, such as the right of privacy, but not
exclusively I tinted to that, in your words "have a readily discerni-
ble basis in the Constitution." But you also recognize, Judge Ken-
nedy, that the text of the Constitution is not always, to use your
phrase, I believe, "a definitive guide."

  On two separate occasions, in August of 1987 and February of
1984, you have described the Due Process Clause, which, of course,
contains the word "liberty," the 14th amendment. You described
that as a spacious phrase. That seems to--well, let me not suggest
what it suggests.

  The point I want to raise with you is there seems to be an under-
lying tension here; that you talk about liberty as being a spacious
phrase, and you insist at the same time that the constitutional text
must be our principal reference.

  Although 1 have my own view of what you mean by that--and
they are not incompatible, those two phrases, as I see it--I would
like you to give us your view of the liberty clause. Do you believe
that the textual reference to liberty in the 5th and 14th amend-
ments and in the Preamble of the Constitution provides a basis for
certain fundamental unenumerated rights?

  Judge KENNEDY. Senator, of course, the great tension, the great
debate, the great duality in constitutional law--and this has been
true since the court first undertook to interpret the Constitution
200 years ago--has been between what the text says and what the
dictates of the particular case require from the standpoint of jus-
tice and from the standpoint of our constitutional tradition. The
point of my remarks--and we can talk about the Canadian speech
in detail, if you choose--was that it is really the great role of the
judge to try to discover those standards that implement the inten-
tion of the framers.

  The framers were very careful about the words they used. They
were excellent draftsmen. They had drawn 11 constitutions for the
separate states. This, they recognized, was a unique undertaking.
But the words of the Constitution must be the beginning of our in-
quiry.

   Now, how far can you continue that inquiry away from the
words of the text? Your question is whether or not there are unen-
umerated rights. To begin with, most of the inquiries that the Su-
preme Court has conducted in cases of this type have centered
around the word "liberty." Now, the framers used that, what I call
"spacious phrase," both in the fifth amendment, almost contempo-
raneous with the Constitution, and again in the 14th amendment
they reiterated it.

   The framers had an idea which is central to Western thought.
   The CHAIRMAN. Western thought?
   Judge KENNEDY. Thought. It is central to our American tradi-
tion. It is central to the idea of the rule of law. That is there is a
zone of liberty, a zone of protection, a line that is drawn where the
individual can tell the Government: Beyond this line you may not
go.

   Now, the great question in constitutional law is: One, where is
that line drawn? And, two, what are the principles that you refer
to in drawing that line?

   The CHAIRMAN. But there is a line.
  Judge KENNEDY. There is a line. It is wavering; it is amorphous;
it is uncertain. But this is the judicial function.
  The CHAIRMAN. It is not unlike, as I understand what you have
said, one of your predecessors--if you are confirmed--discussing
shared traditions and historic values of our people in making that
judgment, and another of your predecessors suggesting that there
is a right to be let alone, left alone.

   Let me ask you, Judge Kennedy, Justice Harlan, one of the great
true conservative Justices, in my view, of this century, had a simi-
lar concern; and as I understand it--correct me if I am wrong--
expressed it not dissimilarly to what you are saying when he said
no formula could serve as a substitute in this area for judgment
and restraint, and that there were not any "mechanical yard-
sticks" or "mechanical answers."

   Do you agree with the essence of what Justice Harlan was
saying?

   Judge KENNEDY. It is hard to disagree with that. That was the
second Mr. Justice Harlan. Remember, though, Senator, that the
object of our inquiry is to use history, the case law, and our under-
standing of the American constitutional tradition in order to deter-
mine the intention of the document broadly expressed.

   One of the reasons why, in my view, the decisions of the Su-
preme Court of the United States have such great acceptance by
the American people is because of the perception by the people
that the Court is being faithful to a compact that was made 200
years ago. The framers sat down in a room for three months. They
put aside politics; they put aside religion; they put aside personal
differences. And they acted as statesmen to draw a magnificent
document. The object of our inquiry is to see what that document
means.

   The CHAIRMAN. Judge, it will come as no surprise to you that
one of the storm centers of our last debate and discussion was
                                          87

whether or not there were unenumerated rights and whether the
document was expansive.

  Would you agree with Justice Harlan that, despite difficult ques-
tions in this area, the Court still has a clear responsibility to act to
protect unenumerated rights, although where it draws that line de-
pends on the particular Justice's view?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, although I am not sure that he spoke in
exactly those terms.

  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I am not quoting him.
  Judge KENNEDY. I am not trying to quibble, but it may well be
the better view, rather than talk in terms of unenumerated rights
to recognize that we are simply talking about whether or not liber-
ty extends to situations not previously addressed by the courts, to
protections not previously announced by the courts.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let us be more fundamental than that. There
are certain rights that the courts over the years have concluded
that Americans have either retained for themselves or have been
granted that do not find specific reference in the Constitution--the
right of privacy being one, as you pointed out in your speech, the
right to travel.
  So what we are talking about here, what I am attempting to talk
about here and you are responding, is that whether or not in the
case of the 14th amendment the word "liberty" encompasses a
right that maybe heretofore has not been articulated by the court
and does not find residence in some text in the Constitution, and
whether or not the ninth amendment means anything.
  Could you tell me what the ninth amendment means to you?
And for the record, let me read it. I know you know it well. "The
enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be con-
strued to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
  Can you tell me what you think the framers meant by that?
  Judge KENNEDY. I wish I had a complete answer. The ninth
amendment has been a fascination to judges and to students of the
Constitution for generations.
  When Madison--and he was the principal draftsman of the Bill
of Rights--wrote the Bill of Rights, he wanted to be very sure that
his colleagues, the voters, and the world understood that he did not
have the capacity to foresee every verbal formulation that was nec-
essary for the protection of the individual. He was writing and pre-
senting a proposal at a time when State constitutions were still
being drafted, and he knew that some State constitutions, for in-
stance the Virginia Bill of Rights went somewhat further than the
Constitution of the United States.
  In my view, one of his principal purposes, simply as a statesman,
was to give assurance that this was not a proclamation of every
right that should be among the rights of a free people.
  Now, going beyond that, I think the sense of your question is:
Does the ninth amendment have practical significance
  Senator THURMOND. Please keep your voice up so we can hear
you.
  Judge KENNEDY. Does the ninth amendment have practical sig-
nificance in the ongoing determination of constitutional cases?
  As you know, the Court has rarely found occasion to refer to it.
It seems to me the Court is treating it as something of a reserve
clause, to be held in the event that the phrase "liberty" and the
other spacious phrases in the Constitution appear to be inadequate
for the Court's decision.

   The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I do not want to hurt your prospects any,
but I happen to agree with you, and I find comfort in your ac-
knowledgement that it had a purpose.

  There are some who argue it has no purpose. Some suggest it
was a water blot in the Constitution. But I read it as you do. It
does not make either of us right, but it indicates that there is some
agreement, and I think the historical text, and the debate sur-
rounding the Constitution sustains the broad interpretation you
have just applied.

  And is it fair to say that in the debate about unenumerated
rights, and the right of privacy in particular, that there is a ques-
tion of crossing the line, acknowledging the existence of unenumer-
ated rights, and the existence of the right of privacy? The real
debate for the last 40 years has been on this side of the line, among
those who sit on the bench and the Supreme Court, who acknowl-
edge that there is, in fact, for example, a right to privacy, but
argue vehemently as to how far that right extends.

  Some believe that extends only to a right of privacy to married
couples. Others would argue, and will argue, I assume at some
point, that that right of privacy extends to consensual homosexual
activity. But the debate has been on this side of the line, that is, as
to how far the right extends, not if the right exists.

  Do you have any doubt that there is a right of privacy? I am not
asking you where you draw the line, but that it does exist and can
be found, protected within the Constitution?

  Judge KENNEDY. It seems to me that most Americans, most law-
yers, most judges, believe that liberty includes protection of a value
that we call privacy. Now, as we well know, that is hardly a self-
defining term, and perhaps we will have more discussions about
that.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I would like to go back to that, if my col-
leagues have not covered it. I only have about 10 minutes under
my own rules, and I would like to settle, if we can at the outset
here, the question of whether or not any commitments were given,
or were asked for.

  In your questionnaire, you identified at least seven different sets
of meetings, and a number of phone calls that you had with White
House staff, or Justice Department personnel before you were actu-
ally nominated by the President.

  Let me ask you this first. Since completing your questionnaire,
have you recalled any other meetings, or conversations of any type,
that have not already been identified, and that took place before
your actual nomination?

  Judge KENNEDY. NO, I have not recalled any such additional in-
stances.

  The CHAIRMAN. TO be absolutely clear, I am asking you here
about direct communications of any type with the White House or
Justice Department, as well as indirect communications such as
through some third party or intermediary. That is, someone
coming to you, asking your view, and that view being transmitted
                                          89

through that person back to anyone connected with the Adminis-
tration.

  Judge KENNEDY. I understood that question in the sense that you
describe when I answered the questionnaire, and I understand it
that way now. The conversations that I described were the only
conversations that occurred.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I appreciate your cooperating in this
matter, but I hope you understand why it is important.

  Let's look at, if you will, the October 28th meeting that you iden-
tified. According to your questionnaire, that meeting was attended
by Howard Baker, Kenneth Duberstein, A. B. Culvahouse, Mr.
Meese, and Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reyn-
olds.

  Were you asked at that meeting how you would rule on any legal
issue?

  Judge KENNEDY. I was not; I was asked no question which came
even close to the zone of what I would consider infringing on judi-
cial independence. I was asked no question which even came close
to the zone of what I would consider improper. I was asked no
question which came even close to the zone of eliciting a volun-
teered comment from me as to how I would rule on any particular
case, or on any pending issue.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, were you asked about your personal opin-
ion on any controversial issue?

  Judge KENNEDY. I was not.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did anyone ask you what, as a personal matter,
you thought of any issue or case?
  Judge KENNEDY. NO such questions were asked, and I volun-
teered no such comments.
  The CHAIRMAN. And were you asked anything about cases cur-
rently before the Court?
  Judge KENNEDY. NO, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. I realize there is some redundancy in those ques-
tions, but is important, again, for the record.
  Now, Judge, there was--if I can move to the end here--there was
some newspaper comment about a meeting that took place after
you had been nominated.
  Let me ask you the question. Did you meet with any sitting
United States Senators prior to your being nominated by the Presi-
dent?
  Judge KENNEDY. NO.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW let me turn to that period, now, after the
nomination.
  Judge KENNEDY. NOW let's be precise, however. I think the nomi-
nation was sent to the Senate some weeks after it was announced.
  The CHAIRMAN. I beg your pardon. From the time the President
had announced his intention
  Judge KENNEDY. At the time I had already met with you and a
number of Senators, but if the demarcation in your question is as
to the time the President made the announcement in the White
House
  The CHAIRMAN. That is what I mean.
  Judge KENNEDY. The answer is no, I had not met with any
United States Senators prior to that time.
                                          90

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW I would like to speak with you about the
same issues, subsequent to the President standing with you and an-
nouncing to all of the world that you were going to be his nominee.

  Have you made any commitments or promises to anyone in order
to obtain their support for your nomination?

  Judge KENNEDY. I have not done so, and I would consider it
highly improper to do so.

  The CHAIRMAN. SO just to make the record clear, you made no
promise to any Member of the Senate on anything?

  Judge KENNEDY. Other than that I would be frank and candid in
my answers.

  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, I am not doubting you for a minute. As I
am sure you are aware, though, one of my colleagues is reported to
have spoken with you about the issue of abortion on November the
12th at a meeting at the White House.

  Let me read to you--and I am sure you have seen the text--from
a newspaper article by a columnist named Cal Thomas. And Mr.
Thomas says the following happened. I am quoting from his article.

  Republican Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina told me that he and Judge
Kennedy met in a private room at the White House on November the 12th.

  Then a quote within a quote.

  "I think you know where I stand on abortion," Mr. Helms said to Judge Kennedy.
  Judge Kennedy smiled and answered, "Indeed I do, and I admire it. I am a prac-
ticing Catholic."

  The article then goes on to say:

  Judge Kennedy did not elaborate, but Mr. Helms interpreted the response to
mean that Judge Kennedy is opposed to abortion and would look favorably on any
case in which the Court's earlier decisions striking down the abortion laws of all 50
States might be overturned.

  A bit later in the column, Mr. Thomas continued:

  "I am certain as I can be," said Mr. Helms, "without having heard him say I shall
vote to reverse Roe v. Wade--which of course he wasn't going to say--on what he
called this 'privacy garbage'--recent Supreme Court decisions involving not only
abortion but civil rights, protections for homosexuals--Mr. Helms indicated a cer-
tain collegiality with what he believes to be Judge Kennedy's views."

  Ultimately though, said, Mr. Helms, quote, "Who knows?," but,
quote, "That's where we are with any of the nominees." End of
quote. End of column.

  Could you, for the record, characterize for us how accurate or in-
accurate you think that column is.

  Judge KENNEDY. I have not seen that column, but I have ab-
sorbed it from what you have said, Senator.

  To begin with, I think it is important to say that if I had an un-
disclosed intention, or a fixed view on a particular case, an abso-
lutely concluded position on a particular case or a particular issue,
perhaps I might be obligated to disclose that to you.

  I do not have any such views with reference to privacy, or abor-
tion, or the other subjects there mentioned, and therefore, I was
not attempting, and would not attempt to try to signal, by infer-
ence, or by indirection, my views on those subjects.

  The conversation that you referred to was wide-ranging, and of a
personal nature. The Senator asked me about my family and my
                                          91

character, and I told him, as I have told others of you, that I
admire anyona^ith strong moral beliefs.

  Now it would be highly improper for a judge to allow his, or her,
own personal or religious views to enter into a decision respecting
a constitutional matter. There are many books that I will not read,
that I do not let, or these days do not recommend, my children
read. That does not prohibit me from enforcing the first amend-
ment because those books are protected by the first amendment.

  A man's, or a woman's, relation to his, or her, God, and the fact
that he, or she, may think they are held accountable to a higher
power, may be important evidence of a person's character and tem-
perament. It is irrelevant to his, or her, judicial authority. When
we decide cases we put such matters aside, and as--I think it
was--Daniel Webster said, "Submit to the judgment of the nation
as a whole."

  The CHAIRMAN. SO Judge, when you said--if it is correct--to Sen-
ator Helms: "Indeed I do, and I admire it, I am a practicing Catho-
lic," you were not taking, at that point a position on the constitu-
tional question that has been and continues to be before the Court?

  Judge KENNEDY. TO begin with, that was not the statement.
  The CHAIRMAN. Will you tell us what
  Judge KENNEDY. We had a wide-ranging discussion and those two
matters were not linked.
  The CHAIRMAN. Those two matters were not linked. So the arti-
cle is incorrect?
  Judge KENNEDY. In my view, yes.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is fine. I thank you. My time is up. I yield
to my colleague from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Kennedy, a fundamental principle of American judicial
review is respect for precedent, for the doctrine of stare decisis.
This doctrine promoted certainty in the administration of the law,
yet at least over 180 times in its history, the Supreme Court has
overruled one or more of its precedents, and more than half of
these overruling opinions have been issued in the last 37 years.
  Judge Kennedy, would you tell the committee what factors you
believe attribute to this increase in overruling previous opinions.
  Judge KENNEDY. That is a far-ranging question, Senator, which
would be an excellent law review article, but let me suggest a few
factors.
  First, there is a statistical way to fend off your question, by
pointing out that the Supreme Court hears many more cases now
than it formerly did. You will recall, in the early days of the Re-
public, when some cases were argued for days.
  The CHAIRMAN. He may be the only one able to recall the early
days of the Republic, here, on the committee. [Laughter.]
  Judge KENNEDY. I was using "you" in the institutional sense,
Senator. And that has changed.
  Secondly, the Court has taken many more public-law cases on its
docket.
  And thirdly, there are simply many, many more precedents for
the Court to deal with, and so the adjustment, the policing, the
shaping of the contours of our law simply require more over ruling,
as a statistical matter.
                                          92

   That does seem, though, to be not quite a complete answer to
your question, because your question invites at least exploration of
the idea whether or not the Supreme Court has changed its own
role, or its own view of, its role in the system, or has changed the
substantive law, and it has.

   In the last 37 years, the Supreme Court has followed the doctrine
of incorporation by reference, so that under the Due Process Clause
of the 14th amendment, most of the specific provisions of the first
eight amendments have been made applicable to the States, includ-
ing search and seizure, self-incrimination, double jeopardy, and
confrontation. Many of these cases, many of these decisions, in-
volved overruling. So there was a substantive change of doctrine
that did cause an increase in the number of overruled cases, Sena-
tor.

  Senator THURMOND. Incidentally, Judge, if I propound any ques-
tion that you feel would infringe upon the theory that you should
not answer questions in case it might come before the Supreme
Court, just speak out, because I do not want you to feel obligated to
answer if I do.

  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, we have recently celebrated
the 200th anniversary of the Constitution of the United States.
  Many Americans expressed their views about the reason for the
amazing endurance of this great document. Would you please share
with the committee your opinion as to the success of our Constitu-
tion, and its accomplishment of being the oldest existing Constitu-
tion in the world today.

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, the reasons for its survival, and its suc-
cess, Senator, are many fold. The first is the skill with which it was
written. Few times in history have men sat down to control their
own destiny before a government took power; in the age of Pericles,
and in the Roman empire, just before Augustus, and again, in 1789.
The framers wrote with great skill, and that is one reason for the
survival of the Constitution, for the survival of the Constitution de-
spite a horrible civil war, a war arguably, and I think probably,
necessary to cure a defect in the Constitution.

  Then there is the respect that the American people have for the
rule of law. We have a remarkable degree of compliance with the
law in this country, because of the respect that the people have for
the Constitution and for the men who wrote it.

  My third suggestion for why there has been a great success in
the American constitutional experience is the respect that each
branch of the government shows to the other. This is a vital part of
our constitutional tradition. It has remained true since the found-
ing of the Republic.

  Senator THURMOND. I had a question on the ninth amendment,
but you have already been asked about that.

  Judge Kennedy, under the Constitution, powers not delegated to
the federal government are reserved to the States, and to the
people.

  Would you describe, in a general way, your view of the proper
relationship between the federal and State law.
                                          93

  Judge KENNEDY. The frarners thought of the States as really a
check-and-balance mechanism, operating, obviously, not on the na-
tional level.

  The idea of preserving the independence, the sovereignty, and
the existence of the separate States was of course critical to the
Constitution, and it remains critical.

  Now there are very few automatic mechanisms in the Constitu-
tion to protect the States. If you read through the Constitution you
will see very little about the rights and prerogatives of the States.

  At one time, as you all well know, United States Senators were
chosen by State legislatures, which gave the States an institutional
control over the national government. That has long since disap-
peared, and I am sure no one argues for its return.

  But that was one of the few automatic mechanisms for the States
to protect themselves. The Congress of the United States is
charged, in my view, with the principal duty of preserving the in-
dependence of the States, and it can do so in many ways; in the
way that it designs its conditional grant-in-aid bills, in the ways
that it passes its statutes.

  The courts, too, have a role, and the courts have devised some
verj' important doctrines to protect federalism. The idea of absten-
tion in Younger v. Harris, the Erie rule, the independent State
ground rule, have all been designed by the courts out of respect for
the States.

  But in my view, this is the job of every branch of the govern-
ment.

  Senator THURMOND. Are you of the opinion that our forefathers
had in mind, as I understand it, that the federal government, the
central government, the national government, was simply to be a
government of limited powers?

  Judge KENNEDY. It is very clear that that was the design of the
Constitution.

  Senator THURMOND. I am glad to hear you say that, and I wish
more people in this country would recognize that. I see you are a
good student of the Constitution.

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I am glad you give me a good mark, Sena-
tor.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, the Supreme Court's deci-
sion in Marbury v. Madison is viewed as a basis of the Supreme
Court's authority to interpret the Constitution, and issue decisions
which are binding on both the executive and legislative branches.

  Would you please give the committee your views on this author-
ity.

  Judge KENNEDY. Marbury v. Madison is one of the essential
structural elements of the Constitution of the United States. As we
all know, the doctrine of judicial review is not explicit in the Con-
stitution. I have very little trouble finding that it was intended.
Federalist Number 78 makes that rather clear, and I think that
this vital role is one of the critical structural elements of the Con-
stitution, and that it is essential to the maintenance of constitu-
tional rule.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, would you please tell us
your general view of the role of antitrust today, including those
                                          94

antitrust issues which you believe most seriously affect competition
and the consumer.

  Judge KENNEDY. I am not a student of the antitrust law. I try to
become one whenever I have an antitrust opinion.

  This is an area which is one of statutory law, and it is an inter-
esting one because the Congress of the United States has essential-
ly delegated to the courts the duties of devising those doctrines
which are designed to insure competition.

  I have no quarrel with the Congress doing that, because if the
courts do not perform adequately, if they do not follow the intent
of Congress, there is always a corrective. And I think it is some-
what reassuring that the judiciary has performed well under the
antitrust laws.

  The particular elements that are necessary to preserve competi-
tion are of course vigorous enforcement of the law against illegal
practices, particularly price fixing, and other prohibited practices.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge, do you believe the Court has given
sufficient consideration to a relevant economic analysis in evaluat-
ing the effects of restraints of trade, and are you satisfied with the
guidance that the Court has provided on the proper role of econom-
ic analysis in antitrust laws?

  Judge KENNEDY. An important function of the courts, Senator, is
to serve as interpreters of expert opinions, and the courts of the
United States have received economic testimony, have studied eco-
nomic doctrine, and have formed these into a series of rules to pro-
tect competition.

  Now economists, like so many others of us, have great disagree-
ments, and we have found--for instance--that economic testimony
tells us that some vertical restrictions are actually pro competitive,
did the courts have accepted this economic testimony.

  And I think the courts, all in all, have done a good job of articu-
lating their reasoning in antitrust cases, and identifying when they
are relying on economic reasoning. Sometimes that reasoning is
wrong, but at least it is identified.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, recent Supreme Court deci-
sions, such as Illinois Brick, Monfort, and Associated General Con-
tractors, have, for different reasons, restricted standing to bring
private antitrust suits.

  Generally, what is your view of these decisions, and how do you
assess their impact on access to the courts by private parties?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, the Court has struggled to draw the ap-
propriate line for determining who may recover and who may not
recover in an antitrust case. As we know, if there is an antitrust
violation it has ripple consequences all the way through the
system.

  Antitrust cases are ones in which triple damages are recoverable,
and therefore, the courts have undertaken to draw a line to allow
only those who are primarily injured to recover.

  Not only is this, it seems to me, necessary simply as a matter of
enforcing the antitrust laws, but it reflects, too, the underlying
value of federalism, because to the extent to which federal anti-
trust laws apply, State laws are displaced.

  Where that line should be, how successful the Illinois Brick doc-
trine has been in terms of promoting competition, and permitting,
                                          95

at the same time, antitrust plaintiffs to sue when necessary, is a
point on which I have not made up my mind.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, there has been much pub-
licity and debate recently about corporate takeovers. What is your
general view about the antitrust implications of these takeovers,
and how do you view State efforts to limit takeovers?

  Judge KENNEDY. The Supreme Court has recently issued a deci-
sion in which it approves of State statutes which attempts to regu-
late takeovers.

  This is a tremendously complex area. It is highly important be-
cause business corporations throughout the United States have a
fixed-capital investment, and a fixed investment in human re-
sources. They have managers, they have skilled workers, and it is
important that they be given protection.

  Now it seems to me that the States might make a very important
contribution in this complex area.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, some of your opinions in-
volve application of the per se rule of liability. Generally, when do
you believe it is appropriate to apply the per se rule in antitrust
cases, and when would you apply the rule of reason?

  Judge KENNEDY. AS to the specific instances, I cannot be particu-
larly helpful to you, Senator. Let me see if I can express what I
think are the considerations that the Court should address.

  There is a continuum here, or a balance. On the one hand, there
is a rule of reason, and this involves something of a global judg-
ment in a global lawsuit. A rule of reason antitrust suit is very ex-
pensive to try. And once it is tried, it is somewhat difficult to re-
ceive much guidance from the decision for the next case.

  Per se rules, on the other hand, are precise. They are automatic,
in many cases, as their name indicates. The problem with per se
rules is that the}' may not always reflect the true competitive
forces.

  The Supreme Court has to make some kind of adjustment be-
tween these two polar concepts, and it has taken cases on its
docket in order to do this.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, recently, there has been
some discussion in regards to raising the amount in controversy re-
quirement in diversity cases. If the amount is raised, it should
reduce the current civil caseload in the federal courts.

  Would you please give the committee your opinion on this
matter.

  Judge KENNEDY. On diversity jurisdiction, generally--I may be
drummed out of the judges' guild--but I am not in favor of a total
abolition of diversity jurisdiction. I have tried cases in the federal
courts, and I realize their importance.

  On the other hand, we simply must recognize that the federal
courts' time is extremely precious. The Congress of the United
States has vitally important goals that it wants enforced by the
federal courts.

  Rather than looking at jurisdictional limits, which can be avoid-
ed, and which are the subject of further controversy as to whether
or not they have been adequately pleaded, it seems to me that per-
haps Congress should look at certain types of cases which could be
excluded from the diversity jurisdiction, say, auto-accident cases.
                                          96

   It seems to me that that is a better approach, generally.
   Senator THURMOND. That question really involved a decision by
Congress, but I just thought maybe your opinion would be helpful.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it is somewhat tempting, with diversity ju-
risdiction, to think that we could take a byzantine area of the law,
and simply make it irrelevant by abolishing the jurisdiction. Many
lawyers, many judges, would think Congress had done them a great
favor if they made that whole branch of our learning simply irrele-
vant.
  On the other hand, I think the commitment to diversity jurisdic-
tion, both in the Constitution and in many segments of the bar, is
sufficiently strong so that the better approach is to find a class of
cases that we can eliminate from the jurisdiction, rather than abol-
ishing it altogether.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, 20 years have passed since
the Miranda v. Arizona decision which defined the parameters of
police conduct for interrogating suspects in custody.
  Since this decision, the Supreme Court has limited the scope of
Miranda violations in some cases.
  Do you feel that the efforts and comments of top law-enforce-
ment officers throughout the country have had any effect on the
Court's views, and what is your general view concerning the warn-
ings this decision requires?
  Judge KENNEDY. I cannot point to page and verse to show that
the comments of law-enforcement officials have had a specific in-
fluence, but it seems to me that they should. The Court must recog-
nize that these rules are preventative rules imposed by the Court
in order to enforce constitutional guarantees; and that they have a
pragmatic purpose; and if the rules are not working they should be
changed.
  And for this reason, the Court should pay close attention to the
consequences of what it has wrought. Certainly comments of law-
enforcement officials, taken in the proper judicial context, it seems
to me, are relevant to that judgment.
  Senator THURMOND. What did you say? Are relevant?
  Judge KENNEDY. Are relevant.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you. Judge Kennedy, there are hun-
dreds of inmates under death sentences across the country. Many
have been on death row for several years as a result of the endless
appeals process.
  Would you please tell the committee your opinion of placing
some limitation on the extensive number of post-trial appeals that
allow inmates under death sentences to avoid execution for years
after the commission of their crimes.
  Judge KENNEDY. AS to the specifics of a proposal, of course I
could not and would not pass on it. It is true that when we have an
execution which is imminent, say, 30 days, the courts, particularly
at the appellate level, begin undergoing feverish activity, activity
which is quite inconsistent with their usual orderly, mature, delib-
erate way of proceeding.
  We are up past midnight with our clerks, grabbing books off the
wall, and phoning for more information, where a man's life--it is
usually a man--is hanging in the balance. And this does foster not
a good perception of the judiciary. It is a feverish kind of activity
                                          97

that is not really in keeping with what should be a very deliberate
and ordered process.

  Justice O'Connor who is the Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit
is concerned about this. She has asked the Ninth Circuit to draft
some procedures in order to make this a more orderly process. Any
guidance that the Congress of the United States could give would, I
think, be an important contribution to the administration of jus-
tice.

  I really do not know how you are going to avoid it, but it is some-
thing that we should give attention to.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, in the last several decades,
we have seen a steady increase in the number of regulatory agen-
cies which decide a variety of administrative cases.

  I realize that the scope of judicial review of these administrative
cases varies from statute to statute. However, as a general rule, do
you believe that there is adequate opportunity today for the appeal
of administrative decisions to the federal courts, and do you believe
that the standard of review for such appeals is appropriate?

  Judge KENNEDY. Generally, the answer to that question is yes.
As I have indicated before, I think the courts play a very vital
function by taking the expert, highly detailed, highly complex find-
ings of an agency, and recasting them in terms that the courts
themselves, the litigants, and the public at large, can understand.
While with reference to particular agencies there may be areas for
improvement by statute, I think generally the system of adminis-
trative review is working well.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, in the past several decades,
the caseload of the Supreme Court has grown rapidly, as our laws
have become far more numerous and complex.

  In an effort to reduce the pressures on the Supreme Court, an
inter-circuit panel was proposed to assist the Court in deciding
cases which involve a conflict among the judicial circuits.

  In the 99th Congress, the Judiciary Committee approved such a
panel on a trial basis. Similar legislation has been introduced in
the 100th Congress. As you may know, former Chief Justice
Warren Burger has been a strong advocate of this panel, along
with many other current members of the Court.

  Would you please give the committee your general thoughts on
the current caseload of the Court, and the need for an inter-circuit
panel.

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I hope, Senator, that some months from
now I will have a chance to take a look at that firsthand. But it
seems to me from the standpoint of a circuit judge that there are
some problems with that proposal.

  Circuit judges, I think, work under an important constraint
when they know that they are writing for review by the Supreme
Court of the United States, and not by some of their colleagues.

  Furthermore, if you had a national court of appeals, it would not
simply resolve particular issues; it would have its own case law,
which would have its own conflicts.

  And I am concerned about that.
  Further, as I understand the statistics, this would save the Su-
preme Court about 35 cases a year, maybe 50. In all of those cases,
the circuit courts have already expressed their views, and so the
                                          98

Supreme Court has a very good perspective of what choices there
are to make.

  If those 50 cases were taken away, the nature of the docket of
the Supreme Court might change. The Supreme Court might hear
all public law cases in which the juridical philosophies that obtain
on the court would divide them in more cases.

  It seems to me somewhat healthy for the Supreme Court to find
something that it can agree on.

  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy
  Judge KENNEDY. And incidentally, this was a suggestion made by
Arthur Hellman in a very perceptive law review article that I read
a few years ago.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, at present, federal judges
serve during good behavior, which in effect is life tenure.
  Federal judges decide when they retire, and when they are able
to continue to serve. Congress, in the Judicial Councils Reform and
Conduct and Disability Act of 1980 provided some limited ability
for the judicial council of the circuits to act with respect to judges
who are no longer able to serve adequately because of age, disabil-
ity, or the like.

  The Supreme Court is not covered by this act. Judge Kennedy, do
you feel the Supreme Court should be covered by the Judicial Con-
duct and Disability Act?

  And would you give the committee your opinion on the need to
establish by constitutional amendment a mandatory retirement age
for judges and justices?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, Senator, in the past few weeks, most of
my thoughts have been on how to get on the Supreme Court, not
how to get off it.

  But my views are that I would view with some disfavor either of
those proposals. The Supreme Court is sufficiently small, sufficient-
ly collegial, sufficiently visible, that I think if a member of the
court is incapable of carrying his or her workload, there are
enough pressures already to resign.

  History has been very kind to us in this regard.
  Senator THURMOND. SO far as I am concerned, it is not age but it
is health that counts.
  Judge KENNEDY. I am with you, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Kennedy, and this is the last ques-
tion, there have been complaints by federal judges regarding the
poor quality of advocacy before the nation's courts, including advo-
cacy before the Supreme Court.
  Do you feel that legal representation is not adequate? And if so,
what in your opinion should be done to improve the quality of this
representation?
  Judge KENNEDY. The repeat players in the legal system--insur-
ance companies, in some cases public interest lawyers--are very,
very good.
  The person that has one brush with the legal system is at risk. I
wish I could tell the committee that most of the arguments I hear
on the court of appeals, and we come from a great and respected
circuit, are fine and brilliant and professional arguments. They are
not.
                                          99

  You gentlemen are the experts on what to do. I think we have to
attack it at every level, in the law schools, with Inns of Court, with
judges participating with the bar, and with an insistence that the
highest standards of advocacy pertain in the federal courts.

   It is a problem that persists. And it is a problem that should be
addressed.

   We had in the ninth circuit a committee study for 4 years on
whether or not we should impose standards on the attorneys that
practice in the federal courts of the ninth circuit. We finally came
up with a proposal that they had to certify that they had read the
rules. And it was turned down. So judges, as well as attorneys,
must be more attentive to this problem.

   Senator THURMOND. Judge, I want to thank you for your re-
sponses to the questions I have propounded, and I think they indi-
cate that you are well qualified to be an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court.

  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, sir.
   The CHAIRMAN. Judge, before I yield to Senator Kennedy, I want
to set the record straight.
   It has been called to my attention that I may have left the impli-
cation that on November the 12th you met with only one Senator,
when in fact you met with about 10 Senators.
   I was referring to a single conversation.
  Judge KENNEDY. I was handed a note to that effect. And I did not
understand your question that way. But it is true that I met with a
number of your colleagues.
   The CHAIRMAN. I didn't think it was that confusing, either. I am
glad you didn't. But obviously, our staffs did. So now we have
cleared up what wasn't confusing before.
   And one last comment that I will make. I was at the White
House with the President on one occasion with the Senator from
South Carolina. And the President was urging me to move swiftly
on a matter.
   And he said to me, he said, Joe, when you get to be my age, you
want things to hurry up. Senator Thurmond looked at him and
said, Mr. President, when you get to be my age, you know it does
not matter that much. [Laughter.]
   I will yield to the Senator from
   Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say, experience
brings wisdom. And as time goes by, I'm sure you will realize this
is the case. [Laughter.]
   The CHAIRMAN. I realize it now. That is why I follow you, boss. I
yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.
   Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
   Mr. Chairman, when I had the good opportunity, like other mem-
bers of the committee, to meet with the nominee, I showed him in
my office the seal of the name Kennedy in Gaelic.
   And the name Kennedy in Gaelic means helmet. And I wondered
whether the nominee was going to bring a helmet to these particu-
lar hearings. But I am not sure we are playing tackle. Maybe per-
haps touch football.
   But nonetheless, I do not know whether he is prepared to say
whether he is really enjoying these hearings, like some mentioned
earlier or not.
                                         100

   Judge KENNEDY. I will put on a helmet when you do, Senator.
[Laughter.]

   Senator KENNEDY. AS I mentioned during the course of our ex-
change, we talked about the issues of civil rights and the progress
that had been made in this country in the period of the last 25
years.

  And I think it has been extraordinary progress. You have re-
ferred to it in a peripheral way in response to some of the earlier
questions, but it has been progress which I think some of the
American people have been proud of.

  It has been progress which Republican and Democratic presi-
dents have contributed to, and for which there's been strong bipar-
tisan support in the House of Representatives and the Senate of
the United States.

  The role of the courts, both in interpreting and in enforcing this
progress, has been important and virtually indispensable. That is
certainly something that you have recognized in ensuring that we
are going to get a fair interpretation of the laws, and that the laws
are going to be vigorously enforced.

  You made a number of speeches, but one of the ones that I find
extremely eloquent was one you made in 1978, when you were talk-
ing about the independence of the federal judiciary.

  And you said, and I quote:

  It was not the political branches of the government that decided Brown v. Board
of Education. It was not the political branches of the government that wrought the
resolution of Baker v. Carr, the apportionment decision, or that decided the right of
counsel case in Gideon v. Wainwright. It was the courts.

  And I submit that if the courts were not independent, those deci-
sions might not have been made, or if made, might not properly
have been enforced.

  Some of the opinions you have written, Judge, do not seem to re-
flect that same sensitivity, and I would like to review some of those
cases with you at this time.

  The first area is fair housing. I think as you probably know the
discrimination in housing is one of the most flagrant forms of dis-
crimination, because it perpetuates the isolation and the ignorance
that are at the roots of prejudice.

  In 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Development re-
ported there are 2 million incidents of race discrimination in hous-
ing each year. In fact, a black family looking for rental housing
stands over a 70 percent chance of being a victim of discrimination.

  Your opinion in the Circle Realty case in 1976 raises a question
about how you interpret the anti-discrimination laws in housing.

  And in that case, the citizens had claimed that their communi-
ties were segregated as a result of racial steering by real estate
brokers, that is, blacks were steered to black neighborhoods and
whites were steered to white neighborhoods.

  You ruled that those citizens did not even have standing to raise
their claim of discrimination under a key provision of the Act be-
cause they were only testers, and they were testing the brokers to
see if they were actually steering clients in this discriminatory
way.

  You threw them out of court because they weren't actually
trying to rent or to buy a house. In 1978, the Supreme Court ruled
                                         101

7 to 2, in an opinion by Justice Powell, that your interpretation of
the law was wrong, and that the testers did have a right to go to
federal court to remedy this blatant form of racial discrimination
in housing.

  My question is this; How do you respond to the concern that your
opinion reflects a narrow approach to the civil rights laws as the
Supreme Court has interpreted those laws?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, Senator, at the outset, it is entirely
proper, of course, for you to seek assurance that a nominee to the
Supreme Court of the United States is sensitive to civil rights.

  We simply do not have any real freedom if we have discrimina-
tion based on race, sex, religion or national origin, and I share that
commitment.

  Now, in the particular case, what occurred was, plaintiffs who
themselves were not homebuyers went to real estate agents and
were turned down allegedly because of their color, or were not
turned down but were shown a black community if they were black
or to a white community if they were white.

  This is, of course, of critical concern because brokers are a small
channel in the stream of housing sales. And if there is discrimina-
tion at that point, that is a good point to attack it.

  Now in a sense, I think it is incorrect, Senator, to say that I
threw them out of court. There were two provisions in the law.

  One provision provided for immediate redress from a court of
law. Another provision, which I believe was Section 810, required
that the plaintiffs must go first to the agency responsible for en-
forcement of anti-discrimination in housing laws.

  Because there were some unresolved questions as to standing at
the time of this litigation, we thought that Congress, in its scheme,
had made a distinction based on the degree of injury that the par-
ticular plaintiff had shown.

  We found no other way to explain the difference in the two sec-
tions. And we indicated in the opinion that administrative reme-
dies may be superior in some cases to judicial remedies.

  The lesson of the Voting Rights Act cases, and the Voting Rights
Act statutes, is that courts can be very inefficient. One of the great
lessons for courts taught by the Voting Rights Act statutes is that
there are remedies other than courts if civil rights are being de-
prived.

  We thought this was a creative, important, helpful statement of
what Congress had in mind. The Supreme Court said we were
wrong, and I certainly have no quarrel with the decision. I was
puzzled by the statute. And so far as the Supreme Court's decision
is concerned, I would willingly and fully enforce it.

  Senator KENNEDY. I do not think you will get any argument, at
least from Senator Specter and myself, with regards to using ad-
ministrative remedies.

  We have legislation that is cosponsored now by some 38 Senators
to try to strengthen these administrative remedies. You point out
that there are two possible remedies in this particular legislation,
one that involved running through an administrative procedure
and then being able to go to the courts; and another in which one
could go directly to the courts.
                                         102

  My question is: how do you respond to the concern as to whether
you were using a rather narrow, cramped, interpretation of that
legislation, in an area where there is a good deal of discrimination
in our society? And what kind of assurance can you give to people
that are concerned about this, that you have a real sensitivity to
the type of problem that at least the existing legislation was fo-
cused on?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. You are entitled to that assurance. And I
have the greatest respect for the lead that the Congress has taken
in this area.

  We had thought that this was really the appropriate way to ex-
plain why the two sections were different. In that respect, we
thought we were being faithful to the drafting of the statute and
the structure of the statute.

  It is true, of course, that these laws must be generously enforced,
or people are going to get hurt.

  Senator KENNEDY. The reason I raise this, Judge, is because both
the Supreme Court had reached a different decision than you had,
and the four other cases that finally were decided by other courts
had also reached a different decision than you had.

  And to get your assurances about this issue, I think, is impor-
tant.

  Let me go to another area, and that dealt with the Mountain
View-Los Altos Union High School case. As the Judge knows, we
indicated to you prior to today that we were going to explore vari-
ous decisions with you, and named the particular cases.

  In recent years, Congress and the States have taken steps to pro-
tect the civil rights of handicapped persons. And we have much
more to do to ensure that the disabled are not isolated, and can
participate to the full extent possible in our society.

  In our efforts to reach that goal, Congress enacted the Education
for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975. The Act gives handi-
capped children the right to education, either in public schools if
possible, or in private schools if necessary; and federal funds are
made available to defray the cost.

  Now, in the Mountain View-Los Altos Union High School case
in 1983, you read the statute narrowly and held that parents who
transferred their handicapped child to a private school, while an
administrative proceeding was pending, were not entitled to reim-
bursement for tuition expenses.

  And once again, the Supreme Court took a different view; and in
a unanimous opinion by Justice Rehnquist, the Court read the stat-
ute broadly, holding that the parents were entitled to reimburse-
ment. Justice Rehnquist recognized that Congress did not intend to
put parents to the choice of losing their rights under the Act or
doing what they think is best for the educational needs of their
child.

  So my question here again is, what can you tell the members of
the committee to give us confidence that you will not take a
crabbed and narrow view in construing these extremely vitally im-
portant and significant statutes?

  Judge KENNEDY. This was a vitally important case. I reviewed it
only last night, and didn't have the record in front of me. But I
recall the case.
                                         103

  It was unfortunately an all too typical case in which a young
man had emotional problems. He found it very difficult to adjust to
school.

  And his mother was distraught, not only over how her child was
developing, but over the battle she had to have with the adminis-
trative agency to get him special care.

  The question was whether or not, if the school disagreed with the
mother initially and said, no, we will not pay for the special care,
whether the school, after the administrative agency had ruled in
favor of the mother, had to pay for the cost of the special instruc-
tion in the interim.

  We thought that the normal administrative remedies rule and
exhaustion rule were written into the statute. There was a so-
called stay-put provision in the statute, which we thought required
the parent to leave the child in the hands of the school authorities
if the school authorities did not agree with the parent; and in
many cases, school authorities agree with the parent. In many
cases, there is an agreement, and they immediately send the child.

  The fourth, the seventh and the eighth circuits agreed with as.
The first did not and the Supreme Court unanimously did not.

  I have seen the necessity for spending more money in the schools
on education across the board. And we were being asked in this
case to say that a local school district, an entity of the State, was
required to pay this sum.

  We thought a question of federalism was involved, in that school
districts are strapped for every penny.

  It is true that the Congress of the United States had a policy in
favor of supporting education for these disturbed children, and of
course that should be given full and vigorous enforcement.

  I have absolutely no problem with the Supreme Court's decision.
It said that exhaustion of administrative remedies wras not neces-
sary.

  The Court also made another very important statement. We had
said that these are damages against the State. And the Supreme
Court of the United States said, well, these are not damages. These
are simply payments that the State had to make all along, and the
State is really not injured. I fully accept and endorse the reasoning
in that case, Senator.

  Senator KENNEDY. It was really the reimbursement of the tui-
tion, was it not?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, of the cost of the special school, yes, sir.
  Senator KENNEDY. But again, the question is: Congress developed
that legislation to try and deal with the need for the handicapped
and disabled children to get an education; the question is whether
you are going to interpret this Act in what I would have considered
as both the spirit and the letter of the law--a sense of generosity,
or whether it would be in a more reshaped way.
  And that is really what we are trying
  Judge KENNEDY. I do not think those statutes should be inter-
preted grudgingly. There is a certain amount of finger pointing
that goes on here where the courts say the Congress did not write
the statute clearly enough, and more or less saddles Congress with
the duty of cleaning up the language. I have come to recognize that
                                         104

the workload of the Congress is such that we have to interpret the
statutes as they are given to us.

   Senator KENNEDY. Well, I think as you know from the process, as
a result of being a political institution we some how lack the kind
of precision that a court might want.

   Again, it seems that this particular issue, given the fact where
the Supreme Court came out on this with a unanimous decision, it
was appropriate to raise and have your comments today.

   Let me move to another area, Judge Kennedy. And this is with
regards to the memberships in various clubs. You are familiar with
this issue.

   As you know, in 1984, the American Bar Association amended
the commentary to its Code of Judicial Conduct to provide, and I
quote: "It is inappropriate for a judge to hold membership in any
organization that practices invidious discrimination on the basis of
race, sex, religion or national origin."

  It would seem from your questionnaire that you belonged to
three clubs that discriminated against women, and that one or
more of these clubs may have discriminated against racial minori-
ties as well.

  As I understand it, the Olympic Club is a country club in San
Francisco which also has a downtown athletic facility with meeting
rooms, dining, and residential facilities. And it has about 4,000
members.

  And when you joined the Olympic Club in 1962, its membership
was expressly limited to white males. And apparently, that explicit
restriction on racial minorities was lifted in 1968.

  Today there are still, as I understand, no active black members
of the club, and women can still not be full members of the club.

  You were a member of the Olympic Club for many years before
you became a federal judge. You continued to be a member of the
club for 12 years after you became a federal judge, even though it
discriminated against blacks and women.

  Now in June of 1987, the San Francisco City Attorney warned
the Olympic Club that its discriminatory practices violated the
California civil rights laws. So the issue was becoming a public con-
troversy.

  At this time you first expressed concern about the club's restric-
tive membership policy. And in August you wrote to the Olympic
Club to express those concerns, and you resigned from the Olympic
Club in late October, when you were under consideration for nomi-
nation to the Supreme Court, and after the membership of the
Olympic Club had voted against the board of directors' proposal to
amend the bylaws of the club to encourage the sponsorship of
qualified women and minority candidates.

  So Judge Kennedy you apparently didn't try to change the dis-
criminatory policies of the Olympic Club until this summer, and
you didn't resign until your name had evidently surfaced on the
short list of potential nominees.

  My question is a simple one. Why did it take so long?
  Judge KENNEDY. Discrimination comes from several sources.
Sometimes it is active hostility. And sometimes it is just insensitiv-
ity and indifference.
                                         105

  Over the years, I have tried to become more sensitive to the ex-
istence of subtle barriers to the advancement of women and of mi-
norities in society. This was an issue on which I was continuing to
educate myself.

  I want to see a society in which young women who are profes-
sionals have the same opportunity as I did to join a club where
they meet other professionals. I would like that opportunity for my
daughter if she were a practicing lawyer or in the business world.

  With reference to the Olympic Club, in part it has the atmos-
phere of a YMCA with its downtown facilities reserved for me. I
used it and enjoyed it and found it helpful.

  In the late spring of 1987, this year, the U.S. Open was sponsored
at the Olympic Club. At that time publicity surfaced that it did not
have some racial minorities as members.

  That was not a policy of the club, as I understood it, but it was
pretty clear that the mix was not there if you looked at the mem-
bership rolls. The club expressly excluded women.

  There was an article in the New Yorker magazine which really
triggered my action. A very fine sports writer wrote about the
Open and talked about the egalitarian history of the club.

  I wrote a letter to the club, which the committee has, in which I
indicated that it was time to make the egalitarian spirit a reality.

  I had discussions with the legal counsel for the club. I knew no
directors of the club or officers. I indicated that in my view it was
high time that the Olympic Club changed.

  They did have a membership meeting, as you've indicated, in
part as a result of my discussions, but in part as a result of the
action of the city attorney, and concerns expressed by other mem-
bers.

  I actually had heard that the bylaw that you referred to had
passed. The board of directors were optimistic that it would, and
somebody actually reported back to me that it had passed. I was
not a voting member and cannot vote and was not at the meeting.

  When I heard that the bylaw had been turned down, principally
the objection was women in the athletic facility, not racial minori-
ties.

  I thought that my position had become quite untenable. I there-
fore resigned before I talked to the members of the Administration,
thinking that it was not fair either to the Administration or the
Members of this distinguished body to make that an issue.

  Senator KENNEDY. This is also a club where professionals gather,
and have some business associations or meetings or entertainment?

  Judge KENNEDY. NO question about it. It is downtown. It is a
luncheon club.

  Senator KENNEDY. I think you probably answered the point that
I am getting at, but let me just back up and see if you have re-
sponded to it.

  In the questionnaire, when you were asked about your definition
of invidious discrimination, you wrote, I quote:

  Invidious discrimination suggests that the exclusion of a particular individual on
the basis of their sex, race, or religion or nationality is intended to impose a stigma
upon such persons. As far as I am aware, none of those policies or practices were a
result of ill will.
                                         106

   In talking about the Olympic Club, I gathered from the answer
you just gave previously, when you were talking about this issue,
you talked about insensitivity and indifference with regards to cre-
ating a stigma on professional people, women, minorities, and used
the illustration of your daughter.

  Judge KENNEDY. That is the distinction I drew.
   Senator KENNEDY. I just want to make sure we have the whole
response and answer here, so I have it correctly.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you for giving me that opportunity. In
my view, none of these clubs practiced invidious discrimination.
That term is not a precise and crystal clear term. But as I under-
stood it and as I have defined it in the questionnaire, none of the
clubs did practice that, or had that as a policy.
  Senator KENNEDY. But in terms of stigmatizing various groups,
since this is a prestigious club, in what I gather was the general
commercial life of the city, the fact that either women or minori-
ties cannot belong to it, does that not serve to stigmatize those indi-
viduals?
  Judge KENNEDY. There is no question that the injury and the
hurt and the personal hurt can be there, regardless of the motive.
  Senator KENNEDY. YOU resigned from the Sutter Club, as I un-
derstand.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator KENNEDY. Could you tell us the reasons--and that was
in 1980, is that correct?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. The Sutter Club is in downtown Sacramen-
to. It is a club that is primarily used at luncheon by professional
and business people.
  I was always seen there as a judge when I went there. And I had
concerns with their restrictive policies against women.
  Again, some of the great leaders in Sacramento city life, some of
my very best friends, people who have no animosity, people who
have sensitivity and goodwill, are members of those clubs. I in no
way wish to criticize them, because many feel as I do that the
policy should be changed.
  I, however, felt that my membership there was one where I was
there only as a judge, and that it was inappropriate for me to
belong. And I resigned in 1980 before the canons of ethics on the
subject were promulgated.
  Senator KENNEDY. And you resigned from there, as I understand,
because of both its restrictive kinds of policies and because you
were, as I understand it, a judge, and you didn't want to appear to
have an inappropriate appearance, since it was more restrictive in
terms of women and minorities.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. Everybody knew me there as a judge, and
would come up and greet me and so forth. And I felt uncomfortable
in that position.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, if you felt uncomfortable with regard to
the Sutter Club in 1980, why didn't you -and since you were meet-
ing on the Circuit Court in San Francisco, and you had another
club there that had similar kinds of problems, why didn't you feel
uncomfortable with that club?
  Judge KENNEDY. Probably because nobody knew me, and I basi-
cally used the athletic facility.
                                         107

  Senator KENNEDY. But it really isn't a question just of being
known, is it? It's a question about what you basically represent or
your own beliefs on this.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, although I think sometimes continued
membership can be helpful. In California the rule is that judges
should remain in those clubs and attempt to change their policies
and resign only when it becomes clear that those attempts are una-
vailing.

  Senator KENNEDY. Don't you think the club's rules did actually
then stigmatize women and minorities?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, they were not intended to do so. I think
women felt real hurt, and there was just cause for them to want
access to these professional contacts.

  It is most unfortunate, and almost Dickensian, for a group of
lawyers to meet at 11:30 and to settle a case and to celebrate and
say, well, let's all go to the club. And suddenly there is a silence,
and they cannot go because there is a woman there. That is stigma-
tizing. That is inappropriate.

  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I understand my time is up. In
my next questioning, I would like to come into the area of the
voting rights issue.

  I think I have indicated to you that I had hoped to be able to get
to that at another time.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Again, I welcome you, Judge, before the commit-
tee. Let's revisit for a few minutes the question of club member-
ship. Just a few questions do linger from that.
  First, as I understand it. you joined the Olympic Club back in
1962; is that correct?
  Judge KENNEDY. That is correct, sir.
  Senator HATCH. YOU have described the club a little bit, but
could you describe it a little further with regard to some of its
public service and charitable activities that it supported?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it has been a club that is principally
prominent in athletics. And it has promoted athletics for young
people in the community for over 100 years.
  It is recognized as a club with a strong sense of civic obligation.
It has athletic meets and so forth at its facilities.
  Senator HATCH. AS I understand it, the club came into being
about 2 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
  Judge KENNEDY. The Olympic Club was founded in the 19th cen-
tury and I joined in 1962.
  Senator HATCH. And in 1962, I think it's fair to say, a lot of clubs
did have the same policies as this club, and that was one of the rea-
sons why Congress enacted the 1964 act to begin with.
  So it took only a few years for individuals to understand this.
  As I understand it, you mentioned that the Olympic Club was
the site of the U.S. Open, and this was a great honor, as I under-
stand it, for that particular club at that time.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
   Senator HATCH. What preparations did the club make for this
national event?
                                         108

   Judge KENNEDY. I was not involved in it at all. I know from the
press that it was a great event for the club, and they made ar-
rangements to serve all of those who purchased a ticket to come in
and watch the golf match, and they wanted to put their best foot
forward, of course, because it is a great event.

  Senator HATCH. And when the press learned that the club, ac-
cording to its bylaws, was open only to, quote, gentlemen, unquote,
what was the reaction, if you recall?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, the reaction in the community is one I
can only gauge by the press. There were press stories on it. It did
not seem to dampen attendance at the Open or interest in the
Open.

  But I thought there was a problem disclosed by that, and that
problem was not going away. That was very clear.

  Senator HATCH. Well, the reaction some thought might have
been somewhat unexpected. Because as I understand it there were
over a thousand women who had privileges at the club and had the
regular use of its facilities.

  But am I correct that they did that through their husbands or
through some male members?

  Judge KENNEDY. I cannot answer that question, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. That was my understanding.
  Judge KENNEDY. That is plausible.
  Senator HATCH. Well, apparently, some of this heightened scruti-
ny that the press brought out and others brought out came to your
attention. Was that about at the time when you began to discuss
with the club leaders some of these problems?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator HATCH. YOU referenced that discussion in your letter
dated August 7th, 1987, and you asked to be notified of the results
of the poll of the membership, as I recall.
  In fact, you said that--in your letter, you said, the fact is that
constitutional and public morality make race or sex distinctions
unacceptable for membership in a club that occupies the position
the Olympic Club does, unquote.
  Judge KENNEDY. That was my position. And I urged the board to
go ahead with the membership poll and see if the bylaw change
could be effected.
  Senator HATCH. In other words, by your letter, by what you were
doing, you were strongly urging the club to end the process of dis-
crimination, or its policy of discrimination?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Okay. I think another point that is worth repeat-
ing, it occurred in the first week of August--at that point Judge
Bork was President Reagan's nominee. The hearings had not yet
begun for Judge Bork, and most commentators felt that he would
have a rough time, but they felt that he was going to make it
through and that he was going to be confirmed. Moreover, your
name had not yet surfaced as one of the leading candidates for the
Supreme Court nomination in the way your colleague Cliff Wal-
lace's name had arisen at that time.
  I only mention this because we ought to be completely clear that
you were acting, it seems to me, out of a sense of constitutional and
public morality, as you said, not on the basis of any hint that there
                                         109

might be a higher calling in your future when you wrote that
letter.

  So what was the outcome of the vote at the club?
  Judge KENNEDY. I don't know what it was; three to two is my
guess. There are some 7,000 members of the club. I had better not
guess what the vote was.
  I'm not allowed to come to meetings: I'm not a voting member,
but apparently it was a great debate. The membership was divided
on it.
  Apparently the board of directors are going to continue to try to
press for this change.
  Senator HATCH. I see. When were you informed of that particular
vote?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I was originally informed that the vote
had been successful, that the measure had been successful to
change the by-laws.
  So I congratulated myself for having played a small part in
bringing the membership meeting about. It came to my attention
about a week later that my information was wrong. The proposal
had actually been turned down.
  So I wrote a letter saying that my position had simply become
untenable.
  Senator HATCH. I see. Are you now a member of the club?
  Judge KENNEDY. NO, sir.
  Senator HATCH. Well, it seems to me that under the circum-
stances your actions are basically above reproach. The most you
could be faulted for is not recognizing the problem earlier, but then
nobody else had recognized it either. Many other clubs have had
similar policies and they have gone unnoticed as well. I am aware
of a number of popular clubs here in the Washington, DC area, for
instance, that have this same kind of policy. So I just wanted to
bring that out because I think that is important.
  Will you describe for us the Del Paso Country Club and its activi-
ties in support of worthy community ventures?
  Judge KENNEDY. It is a country club in Sacramento with a golf
course and a swimming pool. I had been a member of it when I was
a boy. My family and children enjoyed it. And again, I have the
greatest respect for the members of that club.
  The by-laws of the club, in 1975 when I became a judge, used
male pronouns and led to the inference that it was male-only mem-
bership, although there were some women members. I objected to
the by-laws being written in those terms and the board of directors
changed the by-laws.
  My purpose in making the recommendation was so that it would
be clear that women would be admitted to the club. Women are ad-
mitted to the club as members, but a quick look at the roster shows
there is not any kind of a representative mix based on the profes-
sional community.
  However, the club does not have a policy or a practice of exclud-
ing on the basis of sex or race as far as I know.
  Senator HATCH. In fact, there have been women members of the
club since the early 1940's, as I understand it, according to my
records.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
                                         110

   Senator HATCH. Well, once again I can only say your actions
demonstrate nothing it seems to me but heightened sensitivity to
any perception of bias. You know, even when the by-laws might
have been technically complied with, or might have technically
complied with the law you urged an effort to remove any residual
sense of difficulty there or problems. So I think that is an impor-
tant point, too.

  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you.
   Senator HATCH. Your attention to your judicial and ethical
duties I think is particularly underscored by your activities with
respect to the Sutter Club. Can you describe that club again, and
its activities?
  Judge KENNEDY. That is a downtown club primarily used for
luncheon. It is a very well-knowTn club used by many in the govern-
ment and in business. The club sometimes has grand functions in
the evening which are open for parties that are sponsored by mem-
bers, and persons of all races and gender are welcome.
  Senator HATCH. I see. You joined that club in 1963, as I under-
stand it?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator HATCH. About then?
  Judge KENNEDY. That is about right.
  Senator HATCH. That also is one year before the 1964 Act, Civil
Rights Act. In that case, however, the club's by-laws did not bar
women but the club's practice seemed to exclude females.
  Judge KENNEDY. That is my understanding, that the practice was
fairly clear.
  Senator HATCH. Well, when and why did you leave that club?
  Judge KENNEDY. I was concerned about the policy of excluding
women. I went to the club for lunch and was known, really, only as
a judge. Although I had many close friends there, it seemed to me I
was really there in my professional capacity. I was concerned about
the appearance of impartiality.
  Senator HATCH. Okay. Well, again I think your actions show ex-
treme sensitivity to these problems, and I think that is much in
your favor and I just want to compliment you for it.
  Let me ask you about the Sacramento Elks Lodge. The propriety
of your actions with respect to club memberships I think is bol-
stered with respect to the Elks Lodge. Can you describe the Sacra-
mento Elks Lodge and its charitable and service activities?
  Judge KENNEDY. Again, I simply used the club for its athletic fa-
cilities. I really was not an active participant in the club, but I
know that they undertake any number of civic and charitable ac-
tivities and that membership in the club is viewed by all who are
in it as a privilege and as a way to furthering charitable and civic
purposes.
  Senator HATCH. What is that organization's policy with respect
to women?
  Judge KENNEDY. I do not know, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. Okay. When did you join that club, and when
did you resign?
  Judge KENNEDY. It is in my questionnaire.
  Senator HATCH. Okay.
                                         Ill

  Judge KENNEDY. I just do not have the dates. I believe I resigned
shortly after I became a judge.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I just submit to anybody looking at it care-
fully that that also is an instance of your responding to at least a
perception problem back in 1978, and that was years before Presi-
dent Reagan was elected. And I think your actions as a whole on
all of these matters are very commendable with respect to uphold-
ing your ethical duties as a judge. I just want to commend you on
that.

  Let me turn to another, totally different subject. Few provisions
of the Constitution are more important to Americans and our way
of life than the free speech guarantees of our Constitution, our first
amendment. Accordingly, I would like to inquire a little bit about
your record on free speech.

  In the first place, let me just ask you what is your view of the
importance of the speech clause and its role in our society?

  Judge KENNEDY. The first amendment may be first, although we
are not sure, because the framers thought of it as the most impor-
tant. It applies not just to political speech, although that is clearly
one of its purposes. In that respect it ensures the dialogue that is
necessary for the continuance of the democratic process. But it also
applies, really, to all ways in which we express ourselves as per-
sons. It applies to dance and to art and to music. These features of
our freedom are to many people as important or more important
than political discussions or searching for philosophical truth. The
first amendment covers all of these forms of speech.

  Of course, the first amendment also protects the press. One of
the unfortunate things about the case law is that the great cases
on the press are New York Times v. Sullivan and United States v.
New York Times and The Washington Post. But the press is not
monolithic. In Northern California I believe that there are 37 small
papers that in many cases are literally "mom and pop" operations
where the editor has to stop writing at noon because he has to
start working the printing press. These papers simply must have
the protection of the first amendment if they are to be vigorous in
reporting on matters of interest to their readers insofar as their lo-
cality is concerned. They vitally need the protection of the first
amendment. It is not just for The Washington Post and The New
York Times.

  Senator HATCH. Well, our first amendment under American ju-
risprudence, of course, is a model for the rest of the world because
it provides rights and privileges and it actually forbids any prior
censorship or restraints on speech except in the most extenuating
circumstances. And one of your cases dealt with an attempt to
place a restraint on the broadcast of a TV program, and that was
the 1979 case of Goldblum v. NBC.

   Now would you explain why the privacy and fair trial interests
of the petitioner, an executive officer implicated in the equity fund-
ing scandal, were not sufficient to block the broadcast of the TV
program, if you remember that case?

  Judge KENNEDY. What happened in that case, as I recall it, was
that a person who was the subject of what is called a docu-drama
was concerned that his rights were being infringed by the publica-
tion, or by the broadcast of the television show. He was a some-
                                         112

what celebrated figure who had allegedly committed serious wrong-
doings in a financial scam.

   The trial judge was sufficiently concerned about the allegations
that he ordered the television network to bring the tape to the
courtroom and show the tape. This was a matter, really, of hours
or maybe a day or so before the broadcast was to go on nationwide
TV.

   I presided over a three-judge panel in an emergency motion. He
issued the order at 11:30 and we vacated it at 5 minutes to 12. We
said that it was a prior restraint on speech and that for the district
judge to order the film delivered was in itself an interference with
the rights of the press. I wrote the opinion and issued it a few days
later. That is the Goldblum opinion.

   Senator HATCH. In my mind it is significant that the courts, too,
have sometimes forgotten to protect the Constitution's prior re-
straint doctrine. Fortunately, other courts are available to correct
those errors and that was a perfect illustration.

  Although access to government records is not a first amendment
speech issue, it is nonetheless related to the access which our citi-
zens have to their government. In that sense, it is related to the
very principles by which citizens participate in a government run
by the people.

  Now, in this regard, I was interested in your 1985 CBS v. District
Court case. If you remember that case, I know sometimes it is aw-
fully difficult, you have participated in so many cases. I don't mean
to just isolate and pick these out of the air, but it is an important
case. Could you discuss that with the committee? Would you also
explain why the Government's effort to suppress the media's access
to certain sentencing documents in a case related to the DeLorean
trial was really rejected?

  Judge KENNEDY. This was a case in which one of the coprincipals
or accomplices in the DeLorean drug matter had entered a guilty
plea and then applied to the district court, as is his right, to modify
the sentence. The Government of the United States joined with the
attorney for the defendant in asking that the documents be filed
under seal.

  The press objected. There was standing for the objection, and we
ruled that those documents could not be filed under seal. We indi-
cated that the public has a vital interest in ascertaining the sen-
tencing policies of the court. I think I indicated that this is one of
the least satisfactory portions of the entire criminal justice system
and that the public ought to know if a sentence was being reduced
and why.

  Senator HATCH. One further first amendment issue arose in some
of your past cases involving the operation of the Federal Election
Commission. In the 1980 California Medical Association case, you
decided that limitations on contributions to political action commit-
tees are not eligible for the full protections of the free speech
clause.

  When people contribute to a PAC they choose that committee in
order to express themselves on political issues and they make the
contribution to, in essence, advocate their views. Now can you ex-
plain why limiting this form of expression would not be a limita-
tion on the free expression principles in the first amendment?
                                          113

   Judge KENNEDY. This was a case in which we were asked to in-
terpret a new statute passed by the Congress. We thought we had
guidance from the Court that controlled the decision. We expressed
the view, as we understood the law of the Supreme Court, that this
was speech by proxy. This was not direct speech by the person who
was spending the money, rather he or she was delegating it to an
intermediary. We thought that was a sufficient grounds for the
Congress of the United States in the interest of ensuring the purity
of the election process to regulate the amount of the contribution.

   Senator HATCH. All right, let me turn for a few minutes to crimi-
nal law because you have an extensive record and background in
criminal law and few people realize that no category of cases is
more often litigated in the Supreme Court than criminal law cases.
From my point of view, this is entirely appropriate because life and
liberty, not to mention the order and safety of our society, are no-
where more at stake than in criminal trials. Accordingly, I would
like to review with you a portion of your record on criminal issues.

   Could you just give us the benefit of discussing with us generally
how you approach the task of finding an appropriate balance be-
tween the procedural rights of the defendant and society's right to
protect innocent victims of crime?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, Senator, I do not think that there is a
choice between order and liberty. We can have both. Without or-
dered liberty, there is no liberty at all. One of the highest priorities
of society is to protect itself against the corruption and the corro-
siveness and the violence of crime. In my view judges must not
shrink from enforcing the laws strictly and fairly in the criminal
area. They should not have an identity crisis or self-doubts when
they have to impose a severe sentence.

   It is true that we have a system in this country of policing the
police. We have a system in this country that requires courts to re-
verse criminal convictions when the defendant is guilty. We have a
system in this country under which relevant, essential, necessary,
probative, convincing evidence is not admitted in the court because
it was improperly seized. This illustrates, I suppose, that constitu-
tional rights are not cheap. Many good things in life are not cheap
and constitutional rights are one of them. We pay a price for con-
stitutional rights.

   My view of interpreting these rules is that they should be prag-
matic. They should be workable. We have paid a very heavy cost to
educate judges and police officers throughout this country, and the
criminal system works much better than many people give it credit
for. In every courthouse at whatever level throughout the country,
even if it is a misdemeanor traffic case, the judge knows the Miran-
da rule, he knows the exclusionary rule, and so do the police offi-
cers that bring the case before him. We have done a magnificent
job of educating the people in the criminal justice system.

   On the other hand, it is sometimes frustrating for the courts, as
it is frustrating for all of us, to enforce a rule in a hypertechnical
way when the police or the prosecutor have made a mistake in
good faith. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule is one
of the Court's recent pronouncements to try to meet some of these
concerns. It remains to be seen how workable that exception is.
                                         114

Sometimes exceptions can swallow the rule, and the Court has yet
to stake out all of the dimensions of this exception.

   That is just a rough expression of my general philosophy in the
area.

   Senator HATCH. That is good. As I mentioned earlier, nearly one-
third of the Supreme Court's time is consumed in criminal trials,
criminal matters. It seems to me that this is very appropriate for
another reason because studies have shown that the poor, the aged,
women, the minority groups are disproportionately victimized by
crime and when our criminal justice system fails these groups are
the first to suffer. So what role do you think the plight of victims
of crime ought to play in the criminal justice process?

  Judge KENNEDY. YOU know, Senator, I went to one of the great
law schools in the country--I am sorry Senator Specter is not here
to agree with that--and I never heard the word "victim" in three
years uf law school, except maybe from the standpoint of an apol-
ogy that a corpus delicti was not present. This is the wrong focus.
We simply must remember that sometimes the victim who is re-
quired to testify, who misses work without pay, who sits in the
courthouse hallway with no special protection, and who is stared at
by the defendant and harassed by the defendant's counsel, under-
goes an ordeal that is almost as bad as the crime itself.

  The Congress of the United States has made a very important
policy statement in passing the Victims Assistance Act. It has
given the courts a new focus, and a focus that is a very, very im-
portant one in the system. Judges recognize that victims, too, have
rights.

  Senator HATCH. I think that is great. In October of 1987, the
Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that the rate of violent crime
dropped 6.3 percent in 1986. Now, of course, this was no consolation
to the victims of crime, but it is important to realize that since
1981 the rate of violent crime has dropped nearly 20 percent; 7 mil-
lion fewer crimes occurred in 1986 than in the peak year of 1981.
That does not mean that the battle is being won. I am sure we will
find statistics to show that drug abuse and its link to crime is defi-
nitely on the rise.

  Nonetheless we are gaining ground on crime to some degree. Do
you feel that the courts have a role to play in ensuring that this
hard-won progress on crime continues?

  Judge KENNEDY. Absolutely, Senator. They are the front-line
agency for administering the criminal justice system, and we have
much to do, particularly in the area of corrections, which judges do
not know much Jbout. But in so far as the enforcement of the
criminal laws, the courts do have the responsibility to ensure that
their procedures are efficient, that they understand the law, and
that they apply it faithfully.

  Senator HATCH. In this regard, I would like to discuss with you
one of your death-penalty cases, namely, the Neuschafer v. Whitley
case.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator HATCH. AS I understand that case, an inmate had mur-
dered another inmate, and when you first received the case, you
sent it back to the lower court to make sure that the evidence in
that case--it was a statement by the accused--was proper. Now
                                         115

when that was established, the case returned to you, and several
arguments were made against the State's decision to order the
death penalty.

  Could you recall some of the arguments and why they were in-
sufficient in that case?

  Judge KENNEDY. Senator, I have a little difficulty in answering
that question because my characterization of the arguments might
bear on the petition for rehearing.

  Senator HATCH. Sure. All right. Then I will
  Judge KENNEDY. That case is still before us.
  Senator HATCH. That is one of those cases that goes on and on,
then.
  Judge KENNEDY. I would rather not characterize an argument in
a way that would seem either too generous, or too limited for the
particular parties in that case.
  Senator HATCH. Well, let me move to another capital-crime case
in which you were involved, and that was Adamson v. Ricketts, and
I do appreciate your sensitivity there, and this involved the murder
of an Arizona newspaper reporter with a car bomb.
  As I understand it, the defendant had confessed to the murder
but had escaped the death penalty in the first trial because of a
plea bargain.
  Now, would you briefly state the facts of that case, and how you
became involved.
  Judge KENNEDY. This case is also appearing before us--or,
rather, is still before us on remand from the Supreme Court of the
United States--so I will give only a capsule description.
  A newspaper reporter was killed when a bomb was placed in his
car by a person connected with the Mafia. The reporter lost both
arms and both legs, but lived for 10 days.
  He identified the defendant in this case, Adamson. Adamson was
brought to trial, but the question was whether or not Adamson
would tell who paid him to do this work. As part of a plea bargain,
Adamson did agree to testify, and in exchange, the State of Arizona
reduced the charge to second-degree murder. I think that is accu-
rate; but, in any event, the State dropped the capital sentence
demand that it had made earlier. Adamson did testify, the two
were convicted. The Supreme Court of Arizona then reversed, so
another trial was called for.
  At this point Adamson said that he wanted to change the deal.
The question came to our court whether or not his double jeopardy
rights had been properly protected. Some of my colleagues thought
they had not. Some of us thought that the plea bargain itself was
clear warning to Adamson that he had certain rights that were
being waived.
  I was in the dissenting position. The Supreme Court of the
United States agreed with the dissenters. The case has now been
sent back to the ninth circuit on other issues.
  Senator HATCH. Well, in other words--my time is up--but in
other words, the Supreme Court overturned the majority of your
court
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
   Senator HATCH [continuing]. And followed your dissent
  Judge KENNEDY. That is correct.

            )0-878 0 - 8 9 - 5
                                          116

   Senator HATCH [continuing]. In finding that the plea bargain
should not figure into the double jeopardy clause in this particular
instance, so that resulted in the reinstatement of the death penalty
for the cold-blooded car bombing. Is that correct?

   Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
   Senator HATCH. All right. Well, I have a lot of other questions,
but I have appreciated very much the responses you have made
here today.
   Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator.
   Senator HATCH. Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. As I indicated earlier, we
will very shortly recess for 15 minutes, and then we will come back
and stay at least until 5 and no later than 6.
   So we will recess now for 15 minutes.
   [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Well, Judge, how is it so far?
  Judge KENNEDY. It is very fair, Senator. Since I have been doing
this to attorneys for 12 years, it is only fair that it be done to me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Simpson is worried about your students.
He wants to make sure they are observing.
  I will now yield to my colleague from Arizona, Senator DeCon-
cini.
   Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Kennedy, I appreciate your candidness and response to
previous Members here. I think it is very helpful, and quite frank-
ly, I think it tells us something about you, both as a jurist and as a
lawyer, and as a family person of values and sensitivity, and that is
important to this Senator, and I think it is important to the proc-
ess.

  I am very interested, Judge Kennedy, as I discussed with you
briefly, the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th amendment, and I
would like to review some of that.

  Based on some of your decisions, and your teachings, I consider
you an expert in it, and I do not consider myself in that vein at all.
However, it is of great importance to me, for many compelling rea-
sons. With regards to race discrimination, as you know, the courts
have employed a strict scrutiny test, and require that a compelling
interest be shown, in order for the statute to survive review.

  Additionally, fundamental rights, such as the right to travel, the
right to vote, the access to the judicial process, enjoy the benefit of
a strict scrutiny analysis.

   In gender discrimination cases the Court employs the heightened
scrutiny test, sometimes called the intermediate scrutiny test. The
classifications, by gender, must serve important governmental ob-
jectives and must be substantially related to achieving those objec-
tives.

   There is some suggestion that both alienage and illegitimacy
enjoy the same type of analysis--intermediate scrutiny. All other
forms of discrimination, economic and social, receive the lowest
level of scrutiny known as the rational basis test.

   I offer this abridged review to set the basis for the few questions
I would like to ask you.
                                         117

  Justice Marshall, as you are aware, has proposed a sliding
scale--I guess you would call it--approach to analyzing equal pro-
tection claims.

  He suggests that instead of cases falling into neat categories, as
the Court has so put them, a spectrum be used to review claims of
discrimination, and this spectrum clearly comprehends variations
in the degree of care with which the Court will scrutinize, particu-
larly classifications, depending, I believe, on the constitutional and
social importance.

  Now, when Judge Bork was here, it became very clear to many
of us that there was a fundamental disagreement here. I am not
here to peg you against Judge Bork at all.

  What I would like to know, Judge, is some answers to some ques-
tions, if you would, please.

  In reviewing the opinions you have written, I notice that in the
equal protection area, you have had little opportunity to express
yourself, I think maybe six opinions, the best that I could encoun-
ter.

  Is that a. our;/n or have we not found more decisions? Or do you
know?

  Judge KENNEDY. I have really not had the opportunity, Senator,
to address, ' i any detail, the levels of scrutiny that apply to
gender, or, t compare them to race.

  I think you are correct. I have had Equal Protection Clause
cases, mostly in the implementation phase rather than in defining
substantive liability.

  Senator DECONCINI. And it is roughly a half a dozen opinions, to
your recollection?

  Judge KENNEDY. I would think that would be correct, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. I would like to explore with you the analysis
you do apply, or the approach you take, and not to get into any
particular case or circumstances that would be a potential case
before you, but how you view the Equal Protection Clause.
  Would you agree, first of all, that the Equal Protection Clause
applies to all persons?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, the amendment by its terms, of course, in-
cludes all persons, and I think was ver}^ deliberately drafted in that
respect.
  Senator DECONCINI. And of course women being in that category.
As I understand, that the Court has developed some standards, and
they refer to them in the race cases, considered a "suspect classifi-
cation," I think is the Court's term, and the standard of review is
known as strict scrutiny, as I mentioned.
  Additionally, for the State to justify discrimination based upon
race, would require a showing of a compelling interest. Is that your
fundamental understanding of the strict scrutiny standard that the
Court has referred to in various decisions?
  Judge KENNEDY. That is my understanding of the standard that
the Court has enunciated.
  Senator DECONCINI. Can you conceive of any situation where dis-
crimination based upon race would be legitimate under the Equal
Protection Clause?
  Judge KENNEDY. I cannot think, at the moment, of any of the
standard law-school hypotheticals, that would lead to the conclu-
                                         118

sion that a racial classification that is invidious would be sustained
under an equal protection challenge.

   Senator DECONCINI. Your record certainly indicates that you
have not had any cases, that has squarely been presented to you,
that I can find at least, but I just wondered if you had any hypoth-
eticals, because I find I can make up some hypothetical, but I just
would like to see whether someone else has, if they have thought
about it.

  With respect to this standard of strict scrutiny, analysis em-
ployed by the Court today, is it your understanding that a funda-
mental right, such as the right to interstate travel or freedom of
speech, are protected in the same manner as the race discrimina-
tion? Or non-race discrimination?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, and sometimes those cases are difficult, be-
cause if you have a first amendment case, it often can really be ex-
plained on its own terms. The first amendment sits on its own
foundation, so it is sometimes puzzling why we even need an equal
protection analysis in such cases, although the Court has had first
amendment cases in which it uses an equal protection analysis.

  Why that is necessary is not clear to me, since one of the essen-
tial features of the first amendment is that we cannot engage in
censorship. Censorship involves choice, so the first amendment
does seem to have its own foundation in this regard.

  Senator DECONCINI. Focusing, Judge Kennedy, on gender dis-
crimination, discrimination based on sex, I understand that the
Court has developed what is popularly known as the heightened
scrutiny test, as I mentioned, or intermediate scrutiny for this type
of discrimination case brought before the Court.

  Do you recognize that, or agree that is the standard the Court
now has set out.

  Judge KENNEDY. That is my understanding of the case law. The
Court, as an institution, and the judicial system generally has not
had the historical experience with gender discrimination cases that
we have had with racial discrimination cases. The law there really
seems to me in a state of evolution at this point. It is going to take
more cases for us to ascertain whether or not the heightened scru-
tiny standard is sufficient to protect the rights of women, or wheth-
er or not the strict standard should be adopted.

  Senator DECONCINI. There is no question in your mind, that the
Supreme Court is very clear--and whether they are termed con-
servative, or liberal judges, or moderate--whatever they may be--
that the judges recognize those standards, and you also subscribe to
the standards in general principle?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it may be that in resolving one of those
cases, I would give attention to Justice Marshall's standard and
make a determination whether or not that is a better expression
than the three-tier standard that the Court seems to use, although
it seems to me, on analysis, that those are very close.

  Senator DECONCINI. NOW I also understand that classification
based on gender must serve as an important governmental objec-
tive, and must be substantially related to the achievement of cer-
tain legislative goals.

  Have you delved into that, or have any thoughts on that?
                                         119

  Judge KENNEDY. NO. I understand what the Court is driving at,
and as I have indicated, it is probably because the Court simply
lacks the historical background to feel that it can impose the strict-
scrutiny standard without causing problems for itself down the
line.

  Senator DECONCINI. Without committing you on anything that
you might do as a Supreme Court Justice, do you think, generally
thinking, that that is a proper legal conclusion that the Court has
come to in this area?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I think the Court has, as 1 say, recognized
the fact that the law is in a state of evolution and flux, and is pro-
ceeding rather cautiously.

  Senator DECONCINI. YOU do not have some personal hostility to-
wards the way the Court is proceeding in this particular area of
gender discrimination as it relates to the Equal Protection Clause?

  Judge KENNEDY. The cases seem to me a plausible and rational
way to begin implementing the Equal Protection Clause.

  Senator LEAHY. I am sorry. I did not hear that.
  Judge KENNEDY. The cases seem to me a plausible and a rational
way to begin implementing the Equal Protection Clause.
  Senator LEAHY. I thought you said plausible and irrational.
Thank you.
  Senator DECONCINI. And of course with reference to other forms
of discrimination we have what is known as the rational basis,
which, if you accept the different standards we have--and I do not
make those decisions, but I certainly have read enough cases--that
it seems clear to me, that even if you feel, a judge feels that a set
of facts may not fall into the heightened scrutiny, or into the ra-
tional basis, that there is so much precedence here--and as you
say, it may be new, and does not have a long history of it--it ap-
pears to me to be very fundamental, that the Court is set, at least
on a course, to help guide lower courts, to help guide legislative
bodies, where these scrutinies are going to be placed.

  As to the rational basis test for other discrimination, do you rec-
ognize that as a given standard that the Court has pretty well set-
tled on for other discrimination, other than gender and race?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, it is, and as we know, all laws discrimi-
nate.

   Senator DECONCINI. That is right.
  Judge KENNEDY. YOU can get a driver's license if you are over 16
but not if you are under 16. Yet we know that there are some driv-
ers who are under 16 who are much better than many drivers who
are over sixteen. But we have a fixed and arbitrary standard. That
is the way laws must be written in order to have an efficient socie-
ty and an efficient legislative system.
   Senator DECONCINI. Have you delved at all, either in your job as
a judge, or as a teacher, with Justice Marshall's sliding scale?
   Have you written anything or done anything in that area?
  Judge KENNEDY. I have not written on it.
   Senator DECONCINI. YOU are aware of it yourself?
   Judge KENNEDY. I ask my students to explain to me why there is
any difference between that and the three-tier standard, and I am
not yet satisfied what the correct answer to that question should
be.
                                         120

   Senator DECONCINI. Then there is the proposition that has been
mentioned--I believe it is Judge Stevens--about a reasonableness
standard as a sole standard, and of course the Court has not accept-
ed that, although I believe Stevens is the only one that has men-
tioned that, and of course as we said, Marshall, a sliding scale
standard.

  The reasonable standard poses problems to this Senator, but I
welcome people who might disagree with that.

  Have you formed either a preference, or do you have any distinc-
tion in your mind between a three-tier standard that we have been
talking about, and the importance of it, particularly as it relates to
gender, and a reasonableness standard for all discrimination cases?

  Judge KENNEDY. I do not have a fixed or determined view. I
would offer this observation: one beneficial feature of a tier stand-
ard is that the court makes clear the substantive weight that it is
giving to the particular claim before it, and the court can then be
criticized, or vindicated as the case may be.

  It sets standards. And the lower courts have a certain amount of
guidance. The Supreme Court is in the difficult position of hearing
150 cases a year, and in doing so, providing the requisite doctrinal
guidance and supervision of the lower courts.

  This is a very difficult task, and not much has been written on
the difference between an intermediate appellate court judge, such
as I am, and the responsibilities of the judge of a supreme court of
a State or the Supreme Court of the United States.

  Judge Sneed of our court is always careful to point out that this
is an area of academic inquiry that should be explored. I think the
requirements, and the duties and the obligations, and the concerns
of those two different courts may be quite divergent.

  Senator DECONCINI. The interesting thing, as one views this--
and I think you make a good point, the history behind the Court's
struggle as it relates to the sex-discrimination cases--is the impor-
tance to the lower courts to see something coming from the Court
that is a bit consistent, even though it may fall into different
standards as they come.

  Judge, as an appellate judge, how helpful is that when the Su-
preme Court has these fundamental cases, if you want to call them,
where they start to become consistent in their holding and a stand-
ard starts to emerge?

  Is that as obvious to the federal judges, yourself, as it is to me,
that that would be extremely helpful, or is it difficult to imple-
ment?

  Judge KENNEDY. It is tremendously helpful. We wish that the Su-
preme Court could review most of our cases.

  As you know, the Supreme Court takes only about 2 percent of
the judgments of the circuit courts, and within that case mix it has
the duty to give us the necessary guidance.

  This of course is the way the case law method evolves, but we
wish we could have more guidance from the Court.

  Senator DECONCINI. I would like to turn to another subject
matter. The Chairman touched on it somewhat this morning, re-
garding your Canadian Institute speech that you made in Decem-
ber of 1986, and as it relates particularly to the privacy question.

  On page 9 of that text, you state that:
                                             121

  It is difficult for courts to determine the scope of personal privacy when it is spe-
cifically mentioned in a written constitution, and that courts confront an even
greater challenge when the Constitution omits language containing the word priva-
cy, or private.

  Now in discussing the legislation, and the legitimate sources for
the right of privacy, you mentioned the Supreme Court cases, the
Bowers case, and the Griswold case.

  And it appears from reading your speech, that you have conclud-
ed, without question, that there is a fundamental right to privacy.
And I think the Chairman had you state that, and that is your po-
sition, correct?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I have indicated that is essentially cor-
rect. I prefer to think of the value of privacy as being protected by
the liberty clause; that is a semantic quibble, maybe it is not.

  Senator DECONCINI. But it is there, is that
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator DECONCINI. NO question about it being in existence?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator DECONCINI. NOW the Chairman also touched a little bit
on the ninth amendment, and just out of education for this Sena-
tor, do you have an opinion why the Supreme Court seems to shy
away from using that ninth amendment for some of these unspeci-
fied rights that have been, I think quite clearly enunciated by the
Court, vis-a-vis the right of privacy?
  Judge KENNEDY. Again, I am not sure. I think the Court finds a
surer guide in the 14th amendment or the fifth amendment, be-
cause the word liberty is there. In the ninth, of course, it is simply
an unenumerated right.
  I think also that the Court has this problem: as we have indicat-
ed, Mr. Madison, and his colleagues, were concerned with the ninth
amendment to assure the States that they had adequate freedom
for the writing of their own constitutions, but under the incorpora-
tion clause that is flipped around.
  Under the incorporation clause, the ninth amendment would ac-
tually be used as a constraint on the States, and I think the Court
may have some difficulty in moving in that direction. I do not
think the Court has foreclosed that, and I do not think, for rea-
sons--as I have indicated--that it should address the issue until it
has to.
  Senator DECONCINI. It just quite frankly fascinates me--not
being a judge--and I ask that question purely for myself, just want-
ing to know what a judge thinks. If we were sitting in my office or
at a social function, I might just ask you that question, because I
have never quite understood why the Court has ruled as it has. I
think you probably have as good an observation, or better than I
do.
  You have asserted, Judge Kennedy, that the opinions in the Gris-
wold case and the Bowers case, that they are in conflict, and on, I
think it is page 13 of your Canadian Institute speech, you discuss
whether a right is an essential right in a just system, or an essen-
tial right in our own constitutional system.
  You state that, quote: "One can conclude that certain essential
or fundamental rights should exist in any just society." End of
quote.
                                         122

   But then you say, quote: "It does not follow, that each of those
essential rights is one that we, as judges, can enforce under the
written Constitution. The due Process Clause is not a guarantee of
every right that should inhere in an ideal society." End of quote.

   How would you define the enforcement power given to the judici-
ary?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, the enforcement power of the judiciary is
to insure that the word liberty in the Constitution is given its full
and necessary meaning, consistent with the purposes of the docu-
ment as we understand it.

  There are many rights, it seems to me, that you could put in a
charter if you were writing a charter anew. The right to be ade-
quately housed and fed, and education, and other kinds of affirma-
tive rights.

  You see this in the European Convention on Human Rights,
which is what I was trying to contrast in the Canadian speech with
the Canadian constitution. We had three documents. It seems to
me an important point, that the Constitution works best if we have
a stable and a just society.

  The political branches of the Government can do much to insure
that these preconditions exist for the responsible exercise of our
freedom. And I think the courts are subjected to constraints, obvi-
ously, that the political branches are not, especially in that the
courts cannot initiate those programs and those requisites that are
necessary to insure that some very basic human needs are met.

  Senator DECONCINI. Some of those, quote, "basic human needs of
society," are you saying, really rest with other branches of govern-
ment, to see that they are available?

  Judge KENNEDY. That would be my general view.
  Senator DECONCINI. In your 1986 speech, you also advance, or
you said that the right to vote, quote, "is not fundamental in the
sense that like the privacy right, it supports substantive relief of
its own. It operates, instead, as a fundamental interest that trig-
gers rigorous equal protection scrutiny." End of quote.

  Am I correct to conclude from this statement, that you think the
right of privacy is a right, freestanding, which though not found in
the Constitution, requires similar consideration as those rights that
are indeed enumerated in the Constitution?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think that is
  Senator DECONCINI. IS that a right interpretation?
  Judge KENNEDY [continuing]. Generally correct to the extent that
we can identify that is a privacy interest. It struck me, as I was
preparing this speech for the Canadian judges, that the voting
rights cases are very interesting. I think most of us think of voting
as absolutely fundamental, and it is so listed in the Canadian con-
stitution. This is a new constitution that the Canadians have adopt-
ed, and their judges were there to see what benefit federal judges
in the United States could give them in interpreting the document.
  I found, doing the research for this, that although we think of
voting as a quintessential fundamental right, the Supreme Court
has not recognized it as a right that necessarily supports an action.
Though you may think that you have a right to vote for a sheriff
because in some States they are elected, the Supreme Court has
                                         123

not so far recognized that you have that right. That is why it is not
a fundamental right on which one can base a cause of action.

  It is a right that we recognize so that the vote cannot be diluted.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU mean that specifically the right to vote
for sheriff is not the same right as the fundamental right to vote?
Is that where you are drawing a distinction, that that is a political
subdivision, whether or not the right to vote for sheriff, or whether
there is a vote for sheriff----
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. As I understand the case law, the Court
has been very cautious about stating that there is a fundamental
right to vote that stands on its own foundation, simply to avoid
having to make this kind of inquiry.
  Whether or not one of those cases will arise in the future, I am
just not sure.
  Senator DECONCINI. YOU have written a very interesting case,
your opinion in Beller v. Middendorf case, dealing with the right of
privacy and homosexuality as it relates to certain regulations.
  The analysis of that case, if I understand it, was of some distinc-
tion as to the regulation vis-a-vis the actual right of a homosexual
act. Is that correct?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think that is a beginning point.
  Senator DECONCINI. And where your opinion zeroed in on. Now
criticism has been levied against your decision in the Beller case,
particularly the National Women's Law Center, asserting that in
the Beller, you incorrectly rejected a fundamental right, or the
analysis of a fundamental right in favor of a more easily met bal-
ance test when applying substantive due process analysis to this
particular set of regulations, and vis-a-vis, that it was relating to
the military.

  Can you address the distinction of this case for me, and your
thoughts, when you came to the conclusion that the military regu-
lations demanded a different view as to the right of regulating that
right of privacy, assuming that the right was there?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
   Senator DECONCINI. AS we know, just for the record, Judge, that
case has gone to the Supreme Court and no longer is one that
would be pending for you to have to decide on.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, this was really, I think, the first case in
the circuits on the question whether or not the armed services, in
this case the Navy, could dismiss its personnel for having engaged
in homosexual conduct while in the military. This case required
the court to undertake a rather comprehensive study of what the
Supreme Court had said on the issue to that point. We reiterated
what we thought the Supreme Court had taught us with reference
to substantive due process, to the rights of privacy and to the
rights of persons, and we set forth there our understanding of the
rules. We assumed arguendo, made the assumption, that in some
cases homosexual activity might be protected.

   We did not say it would be because that issue was not before us.
We decided instead only the narrow issue of whether or not in the
specific context of conduct occurring in the military the Navy had
a right and an interest which was sufficient to justify the termina-
tion and the discharge of the personnel.
                                         124

   Senator DECONCINI. And that is because the regulation was only
before you and not the question of whether or not there was a
right of privacy for this activity; is that what you are saying?

   Judge KENNEDY. Well, that is correct except that you might have
argued that tfyis right was so fundamental and so all-embracing
that the military could not

   Senator DECONCINI. Could not infringe on it.
  Judge KENNEDY. Could not abridge it in any event. For analytic
purposes, we simply left to another day the question whether or
not there is this fundamental right. In other contexts, we assumed
that there could be. We said that in the context of the military
there were adequate, stated, articulated reasons for the enforce-
ment of the policy.
  Senator DECONCINI. I read that case very carefully more than
once because of the significance of what I consider judicial re-
straint, and my compliments about the case, but it seemed to me a
great temptation for a judge who wanted to express an opinion for
or against there being a fundamental right for the homosexual ac-
tivity not to do so. I think the greatest compliment I can pay you,
Judge, is that you stayed with the issue there that I think was very
clear. But quite frankly, if a court had gone off the other way I
might have disagreed with him or I might have agreed with him,
and sometimes the court does. And I really wanted to say that that
opinion, as many of your opinions, have impressed upon me your
real strict understanding of what you think judicial restraint is,
and trying to exercise it.

  I may disagree with it or someone else may, but I think it is fun-
damental and very complimentary to you and the President for
choosing someone who has that restraint in their mind.

  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, sir.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you. I am finished for now. I do want
to talk to you about judicial tenure, a subject that you and I have
shared some fun over the last years, and we will do that tomorrow
I guess.
  Judge KENNEDY. I am looking forward to that, Senator.
  Senator DECONCINI. Thank you, Judge Kennedy.
  Recognize Senator Simpson because Senator Biden isn't here.
  Senator SIMPSON. I thought maybe we were going to take over
there for a minute. With the Chairman gone, it was marvelous op-
portunity, but I see you were prepared.
  Like Senator DeConcini, I found that case fascinating for its clar-
ity and getting just to where he wanted to get and not one whit
further. It was a superb decision, the one that Dennis speaks of.
Dennis and I come at each other occasionally in this league, but he
is a fine lawyer. I have a great respect for him. But I have exactly
the same feelings about that case in reading it and knowing what a
hot one that was.
  You know, you could have at any point gotten off onto a little
Hindu, some philosophy or something else, or morals or everything
else, but you really did a beautiful job with that.
  Well, I am interested in you doing very well in the surveillance
that is being performed here. I don't know if 1--I sometimes forget,
but I can't help but tell you that in the last such proceedings there
was a gathering of various groups who said that they wanted to
                                         125

find the transcript of the law school records of all the members of
the judiciary to see just how well we all did.

  The CHAIRMAN. I sent mine. Did you send yours? [Laughter.]
  No, I make it a habit of not picking mine up. I never have.
  Senator SIMPSON. I am going to move right on now. I have noth-
ing more.
  But I was interested, I told them, I said, I am glad you asked
that question because, I was in the top 20 of ray class. And there
was a scribbling and that was the end of that, and they went off, I
guess, to check.
  But the interesting thing was, then I think I turned to Joe and I
said, "That is going to be great." I said, "There were only 18 of us
in our class." [Laughter.]
  So we get the surveillance. Tndeed, we do, and there will be ever
more of that, and is, in this league. But with that the light comes
back to privacy. What is this right of privacy? We talked about it a
lot with regard to Judge Bork, an awful lot. This right to privacy,
what is it? You know, and you get into it. It is a detonator, and you
have answered that very well so far.
  I think the most pungent comment on it was Judge Griffin Bell,
our former Attorney General, who said that the right of privacy is
the right to be left alone. He really cut through the fog as we were
dissecting the right to privacy and where it was with Griswold and
whether it was written or unwritten, or in the Constitution or out
of the Constitution, or innate or conditional, is the right to be left
alone. That is something that really means something I think to
the American people. At least the average guy, he likes that.
  And then as I say, I shared with many my frustration that at the
very time these very high-blown probes were going on with regard
to that there were few worthies who were finding Judge Bork"
video rental records to find out what he was renting, hoping to find
all sorts of things. My mother has written me about that and
talked to me about that, and I won't go into that. It was a rather
smart phrase.
  But I commend the ACLU who rallied to that in a moment. The
District of Columbia is now dealing with a statute on that. There is
a House bill in on that, and I am certainly going to be looking into
that from the Senate side. So there's some positive results--but
those are more real examples than, j^ou know, law school theories
out there on the right to privacy. In my mind they are.
  Then I was interested in your comments on the two cases, Topic
v. Circle Realty and the Mountain View-Los Altos Union High
School District.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator SIMPSON. Hearing your explanation of those was very
important to me. You used the phrase "we ruled," and I think that
we don't want to forget that, as I understand it, and you can re-
spond, that those were both unanimous decisions of a three-judge
group. I mean, I don't know what you call that in your
  Judge KENNEDY. That is correct, Senator. It was a three-judge
panel on each of those cases.
  Senator SIMPSON. Panel.
  Judge KENNEDY. And, as you know, each judge researches the
record independently and we usually come to the bench not having
                                         126

conferred with one another in order to ensure both the fact and the
appearance of fairness for the litigants. We confer only after the
oral argument.

   Senator SIMPSON. In the Topic case, there was Justices Chambers
and Trask and yourself.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
   Senator SIMPSON. And in the Mountain View case, Justices Trask
and Poole and yourself.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator SIMPSON. And those were unanimous decisions and, as
you say, an interesting finding as to how you come to those, giving
every evidence of fairness in that; isn't it?
  Judge KENNEDY. That is correct. We thought both of them were
close cases in which we were trying to divine the will of Congress.
  Senator SIMPSON. I had a feeling that one on the disabled child
would be a very important one and probably will be reviewed
again, so I was particularly interested in that, you know, because it
is so easy to pick an issue and say how will you vote on this or--for
us, how do you vote on this, Simpson? You can't vote "maybe", you
have to vote yes or no. It is a very precise activity here.

  I was very interested in how you did decide because you obvious-
ly were impressed, and you have said it here. The facts of that case
were rather unique in a sense. This boy, this son who was involved
here had some extreme behavioral problem. It said, while the as-
sessment was taking place the boy was excluded from school for re-
peated misconduct. It went on, they stopped the process then. They
stopped, and no one knows why.

  Then there was the offer to send a teacher to the boy's home for
instruction. District personnel recommended private schools. The
appellant placed the boy in one of the schools and he was expelled
for continued misbehavior and then he attended another. He was a
very disruptive young man apparently is what I gather. It is a very
short opinion.

  And then it was determined that he be placed in a resource
classroom in a regular public school program, and the appellant,
still dissatisfied, requested an administrative hearing under the
Act and the administrative law judge determined the parents were
entitled to reimbursement.

  The school district then brought the action and the appellant
was saying that--the district court, of course, adopted that and
held the appellant had violated the so-called "stay put" provision--
I wouldn't want that to get left out here--by placing the boy in this
other school before the administrative proceedings were concluded.

  That is a very important thing because it says very clearly that
during the pendency of any proceeding conducted pursuant to this
section unless the State or local education agency and the parents
or guardians otherwise agree the child shall remain in the then
current educational placement of such child until all such proceed-
ings have been completed.

  I was fascinated by the precision of that. She was saying that her
actions were not unilateral and they were saying they were, it was
that simple, I guess. And you were saying something that is said to
us all the time as Congresspersons. Why do you pass laws that
                                         127

leave the burden on the local districts or the local county or the
municipality?

  Your decision said that the threat of damages in a case like this
would not make compliance any more likely and would subject
school districts to contingent liabilities hardly foreseeable when the
annual school budget is prepared.

  Now, with disabled children and the disabilities and special edu-
cation, one of the most serious problems in the United States is
that the school districts can't afford it. And they tell us that when
they go home, but who is going to come back here and say you
can't afford to take care of disabled children, so we don't say much
about it. We just pass another law and ship it back to the local dis-
trict.

  Some districts are paying out $100,000 and $200,000 for maybe
one person in one year, and we just sit and say go ahead, that is
your job. Now that won't last much longer. They can't stand that
burden.

  So it is such a well-focused opinion. A very well-centered and rea-
sonable decision, and I don't think it should have any kind of
flavor that somehow you are not sensitive to the disabled in our
society. And I don't think that was the intent but we surely
wouldn't want it to be at all expressed in that form because that is
not what it dealt with as I see it. Compassion was there but this
was, under the fact situation, a most difficult person.

   And we do that with our new asbestos law. We passed a dazzling
law about asbestos in the schools and then just sent it back to the
States and said go to it. We don't know where you are going to get
the money to do two or three hundred grand worth of ripping as-
bestos out of a school built in 1930, but get at it. And this is the
same kind of thing that we do well, and I think you called atten-
tion to that.

  Well, that is just my view of that. Some of that of that case.
  Then with regard to discrimination, that certainly came up and
it has come up again here today. Discrimination based on gender, I
don't like to harp here but I think it is so important that we just
try to keep a continuity. We have a situation where six members of
this 14-member panel have voted to cast a vote specifically to dis-
criminate against women based solely on their gender. That may
be a bit surprising but it is very real and you can't describe it any
other way; and that is, to exclude women from the draft.

  And six members of this panel, three from each side of the aisle,
so we don't get into sloppy partisanship, voted to exclude women
from the draft, which is obviously and patently a discrimination
against women based solely on their gender. There is no other way
to describe that that I know, as a lawyer.

  So that is interesting, when we get into those tough issues that
seem so good when they appear in law review articles, but in real
life they are just plain tough.

  You cited a very interesting thing about, I think you were talk-
ing about advocacy before the courts. The quality of advocacy has
gone down, I hear you saying, or is not what it should be. Would
you develop that a bit more? Tell me a little more about that. How
do you feel about that?
                                         128

   Judge KENNEDY. Well, Senator, sometimes one asks the question,
does a good lawyer really make a difference? The questioner I
think, may think it a trick question because if you say yes, then
you are not listening to the law, and if you say no, then you are
just wasting your time listening to the oral argument.

  But these cases are very, very difficult, and the law draws its
sources from many places. Judges listen to many voices. The con-
straints and the compulsions of the facts of the particular case, and
of the legislative history, all have to be brought to bear on the spe-
cific case before the court. Far more often than most people realize,
the three judges on that panel all have their minds made up
during the oral argument.

  It is the time that I use to make up my mind. I wait until that
oral argument. It is a tremendously important half hour or hour. It
is very important that counsel be skilled.

  Oh, sometimes we know that the counsel just has not seen the
problem, and we will see it for him and save the case. But really,
we have to impress upon the bar that the duty of the lawyer is to
the client, and he may not let the court do the work for him or her.
There should just be no shoddy practice in the federal courts; and
there is too much of it.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I think it was former Chief Justice
Burger who made some statement years ago that we were doing
747 litigation with Piper Cub pilots, or something like that, and I
think that is true. I admired Justice Burger, a Chief Justice, in so
many ways a superb human being. He is a delightful gentlemen. I
have come to know him personally and that has been my great
gain.

  Would you, if you were on the Supreme Court, and I honestly
and sincerely hope you will be, would you hesitate to write and
speak on that subject of lawyers when you are addressing the
American Bar Association or the federal bar? Is that something
you would like to get involved in, making our profession better and
speaking as one who has heard these men and women before you?

  Judge KENNEDY. I am committed to that. The former Chief Jus-
tice, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, did a marvelous service to the Con-
stitution and to the rule of law when he insisted on this through-
out the country. This is not to denigrate the legal profession or the
law schools. They are doing a magnificent job.

  But one of the frustrations of being a judge is that we get away
from the practice somewhat. I see or hear of things going on in the
practice, and conclude the ethic is changing out there. The law
practice has become much more of a marketplace than of an ethi-
cal discipline, and I am concerned about that. But I am so far re-
moved from the practice that I am not sure there is a whole lot I
can do about it, other than to talk about the problem.

  Senator SIMPSON. But you would be talking about that if you
were on the Supreme Court bench?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think it is vital.
  Senator SIMPSON. That is very important to hear you say that. I
think it is critical. I practiced law for 18 years and I loved it, and I
did everything from the police court to the federal district court--
everything. And now in the marts of trade, the law school students
are interested only in what they will receive on their first job.
                                         129

Those who recruit them are interested only in those who are in the
top 8 percent of their class. They must come from the best schools,
whoever makes those descriptions, and they must I guess have an
overwelming desire for pure greed. Because I think greed is over-
whelming our profession. I think they are not practicing law, they
are practicing money, and that disturbs me.

  And, if you are placed on this Court, it will be a delight to see
you with your tremendous ability to deal with young people as you
have in your law school, in McGeorge, that you can get them back
on track as to what it is. And what it is is not to see how many
depositions you can Xerox during the discovery proceedings, you
know, by the metric ton, or how to make discovery to put your chil-
dren through college. The first and only rule under Rule 1 of the
Rules of Civil Procedure is that the rule shall be construed to
secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every
action. That is what it says, and it says that in every State rule,
under the State rules of civil procedure.

  So as we talk about dissecting cases, and that is critically impor-
tant, we all do that in our law careers, and in theory and philoso-
phizing the issue we are forgetting what has happened to the little
guy. He can't even afford a lawyer anymore.

  What are your thoughts about that?
  Judge KENNEDY. Just to go back one moment
  Senator SIMPSON. Please.
  Judge KENNEDY [continuing]. To your first comment, the bar of
the ninth circuit and the leaders of the bar in every circuit in the
country do work with the courts very, very closely to assist their
colleagues in understanding the rule of courts. They have helped
us implement rule 11 on sanctions. They sometimes forget, though,
the very critical point that the first duty of the lawyer is really to
the law. He has an ethical obligation.
  The greatest privilege that a lawyer has is counseling a client. I
think we all miss that from our practice.
  Every lawyer every day acts as a judge, telling his client what
the facts are and insisting that his client or her client conforms
their conduct to an ethical standard. That is what the law should
be about. I am afraid we have lost some of that ideal in the profes-
sion, and part of the reason is money.
  You can not have it two ways. You can not complain about poor
representation and then, on the other hand, complain about the
cost of legal services. There is a relation between the two. Law is so
complex now that it takes lawyers longer to do the job. What the
answer is so far as legal fees are concerned, I don't know. But it is
quite true that if a wage-earner, a person in the middle-class is hit
with a lawsuit and does not have an insurance company to defend
him or her, they are in big, big trouble.
  The repeat players in the system and, as I have indicated, includ-
ing some public interest groups are very adequately represented.
But the person that has one brush with the law sometimes has a
problem.
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes, that is an interesting part of our profes-
sion, counseling a real live, human being client who is in extremity
usually. Because they have already talked to their spouse and said,
"I wonder if I should go get a lawyer," and they think "I don't
                                          130

think so. Better watch out." Then they go to their brother and then
their uncle and finally they walk in to see a lawyer, and they know
they are in trouble and they go only in extremity.

   You know, that is the way law really is practiced in the world. It
is not like here where there are 33,000 lawyers who, if you turn
them loose with an anguished and tearful human being, they
would hope they could find somebody down in the lower bowels of
the office to take care of the poor old soul.

   Well, I haven't asked many questions yet, have I? But I have
been certainly launching around in them. Another thing though I
wanted to--it is so good to hear someone saying that, and be on the
Court saying that where you will be heard and have a forum. But,
again, take the issue of clubs. You stated your position I thought
very clearly. There is a discrimination based on hostility. And then
there is a discrimination just based on plain old, you know, indif-
ference, not paying attention. Joining a club and you don't know
what is in the by-laws. You just were looking for a place to play
squash.

   We have been through some remarkable exercises here. We
nearly torpedoed a guy because he was a member of the Masons.
And everybody sobered up real quick and the word went around
that there were about 20 of us in the Masons in the U.S. Senate
and 60 or 70 over in the other body, or more than that, and it is
really not too sinister an organization. Their tenets there are based
on a fierce protection of wife and mother and daughter and son
and brother. Probably like the Knights of Columbus in that re-
spect. But we had to go through all that. I mean you really would
have been dazzled by that.

  And groups that care for the needy, and there is, you know, a
secret society that believes in love of fellow man and woman. Inter-
esting.

   But the Elks Club now is really getting to be the epitome now. I
joined the Elks Lodge in Cody, Wyoming, so I could get a suds on
Sunday. That was the original reason. Since then I learned what
they did, and their order is based on charity and brotherly love and
helping their fellow man. That is what it is. It is not some sinister
outfit.

   I don't know about the Sutter Club but they must have some
purpose. Charity--you know, they actually take Christmas baskets
and do little silly things like that in real life in Cody, Wyoming,
and help people. Give scholarships to boys and girls.

   So, it really is fascinating. I did bring this up and I want to bring
it up one more time because we had a group that wrote to us in
strident terms during the last hearing, the National Women's Law
Center, I believe was the name, in Chicago. There is a forum there
of women lawyers. There is not a single man on the letterhead.
And they really raised hell with us. And I asked if they had any
men members, and they said no. But there wasn't much more to be
said about that.

   But, you know, come on. You can't have it both ways in this
game. You reach the height of absurdity, and that is what gets
reached in this exercise.

   Well, I will hear from someone on that subject, but it is impor-
tant to me to know that you have done the human practice of law
                                         131

for 13 years and apparently with distinction that testimony from
your neighbors, Vic Fazio, to hear him speak, I have great regard
for him, Bob Matsui, Pete Wilson. Those things are very important
to us as we make our decisions.

  I understand you have represented minority groups. You were in
the Judicial Administration for the Pacific Territories of American
Samoa, were you not?

  Judge KENNEDY. I am still on that committee, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. And what is the nature of that work-- I have 4
minutes remaining? Wait. Forget it. Don't bother with that.
[Laughter.]
  You were a member of a union, yourself?
  Judge KENNEDY. I am trying to--1 believe that I was. I had
summer jobs where I did manual labor, usually in the oil fields, but
one summer I worked in a lumber mill and I believe I was a
member of the Millworkers union. At least I remember paying the
money. I do not know if that made me a member or not.

  Senator SIMPSON. If you paid money, we will talk to Lane Kirk-
land. I think you are all right if you paid in. But you are sensitive
to those rights of unions and minorities and women and pro bono
activity and fairness. Those things have all been forged in you.
Would you say that that is a very important thing as you go on to
this new duty, which I hope you will?

  Judge KENNEDY. NO judge comes to the bench as a clean slate
and completely free of all compulsions and restraints from his
background. Therefore I think the background of a person, his tem-
perament and his character, or her background, temperament and
character, are of relevance to your consideration. I have been
pleased to make available to you my life so far as I can remember
it, Senator.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, we will do that sometime. I would like
that. And it has been a real treat to almost watch your cognitive
processes as you deal with the issues and the questions presented
to you. You handle the inquiry very well, and it is interesting to
hear the verbalization of that cognitive process after you churn it,
and it comes out in a way that is very understandable. And as I
have always said, what good is our whole practice or profession if
those we are supposed to serve can't understand what we are doing
for them, can't read the lease you prepare, don't understand the
will you did, can't understand the property settlement that you
drafted. Clarity will save us yet. But I think you are going to be a
great advocate of that. Thank you, sir.

  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Senator.

   The CHAIRMAN. Judge, do you realize how difficult you are
making this for Senator Simpson? He spent a whole half hour de-
fending you against charges no one made. [Laughter.]

   You know, he is so much in the mode from the last confrontation
that I hope that Senator Heflin says something nasty so we get
something going here.

   Senator SIMPSON. YOU have been always good with equal time.
   The CHAIRMAN. YOU are the only one I would take the liberty to
kid with because I know you have a sense of humor that exceeds
mine.
                                          132

   And I want to say one other thing while we are on this. And that
is, that things haven't changed all that much, Judge. I remember
my first case as a young lawyer in the Court of Common Pleas in
New Castle County, Delaware. I was assigned to--I was sent a
client who was accused of driving under the influence, and my first
thing that I did was to go in and to ask for a continuance.

   And, as I stood there waiting in line, a fellow named Switch Di
Stefano, God bless him, the clerk of the court, turned to Judge
Gallo and he said, and I could hear him say, "Ask him if rule 1 has
been complied with?"

   And he asked me, and I looked and I panicked. I thought I knew
what rule 1 was but I couldn't see how it related to this. And I
said, "Your Honor, I am embarrassed. I am not sure what rule 1
is."

  They called me to the bench and Switch Di Stefano leaned over
and he said, "Before we grant the continuance, have you gotten the
fee?" [Laughter.]

  I am sure that never happened in your life, Judge, but it hap-
pened in mine. And I want to yield now to the Senator from Ala-
bama.

  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Kennedy, have you found the teaching of
law while being a judge rewarding?

  Judge KENNEDY. I have to say since I am under oath that teach-
ing is the most enjoyable day of my week. I love it.

  Senator HEFLIN. Would you plan if you go to the Supreme Court
to do some teaching, too, on the side?

  Judge KENNEDY. From what I hear about the workload, I think
the answer must be no, Senator.

  Senator HEFLIN. Does teaching cause any problems with prede-
termination of issues?

  Judge KENNEDY. I fear that if I were appointed to the Supreme
Court that it might. In the ninth circuit there would be maybe two
or three times a year in which I would get a little close to a case
that was before me, and so I thought I would stay away from it.
But you know what the usual drill is. You simply ask the student
the question and then you take the opposite side.

  I always made it clear to my students that I did not care what
they thought but I did care passionately how they came to that
conclusion, within certain broad limits of tolerance, of course.

  Senator HEFLIN. In the case of U.S. v. Alberto Antonio Leon,
which is now a famous case--and was heard by the Supreme
Court--you dissented from the opinion of the ninth circuit and you
closed your dissent with this language:

  Whatever the merits of the exclusionary rule its rigidities become compounded
unacceptably when courts presume innocent conduct when the only common sense
explanation for it is ongoing criminal activity. I would reverse the order suppressing
the evidence.

  Now I would assume as a teacher after the Supreme Court decid-
ed the Leon case, you and your students discussed this decision and
also your dissent in the ninth circuit's decision. Did that occur?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, Senator, the constitutional law course as
it is now composed no longer includes criminal procedure, so I was
not able to discuss that with my students. As you have indicated, I
get somewhat, at least by inference, more credit for the Leon case
                                         133

than I deserve, because I did not find that there had been an illegal
search in that case.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU looked at the conduct and felt it was con-
tinuous conduct and therefore that the information was adequate
for the warrant, but you did use the word "good faith" in one
aspect

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator HEFLIN. SO you at least have some claim for that. You
also mentioned the rigidities of the exclusionary rule. Do you see in
other areas, say in warrantless cases, that the good faith exception
could be applied?
  Judge KENNEDY. I was on a panel and authored the decision in a
case called the United States v. Peterson in which drug enforce-
ment agents relied on the statement of Philippine law officials for
the proposition that they could tap a telephone.

  They interdicted a ship some 100 miles off the coast of California
with a huge volume of illegal drugs on it. We held that the good
faith exclusionary rule applied in the circumstances on the theory
that the officers acted reasonably in relying on the assurances of
their foreign counterparts. So I have addressed that issue. There
was no warrant there.

  Whether or not it should apply to warrantless searches in the
United States is a question that I have not addressed, and I would
want to consider very deliberately whether or not the rule should
be extended to those instances because you then get, as you know,
into the problem of objective versus subjective bad faith. You must
be very careful to ensure that by the exception you do not swallow
the rule.

  Senator HEFLIN. NOW let me ask you about the interpretation of
the freedom of religion and the Establishment Clause. Over the
past several years many have accused the Supreme Court of inter-
preting the Establishment Clause in an overly expansive manner.
You are quoted in a 1968 interview with McGeorge School of Law
newspaper as saying that the Court should leave room for some ex-
pressions of religion in State-operated places. There should be a
place for some religious experience in schools or a Christmas tree
in a public housing center.

  Now, without speaking to any specific case, can you elaborate a
little on your thoughts pertaining to this issue?

  Judge KENNEDY. I can not recall that article or that interview. I
saw another article about it just yesterday or the day before. I
would say that the law would be an impoverished subject if my
views did not change over 20 years.

  As I understand the Establishment Clause doctrine, the Court
has a very difficult problem because, as you know, the Establish-
ment Clause, which tells us that the Government should not aid or
assist religion, in some senses works at cross purposes with the free
exercise clause. The classic example is the furnishing of a chaplain
to the military. If the Government furnishes the chaplain, it is in a
sense assisting religion. If it does not it is denying soldiers whose
conduct is completely controlled by their officers the free exercise
of their religion. So the clauses sometimes point in different direc-
tions.
                                         134

   Now, the test the Supreme Court has for Establishment Clause
cases is whether or not the particular legislation or governmental
program adopted has the purpose or the effect of aiding religion or
of hurting religion and whether or not there is a forbidden entan-
glement of religion. The Court is struggling with that test on a
case-by-case basis. The decisions are difficult to reconcile, Senator.

   In this area more than in almost any other one the Court has
relied on the historic practices of the people of the United States,
and has found in history a guide to a decision. In that respect in
this area history has been helpful to the Supreme Court. It seems
to me that that is an appropriate reference in those cases.

  Where I would draw the line in any given case is a question that
I have not addressed in my circuit decisions so far. I have no really
fixed views on the subject other than to say that the framers were
very careful about this. Many of the framers were religious people,
but they were careful not to allow that to enter into the debates in
the Constitutional Convention.

  Madison was very concerned about religious intolerance and so
when Alexander Hamilton asked for the protection of contracts,
Madison asked that the test oath clause be put in the main body of
the Constitution. The main body of the Constitution contains reli-
gious protection and the framers were very, very conscious of this.
It is a fundamental value of the Constitution of the United States
that the Government does not impermissibly assist or aid all reli-
gions or any one religion over the other.

  Senator HEFLIN. Going to another subject, media reports have in-
dicated that your relationship with President Reagan came as a
result of your assistance in writing proposition No. 1, which was a
tax limitation measure. Would you tell us about your circum-
stances in relationship to now Attorney General Edwin Meese and
now President Ronald Reagan when he was Governor and the cir-
cumstances concerning that?

  Judge KENNEDY. In those halcyon days, Senator, when our cur-
rent President was Governor of the State of California and Edwin
Meese, I suppose his executive secretary, I am not sure exactly of
the title, the Governor's administration concluded that it was time
to propose to the people of the State of California an amendment
which would limit the spending of the government of the State of
California. It was a rather complex proposal designed to impose a
spending limit. It was hoped that tax reform would follow from
that. The spending limit was based on a percentage of the total
gross product for the State of California, and the permitted spend-
ing, expressed as a percentage, was to decline each year. It was a
highly complex measure.

  The Governor at the time believed very strongly that the citizens
of the State of California should be able to control their govern-
ment. He and Mr. Meese asked if I would be the draftsman for this
complex proposal. One of the reasons the proposal failed of adop-
tion, I am told, is it was too difficult for people to understand. I
understood it, but it was an exceptionally complex document. It
was very interesting to work on.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, your judicial writings have improved.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, thank you.
                                         135

  Senator HEFLIN. In this Canadian Institute speech you deal with
unenumerated rights, and in that speech you state that most rights
in the Constitution are enforced as negatives or prohibitions, not
affirmative grants, and you list as examples, Congress shall make
no law respecting the establishment of religion, no warrant shall
issue but upon probable cause, or nor shall any State deprive any
person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.

  You seem to view these prohibitions in the Constitution as limit-
ing the expansion of judicial power. Are they also, though, a means
of preventing government from denying individuals their funda-
mental rights?

  Judge KENNEDY. I would agree that they certainly are, Senator.
And in the negative form they are easily understood well, not
always easily enforced, but I think easily understood.

  Senator HEFLIN. In Judge Bork's hearing, I think we questioned
him for a long time before we finally got around to asking him
about Roe v. Wade. I suppose if there is any one issue, that issue is
probably within the spotlight the most.

  He answered by saying that his position relative to reviewing
Roe v. Wade, if it came up for a review and if he was on the Su-
preme Court, would be directed in three different areas. One is
looking to the Constitution to find whether or not there was any
specific authorization for an abortion; second, whether or not he
could find a general right of privacy by which he would base a deci-
sion relative to Roe v. Wade; and, third, stare decisis.

  There was no question that he had been quoted as saying that
that decision was a unsatisfactory decision of the U.S. Supreme
Court. He had previously been quoted and he admitted that he
thought it was a wrong decision, and that he thought that the rea-
soning of the decision was defective.

  He outlined, not in specific terms the criteria that he would use,
but in general terms the criteria that he would review relative to
stare decisis. In all fairness I think the American people would like
for you to give an expression pertaining to that case, your views,
how you would approach, without specifying how you might hold,
but how you would review and how you would approach that issue.

  Judge KENNEDY. In any case, Senator, the role of the judge is to
approach the subject with an open mind, to listen to the counsel, to
look at the facts of the particular case, to see what the injury is,
see what the hurt is, to see what the claim is, and then to listen to
his or her colleagues, and then to research the law. What does the
most recent precedent, the precedent that is before the Court if it
is being examined for a possible overruling, and what does that
precedent say? What is its logic? What is its reasoning? What has
been its acceptance by the lower courts? Has the rule proven to be
workable? Does the rule fit with what the judge deems to be the
purpose of the Constitution as we have understood it over the last
200 years? History is tremendously important in this regard.

   Now, as you well appreciate, and as you certainly know, Senator,
stare decisis is not an automatic mechanism. We do not just pull a
stare decisis lever or not pull it in any particular case. Stare decisis
is really a description of the whole judicial process that proceeds on
a case-by-case basis as judges slowly and deliberately decide the
facts of a particular .case and hope their decision yields a general
                                         136

principle that may be of assistance to themselves and to later
courts.

  Stare decisis ensures impartiality. That is one of its principal
uses. It ensures that from case to case, from judge to judge, from
age to age, the law will have a stability that the people can under-
stand and rely upon, that judges can understand and rety upon,
and that attorneys can understand and rely upon. That is a very,
very important part of the system.

  Now there have been discussions that stare decisis should not
apply as rigidly in the constitutional area as in other areas. The
argument for that is that there is no other overruling body in the
constitutional area. In a stare decisis problem involving a noncon-
stitutional case, the Senate and the House of Representatives can
tell us we are wrong by passing a bill. That can not happen in the
constitutional case.

  On the other hand, it seems to me that when judges have an-
nounced that a particular rule is found in the Constitution, it is en-
titled to very great weight. The Court does two things: it interprets
history and it makes history. It has got to keep those two roles sep-
arate. Stare decisis helps it to do that.

  Senator HEFLIN. Let me ask you about the death penalty. If you
believe that the death penalty is constitutional, and some of the
speeches you have made indicate that you believe that it is, what
safeguards do you think are necessary to prevent the use of the
death penalty in a discriminatory manner?

  Judge KENNEDY. I, at the outset. Senator, would like to under-
score that I have not committed myself as to the constitutionality
of the death penalty. I have stated that if it is found to be constitu-
tional it should be enforced.

  With reference to its being used in a discriminatory manner,
there are at least two safeguards. The first is that the legislature
itself defines the category of crimes that deserve the ultimate pun-
ishment. The second is that courts develop, articulate, and pro-
nounce rules for instructions to the jury so that the jury's decision
is properly channeled. You know better than I because of your ex-
perience in the trial courts, Senator, the tremendous power of that
jury. Juries simply must be given clear guidelines so that they can
apply the death penalty on a consistent basis.

  It is not clear to me that under the existing law that requisite
has been satisfied in some of the cases that I have reviewed. On the
other hand, I recognize the difficulty in formulating these stand-
ards that I so blithely recommend.

  Senator HEFLIN. In 1980, you gave a speech in Salzburg, Austria,
which focused on the power of the Presidency. In that speech you
stated:

  I think that the accepted view is that while Congress can instruct the President in
most matters there are some inherent powers in the office exercisable in an emer-
gency but their nature and extent are still not fully understood. These answers
must wait an evolutionary process in the continuing traditions of the Presidency.
My position has always been that as to some fundamental constitutional questions it
is best not to insist on definitive answers. The constitutional system works best if
there remains twilight zones of uncertainty and tensions between the component
parts of the government. The surest protection of constitutional rule lies not in de-
finitive announcements or power boundaries but in a mutual respect and deference
                                             137

among all the component parts. This furthers recognition of the need to preserve a
working balance.

  Would you elaborate on the inherent powers you believe might
be exercisable by the President in an emergency?

  Judge KENNEDY. AS you know, Senator, if you look at article II of
the Constitution, it is much different in style than article I.

  Article I, which specifies the powers of the legislative branch, is
quite detailed. Article II is not. It is almost as if it were written by
different people. It was not, but it looks that way.

  It is a text in which you have to isolate phrases in order to pick
out what the President's powers are. The President's power is to
exercise the executive power; that is the way article II begins; he
has the powers of the commander in chief; he has the power of ap-
pointment, the power to receive ambassadors, and the duty faith-
fully to execute the law. Duty has translated to power by the tradi-
tion of the office. I am not quite sure how that happened.

   Youngstown Sheet and Tube tells us, or it begins to discuss, the
critical question, whether or not the President is simply the agent
of Congress, bound to do its bidding in all instances, or whether or
not there is a core of power that lies at the center of the presiden-
tial office that the Congress cannot take away.

  As I understand current doctrine, and the Youngstown case,
there is that core of power. The extent to which it can be exercised
in defiance of the congressional will is a question of abiding con-
cern, I know, to the Congress and to the judges.

  My point in those remarks was that these power zones are per-
haps best defined as each branch accommodates the other, and ex-
presses deference to the legitimate concerns of the other branch.

  The history of the development of the presidency has been one of
evolution. One suggestion given for the different textual treatment
in article II was that the framers knew that Washington would be
the president. They trusted him, indicating that the framers
thought there would be an evolutionary component to the presiden-
cy as it evolved.

  The extent to which the presidency can be controlled by the
courts is not yet clear. We know that in the Youngstown case,
where the president seized the steel mills, and in the Nixon tapes
case, where the President was ordered to turn the tapes over to the
prosecutor, there was immediate compliance by the president with
the mandate of the Court.

  To date, the court's authority to review the acts of the president
has not been questioned by the president. Lincoln questioned the
authority, because of the necessity of the Civil War.

  Whether or not the courts are the appropriate body for the rec-
onciliation of all of the disputes between the political branches of
the government is a question as to which I have some doubt. In
some disputes, it may be unclear there is a case and controversy
which the courts can adequately and meaningfully interpret con-
sistent with the case-by-case method.

  Senator HEFLIN. Have you expressed in your opinions or speech-
es or statements a position on congressional standing?

  Judge KENNEDY. NO, sir, I have not. It has been an issue that has
arisen principally in the District of Columbia circuit. It is an issue
on which I have not expressed myself, and have no particular fixed
                                          138

views, other than, as I have indicated, to state that one of the rea-
sons for a case and controversy requirement is to recognize the lim-
itations of the judicial office.

   When President Truman seized the steel mills, this was an act
that took place at a fixed time. It was like a taking under the fifth
amendment. It was something that the court could very manage-
ably work with. And they gave an important pronouncement in
that case.

   It is a case that still has puzzles to it, but it is one of the leading
cases on presidential power. That was a circumstance that had
fixed boundaries, both as to time and to space, and the actions of
the participants involved. That is the kind of case that the court
can very manageably undertake.

   Senator HEFLIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time is up.
   Senator KENNEDY. The Senator from Iowa.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   Judge Kennedy, during the committee's consideration of Su-
preme Court nominees over the past several months, it has been
asserted several times by different people that one of the jobs of a
judge is to find and create rights which are not in fact mentioned
in the Constitution, but which the Judge might deem to be very
"fundamental." Fundamental in terms of the mind of the judge
and the judge's own abstract moral philosophy.
   Do you see any dangers with such an undefined standard as a
foundation for constitutional analysis? In other words, how confi-
dent can we be that judges, fallible human beings as they are, will
exercise that mighty power appropriately?
  Judge KENNEDY. I am not sure how you can be satisfied that a
judge will not overstep the Constitutional bounds. What you must
do is, number one, examine the judge's record; document his or her
qualifications and commitment to constitutional rule.
   As I think Mr. Justice Jackson said, judges are not there because
they are infallible; they are infallible because they are there.
   I think that comment is somewhat inappropriate. I do not think
judges think of themselves as infallible at any point. Certainly the
history of the Supreme Court in which the Court has been willing
to recognize its errors and to overrule its decisions, indicates that
the justices take very conscientiously their duty to interpret the
Constitution in the appropriate way.
   Senator GRASSLEY. If we do not recognize the dangers of judges
using undefined standards, aren't we doomed to end up with a
small group of unelected, unrepresentative judges making the law
in this country?
  Judge KENNEDY. That, Senator, is one of the great concerns of
any scholar of the Constitution. This is not the aristocracy of the
robe.
  Judges are not to make laws; they are to enforce the laws. This
is particularly true with reference to the Constitution.
   The judges must be bound by some neutral, definable, measura-
ble standard in their interpretation of the Constitution.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Kennedy, you stated in an August 1987
speech before the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference that there are
two limitations on judicial power. I hope I interpret the speech cor-
rectly.
                                         139

  The first limitation is that the Constitution is a written law to
which courts are bound when announcing constitutional doctrine.

  As you know, Judge Kennedy, the Bill of Rights and many later
amendments are phrased in broad, spacious terms. If a judge were
so inclined, he or she could expand the interpretation, use, and
effect of many provisions of the Constitution.

  And I believe you to be an advocate of judicial restraint. As Chief
Justice Marshall emphasized in Marbury v. Madison, judges have a
duty to respect constitutional restraints.

  How do you apply the words of the Constitution to problems that
the framers could not have foreseen?

  Judge KENNEDY. The framers, because they wrote a constitution,
I think well understood that it was to apply to exigencies and cir-
cumstances and perhaps even crises that they could never foresee.

  So any theory which is predicated on the intent the framers had
what they actually thought about, is just not helpful.

  Then you can go one step further on the progression and ask,
well, should we decide the problem as if the framers had thought
about it? But that does not seem to me to be very helpful either.

  What I do think is that we can follow the intention of the fram-
ers in a different sense. They did do something. They made certain
public acts. They wrote. They used particular words. They wanted
those words to be followed.

  We can see from history more clearly now, I think, what the
framers intended, than if we were sitting back in 1789. I made that
discovery when I gave the speech to the Canadian judges.

  They had just written a constitution 2 or 3 years ago. They knew
the draftsmen. And yet, they were, it seemed to me, more at sea as
to what it meant than we were in interpreting our own Constitu-
tion.

  We have a great benefit, Senator, in that we have had 200 years
of history. History is not irrelevant. History teaches us that the
framers had some very specific ideas.

  As we move further away from the framers, their ideas seem
almost more pure, more clarified, more divorced from the partisan
politics of their time than before.

  So a study of the intentions and the purposes and the statements
and the ideas of the framers, it seems to me, is a necessary starting
point for any constitutional decision.

   Senator GRASSLEY. IS there any room for a judge to apply his or
her own values and beliefs for the purpose of interpreting the text
of the Constitution?

  Judge KENNEDY. The judge must constantly be on guard against
letting his or her biases or prejudices or affections enter into the
judicial process.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Well, what other factors are there which can
affect a judge's interpretation of the text of the Constitution?

   Can these factors be determined and applied without involving
the personal bias of the judge?

   Judge KENNEDY. The whole idea of judicial independence, the
whole reason that judges are not accountable to the Congress once
they're confirmed, other than for misbehavior, the whole theory is
that the judge is impartial; that he will apply a law, or that she
                                          140

will apply a law, that is higher than themselves. It is higher than
their own particular predilections.

   Senator GRASSLEY. I do not disagree, but I do not know to what
extent you mentioned other factors that can come into play to
affect a judge's interpretation of the text of the Constitution?

  Judge KENNEDY. When a judge hears a constitutional case, a
judge gets an understanding of the Constitution from many
sources: from arguments of counsel; from the nature of the injuries
and the claims asserted by the particular person; and from the
reading of the precedents of the court, and the writings of those
who studied the Constitution.

  All of these factors are, in essence, voices through which the
Constitution is being heard.

  But the idea is that the Constitution is itself a law. It is a docu-
ment that must be followed.

  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU described yourself in a February, 1984
speech before the Sacramento Rotary Club as a "judicial conserva-
tive."

  Does this mean that you are in any way adverse to evolving in-
terpretations of the Constitution that accommodate new technology
or current trends in society?

  Judge KENNEDY. A conservative recognizes that any State must
contain within it the ability to change in order to preserve those
values that a conservative deems essential.

  As applied to a judge, I think that is consistent with the idea
that constitutional values are intended to endure from generation
to generation and from age to age.

  Senator GRASSLEY. In that August, 1987 speech before the Ninth
Circuit Judicial Conference--which I previously mentioned--you
stated that the doctrine of original intent is best conceived of as an
"objective" rather than a "methodology."

  I would like to have you explain the difference between using the
doctrine of original intent as an "objective," and using it as a
"methodology"; and why that is a better practice?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think what I had in mind there was to indi-
cate that the doctrine of original intent is not necessarily helpful
as a way to proceed in evaluating a case; but that really it is one of
the things that we want to know.

  The doctrine of original intent does not tell us how to decide a
case. Intention, though, is one of the objectives of our inquiry.

  If we know what the framers intended in the broad sense that I
have described, then we have a key to the meaning of the docu-
ment.

  I just did not think that original intent was very helpful as a
methodology, as a way of proceeding, because it just restates the
question.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, when the objective of original intent is
not met, do you reevaluate your result and underlying analysis? Or
do you accept the result despite not obtaining the objective?

  Judge KENNEDY. Let me see if I--if you cannot find the original
intent, is that your point?

  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes, when the objective of original intent is
not met.

  Judge KENNEDY, IS not met?
                                         141

  Senator GRASSLEY. Yes.
  Judge KENNEDY. Original intent, broadly conceived as I have de-
scribed it, is extant in far more cases than we give it credit for.

  I think that in very many cases, the ideas, the values, the princi-
ples, the rules set forth by the framers, are a guide to the decision.
And I think they are a guide that is sufficiently sure that the
public and the people accept the decisions of the court as being
valid for that reason.

  If there is not some historical link to the ideas of the framers,
then the constitutional decision, it seems to me, is in some doubt.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, in your role as a judge--and I do not
question your statement that original intent is more often met
than we may realize--but if it is not met, do you then at that point
reevaluate your result and underlying analysis?

  Or do you accept the result, despite not attaining the objective?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I do not wish to resist your line of ques-
tioning, because I think it is very important; it goes to the judicial
method.
  But I think that in almost all cases there is an intent, at least
broadly stated; the question is whether it is narrow enough to
decide the particular case.

  It is, I think, an imperative that a judge who announces a consti-
tutional rule be quite confident, be quite confident, that it has an
adequate basis in our system of constitutional rule; and that means
an adequate basis in the intention of the Constitution.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Over the past few months, it has been sug-
gested that the broad and spacious terms of the Constitution are
best utilized by the courts to relieve the political branches of their
responsibility to determine what some might consider to be the at-
tributes of a just society.

  What is your opinion of the current perception in our society
that only the courts, rather than the political branches of govern-
ment, should address constitutional problems?

  Judge KENNEDY. I resist that idea as a proper constitutional ap-
proach. In my view, it is the duty of the legislative and of the exec-
utive to act in a constitutional manner, and to make a constitution-
al judgment as to the validity of each and every one of their ac-
tions.

  We have a rule in the courts that we presume that a statute is
constitutional. If the legislature says, well, it is simply up to the
courts, the basis for that presumption is not there. If the legisla-
ture does not take the responsibility of making a constitutional de-
termination that its actions are justified, then the presumption of
constitutionality should be destroyed. I do not think that would be
consistent with our political system.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Kennedy, do you believe that one of the
consequences of this deference to the judicial branch that I have
just described is the judicial activism the Supreme Court has prac-
ticed over the last 20 or 30 years, and that a good way to alleviate
this problem would be for the Court to begin practicing a greater
degree of judicial restraint?

   Judge KENNEDY. I think judicial restraint is important in any
era. It is especially important if the political branches for some
                                         142

reason think that they can delegate or have delegated the power to
make constitutional decisions entirely to the courts.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Your answer is yes, then?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Judge, I am sure that you will agree with me,
that there have been many unpopular, and in many cases, even
"bad" laws enacted in the history of our country.
   However, many of these laws, no matter how unpopular, were, or
are, constitutional. What is the court's role when faced with a bad
or unpopular law which is nonetheless constitutional?
  Judge KENNEDY. It is very clear. The court's role is to sustain
and to enforce that law.
  Senator GRASSLEY. IS it your judgment, then, that it is the re-
sponsibility of the political branches of government to deal with an
unpopular law?
  Judge KENNEDY. Absolutely, Senator. The essence of the demo-
cratic process is that the legislature protects citizens against unjust
laws, and acts promptly to repeal them.
  Senator GRASSLEY. DO you think it is within the jurisdiction of
the Court to address these laws, or is this an example of what you
called, in your July 1986 address to the Canadian Institute for Ad-
vanced Legal Studies the "unrestrained exercise of judicial power"?
  Judge KENNEDY. If a law is wrong-headed, or a bad, or an ill-con-
ceived law, but is nevertheless constitutional, the court has no
choice but to enforce it.
  Senator GRASSLEY. What exactly is--using your words--the "un-
restrained exercise of judicial power"?
  Judge KENNEDY. The unrestrained exercise of judicial power is to
declare laws unconstitutional merely because of a disagreement
with their wisdom.
  Senator GRASSLEY. The second limitation of judicial power which
you discussed in your August 1987 speech before the Ninth Circuit
Judicial Conference is the constitutional requirement of "case or
controversy." Correct?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator GRASSLEY. However, you suggested that this requirement
is not as effective as it once was. Why do you think that this is so?
  In other words, how did j'ou come to this conclusion?
  Judge KENNEDY. The underpinning for the doctrine of Marbury
v. Madison is that the court pronounces on the Constitution be-
cause it has no other choice. It is faced with a case, and it must
decide the case one way or the other. It cannot avoid that responsi-
bility, and so the constitutional question is necessarily presented to
it. Chief Justice Marshall says that very clearly. He said we do not
have the responsibility, or the institutional capability, or the con-
stitutional obligation, to pronounce on the Constitution, except as
we must in order to decide a case.
  Now I had long thought that the case or controversy requirement
therefore was an important limit on the court's jurisdiction. The
court would not decide cases or issues that should be properly ad-
dressed by the political branches in the first instance.
  But the case or controversy rules are changing. The Court has
relaxed rules of standing in some of its own decisions. The Con-
gress has done the same. We have class actions. We have remedial
                                         143

relief. Courts have entered the 20th century in order to make their
judgments efficient, which they must do, and their systems effi-
cient, which they must do.

  All of this has meant that what was once a selection process has
now really diminished in its importance and its significance. The
courts are more and more confronted with cases that involve the
great, current public issues of our time.

   Therefore, judicial restraint is all the more an imperative.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Could it in any way be said that part of the
blame for the ineffectiveness of the "case or controversy" require-
ment must lie with Congress and its historic deference towards reg-
ulating the courts?
   In other words, should Congress consider removing federal court
jurisdiction over certain controversies?
   Judge KENNEDY. Well, that is a very delicate question, Senator.
The authority of the Congress to reduce the jurisdiction of the fed-
eral courts in a particular class of cases presents a very difficult,
and, I think, a significant constitutional question.
   It presents a question that goes perhaps to the verge of the con-
gressional power. Before the Congress would enact such a rule, I
would submit that it would have to have the most serious and the
most compelling of reasons, and even after that any such attempt
would present a serious constitutional issue for the Court itself to
decide.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Well, should the Supreme Court try to find
some way to make more effective the "case or controversy" re-
quirement?

   Judge KENNEDY. Case or controversy is requisite in the Constitu-
tion and I agree that the Court should be very, very careful to
insure that that requirement is met in every case, and I think it
should pay very, very close attention to that.

   Senator GRASSLEY. I was asking my question based upon your
statement that in modern times there have been ways of getting
around the "case or controversy" requirement; that it is not as ef-
fective as it once was.

   Is there some answer here? I sense that you seem to feel that
this is an area in which Congress ought not to operate in, or at
least you seem to indicate that it is a very controversial area. I
think you have indicated that there is a problem; is there some
answer to the problem?

   Judge KENNEDY. I may also have misinterpreted your earlier
question. Congress certainly can relax the rules of standing, or
tighten the rules of standing, in order to give more content to the
case or controversy rule without

   Senator GRASSLEY. Well, of course Congress has had some defer-
ence toward regulating the courts to any great extent.

   Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
   Senator GRASSLEY. Would it be unfair to say that another reason
for the failure of the "case or controversy" requirement is the phi-
losophy of judicial activism which the Court has applied over the
last 20 or 30 years? In other words, because the Court has so often
extended its holdings to issues not directly presented in the cases
before it, do you think litigants and attorneys are more inclined to
                                         144

go to court with attenuated, rather than direct, injuries, expecting
relief, nonetheless?

  Judge KENNEDY. I would not quarrel with that characterization.
I might be a little bit hard-put to give you a specific example, but
there seems to be a thrust in favor of the courts reaching out to
decide the issues.

  Senator GRASSLEY. The previous nominee before this committee
to fill this vacancy on the Supreme Court was a strong advocate of
the belief that rationale was more important than results.

  He criticized what he called result-oriented jurisprudence in
which the rationale was made secondary to the actual result
reached.

  He was admittedly taken to task for his position on this matter,
especially before this committee.

  What is your position regarding this so-called result-oriented ju-
risprudence, and when, if ever, is it justified?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think if a judge decides a case because he or
she is committed to a result, it destroys confidence in the legal
system.

  Senators and Representatives are completely free to vote for a
particular bill because it favors labor, or because it favors business.
That is the way politics works, and that is your prerogative. To
identify such an interest, it seems to me, is very candid.

  That is improper for a court. The court must base its decision on
neutral principles applicable to all parties. That is inconsistent, in
my view, with deciding a case because it reaches a particular
result.

  Now we all know that the way we make our judgments in every-
day life is to look quickly at a result and act accordingly if the
result seems instinctively correct.

  I think sometimes judges do that initially when they hear a case.
They say well, this case is just wrong, or this case is just right. But
the point of the judicial method is that after the judge identifies
the result, he or she must go back and make sure that that result
is reachable because the law requires the result, and not otherwise.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I think I liked the first half of your answer.
On the second half, are you in the middle between "results" versus
"rationale"?

  Judge KENNEDY. I insist that a result is irrelevant. I just have to
tell you that many judges have an instinctive feeling for a case,
and sometimes you reason backwards.

  Sometimes you say the case ought to come out this way and you
begin to write it, and to prepare an opinion for your colleagues,
and it just is not working, and then you know that the result is
wrong.

  That is the nature of the judicial method. That is why we write.
We do not write because it is easy to read, or because we think
people enjoy reading it. We write because it is a discipline on our
own process.

  Senator GRASSLEY- Judge, as we become more familiar with you
and as we study those opinions that you have written, I sense that
you are very adept at addressing the narrow question at hand with-
out expanding into unnecessary discussions of the law.
                                         145

  Can you think of any situation where it is appropriate for a Su-
preme Court Justice to depart from the issue at hand, and an-
nounce broad, sweeping constitutional doctrine?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think that the constitutional doctrine that is
announced should be no broader than necessary to decide the case
at hand.

  I do have to tell you this, Senator, and it was touched on earlier.
When the Supreme Court has only 150 cases a year, and it is
charged with the responsibility of supervising the lower courts, it
has to write with a somewhat broader brush, in order to indicate
what its reasons are.

  This does not mean, however, that it is free to go beyond the
facts of the particular case, or that it is free to embellish upon the
constitutional standard.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Judge Kennedy,
thank you.

  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Judge, we do not have time to get
another round in and keep the commitment to get out of here by 6
which I told my colleagues, and we have four Senators who have
yet to ask a first round. I do not know how many will have a
second.
  Judge, would you mind coming in at 9:30 tomorrow instead of 10,
so we can start a little bit earlier?
  Judge KENNEDY. Not at all. I am here at the pleasure of the com-
mittee, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Why don't we start at 9:30. We will
probably start with Senator Specter at 9:30 and Senator Metz-
enbaum at 10, unless Senator Metzenbaum is here, and we would
alternate. But otherwise, I had told him he would probably start at
10, and I do not know whether he will be able to be back by 9:30. I
do not know if he will get the message.
  So if you are prepared to go at 9:30, or at 10:00, if not 9:30, 10
o'clock would be the time we would start.
  Senator SPECTER. That is fine, Mr. Chairman. I very much appre-
ciate that.
  The CHAIRMAN. And Judge, I appreciate your being so forthcom-
ing today and we look forward to another day, and it is my hope
that tomorrow we can finish with your testimony.
  I know several Senators will have a second round of questions,
and we will plan on going from 9:30 until noon, and break for an
hour again, and hopefully go until we finish, and then Wednesday
morning begin the public witnesses with, if all goes well, with the
American Bar Association, Judge Tyler coming before the commit-
tee with the recommendation of the ABA.
  The Senator from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to
say that Judge Kennedy has handled himself in an exemplary
manner, and I feel that we stand a chance that we might be able to
finish his testimony tomorrow.
  The CHAIRMAN. The best measure of how exemplary the manner
is, is every Senator who has spoken so far has indicated they do not
fully agree with you. You have a lot going for you.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Senator.
                                         146

  The CHAIRMAN. Seriously, Judge, I appreciate you being so forth-
coming.

  The hearing will recess until tomorrow at 9:30.
  [Whereupon, at 5:40 p.m., the committee adjourned, subject to
the call of the Chair.]
NOMINATION OF ANTHONY M. KENNEDY TO BE

 ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

                OF THE UNITED STATES

                       TUESDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1987

                                                                       U.S. SENATE,
                                                  COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                               Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:35 a.m., in room SR-
325, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,
chairman of the committee, presiding.
  Also present. Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, Leahy, Heflin,
Thurmond, Hatch, Grassley, Specter, and Humphrey.
  The CHAIRMAN. What I would like to know before we begin, Mr.
Kennedy, is: Did Senator Metzenbaum tell you about the candy
barrel in his office?
  Senator METZENBAUM. The candy is very good.
  The CHAIRMAN. We are delighted to have you back, Judge. In
this town, as you know, there are instant reviews and instant anal-
yses, and I observed last night and this morning what I observed
when you were here: that everyone thinks you did well. I want to
admit I share that opinion.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Notwithstanding the Wall Street Journal's edito-
rials.
  Senator Metzenbaum is next to speak, but he has been gracious
enough to accommodate Senator Specter's schedule. He has a meet-
ing at the White House at 10:30. So what we will do, once
again
  Senator METZENBAUM. If the Chair would yield for a question?
  The CHAIRMAN. I would be delighted to.
  Senator METZENBAUM. The news reports within the last hour
have indicated that one of the former contenders for the Democrat-
ic nomination is about to re-enter the race and has called a press
conference for today at noon. Do you have any plans to call a press
conference for tomorrow at noon?

   The CHAIRMAN. NO, but

  Senator LEAHY. We just want to be able to schedule, Mr. Chair-
man. That is all it is.

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be today at 3. [Laughter.]
  Senator LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, could I ask a serious question?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU mean that is not serious? [Laughter.]

                                                                (147)

                                         148

   Senator LEAHY. NO, I was very serious, but you have already an-
swered 3 o'clock. I will go to the gym during that time. No, actual-
ly, I would be at the press conference, Mr. Chairman.

   Senator Specter is going to go next, then Senator Metzenbaum.
Just so that I can plan, I am perfectly free, whatever you want to
do, would I then be after Senator Metzenbaum on questioning?

  The CHAIRMAN. The answer is yes, you would.
  Senator LEAHY. That would put us back into the sequence.
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, you would. I hope that Senator Humphrey
is listening--I do not mean that facetiously--so we do not get into
a discussion about two Democrats in a row, et cetera. What we will
do, the order will be as follows: The Senator from Pennsylvania,
the Senator from Ohio, the Senator from Vermont, the Senator
from New Hampshire, the Senator from Alabama--no, you already
asked questions, as a matter of fact, yesterday, if I am not mistak-
en--the Senator from Illinois, who will be at the Hart press confer-
ence, and then back to me and to the ranking member.

  With that, are you not really fascinated by all this, Judge?
  Judge KENNEDY. It is more interesting than some of my sessions,
Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will now begin with the Senator from Penn-
sylvania who will question for his first round for half an hour.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank my col-
league, Senator Metzenbaum, for yielding at this time.
  Judge Kennedy, as already indicated, I am going to have to
depart after my round. We have a meeting on the Strategic De-
fense Initiative and the INF treaty. We will be following through
staff and listening on the radio as I drive away.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator. I certainly understand.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Kennedy, I would like to begin with ex-
ploring the legal theories that run through your writings and
through your decisions: original intent, interpretivism, legal real-
ism, result-oriented--all subjects which you have addressed and
matters which have been referred to, to some extent, in yesterday's
session.
  I start with a comment which you made this year at the Ninth
Circuit Conference where you say, "There must be some demon-
strated historical link between the rule being advanced in the
court and the announced declarations and language of the fram-
ers."
  In a speech which you made in 1978 to the judges of the ninth
circuit, you have identified three cases--Brown v. Board of Educa-
tion, Baker v. Carr, Gideon v. Wainwright--where you noted and
reminded the audience that it was not the political branches which
decided those cases. And in the context of Baker v. Can; you re-
ferred to the fact that the court has wrought the revolution of
Baker v. Carr. You had picked out these three cases as being dis-
tinctive matters of judicial interpretation. I would like to begin
with Brown v. Board of Education, the desegregation case.
  In examining the issue of framers' intent, I refer to the treatise
by Raoul Berger, a noted constitutional authority, who set the fac-
tual circumstances at the time the Equal Protection Clause of the
14th amendment was adopted in this context. And at page 118 in
Professor Berger's book, "Government By Judiciary," he points out
                                         149

that Congressman Wilson, the sponsor in the House of the 14th
amendment, stated, "Civil rights do not mean that all citizens shall
sit on juries or that their children shall attend the same schools."
Later at page 123, Professor Berger goes on to point out that at the
time the 14th amendment was adopted, eight Northern States pro-
vided for separate segregated schools; five States outside the Old
Confederacy, either directly or by implication, excluded black chil-
dren entirely from their public schools; and that Congress had per-
mitted segregated schools in the District of Columbia from 1864
onward. Then Professor Berger notes, at page 125, that even the
Senate gallery itself was segregated at that time.

  Now, my question is: Is it ever appropriate for the Supreme
Court of the United States to decide a case at variance with the
framers' intent?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, in answering that question, let me say
that implicit in your introduction was the proposition that it was
not the framers' intent to forbid segregation in schools, and 1 think
Professor Burger has 180 degrees the wrong slant on that point. He
defines intent ii a. vry narrow way. He defines intent to mean
what the framers, as he AU them, actually thought.

  I think that is irrelevant. What is important are the public acts
that accompr nj> d the ratification of, in this case, the 14th amend-
ment. Reme^nber that the framers are not the sole repository from
which we discover the necessary intention and the necessary pur-
pose. In the legislature we do not ask what the staff person
thought when he or she wrote the bill, we ask what the Senators
thought.

  And so with the Constitution. It is what the legislatures thought
they were doing and intended and said when they ratified these
amendments.

  The whole lesson of our constitutional experience has been that a
people can rise above its own injustice, that a people can rise above
the inequities that prevail at a particular time. The framers of the
Constitution originally, in 1789, knew that they did not live in a
perfect society, but they promulgated the Constitution anyway.
They were willing to be bound by its consequences.

  In my view, the 14th amendment was intended to eliminate dis-
crimination in public facilities on the day that it was passed be-
cause that is the necessary meaning of the actions that were taken
and of the announcements that were made. You can read the aboli-
tionist writings that were the precursor to so much of the 14th
amendment. So, that, as Professor Berger states, the framers did
not have it in mind at the time or that they knew they had a segre-
gated school system, is irrelevant.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Kennedy
  Judge KENNEDY. SO with that preface, we then come to the next
part of your question: Can the court ever decide a case contrary to
intent? I just wanted to make it clear that I somewhat disagree
with the thesis that you interjected at the outset because I think
Brown v. Board of Education was right when it was decided, and I
think it would have been right if it had been decided 80 years
before. I think Plessy v. Ferguson was wrong on the day it was de-
cided.
                                      150

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Kennedy, I quite agree with you that
Plessy was wrong and Brown was right, and I am very pleased to
hear you say that people can rise above their own injustices, and
that a society can rise above its own inequities. Those are very
sound principles, and I am pleased to hear you say that.

  But I do not square the statement you made at the Judicial Con-
ference, referring to framers' intent, with the statement you just
made, "What the framers actually thought was irrelevant." You
have made a statement about ratifiers, legislators, and I agree that
when you have a constitutional amendment, you have the framers
who adopt it in Congress and then you have ratification by the
state legislatures. But if you take a look at the states which rati-
fied the 14th amendment, you will find that they were the States
where the factual situations outlined by Professor Berger were in
existence.

  I do not quote Professor Berger for any philosophical approach or
any theory or any conclusion. I quote Raoul Berger for the factual
basis. And I could quote many other sources. He just has it neatly
pigeonholed in terms of putting in one place the fact that segrega-
tion, segregated schools were a fact of life--in the District of Co-
lumbia, in Southern States, in Northern States. Segregation was a
fact in the Senate chamber. The principal sponsor of the 14th
amendment said it was not intended to have integrated schools,
that segregation was the order of the day. And in the statement
you made at the Judicial Conference, you talk about framers; you
do not talk about ratifiers. "There must be some demonstrated his-
torical link between the rule being advanced in the court and the
announced declarations and language of the framers."

  So I do not quite understand your statement today, "What the
framers thought was irrelevant." Could you expand upon that a
bit?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, number one, I not only should expand on
it, I should probably correct it. It is highly relevant what the fram-
ers thought. But the general inquiry, the principal inquiry, should
be on the official purpose, the official intent as disclosed by the
amendment. In looking at legislative history to determine the
meaning of Congress, we sometimes find statements made on the
floor of the Senate or the floor of the House that seem almost at
variance with the purpose of the legislation when viewed overall as
an institutional matter. I am applying that same rule here.

  With reference to framers, I and many others use "framers" in a
rather loose sense. I think obviously we want to know what Madi-
son and Hamilton thought, and the other draftsmen of the Consti-
tution. But theirs is not the entire body of contemporary opinion
and contemporary expression that we look to.

  In my view, for instance, the abolitionist writings are critical to
an understanding of the 14th amendment. It was in response to
their concerns that that amendment was enacted.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Kennedy, when you say that the
principal inquiry should be directed to the official purpose, who is
going to determine the official purpose? In the case of Brown v.
Board in 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States declared
that as a matter of basic justice and equal protection of the law, as
                                         151

we understood that concept, it was patently unfair to have black
children go to segregated schools.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. But if you contrast that with what the intent
was of the framers, ratifiers of the 14th amendment, the cold facts
are that their intent was very different.
  That leads me to a conclusion that the real judicial philosophy
comes through when you say that people can rise above their own
injustices, rise above their inequities, but really look to an intent of
justice and an official meaning of equal protection as it is viewed in
1954, as opposed to the way it is viewed in 1868, when the 14th
amendment is ratified; and there are segregated schools and a seg-
regated Senate gallery. And the operative intent of the Congress-
man who passed the amendment and the legislators who ratified it
were to be satisfied and really expect segregation.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I am not saying that the official purpose,
the announced intention, the fundamental theory of the amend-
ment as adopted will in all cases be the sole determinant. But I
think I am indicating that it has far more force and far more valid-
ity and far more breadth than simply what someone thought they
were doing at the time. I just do not think that the 14th amend-
ment was designed to freeze into society all of the inequities that
then existed. I simply cannot believe it.
   Senator SPECTER. Well, I agree with that. But to come to that
conclusion, you have to disregard what is a pretty obvious infer-
ence of intent of the framers or ratifiers because they lived in a
segregated society.
  Judge KENNEDY. That is true, and I think maybe many Senators
felt at the time they passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that they
lived in a society that did not comply in all respects with what the
statute required them to do. They were willing to make a state-
ment that society should be changed. The Constitution is the pre-
eminent example of our people making such a statement.
   Senator SPECTER. But the legislature's role is clearly established
under our principles of government. The contest comes up as to
whether the court has any business handing down a decision like
Brown v. Board if the court is supposed to look only to framers'
intent. And I think the court did have business doing that. But if
you contrast that with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, everyone would
say, well, that is up to the Congress; that is up to the elected offi-
cials; contrasted with the judges who have life tenure who should
not make political decisions. And if you have a shifting meaning of
equal protection--and I think you do, and I think that is the real-
ism--then it seems to me that that is realistically an abandonment
of a rigid nexus to the intent of the framers and ratifiers in 1868.
   Judge KENNEDY. Well, I do not want to put us in a deeper
trench, because I think there is an element of agreement between
us. But I must insist that the intention of the 14th amendment is
much more broad than you seem to state in the predicate for all of
your questions.
   Senator SPECTER. Well, where do you find the intention in the
Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment more broadly
stated than the fact of segregation, which was, in practice, obvious-
ly in the minds of the framers and ratifiers?
                                          152

   Judge KENNEDY. It was very clear to me that the purpose of the
14th amendment was to effect racial equality in public facilities in
this country.

   Senator SPECTER. But what did that mean?
  Judge KENNEDY. It was very clear from the abolitionist writings;
it was very clear from some of the statements on the floor; and it is
abundantly clear from the text of the language, which admits of no
exception, in my view. I think the framers were willing to be bound
by the consequences of their words. And their words are sweeping,
and their words are very important and they have great power.
  Senator SPECTER. Are you saying that there is something in the
legislative history of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th
amendment which specifies that schools should be desegregated?
  Judge KENNEDY. NO. Those who addressed the amendment speci-
fied their purpose in much broader, much more general terms. I
think that they were willing to be bound by the consequences of
what they did and the consequences of what they wrote. And I
think Plessy v. Ferguson was wrong the day it was decided on that
basis.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I agree with you about that, and I agree
with you about Brown v. Board being correctly decided. But I do
not
  Judge KENNEDY. But that cannot be because society changed be-
tween 1878 and 1896.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I was not around in 1896 when Plessy was
decided, and neither were you. So our perspectives are very differ-
ent. But the perspectives of the framers, I think, were clearly es-
tablished by the facts of life.
  I do not see how you can take a broad principle and say that
there was framers' intent or ratifiers' intent to have equal protec-
tion, which is specified in desegregation, when the schools were all
segregated and the Senate gallery was segregated and the principal
sponsor, Congressman Wilson, said it was not their intent to have
desegregated schools.
  It seems to me that the conclusion is conclusive that it is just
Judge Kennedy and Arlen Specter viewing it in a different era
with different eyes, and the inequities appear differently. As you
say, people can rise above their own injustices and above their in-
equities. And it is a different interpretation, and it does not really
turn on what the framers necessarily had in mind.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I agreed with you until your last state-
ment, because I think what the framers had in mind was to rise
above their own injustices. It would serve no purpose to have a
Constitution which simply enacted the status quo.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, let me move on to another category,
the
  Judge KENNEDY. And, incidentally, we should note for the record
that Mr. Justice Harlan was there in 1896, and he dissented in
Plessy. Plessy was not a unanimous decision. The first Mr. Justice
Harlan.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, he was correct, but it was a decisive mi-
nority view, unfortunately. Only one out of nine saw it, contrasted
with Brown v. Board where all nine saw it. In our society, it is
hard to understand how anybody ever saw it differently or why it
                                         153

took the political branches--the Congress or the executive
branch--so long to catch up. That is the point you make in your
speech, pointing to the courts and not to the political branches.

  That underscores what I consider to be a very basic point that at
times, notwithstanding the valid principle of judicial restraint, and
notwithstanding the fact that it is up to the Congress and the polit-
ical branches to establish public policy, public policy of change,
that the inequities can be so blatant that the court must step in, as
it did in Brown v. Board, and say that equal protection simply
mandates desegregation, which is, of course, what happened.

   Judge KENNEDY. Well, you know, it sometimes takes humans
generations to become aware of the moral consequences, or the im-
moral consequences, of their own conduct. That does not mean that
moral principles have not remained the same.

   Senator SPECTER. Well, I believe that these are very important
considerations on judicial philosophy, Judge Kennedy, because
judges everywhere are applying them--not only in the Supreme
Court, but in courts of appeals and in District courts and in State
courts. And people are listening to what Judge Kennedy has to say
about these subjects, perhaps even to what some of the Senators
have to say about the subjects.

  There is a real battle on interpretivism and legal realism, and to
look for some conclusive nexus between framers' intent and the de-
cision in a specific case is very, very difficult, and in my own view
in Brown was impossible. But we have explored it at some length. I
would like to move on, if I may now

  Judge KENNEDY. Certainly, Senator.
   Senator SPECTER [continuing]. To the subject of neutral princi-
ples. Here, again, we are on a subject which has been very exten-
sively applied. And judges are always looking to neutral principles,
and the hard thing is to make a decision about what a neutral
principle is.

  You say, or said, in a speech to the Sacramento chapter of the
Rotary Club just a few months ago, October 15th of this year, that
"Closely related to the inquiry over the legitimacy of constitutional
interpretation is the dangers that courts might be thought of as ex-
ercising policy review and not applying neutral judicial principles."
And you pick up on that same theme in your response to the Judi-
ciary Committee's questionnaire, when you say that "Judges must
strive to discover and define neutral juridical categories."

   In a speech you gave to the Stanford law faculty on May 17,
1984, you refer to Dean Ely, and you say, "He might make the ar-
gument that we prove his point that interpretivism is more hollow
than real, because obviously the framers could not and did not fore-
see a sprawling administrative state."

  And my question to you, Judge Kennedy, is: Considering, as you
have said in this speech, that there are some circumstances which
the framers could not have contemplated, obviously--such as the
sprawling administrative state--just how far can you go on the
principle of interpretivism as a fixed and resolute ideology for ap-
plication by the courts?

  Judge KENNEDY. All right. You are talking about quite a few
things here.
                                         154

   Let me say at the outset that it is somewhat difficult for me to
offer myself as someone with a complete cosmology of the Constitu-
tion. I do not have an over-arching theory, a unitary theory of in-
terpretation. I am searching, as I think many judges are, for the
correct balance in constitutional interpretation. So many of the
things we are discussing here are, for me, in the nature of explora-
tion and not the enunciation of some fixed or immutable ideas.

  Once again, we must be very careful to note that when we speak
of intent we speak on many different levels. The fact that the
framers never thought of an ICC is not entirely relevant. The ques-
tion is whether or not an administrative agency can and does fit
within the principles that the framers announced for separation of
powers.

  Now, the position of administrative agencies in a system in
which the Constitution mandates the separation of powers--legisla-
tive, executive, and judicial--has not been clearly established in
the case law. Much work needs to be done there. It seems to me
that the Government of the United States could have hardly sur-
vived without those agencies, and that may itself be a strong argu-
ment for the fact that they are legitimate, given what the framers
promulgated. But that whole area of the law, as Professor Bator, I
think, has described it, is a very unruly one. And I think, the
courts have not really come to grips with how to explain the posi-
tion of an administrative agency, that is, whether or not it is an
appropriate exercise of article I power.

  Did I answer the question?
  Senator SPECTER. Yes, I think you did early on. I am pleased to
hear you say that you have no cosmology of constitutional theory,
no over-arching principles, and I think that is a very important
basic concept. When you take up the ideologies of original intent or
you take up the ideologies of interpretivism and neutral principles,
there is a tendency, as I see it, for the Supreme Court, for the fed-
eral courts or any courts to become musclebound and unduly re-
strictive.
  There are many cases that we could take up. I wanted to discuss
with you at some length Baker v. Carr, where you have noted in
your own writings that there is no established philosophy. And you
characterized Baker v. Carr, one-man, one-vote, as the wroughting
of a revolution. In some of our hearings, we have become entangled
in very rigid ideological philosophies of the court. And I repeat, I
am pleased to hear you say that you are looking for a balance as
opposed to immutable philosophies, to give you the answer in every
case, even though you may not be able to find original intent or
even though you may not be able to find a neutral principle of in-
terpretivism.
  I have got about 4 minutes left, Judge Kennedy, or 3. The time
really flies.
  I want to come to a central issue about the administration of jus-
tice and due injustice, and I intend to return to this in another
round. I have made reference in my opening to a very provocative
comment, very interesting comment, very constructive comment
which you made in your speech to the Canadian Institute in 1986
where you say, "A helpful distinction is whether we are talking
about essential rights in a just system or essential rights in our
                                         155

constitutional system. Let me propose that the two are not coexten-
sive."

  Now yesterday, when Chairman Biden was asking you questions,
you adopted the principles of the second Justice Harlan, and if I
had time I would go through Cardozo and Palco and fundamental
values and Frankfurter. We may have time later to come to that.
But when we talk about doing justice and we talk about people
rising above their own inequities and above their own injustice,
why should it not be that the essential rights in our constitutional
system should not be coextensive with the essential rights in a just
system? Or stated differently, should not essential constitutional
rights be implemented to see to it that essential rights in a just
system are recognized, that the two are coextensive?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I think the American people would be
very surprised if a judge announced that the Constitution enabled
a judge to issue any decree necessary to achieve a just society. The
Constitution simply is not written that way. And I think it is an
exercise in fair disclosure to the American people, and to the politi-
cal representatives of the Government, to make it very clear that
the duty to provide a just society is not one that can be undertaken
solely by the judiciary.

  I indicated yesterday there is no truly just or truly effective con-
stitutional system in the very broad sense of that term--constitu-
tional with a small "c"--if there is hunger, if there are inadequate
educational opportunities, if there is poor housing. It is not clear to
me that the Constitution addresses those matters.

  Senator SPECTER. My time is up. I will return later. Thank you
very much, Judge Kennedy.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator Metzenbaum.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, we will turn to Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Kennedy, in the Aranda v. Van
Sickle case, you joined a decision which held that the constitutional
voting rights of Mexican-Americans were not violated by the elec-
tion system of the city of San Fernando, California. That was a
case where Mexican-Americans claimed that they had been denied
their voting rights by the city, and that they had been denied equal
access to the political process.

  Some Hispanic groups, it is only fair to say, find that decision
very troubling. They say that you ignored a lot of evidence which
showed that the political process was not equally open to participa-
tion by Mexican-Americans, and that Mexican-Americans had less
opportunities than other residents to participate in the political
process and elect legislators of their choice.

  For example, the evidence showed that up until 1972, two-thirds
of the polling places had been located in the homes of whites, and
"that the private homes which were used were invariably not
Spanish-surnamed households, and they were not located in an
area of the city where Mexican-Americans lived."

  In your opinion, you said, "There is no substantial evidence in
the record indicating that location of polling places has made it
systematically more difficult for the Mexican-Americans to vote,
causing Mexican-Americans who otherwise would have voted to
forego voting."
                                         156

   I guess in this connection I might quote a Supreme Court Justice,
when referring to obscenity, who said. "I know it when I see it."
And I sort of feel the same thing about this kind of situation. Is it
not sort of common sense, or does it not sort of speak for itself, that
when you locate polling places in white homes and in a Mexican-
American area that you are going to bring about the results--I
think the results were that only 28 percent of the Mexican-Ameri-
cans were voting, although they made up about 48 percent of the
population.

  I just was wondering how you came to the conclusion you did in
that case.

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I am pleased to talk with you about that
case, Senator. I found it a very troubling case and still do.

  You began by saying that in that case I found that the constitu-
tional rights of the Hispanic community to vote were not violated.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Would you mind pulling the mike a little
bit around? Thank you.

  Judge KENNEDY. YOU began by saying that in that case I found
the constitutional right to vote of Hispanics in the community were
not violated. That was precisely what I was concerned about. It was
precisely what I did not find. It is precisely why I wrote a separate
opinion.

  In this case, the plaintiffs, who were residents of the city of San
Fernando in Southern California, brought a challenge to the at-
large system of voting, and they asked for the remedy of a federal
court decree to require district voting--the purpose being so that
Hispanics could have representation in the city government. Al-
though I forget the facts of the case, I will assume that there were
neighborhoods which were largely Hispanic. I think that is prob-
ably implicit in the facts of the case. So they would have achieved
that had that remedy been granted.

  The lower court found the evidence insufficient to state a cause
of action and granted summary judgment. My two colleagues on
the court agreed. I felt that there was something wrong in that
case. So I undertook to write a separate opinion to express my con-
cerns.

  I went through the evidence and brought out the fact that voting
booths were located in non-Hispanic neighborhoods, that there had
been no representation on city commissions and boards, et cetera. I
indicated that these facts might very well support an action for
relief in the federal courts.

  In that case, however--and you are never sure why lawyers and
litigants frame the cases the way they do--the insistence by the
plaintiffs was that they wanted only the one remedy of a district
election scheme rather than an at-large election scheme. That is
the only remedy they sought.

  This is one of the most powerful, one of the most sweeping, one
of the most far-reaching kinds of remedies that the federal court
can impose on a local system. And in our view, or in my view as
expressed in the concurrence, that remedy far exceeded the specific
wrongs that had been alleged. I concluded that the remedy sought
did not match the violation established. But I made it very clear--
and that was the point of my opinion in what I still consider trou-
                                         157

bling and a very close case--I had a serious concern that individual
rights violations had been established in the record.

  What was the outcome of that case, whether a subsequent suit
was brought based on my concurring opinion, I do not know. My
concurring opinion is a textbook for an amended complaint, or a
textbook for a new action. I tried to indicate my concerns and my
sensitivities in that case rather than simply joining in the majority
opinion, which I thought did not adequately address some very real
violations.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Did you make it clear, in your opinion,
that if the remedy sought had been a different one, that based
upon the same facts, and I think the facts also were that all of the
election process was in English and it made it that much more dif-
ficult for people to vote, but had the remedy sought been a differ-
ent one, that you very well might have arrived at a different con-
clusion?

   Or is that your comment here today?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I thought that that was implicit if not ex-
plicit in my opinion. I was writing a concurring opinion. I did not
have the second vote, so I could not order--I could not frame the
judgment in the case.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Just on this point, why did you not let it
go to the jury? You affirmed a summary judgment.

  Judge KENNEDY. Or to the finder of fact.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Or to the finder of fact. Since 3'ou were
troubled by it, and there were the egregious circumstances of poll-
ing booths being in white homes, that decision is made by the local
ordinance, by the local election officials, if you were troubled by it,
why not then let it go to the next stage and let a finding of fact b^
permitted?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, remember, number one, I just don't have
the judgment. But so far as my own separate concurring opinion,
why didn't I recommend that, I guess would be your question.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Yes. And you might at the same time
answer this: why could you not have indicated in your decision
what the proper remedy should be? Even though the plaintiffs
sought a certain kind of remedy, couldn't you have come to the
conclusion in your opinion that another kind of remedy was appro-
priate? Perhaps the court is not required to deny all relief merely
because the petitioner comes in asking for one kind of remedy.
Shouldn't the court be able to come up with another remedy in this
case?

   Judge KENNEDY. That is a fair question, and I am not sure I have
an adequate answer in my own memory--now.

   As I recall the case, we explored the case with counsel extensive-
ly at oral argument. And counsel said, "This is a case in which all
we are seeking is an abolition of at-large elections. That is all this
case is about." And that was my concern.

   Why clients and attorneys present cases in this way is beyond
me. It was very clear to me, based on my understanding of the
record, that any Hispanic resident could bring an action to change
the places of the polling booths and to rectify the other injustices
that were there in the system.
                                      158
  Now, under the--well, I'm not an expert in the amendments to
the Voting Rights Act of 1980, I haven't had cases on those. At this
time, we were operating under the assumption that the remedy
had to fit the wrong, and that was the argument that I had with
the attorneys in the case.
  But I wanted to make it very clear in the concurring opinion
that I was concerned with the treatment that the court was giving
to these litigants, and I wanted to put on the record that I thought
there was some evidence of discrimination.
  And I guess, Senator Kennedy, the answer to your question of
why didn't it go to the finder of fact, is because the attorneys in-
sisted that this was all the suit was about, at-large versus district
elections.
  I just did not see that as a plausible remedy, as a permissible
remedy, given the violations they had established.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I don't think we need to debate it further.
But suffice it to say, if I were a Mexican-American, I think there
would be a keen sense of disappointment that you did not take that
extra step so that the summary judgment would not have preclud-
ed a different kind of remedy.
  And as you have already said, maybe you could have or should
have indicated something to that effect.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it brings up the troubling point that I
have not resolved, Senator: To what extent can courts try lawsuits
for the litigants. In this case, as I recall, these were extremely ex-
perienced, capable attorneys.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge, I want to make a distinction on
that point.
  Judge KENNEDY. And for me to say, well, now, you have done
this the wrong way, you go back, when they insisted they did not
want to do that, it seems to me is perhaps overstepping.
  Senator METZENBAUM. YOU are saying that the court cannot try
the case for the litigants' attorney.
  But I do not think it was a matter of trying the case in a differ-
ent manner. I think it was a matter of providing a different solu-
tion, a different conclusion, than the summary judgment.
  The evidentiary material was already in the record. It was suffi-
cient. There were Mexican-Americans, 48 percent; 28 percent only
voting. Voting booths were in the white homes. All of the election
process was in English.
  So the facts were there. And so I do not think it is a matter of
saying that the court had to tell the lawyers how to try the case
differently. I think what you're really saying is whether the court
should come up with a different kind of result or different kind of
remedy than that which is being sought by the litigants.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, but it is not clear to me that the court
should, if the litigants insist that this is all they are asking for.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, I understand your point.
  Judge KENNEDY. And the whole point of the decision was that I
did not want Hispanics to think that I did not think there were
some serious problems down there in San Fernando.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Let me go on to another issue.
  Let us look at your 1985 opinion in AFSCME v. State of Wash-
ington where you reversed a lower court finding that the State had
                                         159

violated the civil rights law by paying women substantially less
than men for comparable work.

  Until the early 1970s, the State of Washington ran segregated
male-only and female-only help wanted ads. In 1974, following a
comprehensive job pay study, the State concluded that women
overall were paid about 20 percent less than men in jobs of compa-
rable value, and in certain jobs, were paid as much as 135 percent
less.

  These differences were not related to education or skills. They
were related only to sex. After the State study, then Governor, now
Senator, Evans, conceded there was an inequity, and said the State
had an obligation to remove it.

  Despite its knowledge of the inequity, the State did not correct it.
The district court held that the State's knowing, quote, "deliberate
perpetuation," end of quote, of a discriminatory pay system, com-
bined with the State's admission of the discrimination, and its past
segregated job ads, supported a finding of unlawful discrimination
under title VII of the civil rights law.

  Now, in reaching that conclusion, the court was guided by the
Supreme Court's 1981 Gunther decision, which said that Congress
wanted title VII's prohibition of discriminatory job practices to be,
quote, "broadly inclusive, to strike at the entire spectrum of dispar-
ate treatment of men and women resulting from their sex stereo-
types," end of quote.

  The district court's findings obviously raise very serious ques-
tions as to the state's discriminatory practices toward women.

  I have difficult in understanding your complete rejection of the
court's conclusion on these facts. And I wonder if you would care to
address yourself to it because it is a decision that frankly has many
in this country very worried.

  Judge KENNEDY. I would be glad to address it, Senator.
  We must at the outset distinguish between equal pay and compa-
rable pay. The Congress of the United States has a statute which
says that women and men in the same positions are to be given the
same pay.
  That is not what this case was about. That law is clear; that
policy is clear; that obligation is clear; and the courts enforce that.
  That is not what this case was. What this case was about was a
theory that women should be paid the same as men for different
jobs.
  The theory of the case was that the State of Washington was
under an obligation to adopt this differential pay scale or a com-
pensatory pay scale, because it had notice of the fact that there
were pay disparities based on long classifications and stereotypes of
women in particular jobs.
   I understand that. You do not have to be married to a school
teacher for very long to figure out that the reasons educators are
not paid enough in this country is because for hundreds of years
the education system has been borne on the backs of women.
   They have borne the brunt of it. And I think you can make a
pretty clear inference that the reason for those low pay scales is
because women have dominated that profession. I think that is
very unfortunate.
                                         160

   On the other hand, it is something of a leap to say that every
school district in the country is in violation of title VII because it
does not adopt a system whereby you find comparable worth and
lower the salaries of drivers of equipment which, say, are male
dominated jobs--let's assume they are--and raise the salaries of
women.

  That may be a commendable result but, number one, we did not
see in title VII that Congress had mandated that result, or in the
Equal Pay Act. We looked very carefully at the legislative history.

  Second, we did not see, in the evidence presented to us, that the
State of Washington had intentionally discriminated by continuing
to use the market system in effect.

  The State of Washington was subject to a judgment for $800 mil-
lion, which I take it is a large amount of money, perhaps even in
Washington, DC, on the theory that their failing to depart from the
market system and from market forces was an actionable violation.

  Now, the Governor recognized--I forget if it was the Governor or
the legislature or both--that in their view, the State as an affirma-
tive matter should undertake this correction.

  We did not think, however, that there was a shred of evidence to
show that the State had deliberately maintained that pay scale dif-
ference in order to discriminate against women.

  It is true that the State had in the past advertised for some job
categories as male only. And the State had corrected that.

  Once again, I guess we are talking about the difference between
the wrong and the remedy.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I am not sure we are in this case, because
the Supreme Court in the Gunther case laid down the rule that
title VII's ban on discriminatory job practices should be liberally
interpreted and strictly enforced.

  Now, what concerns me is whether you applied title VII too nar-
rowly. You seem to hold that to prove discriminatory treatment, it
would be necessary to show that the employer harbored a--this is
your word--"discriminatory animus," end of quote, or a discrimina-
tory motive.

  But the district court had already found that the State of Wash-
ington knew for several years that it was perpetuating a discrimi-
natory pay system.

  Didn't you go too far in immunizing an employer from title VII
liability? Should not an employer who has knowingly and deliber-
ately perpetuated a discriminatory wage system be legally liable
for engaging in unlawful employment discrimination?

  Judge KENNEDY. We held not. We held that under that formu-
la--it appeared to me, it appears to me, that under that formula,
every employer in the United States is charged with an intentional
discrimination because it follows the market system even though it
did not create that market system.

  Senator METZENBAUM. But it seems to me the case is very simi-
lar to Gunther. Gunther went beyond equal pay for equal work.
Gunther said that a case could be brought where the court was not
required to make subjective assessments of job worth.

  The State did its own study in this case, and therefore there was
no requirement in the AFSCME case that the court make a subject
judgment.
                                         161

  There was the finding by the State. The State had done the
work. The facts were there. Gunther had recognized that it ap-
peared to be enough. The appellate court, with you writing the
opinion, reversed that and undermined the rights of the women es-
tablished in the Gunther case.

  And frankly, it is a kind of a case that causes great concern, and
my guess is, we will hear some testimony, some witnesses, on the
subject. Women are saying they are concerned about whether you
went too far to reverse the lower court in this case, and went
beyond the requirements of the Supreme Court as enunciated in
Gunther.

  Judge KENNEDY. I am absolutely committed to enforcing congres-
sional policy to eliminate barriers that discriminate against
women, particularly in employment or in the market place or in
any other area where it is presented to me.

  We do not have a free society when those barriers exist. We do
not have a free society if women cannot command pay that is cal-
culated without reference to the fact that they are of a particular
sex.

  But it is simply not clear to me at all that the State of Washing-
ton, because it undertakes a survey and discovers what is intuitive
for many people, that some job classifications are dominated by
women and that they are paid less, can be held to be a violator for
not correcting that.

  I think the State should be commended for undertaking the
study. If the holding were that any employer who undertakes a
study of comparable worth is liable for failing to correct the inequi-
ty--I simply don't think that the Congress has let the courts go
that far.

  If the Congress wants to enact that, I will enforce it. If the Con-
gress has not enacted it, I cannot as a judge invent it.

  Senator METZENBAUM. But the lower court found the law and the
evidence adequate. Gunther seemed to say that much evidence was
sufficient.

  And what is of concern to this Senator, as well as to many
women, is that you then saw fit to reverse.

  But let us not belabor that point.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it is an important case, Senator, and I do
not mind talking about it. A couple of final points. First, my under-
standing is that every other court in the country that has looked at
the issue has reached the same result. Second, we indicated that in
a case where you can establish that the wage scales were set be-
cause women were dominant in the pay group, there could be an
actionable violation, of course.

  We made that very clear. We did not find it on this evidence.
  Senator HATCH. Howard, would you yield to me for a comment
on my time? It will take less than a minute.
  Senator METZENBAUM. If the Chair permits it.
  The CHAIRMAN. If there is no objection from anyone else.
  Senator HATCH. I just want to point out that in the Gunther case
the court specifically noted that it was not deciding the case on the
basis of comparable worth. It was simply ruling on a discriminato-
ry method of evaluation.
                                         162

   In this case, you didn't have the same set of circumstance. And
one last thing, this was a three judge decision, right?

   Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
   Senator HATCH. HOW was it decided?
  Judge KENNEDY. It was unanimous.
   Senator HATCH. Okay. That is all.
   Senator METZENBAUM. And you wrote the opinion?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator METZENBAUM. And I am not going to get into a debate
with my colleague on it, because I want to go further.
  I want to ask you about a labor law case called Kaiser Engineers.
As you know, that case involved the question whether employees
who petition their Congresspersons on a matter of public policy
that affects their job security are engaging in protected activity
under the National Labor Relations Act.

  The ninth circuit held that it was unlawful to discharge employ-
ees who wrote to their Congressman regarding a proposed change
in immigration policy that they felt threatened their jobs.

  You wrote a dissent from the ninth circuit majority opinion. Two
years later, the Supreme Court in the Estek case squarely rejected
your position.

  Justice Powell, writing for seven members of the court, conclud-
ed that employees are protected when they seek to improve terms
or conditions of employment through channels outside the immedi-
ate employer-employee relationship.

  The court specifically mentioned appeals to legislators, and cited
the Kaiser majority decision with approval.

  In light of the Supreme Court's decision in Estek, have you re-
evaluated your position? And do you feel that perhaps the conclu-
sion you reached in the Kaiser was wrong?

  Judge KENNEDY. I am fully satisfied with the decision of the Su-
preme Court. I should note that in Kaiser the implication of the
employees was that the employer was supporting their policy posi-
tion. And the employer's decision to discharge was based on a
theory that the engineers had misrepresented the employer's posi-
tion.

  But as for the rule that the Supreme Court has announced, I
have absolutely no trouble with. And I think it is a good rule.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I must tell you, Judge, that I am troubled
by the pattern of your opinions in the area of labor law.

  In addition to the Estek case, there are two instances in which
the Supreme Court granted review of ninth circuit decisions involv-
ing labor law questions.

  In both cases, you wrote, or joined the opinion. In both decisions
involving labor law questions.

  In both cases, you argued for a restrictive interpretation of em-
ployee or union bargaining rights.

  In both cases, the court rejected your position by a vote of 9 to 0.
  I refer here to the 1982 case called Woelke v. Romero, and the
1986 case called Financial Institution Employees of America.
  But the Supreme Court cases really only tell part of the story. In
your 12 years on the bench, you have participated in more than 50
decisions reviewing orders issued by the NLRB.
                                         163

  It is my understanding that although you have voted to reverse
board rulings against the employer approximately a third of the
time, you have never voted to overrule the NLRB when it has
ruled in favor of the employer.

  It seems to me that your judicial writings reflect a disturbing
lack of concern for the bargaining rights of employees. I hope that
I am wrong.

  Can you suggest some other interpretation of this record? Or can
you tell us where or when in your opinions or other writings you
have evidenced a commitment to employee rights in the collective
bargaining context?

  Judge KENNEDY. It is very clear to me that the unions of this
country are entitled to full and generous enforcement of the na-
tional labor relations laws that protect their activities.

  The box score here I am not quite familiar with. It is a funda-
mental matter of national policy that workers are protected in
their right to organize, and in their right to collective bargaining.

  And in my view, I have fully and faithfully interpreted the law
in that regard. I have great admiration for working people. I
worked through all kinds of jobs when I was working my way
through school.

  Since I was 14 or 15 years old I had jobs with manual laborers. I
learned that they had a great deal of wisdom and a great deal of
compassion, and that their rights should be protected by bargain-
ing agents.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Just in conclusion, I do not think the
question really is, are some of your decisions right or wrong, but I
think the issue is whether your consistent support for the employer
position on important, unresolved matters of statutory interpreta-
tion is indicative of a predisposition in the area of labor law.

  I do not know. If you are confirmed maybe my questions today
will cause you to reflect a bit on this very issue.

  Thank you, Judge.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. AS preordered, we will now go to the Senator
from Vermont, and then the Senator from New Hampshire.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Judge Kennedy, wel-
come back.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, sir.
  Senator LEAHY. TO you and your family. I always like to get a
chance to get my family to sit still this long to listen to me, and I
say that only semi-facetiously, because they have had to sit
through and listen to too many speeches during campaigns and ev-
erything, and do it dutifully.
  But I think this is such an extraordinary circumstance, as it
should be in your life, that I hope it has been something of interest
to your family. Certainly we have never seen anybody sit here
more attentively than they have.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you very much, sir.
   Senator LEAHY. Judge, I mentioned to you when we met private-
ly that I was impressed with your comments at the White House in
which you said that not only did you look forward with eagerness
to these hearings, but, and I am paraphrasing now, that they very
definitely were not only an integral part of our constitutional
                                         164

makeup, but a very important one, and one that should be done
thoroughly and completely.

  Do you still feel that way, I hope?
  Judge KENNEDY. Certainly, Senator, I do.
   Senator LEAHY. I want to ask you questions in three different
areas, primarily. One is in the privacy area; one is in the criminal
law area--I spent about a third of my adult life as a prosecutor, so
I have an interest there, and you have written a number of cases
there; and then lastly in the first amendment area

  Normally, in these things, I take first amendment first, but a
number of your comments to me privately, a number of decisions
you have made in the past, give me a lot more comfort in those
areas than a number of other nominees have.

  To begin in the area of privacy, I wonder if I might just follow up
on a couple of questions. Senator Biden asked you a number of
questions in this area yesterday. In response to one, you said that
you think, "most Americans, most lawyers, most judges, believe
that liberty includes protection of a value we call privacy."

  You did not state your own view at that point. But slightly later
you said that you had no fixed view on the right of privacy. Sena-
tor DeConcini followed up on that. And in response to a question
from him, you said that you had no doubt about the existence of a
right to privacy, although you prefer to think of it as a value of
privacy.

  Is this a semantic difference? Or is there a difference between
right and value? And if there is a difference, what is your view?

  Judge KENNEDY. I pointed out at one time in yesterday's hear-
ings that I am not sure whether it is a semantic quibble or not. I
think that the concept of liberty in the due process clause is quite
expansive, quite sufficient, to protect the values of privacy that
Americans legitimately think are part of their constitutional herit-
age. It seems to me that sometimes by using some word that is not
in the Constitution, we almost create more uncertainties than we
solve. It is very clear that privacy is a most helpful noun, in that it
seems to sum up rather quickly values that we hold very deeply.

  Senator LEAHY. But you understand
  The CHAIRMAN. Will the Senator yield on that point?
  Senator LEAHY. Certainly.
  The CHAIRMAN. And this may save some time, because I had a
whole round of questions on this.
  Let me put it to you very bluntly. Do you think Griswold was
reasoned properly?
  Judge KENNEDY. I really think I would like to draw the line and
not talk about the Griswold case so far as its reasoning or its
result.
  I would say that if you were going to propose a statute or a hypo-
thetical that infringed upon the core values of privacy that the
Constitution protects, you would be hard put to find a stronger case
than Griswold.
  The CHAIRMAN. That doesn't answer the question. Is there a
marital right to privacy protected by the Constitution?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes--pardon, is there a
  The CHAIRMAN. Marital right to privacy.
                                         165

  Judge KENNEDY. Marital right to privacy; that is what I thought
you said. Yes, sir.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, if I might follow on that, have you had any
cases so far when you have been in the Court of Appeals where you
have had to follow the Griswold case?
  Judge KENNEDY. The Beller v. Middendorf case was one where
we examined it and discussed it extensively. The case we discussed
yesterday.
  And I'm tempted to say that is the only one.
  Senator LEAHY. But in that, what reference did you make to
Griswold?
  Judge KENNEDY. We tried, I tried, in the Beller case, to under-
stand what the Supreme Court's doctrine was in the area of sub-
stantive due process protection, and came to the conclusion, as
stated in the opinion, that the Supreme Court has recognized that
there is a substantive component to the due process clause.
  I was willing to assume that for the purposes of that opinion. I
think that is right. I think there is a substantive component to the
due process clause.
  Senator LEAHY. And that is your view today?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. When you first
  Judge KENNEDY. And I think the value of privacy is a very im-
portant part of that substantive component.
  Senator LEAHY. The reason we spend so much time on this is
that it is probably the area where we hear as much controversy
and as much debate in the country about Supreme Court decisions
as any single issue. Certainly I do in my own State, and I am sure
others do. It is a matter that newspaper debates will go on, editori-
al debates will go on.

  And in a court that often seems tightly divided, everybody is
going to be looking at you. None of us are asking you to prejudge
cases. But I think also, though, if we are going to respond to our
own responsibility to the Senate, we have to have a fairly clear
view of what your views are before we vote to confirm you.

  I should also just add--something that obviously goes without
saying--we expect you to speak honestly and truthfully to your
views, and nobody doubts but that you will. Some commentators
and some Senators seem to make the mistake of thinking that a
view expressed by a nominee here at these confirmation hearings
must, by its expression, become engraved in stone, and that a
nominee can never change that view. You do not have that view,
do you?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I would be very careful about saying that
a judge should make representations to the committee that he im-
mediately renounces when he goes on the court.

  Senator LEAHY. That is not my point, Judge Kennedy. What I am
saying is that I would assume that your own views on issues have
evolved over the years.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. What I am suggesting is that even as to views
expressed here, should you go on the Supreme Court, there is noth-
                                          166

ing to stop an evolution of your views in either direction, or in any
direction?

   Judge KENNEDY. I think you would expect that evolution to take
place. And with reference to the right of privacy, we are very much
in a stage of evolution and debate.

   I think that the public and the legislature have every right to
contribute to that debate. The Constitution is made for that kind of
debate.

   The Constitution is not weak because we do not know the answer
to a difficult problem. It is strong because we can find that answer.

   Now it takes time to find it, and the judicial method is slow.
   Senator LEAHY. It is also an evolutionary method, is it not?
  Judge KENNEDY. It is the gradual process of inclusion and exclu-
sion, as Mr. Justice Cardozo called it. And it may well be that we
are still in a very rudimentary state of the law so far as the right
of privacy is concerned.
   If you had a nominee 20 years ago for the Supreme Court of the
United States, and you asked him or her what does the first
amendment law say with reference to a State suit based on defa-
mation against a newspaper, not the most gifted prophet could
have predicted the course and the shape and the content of the law
today.
  And we may well be there with reference to some of these other
issues that we are discussing.
  Senator LEAHY. I would hope that all Members of the Senate will
listen to that answer. I think that the fallacy that has come up, in
some of the debate on Supreme Court nominees--one that has
probably been heard across the political spectrum--is that we can
somehow take a snapshot during these hearings that will deter-
mine for all time how Judge Anthony Kennedy or Judge Anybody
is going to then vote on the Supreme Court on every issue. And
that just cannot be done, and in fact, should not be done. That is
not the purpose of these hearings.
  You said back in June of 1975, at the time you were sworn in to
the Court of Appeals, that you were not yet committed in this
debate on the reach of the federal Constitution. I think what we
would like to explore, though, is what has happened in that 12
years. You have written in numerous cases, participated in hun-
dreds of cases. And so you have been part of that constitutional
debate, and your thinking has evolved. And let me just go into a
couple of areas of that.
   In the Stanford University speech that everybody has talked
about here, you said that it is important to distinguish between es-
sential rights in a just system, and essential rights in our own con-
stitutional system. And as I understand your speech, the rights in
the first category--rights that some may consider essential to a
just system but not essential rights in our own constitutional
system--are not enforceable by our courts. Is that correct?
   Judge KENNEDY. That is correct. I was quite willing to posit that
the framers did not give courts authority to create a just society.
   Senator LEAHY. NOW those rights that are essential to a just
system are those things like providing adequate housing, nutrition,
education, those kind of rights?
   Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
                                         167

  Senator LEAHY. And that requires affirmative government
action?

  Judge KENNEDY. Mostly affirmative government action, although
the Supreme Court in a case, Plyler v. Doe, held that the State of
Texas could not altogether deprive illegal aliens of education.

  Senator LEAHY. SO there are essentials?
  Judge KENNEDY. SO even here there is an area for the courts to
participate in.
  Senator LEAHY. SO there are some essential rights in our own
constitutional system, to use your words, that are not explicitly
spelled out in the Constitution, but are enforceable by our federal
courts?
  Judge KENNEDY. The equal protection jurisprudence makes that
rather clear.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, earlier this year in the Ninth Circuit Judi-
cial Conference speech, you said that each branch of government--
and I assume you include the courts in that--is bound by an un-
written constitution that consists of our ethical culture, our shared
beliefs, our common vision.
  Are there rights included in this unwritten constitution?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I would think so, yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Such as?
  Judge KENNEDY. My point about the unwritten constitution, I
suppose, has been to try to explain how that term was used by
early political philosophers.
  Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, all talked about the constitution. And
what they meant was, the whole fabric of a society.
  As you know, there are something like 160 written constitutions
in the world today. Very few of them work like ours does. And yet
their terms in some cases are just as eloquent, and perhaps even
more eloquent.
  Their terms are somewhat more far-reaching in the grant of the
positive entitlements that we have talked about, the right to ade-
quate housing, food, shelter.
  But they do not work. The reason ours works is because the
American people do have a shared vision. And I think important in
that shared vision is the idea that each man and woman has the
freedom and the capacity to develop to his or her own potential.
  That is somewhat different than the Constitution states it, but I
think all Americans believe that. And I think that has a strong
and a very significant pull on the legislature and on the courts.
  Senator LEAHY. At the same time, an unwritten constitution--
you say that it instructs government to exercise restraints. What
does the court do when another branch of government ignores that
counsel and takes some unrestrained action? Say the action of an-
other branch does not violate a specific constitutional prohibition,
can the courts strike that down because it violates this unwritten
constitution that restrains all branches?
  Judge KENNEDY. NO. But, again, this is the consensus that our
society has that makes it work. One of the great landmark
   Senator LEAHY. HOW do you square them if you have got these
essential rights out there one way--that is, at the same time you
have got the essential rights pushing here, but you have some un-
restrained action pushing there. Do they square?
                                         168

   Judge KENNEDY. Well, I hope they square.
   Senator LEAHY. Can the courts make them square?
  Judge KENNEDY. Absent an abiding respect by the people for the
judgments of the court, the judgments of the court will not work.
And the Constitution does not work if any one branch of the Gov-
ernment insists on the exercise of its powers to the extreme.
   One of the great landmarks in constitutional history was when
President Truman complied within the hour with the Supreme
Court's order to turn back the steel mills. President Nixon did the
same thing with the tapes. That is what makes the Constitution
work.
  The Constitution fails when a governor stands in front of the
courthouse with troops to prevent the integration of the schools
subject to a Supreme Court order. The Constitution does not work
very well when that happens.
  Senator LEAHY. Let me just go back a bit, if I might. Judge. In a
democracy, any branch of our Government exists only if there is
respect for that branch, only if it can be heeded. If we did not re-
spect the constitutional mandate for a President to leave office at
the end of his term and the new President to come in, where would
we be?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. I think it is a very powerful statement to the
rest of the world when we see a President who may have been de-
feated in an election riding with the incoming President up for the
oath of office. It is a very powerful statement if we have a Presi-
dent die in office and another President comes in immediately with
total continuity.
  But I think you were suggesting more of what happens with the
courts. In the last generation, have we pushed that parameter
where faith or confidence or respect for the courts may have been
damaged?
  Judge KENNEDY. I do not think so. I think courts have the obliga-
tion always to remind themselves of their own fallibility in this
regard. They have the obligation to announce their judgments in
neutral, logical, accepted terms that are consistent with the judi-
cial method. And the courts have, of course, the obligation to re-
spect the legislative branch.
  Your example of the President leaving office is probably a better
example than any one that I have thought of on this mystic idea of
this unwritten constitution. I think it is an important example; it
is a good one.
  Senator LEAHY. But we have courts stepping into areas of great
controversy. Without going into specific cases, we do it in areas of
busing, of abortion, of civil rights, voting rights. Some of these
things are very explosive, and we have had instances where Feder-
al troops have had to be brought out, Federal marshals, local
police, State police, to enforce the ruling of a court. But yet if the
court is right, you are not suggesting that they should then refrain
from issuing that kind of a ruling, even if it may well require
strong and controversial executive action to carry out the ruling?
  Judge KENNEDY. NO. The courts, except in perhaps rare in-
stances, have never shrunk from their duty to interpret the Consti-
tution and they never should. But as you indicate, one of the really
                                         169

great ironies of our system is that a branch of the Government
that is not supposed to be political in nature has historically re-
solved disputes of great political consequences. One of the great
issues for the first 30 years in this country was whether or not Con-
gress had the right to establish a national bank. And the Supreme
Court stepped right into the middle of that--and fairly early in the
controversy--and it has not been successful in extricating itself
since.

  But the point is that a court must recognize that its function is
not a political function; it is a judicial one. We manipulate differ-
ent symbols. We apply different standards.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge, let me ask you about another right that
was not mentioned in your Stanford speech--the right of the press
and the public to attend criminal trials. In the case of Richmond
Newspapers v. Virginia, the Supreme Court recognized this right,
though the court acknowledged that "The Constitution nowhere
spells out a guarantee for the right of the public to attend trials".

  You have had occasion to enforce what apparently is an unenu-
merated right to attend trials. I believe that in one of the DeLor-
ean trials, you did. Do you think the Supreme Court made a right
or wrong turn when it recognized the right of public access in the
first place, in the Richmond Newspapers decision?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, rather than comment specifically on the
opinion, I would say that right of access generally is an important
part of the first amendment and is properly enforced by the courts.

  Should I wait?
  Senator LEAHY. NO. Just a bomb going off. Senator Heflin does
sort of a bomb alert, but we never clear the room for little things
like that.
  Judge KENNEDY. In the DeLorean case, incidentally, the question
was whether or not newspapers could inspect sentencing docu-
ments.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU say that from the first amendment, but that
is an expansive reading of the first amendment, is it not?
  Judge KENNEDY. I am not so sure that it is that expansive.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU would not consider that expansive? You
would not consider it an expansive reading of the first amendment,
the right of the public to be
  Judge KENNEDY. That the press is allowed to be at trial?
  Senator LEAHY. Press to be at a trial.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I think perhaps we could characterize it
as an expansive reading.
  Senator LEAHY. But a justifiable one? I am not trying to put
words in your mouth. I am really not trying to put words in your
mouth.
  Judge KENNEDY. I think a very powerful case can be made for
the legitimacy of that decision.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  What about the right to teach a foreign language to one's chil-
dren? In the Stanford speech, you point out that such a right might
be found from an expansive reading of the first amendment. The
Supreme Court did not find the right there but recognized the right
anyway in the case of Meyer v. Nebraska.
                                          170

   Judge KENNEDY. Yes. Meyer v. Nebraska has a whole catalogue of
rights that the Supreme Court thought were fundamental, some of
them quite expansive--the right to pursue happiness. The first
amendment, it seems to me, has tremendous substantive force and
can easily justify the result in Meyer and Pierce.

   Senator LEAHY. But that was not what the Supreme Court found.
   Judge KENNEDY. NO. The Supreme Court at that time, I think,
was essentially unaware of the expansive nature of its first amend-
ment decisions. Those cases were 1916. Well, the laws were passed
in 1916, and then it took a few more years to get up to the court.

   Senator LEAHY. But were they wrong in their decision? I mean,
did they have the right result, the wrong reasoning?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, my point was that the statements in the
opinion, the broad statements of the opinion, I was not sure could
support a whole body of jurisprudence.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, that whole list of rights: should they recog-
nize and enforce each of the rights they listed out in Meyer?

  Judge KENNEDY. Did they
  Senator LEAHY. NO. Should they recognize and enforce each of
the rights in Meyer? You have got the right to marry, to establish a
home, bring up children, worship.

  Judge KENNEDY. Again, I think that most Americans think that
they have those rights, and I hope that they do. Whether or not
they are fully enforceable by the courts in those specific terms is a
matter that remains open.

  Senator LEAHY. SO are those rights--you find a right of privacy--
but as to the rights in Meyer, I did not quite follow your last
answer. That threw me a bit. Would you repeat that, please?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it is not clear to me that each and every
one of the rights set forth in Meyer can sustain a complaint for
relief in a federal court. I would be very puzzled if I received a
complaint that alleged that the plaintiff was denied his right to
happiness.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, in fact, that is sort of like what you said in
the Stanford speech. Let me just take one quote out of there. You
say, "It seems intuitive to say that our people accept the views set
forth in Meyer, but that alone is not a conclusive reason for saying
the court may hold that each and every right they have mentioned
is a substantive, judicially enforceable right under the Constitu-
tion".

  What do you look for beyond just the feeling that our people
accept these rights to make them such fundamental rights that
they are judicially enforceable?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, there is a whole list of things, and one
problem with the list is that it may not sound exhaustive enough.
But, essentially, we look to the concepts of individuality and liberty
and dignity that those who drafted the Constitution understood.
We see what the hurt and the injury is to the particular claimant
who is asserting the right. We see whether or not the right has
been accepted as part of the rights of a free people in the historical
interpretation of our own Constitution and the intentions of the
framers.
                                         171

  Those are the kinds of things you look at, but it is hardly an ex-
haustive list. You, of course, must balance that against the rights
asserted by the State, of which there are many.

  Senator LEAHY. What if some of those rights that you see felt by
our people, strongly felt, conflict with your own personal views?
What then?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think that the judge, in assessing what the so-
ciety expects of the law, must give that great weight rather than
his or her own personal views.

  Senator LEAHY. Where do you look, what do you look to to find
out, you know, what these rights are--and I realize we are talking
in a very gray area: Probably to some who might be listening this
may seem like an academic discussion that is wonderful for a class-
room. And somebody suggested yesterday your students will be
watching to see how you answer this. I have to think that these are
the same kinds of questions that have gone through judges' minds
to a greater or lesser degree when we have made some of the major
moves in our Constitution--some of the cases we now refer to as
milestones and others would refer to as abrupt and unforgivable
changes, depending upon which side you are on.

  But what do you look to when you try to determine what those
rights are that are so solid in our people, those senses of right?
How do you find them?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I wish I could give a good, clear answer to
the question. I think in that same speech I said in frustration,
"Come out, come out, wherever you are", looking for the sources
and the definitions of unenumerated rights.

  You look in large part to the history of our own law. This is what
stare decisis is all about. You look to see how the great Justices
that have sat on the Court for years have understood and inter-
preted the Constitution, and from that you get a sense of what the
Constitution really means.

  An English representative in the House of Commons once said
that "History is Philosophy teaching by example"; and I think that
the law can be described the same way.

  Senator LEAHY. Judge, you are 51 years old. If you are confirmed,
you are going to serve on the Supreme Court well into the next
century. Anybody just looking back at the history of the Supreme
Court in the last 20, 25 years knows that it has had to go--it has
been faced with very difficult questions--and it has had to move
the Constitution forward--or backward, depending, again, how
people look at it--but certainly move it, change it from what
people thought of as being a settled Constitution at that time. And
you have to know that you are going to be faced with that same
position, once, twice, maybe many times if you are on the Supreme
Court. Does that cause you any apprehension, or do you look for-
ward to that? Have you thought about that?

  Judge KENNEDY. It causes me some apprehension, some awe. No
jurist, no lawyer, no nominee could aspire to be on the Court that
was occupied by Holmes and Brandeis and Cardozo and the two
Harlans and Black, not to mention the great Marshall, without
some of those feelings.

   On the other hand, the very fact that those judges were there
and that they wrote what they did gives the Constitution and the
                                         172

judicial system great strength and great power. It enables the
judge to continue to explore for the meaning of the Constitution.
That is what I wish to do.

  If you had a visitor coming to this country, and he asked: What
is it that makes America unique? What is the gift that we have for
civilization? What is it that America has done for history? I think
most people would say America is committed to the Constitution
and to the rule of law. And I have that same commitment.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Judge.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would ask unanimous consent that
written questions from Senator Simon be submitted on his behalf.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection.
  [Senator Simon's questions appear on p. 739.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Humphrey, who has waited patiently.
The Senator from New Hampshire.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Good morning, Judge Kennedy. I have been
patiently waiting, anxiously waiting. I so much enjoy these hear-
ings. This is really what I had in mind when I offered myself as a
candidate for the U.S. Senate, this sort of thing. This is what I en-
visioned, not the passing out of money to the gimme groups, which
is our daily fare around here.

  These are very interesting hearings. I have found them fascinat-
ing. Frankly, I would not mind if we had another three or four
after your confirmation, may I say. I would not mind if we had an-
other three or four in the next year. I find these to be so fascinat-
ing. That might have a good effect on the court, may I say. I
happen to believe that it would.

  Fascinating though they are, the hearings do become a little op-
pressive at times, so I want to begin with a joke which comes at the
expense of lawyers. If you have heard this, pretend you have not.

  A woman called a law firm and asked for Mr. Smith, who was--I
guess it was a man. I beg your pardon. A man called a law firm
and asked for one of the senior partners whose name was Mr.
Smith. The receptionist said, "Oh, I am very sorry. I guess you
have not heard the news. Mr. Smith passed away three months
ago."

  And the caller said, "I want to talk with Mr. Smith." The recep-
tionist said, "You do not understand. He is dead. He is deceased."

  And the caller said, "I want to talk with Mr. Smith." "Sir, he is
dead. Don't you understand?"

  And the caller said, "Yes, I understand, but I cannot hear it
often enough." [Laughter.]

  Well, while it is true that we make jokes about lawyers, certainly
the profession of the law is very important, and the role of the Su-
preme Court, the Judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, is
critically important. The Supreme Court is the Super Bowl of the
law profession, and you are auditioning, in a way, for a place on
the team.

  The CHAIRMAN. We will have order in the room. Thank you. I
know the joke was funny but * * * [Laughter.]

  Senator HUMPHREY. NOW, to get down to serious matters, you
write your own speeches; is that correct?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, Senator; for better or worse.
                                         173

  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, they are very good. The ones I have
read are very, very good. Inasmuch as you write them yourself,
that gives us some insight into your thinking. I find your logic to
be very clear.

  The Stanford speech is one that has been examined a number of
times. That is an important speech. It is a very good speech, would
you not say so?

  Judge KENNEDY. I enjoyed it. I want to make clear that I never
speak from notes.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes.
  Judge KENNEDY. I gave the Senate what notes I had. I think that
speech came out about that way.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes.
  Judge KENNEDY. One of the dangers is you sometimes forget the
principal part of the speech until after you have given it.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, we all understand that. I think it is a
very good speech. I want to examine a few parts of that and then
parts of some other speeches, if I have time.
  Let me quote from your Stanford speech.
  "One can assume that any certain or fundamental rights should
exist in any just society. It does not follow that each of those essen-
tial rights is one that we, as judges, can enforce under the written
Constitution."
  "The due process clause is not a guarantee of every right that
should inhere in an ideal system."
  Is that a correct quote?
  Judge KENNEDY. That is a correct quote, and I think it is a cor-
rect concept.
  Senator HUMPHREY. YOU have not changed your mind since
1986?
  Judge KENNEDY. NO, sir.
  Senator HUMPHREY. "The due process clause is not a guarantee
of every right that should inhere in an ideal system." So it is not a
blank check?
  Judge KENNEDY. Certainly not.
  Senator HUMPHREY. HOW about the ninth amendment?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, as I indicated yesterday, the meaning of
the ninth amendment, and even its purpose, is shrouded in doubt,
and the Court has not, in my view, found it necessary to refer to
that amendment in order to stake out the protections for liberty
and for human rights that it has done so far in its history.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Never used the ninth amendment to ground
an opinion
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. There may be some quarrel with that
statement because of an isolated reference by Mr. Justice Douglas
in the Griswold case, and by the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice
Goldberg in the same case.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, if judges--in your opinion--if judges
cannot enforce each of the essential rights which should exist in a
just society, what should the Court do to move us toward a more
ideal system when the political branches fail to act?
  Judge KENNEDY. I suppose the Court can cry in protest if it sees
an injustice in a particular case. The law is an ethical profession,
and the law is designed to seek justice.
                                          174

   And if courts see an injustice being done, I think the oath of our
profession requires us to bring that to the attention of the Con-
gress. On the other hand, judges who are appointed for life cannot
use the judiciary as a platform for their own particular views. So
there is a duality there.

   Senator HUMPHREY. What do you mean by "judges bringing that
to the attention of the Congress"?

   Judge KENNEDY. Well, from time to time, in our opinions we tell
the Congress, please look at this statute and see the way we are
enforcing it. Do you really want us to do this? I think that is quite
a legitimate function of the Court.

   I have said that in some of the RICO cases. Some of my other
colleagues have, too. It is just not at all clear to us that the way we
are enforcing RICO is what Congress really had in mind, but we
are following where the words lead us.

   Senator HUMPHREY. I want to go back to the ninth amendment.
  Yesterday, you said it seems to me the Court is treating it as
something of a reserve clause to be held in the event that the
phrase liberty, and the other spacious phrases in the Constitution
appear to be inadequate for the Court's decision.

  You say, it seems to me the Court is treating, has been treating
it as a reserve clause.

  Is that your view, that it ought to be treated as a reserve clause,
to be held in the event that the spacious phrases are inadequate to
the matter at hand?

  Judge KENNEDY. My characterization was what I thought the
philosophy of the Court was to date, and I think it is important
that the Court not confront such an ultimate and difficult issue
unless it has to.

  A case grounded solely on the ninth amendment requires the
judge to search in the very deep recesses of the law, where I am
not sure there are any answers.

   Senator HUMPHREY. Well, if I have time, I want to come back to
the ninth amendment and discuss the historical context, the intent
of the authors and the framers, which seems to have been ignored
in some of the discourse in this hearing so far.

  May I ask the Chairman his intent with regard to a second
round.

  The CHAIRMAN. We will stay as long as the Senators have ques-
tions.

   Senator HUMPHREY. Good. Quoting again from your Stanford
speech, Judge, you said: "The unrestrained exercise of judicial au-
thority ought to be recognized for what it is--the raw exercise of
political power."

   "If in fact that is the basis of our decisions, then there is no prin-
cipled justification for our insulation from the political process."

   Why did you feel constrained to raise the subject of unrestrained
exercise of judicial authority in that speech?

   Judge KENNEDY. I think there is a concern in society that the
courts sometimes reach results simply because the courts think in
their own view that those results are right, and I think it is ex-
tremely important for judges to remember that they are not politi-
cal officers in black robes.
                                         175

  On the other hand, I think it is also important for the public to
know the limitations of our own powers. Perhaps the public is,
from time to time, disappointed with the cases that we write.

  Perhaps the public thinks that we should reach out to rectify an
injustice, to amend a complaint, to change a lawyer's theory of the
case, and the constraints of the judicial process simply do not
always allow that.

   Senator HUMPHREY. YOU speak of the public concern, but your
audience was judges. It was not a public speech, was it? Was it
judges, or lawyers?

  Judge KENNEDY. These were judges from Canada who have a
new constitution.

   Senator HUMPHREY. Yes.
  Judge KENNEDY. They had been under a parliamentary system
where the legislative authority is supreme, as have the English
judges for many, many years, and they were curious to know what
the extent of their authority was.
  And I think it fair to say most of them were looking forward to
exercising it, and therefore, I was sounding a note of caution.
   Senator HUMPHREY. Well, you say the public is concerned that
judges have sometimes overreached. Is Anthony Kennedy con-
cerned that judges have sometimes overreached?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think it is always a legitimate concern, and
that we must remind ourselves, constantly, of the limitations on
our authority.
   Senator HUMPHREY. But I mean the question in more than the
abstract sense. Is it your view that at times in our history, the Su-
preme Court has overreached, has exercised, rawly exercised politi-
cal power?
  Judge KENNEDY. There are a few cases where it is very safe to
say that they did, the Dred Scott case being the paradigmatic ex-
ample of judicial excess.
   Senator HUMPHREY. SO it is more than an abstract matter. How
about in modern times? Is it your view? This is a modern speech, a
contemporary speech. You felt constrained to make a rather strong
statement about abuse of the judicial prerogatives.
   I have got to think that it is almost a cri de coeur. Is it?
  Judge KENNEDY. I did not really have a list of cases in mind. I
had more in mind an approach, an attitude that I sometimes see
reflected on the bench.
   Senator HUMPHREY. An approach and an attitude?
  Judge KENNEDY. That I sometimes see reflected on the bench in
my own court.
   Senator HUMPHREY. SO irrespective of ultimate decisions, you are
concerned at least about an approach and an attitude in certain in-
stances, in contemporary times?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, and this can affect the decisional course of
the court.
  The CHAIRMAN. If I understand the answer to the question the
Senator asked, is that there are no specific cases which you had in
mind when you referred to the unrestricted exercise
  Judge KENNEDY. That is correct. None come immediately to
mind. But that concern always underlies the examination by a
                                         176

judge of his own writings, or her own writings, and of the writings
of their colleagues.

  It is something you must constantly be aware of as you are
trying to evaluate the pulls and tugs, and the impulses and the
constraints that come to bear on the decisional process.

  Senator HUMPHREY This approach and attitude which caused
you to make the statement cautioning against unrestrained exer-
cise of judicial authority, as raw exercise of political power--this
concern about the approach and the attitude that you have seen in
contemporary times, in some cases--is that something that bothers
you, professionally?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I do not think the judiciary of the United
States, as a whole, has departed from its mandate or its authority,
but I simply think it is a concern that must always remain in the
open, so that judges are aware of the limitations on their authority.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Moving from general concerns over your
viewTs on judicial restraint to the privacy issue, in your Stanford
speech you noted that Bowers v. Hardwick upheld the Georgia law
which proscribes sodomy, yet you noted the decision did not over-
rule Griswold, the case which announced the right of privacy.

  And then you asked, "Are the decisions then in conflict over the
substantive content of the privacy right?"

  My first question is, when you speak of decisions, are you speak-
ing of Bowers vis-a-vis Griswold, or are you speaking of Bowers vis-
a-vis Dudgeon, which the Court, in your opinion

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. There is a case called Dudgeon, decided by
the European Court of Human Rights, under the Convention of
Human Rights, and it reached a result that was absolutely con-
trary to Bowers v. Hardwick, and as I indicated in the speech, the
Supreme Court had enough to wrestle with with its own precedents
without trying to incorporate the European court. But I thought
that it was an interesting exercise to compare the European court
case with the Bowers case.

  Senator HUMPHREY. I am still not perfectly clear
  Judge KENNEDY. And the answer is the comparison was between
the Dudgeon case and the Bowers case.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well nonetheless, do you see any conflict be-
tween Bowers and Griswold?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, the methodology of the cases, it seems to
me, are nol easy to square, although that is nothing to be particu-
larly upset about. The law accommodates a certain amount of con-
tradiction and duality while it is in a state of growth. Absent a per-
fect society, justice and symmetry are not synonymous.
  Senator HUMPHREY. YOU say there should be a certain amount
of--how did you phrase it a moment ago?--a certain amount of am-
biguity?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think I said duality and tension. I do not
know.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, that seems to contradict what you said
yesterday, when you said that judges are not to make laws, they
are to enforce the laws. This is particularly true with reference to
the Constitution. That judges must be bound by some neutral, de-
finable, measurable standard in their interpretation of the Consti-
tution.
                                                    177

  Are you not contradicting yourself?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, between the idea and the reality falls the
shadow. We attempt, of course, to have symmetry. We attempt, of
course, to have cases that are all on fours with each other.
  To the extent they are not, that indicates that the court has fur-
ther work to do.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I think in the meantime, it strikes me that
in the meantime, while the Court is doing its further work, some
citizens are suffering injustices.
  I suppose we cannot hope for perfection in the courts, but I
would certainly hope for objectivity, to the greatest possible extent.
  Judge KENNEDY. I would agree with that, Senator. I think that is
perhaps the correct resolution--objectivity.
  Senator HUMPHREY. The problem with judges is that they are
human beings, and that is why the theory does not quite work out.
  Judge KENNEDY. Madison said if men were angels we would not
need a Constitution.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, I want to discuss your Beller opinion,
not that I want to take up the subject of homosexuality, or discuss
the merits, or the demerits, or the immorality of homosexuality,
but I want to discuss your Beller opinion because there is certain
language in there that worries this Senator.
  You said that, quote: "We recognize, as we must, that there is
substantial academic comment which argues that the choice to
engage in homosexual activity is a personal decision that is enti-
tled, at least in some instances, to recognition as a fundamental
right and to full protection as an aspect of the individual's right to
privacy."
  Why did you feel in writing that, that you must recognize sub-
stantial academic comment? My goodness, you can find academic
comment to justify almost anything. There is just as much, and far
more weighty opinion in centuries of law, and thought, and writ-
ing, which you did not bother to mention in your opinion.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I had read extensively in preparing for
this opinion, in order to understand the right approach, and I usu-
ally think it is fair to the parties to set forth the things that I have
read.
  This was the first case involving a challenge to the discharge of
homosexuals from the military, and I spent a great deal of time on
it, and I thought it important for the reader, and for the litigants
to know that I had considered their point of view.
  Senator HUMPHREY. DO you find something commanding about
academic opinion versus societal mores, when they differ?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it is interesting that the legal profession
is the only profession that is intimidated by its initiates. We have
law review articles written by students who are not even lawyers
and they get paid a great deal of attention, I guess that is one
thing that keeps the law vigorous and vital.
  But I am not overly persuaded by academic comment. I frankly
do not have time to read very much of it.
   Senator HUMPHREY. YOU referred, likewise, in your Stanford
speech to the responsibility of the political branches, quote, "to de-
termine the attributes of a just society." How much weight, as a
judge, or as a Justice, will you give to the political--the responsibil-
                                         178

ity, indeed, the prerogatives of the political branches to determine
the attributes of a just society?

   Judge KENNEDY. I think it is the prerogative and the responsibil-
ity of the political branch to take the leadership there. As I have
indicated yesterday, I think the political branch has the obligation
to assess each of its actions under the standard of constitutionality,
and I think when the Court confronts an act by a legislature, it
must know, it must recognize that the legislators understood the
Constitution, that they acted deliberately with reference to it, and
the legislature is entitled to a high degree of deference.

  This is not just the political system at work. It is the constitu-
tional system at work.

  Senator HUMPHREY, Let us turn to criminal law. In your speech
to the Sixth South Pacific Judicial Conference this year, you said,
"Equally disturbing is that Goetz"--referring to the case in New
York of the subway shooting--"Equally disturbing is that Goetz
emerged from the subway incident as a hero in the eyes of a large
portion of the citizenry: the victim who finally fought back. If the
rule of law means that citizens must forego private violence in
return for the State's promise of protection, then the public ac-
claim with which Goetz's actions were received in some quarters
indicates that the present criminal justice system breeds disrespect
for the rule of law."

  If that is so, must the judiciary share in the responsibility for a
criminal system which breeds disrespect for the rule of law?

  Judge KENNEDY. Absolutely. The judiciary system is responsible
for the immediate supervision and the immediate implementation
of the criminal system. The judiciary has itself made many of the
rules that are binding upon the police, and it is the obligation of
the judiciary to constantly reassess those rules as to their efficacy
and as to their reasonableness.

  In this connection, we were talking about violent crime. We were
talking about victims who feel helpless in the wake of crime, and
courts must be very, very conscious of their front-line position here.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, did you mean to say in your speech to
the conference that the present criminal justice system breeds dis-
respect for the rule of law? Is that what you were saying?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think that it can in some quarters. Everybody
can point the finger to each other, but I think the courts bear a
large responsibility. I know in some States, some States represent-
ed by the members of this committee, there simply are not enough
funds for courts, for law enforcement officials, for correctional fa-
cilities. And it is a tremendous problem.

  What we do is take care of society's failures. We have very little
to do with preventative measures other than the deterrent value
that quick and efficient enforcement of the criminal system brings.

  Senator HUMPHREY. The courts must share some responsibility in
this present system which breeds, to some extent, disrespect.

  Judge KENNEDY. Of course.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Including the Supreme Court?
  Judge KENNEDY. I would include the Supreme Court, of course.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Quoting further from the same speech, "The
significant criminal law decisions of the Warren Court focused on
the relation of the accused to the State and the police as an instru-
                                      179
ment of the State. Little or no thought was given to the position of
the victims."

  Why did you choose to criticize the Warren Court in this?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it was that court, of course, which imple-
mented the great changes that we have had in the criminal proce-
dure system, changes which are now really a part of that system. I
was pointing out the fact that really there has been a lack of
awareness by all parts of the Government of the position of the
victim.
  I had indicated yesterday that victim was a word that I never
even heard in law school, and, frankly, I do not think I heard of it
until the last 6 or 7 years until the Congress of the United States
and commentators brought it to our attention when you passed the
Victims Assistance Act.
  Senator HUMPHREY. HOW much time do I have left?
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have about 2 minutes, but why don't you
take more time at this break. We have had you sitting a long time,
Judge. What we are going to do is we will break for the luncheon
recess when Senator Humphrey finishes, which will end the first
round.
  But before we leave, I would ask the audience please do not get
up. We have a little business to conduct here, so if you are going to
leave, leave now and not at the end so we cannot hear what we are
about to do. It will take 3 minutes after the Senator from New
Hampshire finishes. At that time, we will break. And if you need
another 5 minutes or so, you go ahead, Senator.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. IS that all right with you, Judge?
  Judge KENNEDY. Certainly.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I have a speaking engagement off the Hill at
12, so I cannot take too much time. I am sure you will be glad to
hear that, Mr. Chairman.
  I want to go back to the ninth amendment, Judge Kennedy. If I
understood some of the questions correctly, some Senators seem to
be trying to get you to say that there are some privacy rights
hiding there in the ninth amendment waiting to come out, come
out, wherever you are. That seems to me to be a very generous
reading of the intent of the authors and ratifiers of the ninth
amendment. Wouldn't you agree?
  Would you give us your understanding of the historical intent of
the ninth amendment?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, as I have indicated, the intent is really
much in doubt. My view was that Madison wrote it for two reasons.
Well, they are really related. He knew, as did the other framers,
that they were engaged on an enterprise where they occupied the
stage of world history; not just the stage of legal history, but the
stage of world history. These were famous, famous men even by the
standards of a day unaccustomed to celebrities. And he was very,
very careful to recognize his own fallibilities and his own limita-
tions.
  So he first of all wanted to make it clear that the first eight
amendments were not an exhaustive catalogue of all human rights.
Second, he wanted to make it clear that State ratifying conven-
tions, in drafting their own constitutions, could go much further

     90-878 0 - 8 9 - 7
                                      180

than he did. And the ninth amendment was in that sense a recog-
nition of State sovereignty and a recognition of State independence
and a recognition of the role of the States in defining human
rights. That is why it is something of an irony to say that the ninth
amendment can actually be used by a federal court to tell the State
that it cannot do something. But the incorporation doctrine may
lead to that conclusion, and that is the tension.

  Senator HUMPHREY. May lead to that conclusion.
  Judge KENNEDY. May. May lead to that conclusion.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, let me ask you this, finally. I do hope
we will have an opportunity to think about matters further and
ask further questions of you. Let me just ask you this, finally, with
regard to privacy rights.
  What standards are there available to a judge, a Justice in this
case, to determine which private consensual activities are protected
by the Constitution and which are not?
  Judge KENNEDY. There are the whole catalogue of considerations
that I have indicated, and any short list or even any attempt at an
exhaustive list, I suppose, would take on the attributes of an argu-
ment for one side or the other.
  A very abbreviated list of the considerations are the essentials of
the right to human dignity, the injury to the person, the harm to
the person, the anguish to the person, the inability of the person to
manifest his or her own personality, the inability of a person to
obtain his or her own self-fulfillment, the inability of a person to
reach his or her own potential.
  On the other hand, the rights of the State are very strong
indeed. There is the deference that the Court owes to the democrat-
ic process, the deference that the Court owes to the legislative proc-
ess, the respect that must be given to the role of the legislature,
which itself is an interpreter of the Constitution, and the respect
that must be given to the legislature because it knows the values of
the people.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Those, especially the first category, sound
like very subjective judgments.
  Judge KENNEDY. The task of the judge is to try to find objective
referents for each of those categories.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
Judge.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Let me ask my colleagues who are here, so we can plan the rest
of the day and give Judge Kennedy some notion of how long we
will be asking him to stick around today. Can my colleagues who
are here indicate those who would think they would want a full
second round of 30 minutes apiece? Senator Humphrey, Senator
Specter, Senator Hatch?
  Senator HATCH. I only have a few questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Thurmond, are you going to take 30
more minutes?
  Senator THURMOND. NO, I will not. I may take 5 minutes.
  Senator LEAHY. I might be able to do it in less, but I think there
is a good possibility of 30 minutes, Joe.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. I am told that Senator Heflin has a
second round and Senator Metzenbaum and Senator Grassley. So
                                      181

we are up to at least 5 hours if that is the case. I would hope my
colleagues might not find it necessary to take the full time.

  It would be my intention, Judge, if we can, to have your testimo-
ny end today. I know that would disappoint you not to be able to
come back tomorrow. But if you will bear with me, with the Chair,
we will try, by accommodating 15-minute breaks every couple
hours, to finish up today. I would hope we could finish relatively
early, but maybe as some of the questions are asked in the second
round others will find it unnecessary to pursue, if their line of in-
quiry is the same, their full 30 minutes.

  What I would like to suggest is that, since we kept you so long,
we not start another round this morning, and that we recess until,
say, a quarter after 1. Well, let us make it 1:30. It will give you an
hour and 45 minutes to get some lunch and be back here.

  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will start at 1:30 with a second round of
questions, and we will see where that takes us.
  The hearing is recessed until 1:30.
  [Whereupon, r< 11*48 a.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 1:30 p.m., the same day.]

                                   AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Judge, the reason for the absence of my colleagues, both the
Democratic and Republican Caucuses are meeting until 2 o'clock,
but we will begin.
  Judge KENNEDY. All right, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. In an effort to see if we can finish today.
  And I will repeat this when some additional members are here,
but although I will not limit anyone on the panel to anything less
than 30 minutes, I would like to encourage them to be 20 minutes;
and so at 20 minutes I am going to have that little red light go
off--go on, I should say, and then we have 10 minutes after. Maybe
that might encourage people to move a little bit more. And I will
try to do that, and hopefully not even take the full 20 minutes. At
the very end I may have a few concluding questions.
  Judge, you have, as you discussed with Senator Specter this
morning, you have praised dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, that infa-
mous separate but equal case that Brown overruled, and you
praised Harlan's dissent.
  As I am sure you are aware, Harlan's dissent in the Plessy case
has been used by some scholars and officeholders alike to reinforce
the notion of a colorblind Constitution; in a way, the idea that has
been tremendously powerful in impacting upon one of the elements
in the struggle for civil rights in this country, and that is the whole
question of affirmative action.
  It also is being used by some to argue that Congress lacks the
authority to take race into account in any context. The Congress
does not have the right to pass any laws even if our action is de-
signed to improve equal opportunity for a group previously dis-
criminated against or to remedy past discrimination.
                                      182
  When you say that Justice Harlan was correct, do you give his
opinion that kind of meaning, that it proscribes the Congress from
passing any laws to take into account any issue relating to race?
  Judge KENNEDY. I recognize the quotation that the Constitution
is colorblind. It was, of course, in the context, as you point out, of a
case in which affirmative action was not before the Court and has
since been used, as an interpretation, to argue against affirmative
action. I do not think that that is a necessary interpretation of the
opinion.
  The CHAIRMAN. Could you tell us whether when you say you
agree with Harlan whether it is your interpretation? What do you
mean when you say you agree with Harlan's dissent?
  Judge KENNEDY. My agreement with Mr. Justice Harlan's dis-
sent is his reasoning as he was applying it to the facts of Plessy v.
Ferguson.
  The CHAIRMAN. Can you tell us what your views are on the per-
missibility of Congress engaging in legislative activity that is char-
acterized as affirmative action?
  Judge KENNEDY. The issue has not come before me in a judicial
capacity as a circuit judge, and might well as a Supreme Court Jus-
tice, so I would not commit myself on the issue.
  I will say that my experience in law school taught me the argu-
ments for the practice.
  The CHAIRMAN. I beg you pardon?
  Judge KENNEDY. My experience in law school taught me the ar-
guments in favor of affirmative action. Whether or not they would
prevail in a court of law on a constitutional basis is by no means
certain. But, in the law schools, in 1965, one percent of the nation's
law school student body was black. After 10 years of effort by the
law schools, including the one where I was privileged to teach, to
encourage applicants from the black community, that had risen to
8 percent, an 800 percent increase. I know of no professor in legal
education that does not think that it is highly important that we
have a representative group of black law students in law schools.
  It has apparently stayed about that rate, at 8 percent. I will
notice in some of my classes there are not as many blacks as the
year before, and then I will notice it picks up again. So, it is an
area that the law schools, and I am sure other professional schools,
are continuing to pay attention to, and I think it is a very impor-
tant objective on the part of the schools.
  I recognize that in the area of State schools there are different
kinds of programs that may present constitutional questions that
have yet to be resolved fully by the Court. As you know, the Court
is still engaged in determining the appropriate rationale and the
appropriate explanation for affirmative action under the Constitu-
tion.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am not sure, quite frankly, how to fairly
pursue the issue further with you without getting into areas that
you might have to decide on. Your answer indicates a sensitivity to
the need to encourage minorities and give them access to all insti-
tutions, in this case law, but I am not sure that it sheds much light
on whether or not the Congress has the right under the Constitu-
tion to pass legislation that in fact requires affirmative action on
                                      183
the part of various institutions over which it has control or indirect
control.

  Judge KENNEDY. AS you know, the leading case on the subject is
Fullilove v. Klutznik, a Supreme Court case which ratified, validat-
ed an affirmative action program for minority hiring for govern-
ment contracts. That case is quite sweeping in its reasoning and in
its rationale. But again, this is an area of the law where there is
still much exploration and much explanation to be done on a case-
by-case basis. I am not sure if there is any such case on the docket
of the Supreme Court this term, but I know there are some cases in
the circuits.

  The CHAIRMAN. DO you think that voluntary plans by employers,
voluntary affirmative action plans are permissible?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, and incidentally, I said that I have not
written in this area. Perhaps that was imprecise. Your question
brings to mind one case where we had a unanimous court and I
was the author of the opinion. It was called Bates v. The Pacific
Maritime Association, and the question was whether or not a con-
sent decree, which in a sense is voluntary action, was binding on a
successor employer.

  The previous employer had agreed to the terms and conditions of
the consent decree and thereafter sold the enterprise. But the em-
ployee pool was the same, the equipment was the same, and we
held that the consent decree, which required affirmative action for
racial minority hiring, was valid and was binding on the successor.
And you might be able to obtain some insight into my approach in
this area by looking at that case.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me move to a different area of precedent. I
have been fascinated by your responses to my colleagues on the
role of history in the evolution of the Constitution and the relation-
ship of the text to the practice and societal values.

  And, in your remarks to the ninth circuit, you asked a question
of Paul Brest, the dean of Stanford Law School, that I would like to
put to you, because it bears upon our discussion here and may also
tie this discussion into earlier exchanges you have had with some
of my colleagues.

  You noted that the Canadian Constitution is only 5 years old,
and then you asked Dean Brest, and I think I am quoting, "What
do you think would be easier, to be a constitutional judge in
Canada or a judge interpreting the Constitution of the United
States? Would it be easier to decide a close question when you es-
sentially are a contemporary of those who frame the document or
does 200 years of history and experience and teaching give us in-
sight the Canadians don't have?" That is the question.

  Judge KENNEDY. Paul Brest is a great constitutional scholar and
I wish he had answered the question. He did not.

  I thought when I first began teaching constitutional law that
John Marshall was in the finest position of all of us to know what
the Constitution meant, and in part because of my experience in
talking about the Canadian Constitution with the Canadian judges
I have changed that view. I think 200 years of history gives us a
magnificent perspective on what the framers did intend, on what
they did plan, on what they did build, on what they did structure
for this country.
                                         184

  Holmes said that "A page of history is worth a volume of logic,"
and certainly 200 years of history is not irrelevant, so I think we
are in a better position. The answer is, I think we are in a much
better position.

  And the other point is that over time the intentions of the fram-
ers are more remote from their particular political concerns and so
they have a certain purity and a certain generality now that they
did not previously.

  The CHAIRMAN. I think I will stop there. I will reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

  The Senator from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Kennedy, I want to commend you for the astute manner
in which you have answered the questions during this hearing. You
have answered them with credibility and with knowledge. You
have shown the great respect you have for the Constitution of the
United States, which, in my opinion, is the greatest document that
has ever been penned by the mind of man for the governing of a
people.
  You have shown that you are an independent thinker. In other
words, you will draw your own conclusions after you get the facts.
And you have shown a knowledge of the construction of the Consti-
tution and the law, which I think is to be admired by all, and that
it is your desire to construe it for the best interests of the Ameri-
can people.
  On the question of issues, you have impressed me as being open-
minded and will give careful consideration. You will follow stare
decisis unless there is some overriding reason why you would act
differently. For instance, in Plessy v. Ferguson the Supreme Court
reversed itself. There may be instances in the future in which they
will reverse themselves, and you would not hesitate to reverse a de-
cision if you felt it was the right thing to do.
  You have shown I think that you are not prejudiced and that you
will be fair to all. I have been deeply impressed with your testimo-
ny. And I am not going to take more time at this point, I think we
can all cut these questions short. I think they have had a chance to
size you up, and the only conclusion they can reach is you are a
good man and ought to be confirmed.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU don't object to that, do you?
  Judge KENNEDY. Not at all. I appreciate the Senator's most gra-
cious remarks.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Ohio.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Kennedy, I have some questions in
the antitrust area, and I know that is not your special field of ex-
pertise, so I am not going to get into what I call the nitty-gritty of
some of the Court decisions.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I know that it is yours, Senator, so I
would be pleased to learn.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Pardon?
  Judge KENNEDY. I know that it is yours, so I would be pleased to
learn.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Well, I will at least make an overall in-
quiry.
                                         185

   As you may recall, Judge Bork wrote and testified that manufac-
turers should be able to fix the resale price of their product even
though the Supreme Court has declared such price-fixing per se il-
legal. Letting manufacturers fix the resale price--and what we are
talking about is where the manufacturer tells the retailer that you
must sell at a certain price or else you lose the product--would ac-
tually drive discounters out of business and consumers would be
forced to pay billions of additional dollars.

   I am frank to say to you that I consider this a very major issue,
because to me the essence and bulwark of this whole system of free
enterprise is free competitive forces working and being permitted
to work. If manufacturers can say that you can only sell a refriger-
ator or a stove or a set of dishes, or whatever, at a certain price, I
think that is hurtful not alone to the consumer, but also to the
nation as a whole. I would sort of like to get your views on the sub-
ject as to whether you agree with the current law or with Judge
Bork that manufacturers should have the right to fix resaie prices?

   Judge KENNEDY. At the outset let me tell you, Senator, that I did
not hear Judge Bork's testimony on that point and I am simply not
familiar with his views. There is a case on the Supreme Court's
docket, and I am not sure if it is one that has been argued this
term, in which the question cf whether or not vertical price re-
straints, which is the kind of restraint that you have described, are
per se violative of the antitrust laws. So I should tread very warily
about expressing a view on that case.

   Senator METZENBAUM. I am not trying to get you into any specif-
ic cases. I am more tr}/ing to get you into this whole idea of vertical
price restraints and the whole question of freedom of the retailer
who owns the product to be able to sell at such a price as he or she
determines the product should be sold at.

   Judge KENNEDY. I understand. I just wanted to tell you why I am
going to be very guarded in my answer, because it is such a specific
issue that the Supreme Court is now considering.

   Generally. I think it is fair to say, and I think that the law
should be this, that a per se rule is justified if in almost every event
it has an anticompetitive effect. Only if a particular trade practice
that is challenged is pro-competitive is there a justification for it
when there is a restrictive agreement of the kind you describe. I
take it that is the starting position for analyzing this kind of prob-
lem.

   And so the question, I suppose, would be whether or not there
can be any demonstration that vertical price restraints are in any
respect pro-competitive, and it is not clear to me exactly what
showing would be made on that. You can get economists to testify
on each side of any issue, as you know.

   Senator METZENBAUM. I am not sure how vertical price re-
straints could ever be shown to be pro-competitive. Almost by defi-
nition, the restraint precludes competition.

   Judge KENNEDY. That is the question. And, incidentally, by
saying that economists testify on either side of the issue, I do not
mean necessarily to denigrate them. There is just a great deal of
disagreement, and we use experts in lawsuits this way all the time.

   Senator METZENBAUM. There is a case called the State of Arizona
v. Maricopa County Medical Society. You concurred in an opinion
                                          186

that said doctors could fix prices--so long as it was a maximum
rather than a minimum price--without automatically violating the
antitrust laws.

   You rejected the State's argument that the agreement led doc-
tors to charge the maximum, making it legal price-fixing by its
very nature. The Supreme Court reversed, holding 4 to 3 that "the
anticompetitive potential inherent in all price-fixing agreements
justifies their facial invalidation even if procompetitive justifica-
tions are offered for some."

   Could you tell us why or how you concluded that maximum
price-fixing for the doctors should not be per se illegal, and wheth-
er you still feel that same way today despite the Supreme Court's
reversal of your opinion in Maricopa?

  Judge KENNEDY. I thought it was a close case then, and I am
quite willing to accept the Supreme Court's decision, although all
of us were disappointed that there was not a majority in the Su-
preme Court--there were only four votes--because the district
courts and the circuit courts need guidance and we wanted the Su-
preme Court to set the rule.

  My concern there was that I wanted a record. I wanted the case
to go to trial. It simply wasn't clear to me from what I know as a
judge, from what I am capable of understanding as a judge, that
arrangements for health care services which use a pool of doctors
and which allow the patient to choose the particular doctor are in
all respects necessarily anti-competitive if they use a price sched-
ule.

  Senator METZENBAUM. If they what?
  Judge KENNEDY. The issue, as I understood it, as framed by the
plaintiffs, who were challenging the scheme, was whether allowing
a health plan, where you have a choice of physicians and the physi-
cians have a schedule that they agree upon, is necessarily anti-com-
petitive. I simply saw no body of doctrine or learning or experience
in the courts that would justify my coming to the conclusion that
in all cases that must be anti-competitive.

  The health care field is sufficiently volatile and dynamic, and the
cost problems in the health care field are so well understood that I
thought that the courts could benefit from a trial where we could
have experts testify one way or the other and then evaluate the
record. It did not seem to me that the rules for fixing the prices of
retail goods necessarily applied to the medical profession, which
was attempting to provide this kind of group service.

   And the Supreme Court said, in the 4-to-3 opinion, that that was
incorrect--that a horizontal price schedule is a horizontal price re-
straint, and that it is per se illegal.

   I recognize the utility of per se rules. Because if you have a rule
of reason trial, which is usually at the other end of the spectrum, it
is a global sort of judgment. It is a very expensive suit to try. The
plaintiff has to go through an elaborate and costly trial, and, when
the trial is over you often do not learn a lot. That is the argument
against the rule of reason and the argument for per se rules.

   My concern was that in the health field--we knew so little about
it that we should have a trial on the merits. But the Supreme
Court disagreed, and I understand why.
                                      187
  Senator METZENBAUM. While you haven't written a great many
antitrust opinions, you appear to have written enough to have a
working knowledge of antitrust laws and, undoubtedly, as so far in-
dicated in this last few minutes, some views on it.
  I raise the subject not only because it matters a great deal to me,
which really is totally unimportant, but because the Supreme
Court, as you know, makes a great deal of law in this area. There
will be more law made by the Supreme Court with respect to anti-
trust issues than in almost any other field.
  Some have felt free to substitute their own views for those of
Congress in applying the antitrust laws. Now, there is no question
the antitrust statutes are admittedly general and Congress' intent
in enacting them is not all that clear.
  Give me your thoughts, if you will, as to what you think Con-
gress had uppermost in its mind when it enacted the Sherman and
Clayton Acts, our basic antitrust statutes, and what are your views
on the obligations of the Court to ascertain and enforce congres-
sional intent in this area?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, the Sherman Antitrust Acts and the Clay-
ton Acts were passed in an era when corporate acquisitions and
mergers were proceeding at a tremendous rate. In the period, I
think, from 1900 to 1930, over 7,000 small firms, each with a cap-
ital of over $100,000, simply disappeared. The concern was, in the
acquisitions and merger field, that the capitalistic system simply
could not work if there was not an opportunity for small and
medium-sized businesses to invest capital, to have resources and
talent in localities throughout the country, and to have some pro-
tection against being acquired by competitors and by large con-
glomerates. This particularly happened in the utility area.
  Unfortunately, what happened was that the Supreme Court, in
the E.C. Knight case, gave a restrictive interpretation under the
Commerce Clause to the reach of the Sherman Act, and at the
same time they were willing to enforce agreements against price
restraints, and the two in combination accelerated this merger
pace. And it was only when the Supreme Court changed its rules
under the Commerce Clause that antitrust enforcement became a
reality in the merger field.
  So I think it is necessary to go back to that intent of Congress
and to recognize that it is a central part of our national policy to
have a capitalistic system which is free, which is open.
  So far as the consumer is concerned, the consumer is protected
by aggressive price competition, and the antitrust laws make it
very clear that price-fixing is improper and illegal. As you know, in
some cases violations of the antitrust laws can be criminal, and in
those cases I think the criminal law should be vigorously enforced.
A price-fixing agreement that is unlawful can cause great damage
and great injury, just as much as a bank embezzler can, and I am
in favor of strict enforcement of the criminal laws when there is a
violation.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Some have argued, Judge Kennedy, that
mergers are a good thing even if they leave only two or three firms
in the market. Would you go that far? And what would be your
standards, generally speaking, for judging mergers?
                                      188

  Judge KENNEDY. I am not an economist and I would want to hear
the arguments in the particular case before I ventured anything
that I think would be of very much substance or help to you, Sena-
tor. I would want to look at the facts in the particular case.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, let me ask you this. Some have
argued, and I think it is fair to say that they are conservative anti-
trust thinkers, that only economic efficiency matters in antitrust
analysis; that is, a merger or a monopoly is good if its efficient
even if the net result or the bottom line is that it raises prices or
hurt the consumer.

  Others, and I include myself in this group, believe Congress want
our judges to consider other things as well, things like unfair ex-
ploitation of consumers, excess concentrations of corporate power,
and the effect on small businesspeople.

  Where would you come out on this debate--not on any case, but
on this whole question of economic efficiency, which is on one side
of the issue, versus the questions of unfair exploitation of consum-
ers, excess concentration of corporate power, and negative effects
on small business? Where would you want to place yourself in that
debate?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I would not want to do that because I
really do not have a fixed position. I think my earlier answer indi-
cates to you that I would be as sensitive to and most interested in
those arguments that indicated that economic efficiency was not
the sole controlling determinant.

  Senator METZENBAUM. SO that you, are you saying that those
who would maintain that economic efficiency is not the sole deter-
minant would have the burden of proof to convince you that nega-
tive consumer impact, or loss of competition, or excess concentra-
tion of corporate power, outweigh or negate the efficiencies. Are
you saying that the scale starts off being weighted in favor of eco-
nomic efficiency unless you can prove the contrary? Are you saying
that?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think that any person who argues for a simple
conclusive formula always has the burden of proof to demonstrate
to me that it is correct.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, you could say that factors relating
to unfair exploitation of consumers, or excess concentration of cor-
porate power, or effect on small business tie in with previous deci-
sions of the Supreme Court, and that those who claim that econom-
ic efficiency is the only thing that matters should have the burden
of proof. It is really a question of which comes first, the chicken or
the egg. But let us assume that neither comes first, that both are
evenly on the scale. And I am saying where does Judge Kennedy
come down, without addressing yourself to any particular cases or
any particular issues pending before the Court.

  I think this is a fundamental concept of antitrust law. I honestly
believe that we are entitled to something further on your thinking
on the subject than we have so far.

  Judge KENNEDY. I just do not want to tell you that there has
been a lot of thinking on my part when there has not been, Sena-
tor. To the extent that the precedents say that economic efficiency
is not the sole determinant--and that is the way I understand most
of the precedents in the area--the burden of proof would be on the
                                         189

person who wishes to change that doctrine and change that ap-
proach.

  Senator METZENBAUM. I think it is fair to say that this is not a
field in which you have been that much involved. I would like to
leave you with the concerns of this Senator that the antitrust laws
are not liberal laws, they are not conservative laws. They came
into being with Republican sponsorship, a Senator from my own
State, John Sherman. And that when you have those cases before
you I would hope that you would think seriously not just about the
impact upon the consumer, not just about the impact upon the bu-
sinessperson, not just about the impact of those employees who
may or may not be forced out of work by reason of corporate merg-
ers, but that you think about the overall impact upon the economic
system, the free enterprise system, and recognize that our antitrust
laws have served us well over a period of many years in protecting
free competition in this country with many of the attendant bene-
fits that have resulted in the system.

  Judge KENNEDY. That is an eminently persuasive statement of
the antitrust laws, which commends itself to me, Senator.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you very much, Judge Kennedy.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Thank you, Senator.
  Judge, I want to compliment you for the candid way you have
answered these questions, and I think you have enlightened us in
many ways.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator HATCH. I just have a few questions I would like to go
over with you that I think need to be brought out and may be help-
ful to everybody concerned, and certainly in this bicentennial timr;
of the Constitution.

  I would like to point out there is much value in a unanimous
Court. When the Court is unanimous, it tends to put an end to fur-
ther debate about the merits of any particular decision or issue. Su-
preme Court historians have recounted how Justice Burger labored
diligently to get a unanimous Court in the U.S. v. Nixon case con-
cerning executive privilege during the Watergate era.

  Similarly, historians report that Chief Justice Warren worked
prodigiously to get a unanimous decision in Brown v. Board of
Education. You are sworn to uphold the Constitution and we would
want you to do nothing else. But there might be times when una-
nimity on a ruling is more important than your own dissenting
view.

  Now, how would you weigh the merits of such a case, and what
factors would cause you to submerge your own views in deference
to the need for a unanimous opinion?

  Judge KENNEDY. We have confronted that on our own court, Sen-
ator, and it is a difficult problem. But I think, as you have indicat-
ed, that it is also a very important one. In some cases on the court
in the ninth circuit you can not always tell really how long an
author of an opinion has had a case because sometimes when a
panel is in disagreement, one of us will say, well, why don't you let
me try writing the opinion and I will see if I can solidify our view.
                                      190

  And the two polar tensions here are, on the one hand, the duty
of the judge to speak his or her conscience and not to compromise
his or her views. Judicial decisions are not a log-rolling or a trad-
ing exercise. That is inappropriate. And, on the other hand, there
is the institutional need to provide guidance, to provide uniformity,
to have a statement of rules that all of the court agrees on. And I
think that the Supreme Court functions much better if it has fewer
fragmented opinions. Fragmented opinions are terribly difficult for
all of us to work with.

  I recognize that these are the toughest issues there are, and so
views will differ. On the other hand, I think it is the duty of the
judge to submerge his or her own ego, to accept the fact that his or
her colleagues, too, have much wisdom and have great dedication
to the law. Sometimes I have concurred in opinions simply because
I did not think the majority had it right, but I can not say that
those have added a great deal to the volume of the law. I think
there is much in what you suggest, to commend judges to try to
concur in other judges' opinions.

  Senator HATCH. There is much to that. There is the other side of
the coin, too, and, you know, I want to give some thought to that as
well. I am speaking about the need to stand courageously alone on
matters of principle. Plessy v. Ferguson was a perfect illustration of
that where Justice Harlan, you know, a single Justice, decided that
this separate but equal doctrine established by that case was
wrong. And, frankly, he issued a remarkable dissent reminding the
Nation that the Constitution ought to be "colorblind."

  Now, what factors are going to enter into your decision to stand
alone as a sole dissenter? -

  Judge KENNEDY. Holmes and Brandeis were also known for their
freat dissents. You must stand alone. You may be vox clamatis in
deserto, a voice crying in the wilderness, even though it is a lonely
and difficult position. Judging is a lonely and difficult position.
This is a very lonely job, Senator.

  The Federal system has its own isolation that it imposes on the
judges. Within your own chambers, within your own thought proc-
esses, you wrestle to come to the right result. If you think there is
a matter of legal principle that has been ignored, if you think there
is a matter of principle that affects constitutional rule, if you think
there is a principle that affects the judgment in the case, you must
state that principle, regardless of how embarrassing or awkward it
may be.

  Senator HATCH. One final pcrmt concerning the changing style of
the Supreme Court, more than the substance of its rulings, and
that is this. In recent years the Court's opinions have become far
more complex. Plurality opinions have multiplied. I think you have
noticed it, I have noticed it. Hardly any opinion is issued without
an accompanying flurry of concurring and dissenting viewpoints.

  On the one hand, as we have discussed, this is an important part
of the process because arguments are preserved for the future and
develop more deliberately as the legal and political communities
respond to an unresolved mosaic of opinions on any particular
single issue.

  Yet again, when the Court issues an opinion which nods to both
sides of an issue, or which includes afive-prongedanalysis of com-
                                         191

plex factors, what the Court has actually done, in my opinion, is
abdicate, instead of giving clear guidance as it could do. And by ab-
dicating it thus leaves up to the lower courts to give various kinds
of emphasis to various parts of the mosaic which is wrong.

  Now what can be done to get shorter, more succinct and clear
guidance in some of the Court's opinions?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I think, Senator, that Justices simply
must be conscious of the duties that they have to the public, the
duties they have to the lower courts, the duties they have to the
bar--to give opinions that are clear, workable, pragmatic, under-
standable, and well-founded in the Constitution. More than that I
cannot say, other than that judges also must be careful about dis-
tinguishing between a matter of principle and a matter that really
is dear to their own ego.

  Senator HATCH. I see you as a person, with your experience both
as an eminent lawyer, as a person who has worked as a lobbyist, as
a person who might have a great deal of ability on that Court to
bring about consensus, and to help bring unanimity in those cases
where it should be, and I also see you as a person who is willing to
stand up for principle, even if you are the sole dissenter, which is
an enviable position as well. So I just wanted to point this out, be-
cause a lot of people do not give enough thought to those various
aspects of Supreme Court practice.

  Judge KENNEDY. I agree that that is a very valuable characteris-
tic in a Justice.

  Senator HATCH. Thank you. Let me shift ground just for a
minute. I do not want to keep you too long, so I will only take a
few more minutes.

  But earlier, you were engaged by one of my colleagues in a dis-
cussion about original intent. Now because there has been a great
deal of concern and confusion about what is meant by original
intent, I thought that maybe we could just return for a moment to
that particular issue.

  In the first place, I prefer the term original meaning to original
intent, because original intent sounds like it refers to the subjec-
tive intent of the legislators who wrote the Constitution, or its
amendments, or in the case of other legislation, the Congress and
State legislatures who wrote the legislation or amendments that
were passed.

  When you use the term "original intent," I presume that you are
in reality discussing the objective intent of the framers as ex-
pressed in the words of the Constitution.

  Would that be a fair characterization?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, and I am glad that you brought the subject
up. I think there is a progression, in at least three stages. There is
original intent in the sense of what they actually thought.
  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Judge KENNEDY. There is original intent in the sense of what
they might have thought if they had thought about the problem. I
do not think either of those are helpful.
  There is the final term of original intent in the sense of what
were the legal consequences of their acts, and you call that the
original meaning.
  Senator HATCH. Right.
                                      192

  Judge KENNEDY. I accept that as a good description. We often say
intent because we think of legislative intent, and in this respect,
we mean legislative meaning as well.

  Your actions have an institutional meaning. One of you may vote
for a statute for one reason, and another for another reason, but
the courts find an institutional meaning there and give it effect.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I appreciate that. Our fundamental law is
the text of the Constitution as written, not the subjective intent of
individuals long since dead.

  Specifically, you were asked if statements by the Members of the
39th Congress acknowledging segregated schools meant that the
14th amendment permitted a separate but equal reading, and I
think you were absolutely correct in saying that the text of the
14th amendment outlaws separate but equal, regardless of the
statements or subjective intents of some of its authors, and I appre-
ciated that.

  In fact this example clarifies my thinking for using the term
original meaning instead of original intent. Often, the framers
write into the Constitution a rule which they themselves cannot
live by. I think the 39th Congress was a perfect illustration of that.
They never did completely live up to the aspirations that they in-
cluded in the Constitution in the 14th amendment, but we should
live by the words of the Constitution, not by the subjective intent
or the practices of its authors.

  In a similar vein, the framers could not anticipate the age of
electronics, but they stated in the fourth amendment, that Ameri-
cans should not be subject to unreasonable searches and seizures.

  And so the words and the principles of the fourth amendment
govern situations beyond the subjective imaginings of the actual
authors back in 1789.

  Now do you agree that there are real dangers in relying too
heavily on the subjective intent of the framers of legislation, or, in
this case, the Constitution?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. We always have to keep in mind the object
for which we are making the inquiry, and the object for which we
are making inquiry is to determine the objective, the institutional
intent, or the original meaning, as you say, of the document. That
is our ultimate objective.

  Senator HATCH. Well, we hear criticism sometimes of original
intent, or original meaning analysis, and these critics say that
intent governs, or, they really ask the question, whose intent is the
important intent? In this case, the authors', the ratifiers', the state-
ments made contemporaneously with, the statements that were not
fully recorded?

  That again, it seems to me, to confuse subjective intent with
original meaning. And so I would ask you, in your opinion, whose
intent does govern, or whose meaning does govern?

  Judge KENNEDY. It is the public acts of the framers--what they
said, the legal consequences of what they did, as you point out and
suggest by your phrase, not their subjective motivations.

  Senator HATCH. That is good. Well, let me just say this: that we
could go on and on on this principle, and I think it is a pretty im-
portant principle, and one that we really do not discuss enough,
and one that I think is very much mixed up.
                                         193

   I think many members of this panel misconstrued Judge Bork's
approach towards original intent, as though it was some sort of a
Neanderthal approach to just a literal interpretation of the Consti-
tution, when in fact it was far more complex and far more difficult
than that.

   Let me just say the cases may evolve, circumstances may change,
doctrines may change, applications of the Constitution may evolve,
but the Constitution itself does not evolve unless the people actual-
ly amend it. Do you agree with that?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
   Senator HATCH. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for
the time. Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy.
   Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
   We reviewed, Judge Kennedy, yesterday, some of your decisions
on the handicapped, and on fair housing; and we exchanged views
about whether the decisions you had made were particularly
narrow.
   We talked a little bit about the question of sensitivity on cases
affecting minorities' rights, women's rights in the clubs issue,
where you had been involved and participated in club activities,
and then eventually resigned.
   I do not want to get back into the facts on those, but I want to
get back into related subjects in terms of you, if you are confirmed
and because a Supreme Court Justice, whether those, who are
either left out, or left behind in the system, can really look to you
as a person that is going to be applying equal justice under law.
   And there are some concerns that have been expressed through
the course of these hearings, and 1 want to have an opportunity to
hear you out further on some of these issues.
   I come back to one of the cases that was brought up earlier
today, and that is the Aranda case.
   Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
   Senator KENNEDY. We discussed that earlier in the day, and I
just want to review, briefly, the evidence in that particular case.
You are familiar with it.
   --Ten of the fifteen polling places in the city were in the homes
of whites living in a predominantly white section of town.
   --Although Mexican-Americans constituted 49 percent of the
city's population, and 28 percent of the registered voters, only
three Hispanics had been elected to the city council m 61 years.
   --During a voter-registration drive conducted by the Mexican-
American community, the city clerk issued statements alleging ir-
regularities, and the mayor issued a press release charging that un-
named activists were trying to take control of the city government.
   --In the preceding election there was evidence of harassment of
Mexican-American poll-watchers by the city police.
   --And Mexican-Americans were significantly under-represented
in the ranks of election inspectors and judges, the membership of
city commissions, and the ranks of city employees.
   Now, the lower court indicated that they did not find that there
was any violation of the law. It was appealed to you. You wrote a
separate opinion, and I believe in the exchange earlier today, you
had indicated that even if there had been a finding that all of these
                                      194

facts had been true, that you did not believe that that would justify
the kind of relief that was requested by the petitioners, which
would have been a change in the whole citywide election process.

  Am I correct up to this point?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think that is correct. Yes, sir.
  Senator KENNEDY. I am not trying to fly-speck you on this, but I
want to get to the substance of my concerns.
  Judge KENNEDY. I think that is a fair beginning.
  Senator KENNEDY. The concern that I would have, and I would
think most of those Hispanics would have, is that discrimination
today, whether it applies to women or minorities, does not appear
on signboards. It is often hidden, and, given, if all of these facts
were true, that there had been harassment of the poll workers,
that there had been the conscious positioning of those polls in
white homes that perhaps did not include Hispanics--given the
record--if there had been the harassment of the Mexican-American
poll-watchers, why wouldn't you believe that it would have been
wise to let the jury, or judge hear out the facts on that, to make a
judgment on whether that whole election process and system was
sufficiently corrupt and sufficiently discriminatory, so that the
kind of relief that the petitioner wanted might be justified?
  Judge KENNEDY. In that case, I thought an adequate showing
had been made to survive a summary judgment motion. I said that
to conclude, "That plaintiffs evidence could not justify striking
down the at-large election system, does not, in my view, necessarily
mean that the plaintiffs may not be entitled to some relief. For ex-
ample, plaintiffs statistics regarding placement of polling places in
private homes"--this is a very long paragraph.
  Senator KENNEDY. Right. The point is, don't you think if you
heard, or that a jury heard, the testimony with these kinds of seri-
ous allegations about poll-watchers being harassed, and about ir-
regularities by the city clerks, other kinds of these types of activi-
ties which obviously, if they are true, and you say even if they are
true, might indicate that the whole system, the whole system
within that community is sufficiently tainted, that the opportunity
for a true election would be virtually impossible? Don't you think if
a jury heard and listened to those witnesses that made those alle-
gations, and heard their cross-examinations, given the significance
and the importance of discrimination that exists in my own com-
munity, in the City of Boston, and in other parts of our country--
did you ever think for a moment that we really ought to try to
hear that out, or send it back and let a jury or a judge find out how
invidious this really is, before we deny, effectively, these petition-
ers their day in court?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, it would be a judge in this case, and I
thought that the action did justify further pursuit in the courts. I
have indicated that I thought that a complaint would lie for these
actions.
  I did think, Senator, that because of the insistence of the plain-
tiffs that they wanted only the at-large election remedy, that a
judge could not reasonably conclude that the at-large remedy--or
pardon me--that the maintenance of the at-large system was inten-
tionally caused, because I did not think that the evidence support-
ed that inference.
                                      195

  I did not think that inference could be drawn. Now, if you want
to hypothesize, saying that because of this injury there should have
been a remedy of district elections, then that is another point, and
under the 1982 amendments to the Voting Act, I think that may
very well be the case.

  Senator KENNEDY. Well, it was because we went into an effects
test. But we do not want to leave the record to suggest that you
remanded for further proceedings. You affirmed the earlier deci-
sion. You could have remanded for further proceedings which

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I was a single judge. I did not have the
dispositive power over the judgment.

  Senator KENNEDY. Let me go into, again, this question about a
different type of discrimination. We talked about it, briefly, yester-
day, and that is the whole question of stigmatization and invidious
discrimination, particularly with regards to women in our society.

  And we addressed that issue as it related to your former club
memberships, and I do not want to go back over that ground. But I
want to get back to what you think is necessary in terms of finding
invidious forms of discrimination, again against a background
where we have seen, with regards to women and minorities, that
issues of discrimination are now much more sophisticated.

  They certainly have become so in recent times, and I think the
American people understand that. Now as a practical matter,
blacks were excluded from the Olympic Club because of their race,
or sex, and during our discussion yesterday, you agreed that it is
stigmatizing for a woman to be excluded from a club where busi-
ness is conducted.

  In fact you said it is "almost Dickensian" and inappropriate, but,
at the same time you indicated that in your view--and I quote:
"None of these clubs practiced invidious discrimination,"

  Now the Bar Association, in its commentary, does not require
that there actually is an evil intent, in its restrictions of member-
ship in various clubs. And I am just wondering whether you think
that there can be invidious discrimination--without trying to reach
back into the mind of the particular drafters of a statute, or by-
law, or regulation--whether the effects of that type of a by-law, or
regulation or statute effectively can discriminate invidiously, or
whether you find that you have to go back to the mindset of the
individual who either voted for or drafted that particular by-law or
statute?

  Judge KENNEDY. Invidious is the term that the ABA used, and it
is the term that the Judicial Ethics Committee uses as well.

  It is not a term that so far as I know has a meaning that has
been explored in the case law, and therefore, it is somewhat impre-
cise. I think that the dictionary definition would be evil or hostile.

  Senator KENNEDY. I have got it here. I do not want to be spend-
ing the time on it, but you know the point I am driving at.

  Judge KENNEDY. The law in torts says that you can be charged
with the natural consequences of your own acts. It is clear, to me,
that if a discriminatory barrier exists for too long, if it is visible, if
it is hurtful, and if it is condoned, that the person who condones it
can be charged with invidious discrimination. I would concede that.

  Senator KENNEDY. I think I will leave that there.
                                         196

   Let me go on to another area, if I could, that involves both the
availability and the sensitivity and the usefulness of statutes and
laws to correct wrongs. What I am talking now is access to the
courts.

  I am sure all of us understand the importance of having our day
in court. It is part of our national heritage, but courts are especial-
ly important for those that lack the financial resources and the
skills to be able to protect their rights. So as you know, class ac-
tions are often a means used by large groups of victims to pool
their resources and bring a lawsuit for the benefit of all the mem-
bers of the class. It may be women, it may be blacks, it may be
senior citizens in terms of Social Security, which we saw reflected
during previous nominations.

  In a decision in 1982, in the Pavlak v. Church case, you held that
the fact that a motion to certify a class action was pending did not
stop the clock from running on the statute of limitations on the
claims of members of the class. The approach you took would se-
verely undercut the usefulness of the class actions because each
victim, effectively, wouJd have to file intervention papers in the
class action in order to protect his or her rights if the courts denied
the motion to certify the class.

  So in the hypothetical employment discrimination suit I referred
to, every person who was discriminated against would have to file
intervention papers. They, in effect, would have to get a lawyer
and file in case the court decided not to treat the case as a class
action.

  Now, the Supreme Court in 1983 vacated your decision because
in two cases that year the Supreme Court unanimously rejected
the view you expressed.

  Would you address the concern that your decision in the Pavlak
case reflects a very technical and narrow view in terms of the
access to the courts to American people, who may be poor or handi-
capped?

  Judge KENNEDY. TO begin with, you have to remember that the
class action failed there. So the question is whether a person who
has an individual injury can sue.

  Senator KENNEDY. That is right.
  Judge KENNEDY. And the Supreme Court decision does make it
easier for those persons who are injured to file an individual suit
after the class has failed.
  Senator KENNEDY. Right.
  Judge KENNEDY. Our concern was that by the pendency of the
class action, of course, the defendant has an open-ended contingent
liability, and there is some interest in terminating those contingen-
cies and in encouraging people with individual claims to come for-
ward so the defendant knows what it has to defend against.
  Senator KENNEDY. Sure.
  Judge KENNEDY. And in this case, the plaintiff did not seek to
intervene even after the court gave leave to intervene. The court
gave leave to intervene at the conclusion of the class action, and
the plaintiff did not. That was our rationale for saying that the
statute has run. I certainly do think it is a close case, and I am
quite willing to accept the decision of the Supreme Court. I forget
                                      197
where the other circuits were on that point. I think we followed
the decision of the second circuit, but I am not sure.

  Senator KENNEDY. This is with regards to whether you have got
individuals who have a grievance, and they are trying to find out if
there is going to be certification of a class action.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator KENNEDY. That request or certification can be denied for
any number of reasons--the size of the class dissimilar interest,
any number of different reasons for which a class action, as I un-
derstand, can be dismissed. And we are talking about the statute of
limitations, for example, that in some instances are not 7 years,
but 60 or 90 days. Fair housing is 120 days. So we are talking about
a relatively short period of time in areas, particularly in the area
of housing, where there are some very serious, egregious situations
and where this may have a significant effect. I hear your reasons
for it.
  Let me ask whether these narrow rules really effectively have a
booby-trapping effect on individuals. Just again on the issues of the
statute of limitations, in Koucky v. Department of Navy in 1987,
you affirmed a lower court decision dismissing a handicap discrimi-
nation claim against the Navy on statute of limitation grounds be-
cause the complaint, that was filed on time, named only the De-
partment of the Navy, not the Secretary of the Navy, as required
by law.
  Similarly, in Allen v. Veterans Administration, you affirmed a
district court order dismissing a suit on statute of limitation
grounds because the papers, filed on time, named the Veterans Ad-
ministration, rather than the United States, as the defendant.
  What I am looking for is some assurance that these and other
cases do not reflect any predisposition on your part to look for
ways to keep worthy cases out of court.
  Judge KENNEDY. They do not. If you will look at our opinion in
Lynn v. Western Gillette, I am tempted to say, you will see that I
was quite capable of giving a generous interpretation to a statute
of limitation in a Civil Rights Act case.
  The claims cases you mentioned against the Government are
ones where I wish the Congress would pass just a little bill
  Senator KENNEDY. That is asking a lot.
  Judge KENNEDY [continuing]. To clean up the statute of limita-
tions law. I could write it for you on the back of an envelope during
a recess. We have been pleading with the Congress for years to give
attention to this, to what we consider to be as the law of our cir-
cuit--the mandatory rule that you have to serve two different
people. It is a trap. There is no question it is a trap. It is also, Sena-
tor, the law.
  Senator KENNEDY. Well, I thank you. I would be interested in
your recommendations on it, and I know that the time is flowing
down. But at least in these cases affecting minorities, affecting the
handicapped, affecting access and discrimination, we welcome your
response. I think the real question that certainly members hear
across the country, which is the most important aspect, people
want to know whether--not only as a nominee, but should you be
confirmed--whether you are going to live by those four words that
are above the Supreme Court, which you know so well, and that is
                                      198

"Equal Justice Under Law"; and whether they are going to feel,
particularly those that have been left out and left behind, that in
Justice Kennedy they are going to have someone that will not be
looking for the technicalities and the narrow and crabbed or
pinched view of a particular statute, but a justice who is going to
be sensitive to the basic reasons for why that statute was passed.

  That is something that we will be making judgment on. I do not
know whether you care to comment.

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, thank you, Senator. I think it is an impor-
tant part of the advise and consent process that you make the
judge aware of your own deep feelings and sensitivities. I would say
that if I am appointed to the Supreme Court and I do not fully
meet the great proclamation that stands over its podium, that I
would consider that my career has not been a success.

  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  The Senator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, Mr. Chair-
man, let me say that yesterday I mentioned--and I want this very
important matter to be heard--a group called the National
Women's Law Center as a group who had spoken out against Judge
Bork on issues of discrimination based upon sex, and that they had
no men in their organization. That was incorrect and in error and
unfortunate. The group was not the National Women's Law
Center, which is a Washington, D.C.-based group. My confusion was
occasioned by the fact that one lady named Marsha D. Greenberger
is the managing attorney of the National Women's Law Center and
a member of their board. She is also a member-at-large and on the
letterhead of a group called the Federation of Women Lawyers Ju-
dicial Screening Panel, which is a Washington organization. My
confusion was caused by that dual membership of this lady attor-
ney on that National Women's Law Center and this Federation of
Women Lawyers Judicial Screening Panel. This group, the
Women's Law Center, did object to Bork, in fact, in a letter they
stated that they had never before ever taken a position on a judi-
cial nomination, but because of the extreme nature of Judge Bork's
legal views and the dramatic effect on the rights of women, the
center felt compelled to take that step.
  But what I was referring to was the letter of the Federation of
Women Lawyers with regard to Judge Sentelle where they were
objecting to his being a member of the Masons because it was a
male organization. I was saying there is the true irony because the
letterhead of that group does not contain the name of any male.
  Now, before sinking deeper into the morass there, I do indeed
owe an apology to the National Women's Law Center. The remarks
I made with regard to the Federation of Women Lawyers Judicial
Screening Panel I would leave on the record, but I certainly want
to apologize to the National Women's Law Center as an error on
my part. I would like to clear that record, and especially to Marsha
D. Greenberger. And my apology, surely due, is certainly hereby
expressed, and I earnestly hope accepted.
  With that, I shall move on.
  Mr. Chairman, you know, regardless of what we say, sometimes
the needle does get stuck here, and we have reviewed old ground,
                                      199
the things we reviewed in the previous nomination: unenumerated
rights, framers' intent, ninth amendment, rights of privacy, prece-
dent, States' rights, antitrust, civil rights, freedom of press, speech,
criminal law, equal protection, race and gender, gender discrimina-
tion, Establishment Clause, death penalty, congressional standing,
judicial restraint, voting rights. The only one I do not remember
was comparable worth. But we have, indeed, plowed old ground.

  The CHAIRMAN. Sounds like the Constitution, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. It does. Should be. Lively little place in here.
But let us keep the record quite clear that we have all dabbled in
just what we dabbled in before, and will again because that is our
role.
  So yesterday there was an interesting discussion on criminal
matters. It did not come up as much in the previous hearings, but
there were questions about imposing strict sentences on convicted
criminals. I remember some of your comments on that. A tough
one always for a judge. I know in my practice when the trial was
ended and the sentence awaited, and the jury, having concluded
their deliberations or a non-jury case, the sentencing was always
the troublesome part for the judge. You know, those are the ones,
as they say, that keep you up at night.
  But, anyway, you referred to that. We have just grappled with
technical amendments to the sentencing guidelines legislation
which established uniform sentencing for criminals across the
United States. That was somewhat controversial. Senators Thur-
mond and Kennedy worked many years on the criminal law, sen-
tencing guidelines, those things. The sentencing guidelines were de-
signed, or at least we believe that they will work to bring uniformi-
ty in the sentencing of white collar criminals--white collar crime,
more specifically--one that was tough to get at.
  There is a widespread public perception in society that white
collar crime does not receive the same degree of strict sentencing
which other crimes receive. I would appreciate having your com-
ments on the importance of sentencing in the area of white collar
crime as it is in this country today.
  Judge KENNEDY. White collar crime, as I have indicated in the
initial exchange with Senator Metzenbaum, is, I think, an unfortu-
nate term. It sounds as if it is a clean crime, which is, of course, a
contradiction in terms. White collar crime can rob people of mil-
lions of dollars just as effectively as a person with a gun. I know
bank officers who have congratulated me for my tough stance on
crime because we put away bank robbers, but then they will turn
around and they will, for fear of publicity, not prosecute one of
their officers who has embezzled $50,000. I think that is wrong.
  White collar crime is very, very dangerous, particularly in the
consumer fraud area where people are deprived of their life sav-
ings. I think the courts should be very vigorous with respect to so-
called white collar crime, and I wish we could find another apho-
rism that indicates that it is really a very, very ugly deed that we
are talking about.
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes, it is a tough one because it often arises
from a position of trust to embezzlement and other aspects of that
crime.
                                               200

  Well, now I have a totally provincial question. I want to get right
down to that. I would ask you about perhaps an expansion of your
opinions on the importance of States' rights in the constitutional
system. That is sometimes overused. I think we do overuse that;
perhaps I do, too. "States' rights." But as a Westerner from the
State of Wyoming, I think it is sometimes forgotten that here is a
State of almost 100,000 square miles; 50 percent of the surface of it
is owned by the Federal Government, and 63 percent of its miner-
als are owned by the Federal Government. In that State is 40 per-
cent of the Nation's wilderness in the lower 48.

  So we have continual conflict on States' rights when you have
the surface of a State owned 50 percent by the Federal Govern-
ment. That means it belongs to the people of the United States and
not to the people of the State of Wyoming. So I have this abiding
interest in the opportunity for states to determine their own desti-
ny on a multitude of issues without intrusive interference from the
Federal Government, recognizing, of course, the federal nature of
the public lands--or the public nature of the federal lands might
be a better way to say it.

  Could you give me your philosophy briefly regarding that general
issue of States' rights and the reservation of power to the States
under the Constitution?

  Judge KENNEDY. Federalism is one of the four structural compo-
nents of the Constitution. The framers thought of it as really one of
the most essential safeguards of liberty. They thought that it was
improper, that it was spiritually wrong, morally wrong, for a
people to delegate so much power to a remote government that
they could no longer have control over their own destiny, their own
lives. That is the reason for the states.

  The framers were very concerned that the sheer problem of geo-
graphic size would doom their experiment in a republican form of
government. Their studies had taught them that the only success-
ful republican form of government or democracy would be a small
city-State. In those times, there were great diversities. One of the
framers at the convention from South Carolina said the differences
that divided his State and Maine and New Hampshire and Massa-
chusetts were greater than those that divided Russia and Turkey.
And he might have been right.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Kennedy and Senator Thurmond, thank
you.

  All right.
  Judge KENNEDY. That is the purpose of the Federal system, and
it is the duty of all the branches of the government to respect the
position of the place of the states in the Federal system.
  As I indicated yesterday, there are no automatic mechanisms, or
very few, in the Constitution, to respect the rights of States. You
can read all through the Constitution and you will see very little
about States.
  This indicates, I think, that we have a special obligation to ascer-
tain the effects of national policy on the existence of State sover-
eignty.
  Senator SIMPSON. Obviously, you have made several references to
the history of the Court, the history of the Constitution, the Consti-
tutional Convention. That has been most interesting to me.
                                      201
  Obviously, you enjoy reading and studying Supreme Court histo-
ry; is that true?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator SIMPSON. I would think that would be a tremendous
asset to any Supreme Court Justice to have that appreciation and
flavor of the historical analysis of the Court before a judge would
go on that court.
  I am going to conclude with a question. I remember that Senator
Humphrey waived his whole stack of comments yesterday--and in
accordance with trying to get the job done, I am going to conclude.
  And you have been very good, Mr. Chairman, at accelerating
things, and I hope we can continue to do that.
  But let me ask you this, Judge. In your knowledge of the history
of the Supreme Court, and reading of it, have you come upon a fa-
vorite among Supreme Court justices down through history, those
who have served, one on whom you might lavish just a little extra
ration of praise among all the remarkable men who have served?
  I would be interested if you do have such a preference for a
person?
  Judge KENNEDY. I've sometimes tried to make up all-star lists of
the Supreme Court. I will usually just put on seven in case some-
body else has their favorites.
  Chief Justice Marshall foresaw the great destiny of this country.
He knew the necessity for a national government.
  He had a power and a persuasiveness and a rhetoric and a mo-
rality to his opinions that few other justices have ever possessed.
He went to law school for just 6 weeks. He had a remarkable grasp
of the meaning of government and the meaning of the Constitu-
tion.
  The two Justice Harlans, the Justice Harlan in Plessy v. Fergu-
son, and the Justice Harlan of the not too distant past, were great,
great judges because of their understanding of the Constitution.
  Brandeis, Cardozo and Holmes sat on the same Court, and were
some of the greatest justices who ever sat on the Court.
  And one of your colleagues, one of your predecessor colleagues,
Hugo Black, was one of the great justices of the Court. He had a
hideaway office somewhere here in the Capitol, and he would read
Burke and Marx and Hume and Keynes and Plato and Aristotle
during the Senate's sessions.
  He was simply a magnificent justice. He carried around, as many
of you know, a little pocket copy of the Constitution at all times, in
case he was asked about it, a habit that has been emulated by
many of his admirers.
  Those were all great men in the history of the court, Senator. To
talk only of those who are not living.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, that is fascinating. Now, instead of read-
ing those things, we read stuff from our staff while we are squir-
reled away in some warren somewhere.
  And maybe we ought to go back to some of those treatises in
every way.
  A Wyoming man served on the Supreme Court, Mr. Van De-
van ter.
                                                202

  Judge KENNEDY. Mr. Justice Van Devanter. He was one of the
greatest justices on the court for achieving a compromise among
the justices.

  When they were searching for a common point of agreement, Mr.
Justice Van Devanter could find it.

  He did not produce a lot of the opinions of the Court, because he
found it very difficult to write; he was a slow writer.

  But he was valued very, very highly by all of his colleagues.
  Senator SIMPSON. That is very interesting. Thank you so much,
Judge.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask you a question about history, and I
am not being facetious when I ask this.
  Didn't Justice Black, when he was Senator Black, also carry a
book with a list of all his supporters and contributors? A little
book?
  I am told that Justice Black, when he was a Senator, literally
carried a book--was it Black? He was Senator Black from Alabama
that had a list of all his supporters.
  So every county he went into, he would take out his little book.
And he would know exactly who had helped him in the previous
election. He carried that with him all the time, I was told.
  Judge KENNEDY. I am not aware of that. He was from Clay
County in Alabama.
  The CHAIRMAN. Maybe our Alabamian at the end of the row
could clarify it when we get to that.
  Senator HEFLIN. It would have had to have been the Encyclope-
dia Britannica.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I was told it was his contributors, but I will
move on to the great State of Vermont. Senator Leahy.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do not want to
delay, but when Judge Kennedy and my friend Al Simpson talk
about Hugo Black, I remember when I was in law school. I'm sure
you remember a lot of things about law school, we all do, but for
me one thing really stands out the most of all the matters in law
school. Because we were right here in town, Georgetown, the law
school, decided to have a luncheon inviting all the Supreme Court
justices. They all accepted on one condition: there not be a head
table. We were going to be in a bunch of small, round tables, and it
would be run by either the student bar or something of the law
school. They would draw lots, and different justices would sit at dif-
ferent tables. And that was the only way they would do it, so they
could sit with the students.
  So we drew lots, and I ended up sitting next to Justice Hugo
Black whom I had never met but just seen in the Court. And at the
last minute one of the other students was sick. My wife came with
me. And it was the most fascinating thing in 3 years of law school.
He had no idea I was going to sit there. I mentioned I was from
Vermont. And he said, oh yes. He said, Franklin--the first time he
said it, I didn't realize he meant, of course, President Roosevelt--he
said, Franklin sent me to Vermont to campaign during a contested
election.
  He told me the towns he went to--this was back in the 1930s.
Who he campaigned for. And what the votes were, the numbers.
                                               203

We went back and checked with the Secretary of State's office sub-
sequently, and he was absolutely right. Remember, they picked
their lots as they came in, and ended up at their particular tables.

  But during the course of the thing, a couple of times when ques-
tions came from different students, the hand went to the inside
pocket. Out came the copy of the Constitution. It was more worn
than the one I carry. And he would refer to it.

  And it was a remarkable experience. I felt that it was worth at
least one full year of law school, that one luncheon, just listening
to this man.

  Senator HEFLIN. He had a remarkable memory. He could remem-
ber the score of every tennis game that he beat me. [Laughter.]

  Senator LEAHY. Well, that really was not fair, him beating you,
because he was younger, wasn't he, Senator Heflin?

  But let me just go back, and I will try to brief but to go back to
this morning. You have been asked a lot of questions about your
views on privacy, and you have answered me and other Senators.

  And those answers appear to establish that you recognize the
protection of privacy as a value that the country should enforce in
constitutional litigation, even though the word, privacy, is not men-
tioned in the Constitution; even though the boundaries of privacy
or of the right to privacy may be unclear. Nobody is asking you to
say here today just where those boundaries are, nor I suspect from
your testimony, do you feel that anybody could say today just
where those boundaries are. Am I correct so far?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think that is correct, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. YOU have also said that there are other rights
not specified in the Constitution that you think the courts can en-
force. You have given some clue as to where you go to look for
those--to history, precedent, national values.
  Now, let us turn to an area where the issue is not what unenu-
merated rights should be recognized, but what the specific bill of
rights means, and that is the area of criminal law.
  You have ruled, as I read your cases, you have ruled for the de-
fendants in about a third of the criminal cases you have heard.
You have done it for the government in about two-thirds of the
cases. And going down--and I'm not suggesting anything by that
number. One of the nice things about being a prosecutor rather
than a defense attorney is that prosecutors win most of their cases,
if they are at all smart about what they bring, and defense attor-
neys, by the same nature, would have to lose most of them.
  You gave a speech at McGeorge Law School in 1981, a com-
mencement address, and you said, and I quote: "We encourage
debate among ourselves and with anyone else on the wisdom of the
rules we adopt. I question many of them myself. For instance, some
of the refinements we have invented for criminal cases are carried
almost to the point of an obsession. Implementing these rules has
not been without its severe costs."
  Now, are you referring when you talk about the point of obses-
sion to some of the detailed refinements that have been made in
the application, for example, of the fourth amendment to warrant-
les, searches?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I suppose I had the fourth amendment in
mind generally. This is pretty broad rhetoric.
                                                    204

  With the fourth amendment, we have, as I have indicated, ex-
tracted a tremendous cost for putting the system in place.

  Now that it is in place, it works rather well if it has a pragmatic
cast to it. That is the purpose of the good faith exception. Whether
the good faith exception is going to be so broad that it will swallow
up the rule remains to be seen.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, let me go into that a little bit. Because,
again, thinking of days when I was a prosecutor, I might chafe a
little bit at the idea of the exclusionary rule, but I also realized,
and anybody in law enforcement has to be honest enough to real-
ize, that absent the exclusionary rule, there are some groups
within law enforcement that would just push things as far as they
could.

  Most of the better trained, better equipped, either State or local
police, or groups like the FBI, have been able to work well within
the confines of the exclusionary rule.

  But on gooc! faith--well let me just back up and make sure I un-
derstand this. You do not feel the exclusionary rule by itself is a
mistake; is that correct?

  Judge KENNEDY. NOW that it is in place, I think we have had ex-
perience with it, and I think it is a workable part of the criminal
system.

  Senator LEAHY. But you do not
  Judge KENNEDY. If it is administered in a pragmatic and reason-
able way.
  Senator LEAHY. NOW, I realize this is jumping to quite a hypo-
thetical. But you do not see yourself as being one, back at the time
the exclusionary rule came in, of being the one to be at the fore-
front initiating the exclusionary rule?
  Judge KENNEDY. I am not sure I understood your question, Sena-
tor.
  Senator LEAHY, Well, you say, the exclusionary rule, now that it
is in, you accept it.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. But I take it by that you do not think you would
have been the one to have been the first person to have put the
exclusionary rule in?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I did not mean to imply that. I think that
the courts were generally concerned that there was a lack of any
enforcement of that provision.

  Senator LEAHY. Well, you said in the Harvey case, U.S. v. Harvey,
"the court has the obligation to confine the rule to the purposes for
which it was announced."

  How do you see those purposes?
  Judge KENNEDY. The purposes are in the nature of a deterrent.
The purpose of the exclusionary rule is to advise law enforcement
officers in advance that if they do not follow the rules of the fourth
amendment, the evidence they seize is not going to be usable.
  Now if the rule goes beyond that point, and a police officer in all
good faith, after studying the rule, makes a snap decision that a
warrant is valid, or a considered decision that a warrant is valid,
then I think the system ought to give some recognition to that rea-
sonable exercise of judgment on his part.
                                               205

  Senator LEAHY. But you do accept the idea that the expansion of
that good faith exception could, to use your term, swallow the rule?

  Judge KENNEDY. That could very well happen. And it remains to
stake out the proper dimensions of that rule--of that exception.

  Senator LEAHY. I understand. And is that an appropriate place
for the courts to act, in staking out those parameters?

  Judge KENNEDY. The courts must act there, because it is their
rule.

  Senator LEAHY. Thank you. There are areas where legislatively--
well, I don't want to go into that.

  Let me ask you about the sixth amendment right to counsel for
criminal defendants. Is that a principle that has been taken to the
point of obsession?

  Judge KENNEDY. NO. Although there may be cases where the
right--no, I think not.

  Senator LEAHY. Let me just make sure I understand. Betz v.
Brady, right to counsel in federal felony cases. You have no prob-
lem with that?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, no, and of course that is ^re-Gideon.
  Senator LEAHY. And you have no problem with Gideon?
  Judge KENNEDY. NO.
  Senator LEAHY. Even though that, some could say, erodes inde-
pendent State law. You have no problem with Gideon v. Wain-
wright?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, as a general proposition of law, it is ac-
cepted. I know of no really substantial advocacy for its change.
  Senator LEAHY. Miranda. How do you feel about Miranda?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, we are going down the line here. The Mi-
randa rule, it seems to me, again, we have paid the major cost by
installing it.
  We have now educated law enforcement officers and prosecutors
all over the country, and it has become almost part of the criminal
justice folklore.
  Senator LEAHY. And you do not have any problem with that
now?
  Judge KENNEDY. Criminal justice system folklore. Well, I think
that since it is established, it is entitled to great respect.
  Senator LEAHY. I suspect a sigh of relief might be given by most
police officers. I can't imagine a police officer anywhere in the
country who doesn't have the card.
  Judge KENNEDY. That is a remarkable example of the power of
the courts. And it is a reason for judges reminding themselves that
they should confine their rules to the absolute necessities of the
case.
  Senator LEAHY. DO you want to expand on that? Did they confine
themselves that time?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, the Miranda rule, as I said, is in place. It
was a sweeping, sweeping rule. It wrought almost a revolution.
  It is not clear to me that it necessarily followed from the words
of the Constitution. Yet it is in place now, and I think it is entitled
to great respect.
  Senator LEAHY. Well, one couldn't say it followed the absolute
necessities of that case, could you? Even with the confusion that
still existed following Escobedo?
                               206

Judge KENNEDY. That is right. I think it went to the verge of the
law.
Senator LEAHY. I often ask myself whether it would have if Esco-
bedo had not preceded it
Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
Senator LEAHY [continued]. Which caused all kinds of confusion.
I mention that only because there is the flip side of it. Escobido, I
thought anyway, left a lot of confusion as to just what you are sup-
posed to say and everything else. And Miranda, I happen to agree
with you, went way out there.
But I wonder if it was not a practical reality, because the Court
had to know that there was confusion from Escobedo. And the con-
fusion was laid down with the little card that one could carry out

of Miranda.                    "'*"' ~

Judge KENNEDY. Well, the merit of simple rules is that they are
workable. Their vice is that they may go beyond the necessities of
the case.
Senator LEAHY. And you think in this case they may have?
Judge KENNEDY. I think they may have, yes.
Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
Let me just ask you just one last area. It goes into what has to be
the hardest and loneliest duty of a Justice of the Supreme Court.
Now you act as a circuit justice. Every Justice of the Supreme
Court gets the ability to act as a circuit justice. You have authority
to act alone without the other justices on emergency matters that
come within the geographical circuit to which you have been as-
signed.
Now one of those matters, and it comes up often--it is almost im-
possible to go more than a couple of weeks without reading in the
news--that someone on death row has filed a petition seeking a
stay of execution.
Now, sometimes there are motions still pending in other courts
and so on. But let us take the instance of death warrants issued by
the governor. The lower courts have refused to suspend them.
Other courts are in recess. You're back home, and it is hours before
the petitioner or the prisoner is to be executed. You are at the end
of the line. The decision is up to you. You have got a few minutes
to make it.
Without going into a question of how you feel about the death
penalty, how do you approach a decision like that?
Judge KENNEDY. Well, we have had situations like that where we
have had single judges acting in single motions.
Senator LEAHY. In the ninth circuit?
Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir. The first thing you do is you take off
your coat, and you sit down at the desk and you begin working it
out. If there is merit to the claim you simply have to stop the exe-
cution until you get the information before you. You may end up
increasing the suffering, and the aggravation, and the anguish of
the defendant, but I just know of no other way to do it.
It happens with every single execution. The courts do not look
good. We act with the appearance of feverish haste. The defendant,
who has been sentenced to die, has his deadline extended again.
But the law of this country is that the Supreme Court of the
                                               207

United States exercises supervisory power over its circuits, and if
that is what the jurisdiction is, the jurisdiction must be exercised.

  Senator LEAHY. YOU are also saying that it is a case-by-case
thing. There are no mechanical rules you can follow?

  Judge KENNEDY. There are no mechanical rules. Now there have
been suggestions by task forces that we have fixed points for cut-
ting off any petitions, but the problem was always that there is
new evidence and new argument, and I just do not know how to
cut that off.

  Senator LEAHY. SO you do not agree with those task-force recom-
mendations?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, they have not even come out with any-
thing, that I have looked at, that looks very solid.

  Senator LEAHY. It would be kind of hard to do it, wouldn't it?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. We will now go to Senator Grassley,
and after that, Judge, we will give you an opportunity to get up
and stretch your legs, and break for 15 minutes.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, sir.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Kennedy, several times you have spoken of the tension be-
tween order, on the one hand, and liberty on the other. Constitu-
tional scholars often speak of the tension between our American
ideal of democratic rule and the concept of individual liberties, and
we often refer to this as the "Madisonian dilemma."
  The U.S. was founded on a Madisonian system, one that permits
the majority to govern in many areas of life, simply because it is
the majority. On the other hand, it recognizes that certain individ-
ual freedoms must be exempt from being trampled upon by the ma-
jority.
  The dilemma is that neither the majority nor minority can be
fully trusted to define the proper spheres of democratic authority
and individual liberty.
  First, could I have your assessment of this "Madisonian dilem-
ma." Would you agree that there is a tension there?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I am not--of course order and liberty can
be set up on a polar spectrum, but I think it was Mr. Justice Reed
who said that, "To say that our choice is between order and liberty
is an act of desperation." You may have order and liberty, and
without both you only have anarchy. That is my addition.
  Senator GRASSLEY. It is at least unavoidable?
  Judge KENNEDY. Pardon me?
  Senator GRASSLEY. The tension there is at least unavoidable?
  Judge KENNEDY. The tension does seem to be unavoidable.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, given the fact that there was very little
debate during the Constitutional Convention of 1787 over the whole
subject of the judicial branch, it seems somewhat unclear that the
framers envisioned the leading role for the judiciary in the resolu-
tion of this dilemma.
  After all, you will recall that Alexander Hamilton spoke of our
judicial branch as the "least dangerous" branch, having "neither
force nor will, only judgment."
                                      208
  And over time, of course, people have come to assume that it is
the job of the judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, to decide
how to resolve the tension.
  I assume that you agree with this role for the third branch, cor-
rect?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I am uncomfortable with saying that the
judicial branch has assumed a role that was not intended for it by
the Constitution. On the other hand, we have to recognize that im-
mediately after the Hamiltonian structure and the Madisonian--it
was really a Hamiltonian structure that was in place--we had a
Jeffersonian Bill of Rights added onto it.
  And so, from the outset, we built in a tension, and the framers
did not pay very much attention to the courts, Senator, and I am
not quite sure why that is. Perhaps it is because they never con-
ceived of the courts exercising the broad jurisdiction, the broad au-
thority to announce the law that they now have.
  I am just not sure why. It is fascinating. They distrusted the leg-
islature. You have bicameralism as a principal check, and, of
course, the President, and there are very few checks on the courts.
And so that is why it is important for the court to check itself.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I think you are telling me that there is a role
there for the Court in solving that, "Dilemma," and you see that as
a proper role?
  Judge KENNEDY. I do. Yes, sir.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Some judges and scholars believe that in re-
solving the "dilemma", that courts' obligation to the intent of the
Constitution are so generalized and remote, that the judges are
very free to create a Constitution that they think best fits into
today's changing society.
  Now I am not saying that that is your approach, but I want to
know what you think of that approach, because there are scholars
who believe it and there are people that practice it?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think when a judge defines, or articulates a
constitutional principle, he should find very, very convincing and
authoritative evidence to support his, or her, conclusion.
  Senator GRASSLEY. SO then you would take some exception to
some scholars' beliefs that the courts are free to create a Constitu-
tion that best fits today's needs?
  Judge KENNEDY. I could not accept that formulation as being
consistent with the Court's role in the constitutional system.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me illustrate what happens, then, when
Justices are not faithful to the original understanding of the Con-
stitution, due to over-generalization, like I just expressed.
  Justice Brennan has characterized the Constitution as being,
quote, "pervasively concerned with human dignity," unquote. From
this basic point, he creates a more general judicial function of "en-
hancing human dignity", even when it is contrary to the intent of
the framers.
  The problem with this theory is that every Justice's concept of
human dignity is very personal with the thought process of that in-
dividual.
  Judicial discretion becomes, "untethered." It becomes a matter of
each Justice adjudicating according to some personal bias or belief,
not the Constitution.
                                      209

  Would you agree with that?
  Judge KENNEDY. I would agree; I had an exchange with Senator
Humphrey just before the luncheon break in which we were dis-
cussing the categories that a judge might look to in order to deter-
mine whether there was a privacy claim, and it occurred to me, as
soon as I concluded my answer, that I had made an assumption but
had not stated it.
  And the assumption is we are doing this in order to determine if
this fits with the text and the purpose of the Constitution. That is
why we are doing it. We are not doing it because of our own subjec-
tive beliefs. We are not doing it because of our own ideas of justice.
  We are doing it because we think that there is a thread, a link to
what the framers provided in the original document.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Permit me to continue with the practical ap-
plication of Justice Brennan's theory of constitutional interpreta-
tion.
  Brennan finds that capital punishment, even for those who
commit the most heinous crimes, violates the Constitution, because
capital punishment, to him, falls short of his "constitutional vision
of human dignity."
  I disagree with Justice Brennan. First, because I believe that cap-
ital punishment is explicitly authorized by the Constitution. There
are four or five references to capital crimes or the loss of life in the
Constitution. I also have a problem with this type of constitutional
analysis--Justices generalizing from particular clauses and then
applying the generalization instead of the clauses.
  Can you comment on this theory of constitutional analysis--a
theory that permits the creation of rights so general as to give
courts no guidance in how to interpret them?
  Judge KENNEDY. AS you have stated it, that, it seems to me,
would be an illicit theory.
  Senator GRASSLEY. If I could, I would like to turn to the subject
of the legislative veto. You and I discussed it briefly in my office.
You know of my interest in it, and you have written on the subject
at least in one outstanding case.
  Perhaps your most significant ninth circuit opinion is that one
striking down the legislative veto in the Chadha case, in 1980. This
opinion was affirmed and expanded upon considerably by Chief
Justice Burger 3 years later.
  I have a real interest in the legislative veto. Senator DeConcini
of our committee, Senator Levin, and I and others have introduced
legislation to revive the legislative veto as a check on the bureauc-
racy that over-regulates our lives.
  And I am sure you are aware of all the business people in Amer-
ica who are complaining about too much government red tape, or
the taxpayer that has been abused by the IRS.
  So I have a series of questions on both the constitutional and
practical dimensions of the legislative veto.
  You would agree that federal agencies, which are routinely dele-
gated legislative or quasi-legislative power, may issue regulations
having the force and effect of law, without bicameral approval or
presidential signature, isn't that correct?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, that is the existing law, and we had a col-
loquy earlier this morning in which I indicated that this is a rather
                                      210
untidy area of the Constitution, so far as explaining the justifica-
tion and the constitutional bases for administrative agencies.

  I think most of us recognize their necessity, and there is no ques-
tion that agencies make law. We cannot avoid that fact. And so I
think I would say that I do agree that that is what happens.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Would you also agree that sometimes these
regulations can be excessive, burdensome, ill-advised, or just plain
wrong-headed?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, and I could say the same things about deci-
sions of courts. I agree.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, if agencies need not satisfy the article I
requirement when they pass something that is wrong-headed, or
however you want to characterize it, why, then, is the Congress's
mere reservation--just the mere reservation of a veto subject to a
more exacting article I test?

  Judge KENNEDY. I thought that this was a tremendously difficult
problem in the Chadha case. In the Chadha case, there was an ad-
judication of an alien's status, and he was granted leave to remain
in the United States on the grounds of extreme hardship.

  They made an adjudication in an individual case. One House of
the Congress, the House of Representatives, for no given reason, at-
tempted to cancel that and he was to be deported.

  We found, in the ninth circuit, that this was impermissible, that
this was an interference with the core function of the executive
branch, and also with the judicial branch.

  The opinion was written very narrowly because we reserved the
question of whether or not the Congress might have a veto mecha-
nism over the rulemaking functions of agencies. We did not think
that case was presented and we thought that that might present
different considerations.

  Now we recognized, of course, that any broader formulation than
the one we adopted would strike down 250 statutes, and we thought
that one was enough for that opinion.

  The Supreme Court did affirm our court, but I have to say, on a
different rationale. The Chief Justice, writing for the court, in-
voked the presentment clause and thereby I think pretermitted
any evaluation of a one-House veto over rulemaking, and we did
not come to that conclusion.

  But that is the law, and the Supreme Court has handed down the
Chadha case, and I think that legislative veto in one House, or
both House vetoes--

  Senator GRASSLEY. DO you think there is any way to validate the
legislative veto through the use of the doctrine of original intent?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. I tried to find that. You know, it can work
both ways for us, Senator. We do not always find the answer we
want. I read all of "The Federalist Papers." I read everything I
could find that Madison had written.

  I read what Jefferson had written, even though he was not at the
Convention. I concluded that, in this case, the veto mechanism did
violate the express intent of the framers.

  And it is a good example of the fact that the Constitution can
teach you something.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I think it is important that we look at what
the framers actually said in "The Federalist Papers" about the im-
                                         211

portance of bicameralism. But could they have intended this
result?

  It seems to me that the framers were very practical politicians.
They knew how to resolve political dilemmas, and that is why the
Federal Government was chartered with a great deal of flexibility.

  I do not think they could have foreseen in 1787 what would be
developing in a modern government; that there would be whole in-
dustries to regulate, consumers' and investors' interests to be pro-
tected, government benefits to be distributed, and so on. We could
make a longer list than you or I want to make, of all the things
that government is involved in today.

  If they had known this, do you really think that they would have
intended every bit of legislation to be done in this "civics-book"
fashion?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, you are asking me for my legal opinion.
In the case that we wrote, we found sufficient differentiation be-
tween an adjudicatory proceeding, on one hand, and generic rule-
making, which is what you are describing on the other, to confine
our case to the former. I thought that the situation you described,
with generic rulemaking, might present a different constitutional
problem.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Doesn't this really get us back to the issue of
how to find the original understanding

  Judge KENNEDY. I think it is a good example of it, Senator, and
it is one in which I thought the Constitution spoke rather clearly
against interference with the core function of another branch of
the government.

  I thought that the legislative veto in Chadha was violative of the
provision of separation of powers, and I made it clear that the leg-
islative veto, in other instances, might not violate that separation.

  What you had in Chadha was one of the highest officers in the
executive branch of the government, making a determination in
his executive capacity It was followed by court review or the possi-
bility of court review, and, for one House of Congress, without
reason, to simply upset that adjudication, seemed to me to violate
separation of powers, and we so held.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Kennedy, on at least a couple of occa-
sions, Justice Rehnquist has suggested that Congress has unconsti-
tutionally delegated responsibilities to federal agencies.

  As you know, with the creation of the "modern administrative
State', no federal statute that I know of, in the last 50 years, has
ever been invalidated on the grounds that the congressional delega-
tion to the agency was too broad.

  Do you think the Supreme Court ought to revive the so-called
"non-delegation" doctrine, which was last used to strike down some
of the New Deal legislation?

  Do you see any possibilities in that area, following Rehnquist's
view, at least?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, the non-delegation cases--and I think
that is the right term to give them--seem to be lying dormant,
don't they? And it is not clear, to me, the extent to which they still
have vitality.

  But these questions go very much to the core of the functioning
of the Congress, and I think that the Congress must give very, very

       90-878 0 - 3 9 - 8
                                         212

careful attention to how it can control the agencies that it creates.
I think that problem is pointed up by the opinion of the Supreme
Court, and of our own court, in Chadha.

   Senator GRASSLEY. I would like now to turn to a different area.
   Judge Kennedy, during the Bork hearings, much was made of
the fact that many law teachers opposed Judge Bork's nomination.
   In his writings, Judge Bork was very critical of the prevailing
academic establishment which tended to have a liberal political
philosophy.

   Bork was critical of law professors who, once realizing that they
could never convince democratic electorates to vote in their social
policies, turned to judges as a fast way to make society over to
their liking.

   Of course I suppose wanting judges to do "good things," simply
because the electorate will not do them, and do them quickly
enough, is not limited just to liberalism, I will admit.

  But I do sense an attitude among what I refer to as the "legal
elites" of this country, that when the legislative process "malfunc-
tions", judges ought to step in and deem themselves lawmakers.

  That is why I am so concerned about getting someone who be-
lieves in judicial restraint on the Supreme Court. You have been a
constitutional law professor for many years. Can you comment on
your perception of the ideology that eminates from most law
schools today?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it might be somewhat presumptuous of
me to characterize the legal education establishment nationwide in
just a few words, particularly because I am a part-time law profes-
sor.

  It is true that the law schools throughout the United States have
a tremendous influence on the way our system works. There is a
high degree of uniformity in law school teaching and in law school
curriculum, and this has some great benefits. To begin with, law-
yers are taught, in effect, a national language and this makes for a
very, very efficient legal system.

  The capitalistic system in this country, and the corporation
system, was built by the legal profession. They are important as
shipwrights were to England. And so the legal profession has, and
the legal education system has presented a tremendous contribu-
tion to the capitalistic system of this country with the legal talent
that it educates.

   Now, on the other hand, with this uniformity we can create per-
haps a lack of diversity, a lack of creativity. I don't see that in the
law schools. I think individual professors are willing and able to ex-
plore their own philosophies in their own terms. But the danger is
always there and I think law schools should be aware of it--the
danger of uniformity.

   Senator GRASSLEY. Well, regarding this "uniformity", tell me
whether or not you agree that the prevailing judicial philosophy
among many law professors is one that applauds judicial activism?

   Judge KENNEDY. I am not particularly comfortable in making
those judgments. I am certain that a number of law school profes-
sors do hold that view, but there are others who do not.
                                         213

  Senator GRASSLEY. Can I ask you then, in your own approach to
teaching, how have you gone about teaching your students the ac-
tivist decisions of the Warren and Burger courts.?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, as I indicated yesterday, I, within certain
limits of tolerance, do not care what ray students think. I do care
passionately how they think. The method is the important thing.
Each case must be justified according to logic, according to prece-
dent, and according to the law of the Constitution, and I insist that
each student do that for every case.

  Senator GRASSLEY. Could I ask just one last question?
  The CHAIRMAN. Surely.
  Senator GRASSLEY. I don't think it is going to take a lot of time.
  Have you challenged your students to question the rationale, the
reasoning, behind the Supreme Court's most expansionist of deci-
sions like the Miranda case, the Griswold case, and the Roe v.
Wade case?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. That is a routine part of the curriculum. It
is a routine part of the exercise. Because if those decisions cannot
stand rigor->us analysis, then they can be called in question.
  Senator G K A ^ ,U: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Tnar / rou.
  Before we b^e^k, Judge, as you can see, you are causing a dilem-
ma for some on this committee. You are not turning out to be quite
what anyboay thought.
  So with that, we will break for 15 minutes.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing will come to order.
  Judge, I realized as we broke you and others may have misunder-
stood my closing comment. What I meant to say was you are turn-
ing out not to be espousing the same philosophy that we heard
before, and that is disturbing to some, reassuring to others, and
confusing to still others; and you are turning out to be exactly
what you advertised to be--your own man--and that is what I
meant. I did not mean it in a way that was meant to be in any way
insulting. I meant it in a complimentary way when I said no one
knows for sure.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, thank you, Senator. I didn't take it in any
other respect.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, before I yield to my colleague from Ala-
bama, the Senator from Arizona would be the next to question, but
he is tied up in a conference that is going on now which will deter-
mine when and if we, the Senate and the House, ever adjourn prior
to Christmas. And he will, unless he is able to make it back prior
to the closing out of your testimony, he ask unanimous consent
that his questions be submitted for you to respond in writing.
  Judge KENNEDY. I would be pleased to do that, sir.
   [The questions for Senator DeConcini appear at p. 733.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, that will be done.
  Now, I yield to my friend from Alabama for his
  Senator LEAHY. Senator Heflin was gracious enough to say he
would yield to me just fcr one follow-up question on an earlier
point. I want to make it absolutely clear that I understood the
answer.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, fine. The Senator from Vermont,
                                      214

  Senator LEAHY. Judge Kennedy, on Miranda--aside from wheth-
er you would have written in the opinion "here are the four warn-
ings to give," do you agree that defendants should be warned of
their right to counsel and their right to free counsel if they cannot
afford it?

  Judge KENNEDY. That, of course, is the law and I know of no
strong argument for overruling the law that is now in place.

  Senator LEAHY. And you agree with that right?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I don't want to commit myself that I
wouldn't re-examine it, but I think it would take a strong argu-
ment to require me to change it.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you.
  Thank you very much, Senator Heflin.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin?
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Kennedy, you were a witness in a crimi-
nal prosecution against Judge Harry Claiborne, as I understand it.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator HEFLIN. Would you give us the circumstances pertaining
to your appearance as a witness, how you were called and basical-
ly, in a thumbnail sketch, the facts?
  Judge KENNEDY. Judge Claiborne was a U.S. District Judge in
the District of Nevada. He was indicted and tried for various
charges, one of which was the solicitation of a bribe from a former
client of his. The former client of his was one Conforte who operat-
ed a brothel in Nevada known as The Mustang Ranch.
  Claiborne had been Conforte's attorney when Conforte was
charged by the U.S. Government for tax evasion. Conforte was con-
victed. Claiborne was not his attorney on the appeal because be-
tween the time of the ending of the trial and the taking of the
appeal Claiborne became a judge.
  Conforte's case was appealed to the ninth circuit. There was a
three-judge panel consisting of Judge Tang, a United States Circuit
Judge from Arizona; Judge Palmieri, U.S. District Judge from the
Southern District of New York, sitting with us by designation; and
me, and I was the presiding member of the panel.
  During the oral argument of the case, the.panel was quite vigor-
ous in questioning the government, and it might have appeared to
someone who was in the audience that the panel was quite con-
cerned about the conviction and might be disposed to overturning
Conforte's conviction.
  The ninth circuit, because of its workload, historically has as-
signed district judges to sit with us on the circuit, and Claiborne
himself, now a judge, had been assigned to our circuit and had sat
with me a week earlier, and he subsequently sat with me a month
later.
  At the time he sat with me earlier, a week or so before, I was not
aware that the Conforte case would come up and I had no idea that
he was connected with it. When I sat with him a month later I sup-
pose I was aware of it, but we certainly did not discuss it.
  The allegation was that Claiborne solicited a bribe from his
client of $50,000--I never did read the indictment--of a certain
amount of money in order to influence the panel in its decision.
Each of the judges on the panel, including me, testified to the fact
                                         215

that Claiborne had not contacted us to influence the result of the
case.

  I did not hear the testimony. I was careful not to hear the testi-
mony or read the newspaper accounts or even read the indictment.
So my information on the case may not be even as good as someone
who read the newspapers. But, as I understand it, the testimony
was that Claiborne, the judge, had told Conforte, his former client,
that Claiborne had met with Judge Palmieri in Judge Palmieri's
apartment in New York. Judge Palmieri had never met the man,
and so testified. All of us testified that there had been no attempts
to influence us in the case.

  I did say that Judge Claiborne, in a telephone conversation, with
my clerk a party to the conversation, had asked when are you
coming out with the Conforte case and I had said the case is under
submission, which was a polite way of saying I am not talking
about the case.

  My testimony and the testimony of the other judges before the
U.S. district court, which was now trying Claiborne for the bribery
charge and for the tax evasion charges, was to outline the circum-
stances, to explain how the court of appeals works, to give back-
ground, and to give in a capsule--and to say what I have just told
you in a capsule form.

  The jury did not convict on any of the counts. It was a hung jury.
Subsequently, Judge Claiborne was retried just for some tax eva-
sion counts. They did not retry on this matter. And he was convict-
ed in court and subsequently was impeached by the House of Rep-
resentatives and convicted and removed by the U.S. Senate.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, you were called in by the government to
testify largely as to how it worked, to deny this matter pertaining
to approaches being made to the three-judge panel, and I suppose
as to the inquiry as to when the Conforte case would come down. Is
that basically correct?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
   Senator HEFLIN. And you testified as a government witness?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, I testified as a government witness in the
case.
   Senator HEFLIN. All right, sir. Now this brings up the issue of
impeachment proceedings and the independence of the judiciary.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
   Senator HEFLIN. I know that Senator DeConcini will probably
submit written questions to you pertaining to the Judicial Conduct
and Disability Act of 1980, as I believe it was called, which was
known as the DeConcini-Nunn bill, which deals with the activity of
judicial councils and the circuits and the Judicial Conference I be-
lieve, and ultimately perhaps Congress' role relative to the im-
peachment procedure.
   You opposed pretty vigorously in a 1978 speech to the ninth cir-
cuit judges the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
   Senator HEFLIN. And I know that Senator DeConcini has told me
that he appeared there with you and had quite a debate pertaining
to that matter. You and I are on the same side. I voted against it
and made a speech questioning its constitutionality when it was on
the floor of the Senate.
                                      216

  But basically, I think you felt like it had some constitutional im-
perfections. Do you want to explain your opposition to that bill?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, Senator. The bill, incidentally, in the form
that it was initially proposed, the Nunn-DeConcini bill, and the
form that we were concerned with in the Arizona debate was much
more far-reaching than the bill that eventually was adopted. And
that bill would have permitted a national committee of judges to
inquire into the fitness and the behavior of any sitting U.S. judge,
and I took, as did a number of my colleagues, the position that this
was a serious threat to the independence of the judiciary.

  The judges of the United States must be in a position where they
can agree with each other and also disagree with each other very
vigorously. And, if you are in a collegial body, and as you well
know in the Senate, and you must constantly disagree and debate
your colleagues, you need to rely on every bit of decorum, every bit
of tradition, every bit of courtesy, every bit of etiquette that you
can summon in order to maintain your professional friendship with
each other. And we felt that this was one of the serious defects of
Nunn-DeConcini. That it would set judge against judge in an arena
where previously the Constitution had committed that responsibil-
ity solely to the U.S. Senate, and those were some of the grounds of
our opposition to the bill.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, does testifying against a judge pit one
against another?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I suppose it does, although there, in the
context where we were called as witnesses for the government, it
was not as if we, the judges, were bringing the case.

  Senator HEFLIN. After the Claiborne matter was heard by the
Senate and he was impeached, a number of Senators felt that the
procedure was cumbersome and perhaps may even lack some due
process, in effect, the jurors being the members of the Senate, hear-
ing evidence, hearing arguments, absences, and many of them
having to do just like we are doing now, where people have to be at
conferences. Very important issues are up on the legislative basis.
They have their staff there but in some of the proceedings in the
Senate, some of the arguments were done in secret, in closed ses-
sion, and none of the staff was present.

  Do you have any thoughts on whether or not the impeachment
procedure that is followed under the Constitution needs changing
or needs some fine tuning, or a different method, perhaps looking
at what some of the States have done relative to the issue of disci-
pline and removal of judges?

  Judge KENNEDY. The framers were very deliberate about this de-
cision, as you well know, Senator, and what have there been?
Something like, I am tempted to say nine impeachments before
Claiborne. There have been ten impeachments and five convictions,
or something like that, in the history of the United States. There
have been about 10 or 12 other instances where the Senate was
about to convict and the judge resigned.

  I adhere to my view that the existing constitutional system
should be maintained. I am a little cautious about commenting at
length on your impeachment procedures for two reasons: one, be-
cause I haven't given the matter much thought; two, because there
                                         217

is a case in the courts now involving a judge and it is likely to
come before the Supreme Court.

  I think we can say that most of the commentary in the literature
has been that the design of the impeachment trial process and its
conduct is for the Senate to decide, guided by the managers in the
House, and that it is not judicially reviewable.

   Senator HEFLIN. YOU, in regard to the DeConcini-Nunn bill, or
the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act, have taken a pretty strong
position. Now, if you are confirmed and sitting on the Supreme
Court, what standard would you use in determining whether or not
to recuse yourself from cases that would come before you as a
judge on the Supreme Court if the issue of its constitutionality
were to be raised?

   Do you feel like there are certain standards that you would use
or follow on the issue of recusals pertaining to this issue and any
other issue in which you have firmly stated a position, in effect, in
a nonjudicial capacity.

   Judge KENNEDY. AS you know, Senator, there are two methods of
recusal. One is automatic recusal. Automatic recusal is required
under the statute whenever a judge has a financial interest, even
the ownership of one share of stock in a corporation that is a party
to a given case.

   So the first thing you do is you look at the statute--it is 18 USC
Section 455--to determine whether or not recusal is required.

   Then there is a more flexible standard in which the judge in his
discretion must recuse himself if his impartiality can reasonably be
perceived as being affected in the case.

   In the instance you give, I do not think the fact that I gave one
speech, even though it was a rather hard-hitting speech as I recall,
would disqualify me, because I think I could keep a fair and open
mind on the issue.

   Senator HEFLIN. Well, following that same line of reasoning, rel-
ative to issues like privacy or abortion, if you made a statement on
the issues here before this committee, in a similar manner that you
may have made in a discussion before the ninth circuit court of ap-
peals judges on the disability and the conduct matter, do you feel
like that that would in effect cause you to have to recuse yourself
under the perception ground?

   Judge KENNEDY. I realize that some Supreme Court nominees
have taken the position before this committee that the reason they
cannot answer the questions is they have to recuse.

   I have some trouble with that. I think the reason for our not an-
swering detailed questions with respect to our views on specific
cases, or specific constitutional issues, is something quite different.

   I think the reason is that the public expects that the judge will
keep an open mind, and that he is confirmed by the Senate because
of his temperament and his character, and not because he has
taken particular positions on the issues.

   The press is designed to keep politics and the judicial function
separate. It is not because we would be compelled to recuse our-
selves in cases.

   Senator HEFLIN. YOU have made speeches pertaining to victims'
rights, including a speech in March of this year to the Sixth South
Pacific Judicial Conference.
                                         218

  And you came up with a number of suggestions in effect how to
ease the problems that confront victims as they come before the
court.

  Would you comment on the role that victim rights have played
in the decisions you have written pertaining to criminal law.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. I cannot say at this time that I have given
any specific consideration to the new provisions which involve res-
titution and so forth.

  I misspoke. I sat on one case on whether or not restitution could
be required as a condition of parole.

  And I can't now recall if I authored the opinion or not. But we
held that the judge was within his discretion in insisting that as a
condition of parole, the offender make restitution to the victim.
That is an important part of the criminal process. The whole point
of awareness about the victims--is because we can expand our ho-
rizon somewhat.

  Sometimes the best way to impress upon the criminal defendant,
especially if he is a first time offender in a domestic violence type
of case, the best way to impress on him, on the defendant, the
moral wrong that he has committed, the best way to encourage
him to ask for the forgiveness of the victim, is to confront him or
her with the victim in the proceeding.

  And that has worked in lower courts. In the State courts, they
are doing this more than we are in the federal courts.

  Senator HEFLIN. I remember reading somewhere, maybe in one
of your speeches where you mentioned the Bernard Goetz case, I
believe, relative to the fact that he had been mugged previously
before this subway incident.

  That just comes to my mind. Do you recall what you had stated
on that in the past?

  Judge KENNEDY. I think it was in the New Zealand speech, in
which I indicated that the Goetz case had been a celebrated case,
and simply speculated on whether or not this particular person felt
abused by the system, not in anyway intending to excuse the act,
but just attempting to point out that victims are a real party in
interest in the crime.

  They have a certain standing in the proceeding. In many cases,
the ordeal the victim faces requires him or her to relive the cir-
cumstances of the crime.

  It is very, very difficult. And courts can do so much just by the
way of attitude, simple mechanical arrangements for the conven-
ience and the comfort of the victim, to make it known that the law
has an interest in the victim.

  Senator HEFLIN. YOU have been on the television cameras here.
There have been some feelings that the proceedings of the Supreme
Court of the United States should be televised.

  Some of the State courts have televised their proceedings. Some
make a distinction between appellate courts and trial courts.

  Do you have any initial reaction about TV in the courts?
  Judge KENNEDY. My initial reaction is that I think it might
make me and my colleagues behave differently than we would oth-
erwise.
                                         219

  Perhaps we would become accustomed to it after awhile. The
press is a part of our environment. We cannot really excise it from
the environment.

  But in the courtroom, I think that the tradition has been that we
not have that outside distraction, and I am inclined to say that I
would not want them in appellate court chambers.

  I once had a case--it was a very celebrated case--in the City of
Seattle. The courtroom was packed. We were at a critical point in
the argument. I was presiding.

  A person came in with all kinds of equipment and began setting
it up. He disturbed me. He disturbed the attorneys. He disturbed
everybody in the room.

  He was setting up an easel to paint our picture, which was per-
mitted. If he had a little Minox camera, we would have held him in
contempt.

  So the standard doesn't always work.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, there are certain courts that have given a
lot of study to this issue. And they impose certain restrictions such
as certain locations, certain places, no flash bulbs, etc.
  My observation has been that it can be done without interfering
with the court.
  It does cause a few of the justices to wear blue shirts and red ties
and dark suits. But that is not uncommon among judges anyway.
  I think there is one other question that I think should be asked
with Senator Kennedy here. You are not kin to Ted Kennedy in
any way are you?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, my father once announced that we prob-
ably were. And my mother came back the next evening and said,
you know, we are related. And she began to smile, and she said, on
the Fitzgerald side. So [Laugher.]
  So I'm not sure.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU would both be lucky if you were.
  The Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Judge Kennedy, when my first round expired, I was asking you
about the comment in your speech concerning the distinction be-
tween essential rights for a just system, or essential rights in our
constitutional system.
  And I am going to try to boil this question down, because I have
quite a few questions to ask, and there is not a great deal of time
remaining. And I know that Chairman Biden wants to finish up
this evening.
  The CHAIRMAN. Take as much time as you want. No Senator will
be cut off.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, in that event, I will take it slow and easy.
  The CHAIRMAN. Seriously. We are going to stay with the rounds.
Just like we did in every hearing I have ever conducted.
  That is, you have your half an hour. And if you have more ques-
tions, we will go to the next round, and narrow it down until there
are only one or two left.
  You can ask questions until you exhaust questions. And I have
never known you or anyone else in this committee to go on and ask
questions that were not warranted.
  So take all the time you need.
                                                    220

   Senator SPECTER. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   I think the questions |are warranted, and there are a number of
important areas I think (yet to be covered.
   You have Written criticizing legal realism. You make specific ref-
erence, in one of your speeches, to three very important decisions,
characterizing Baker v. Carr as being a matter where a revolution
was wrought, and Brown v. Board and Gideon v. Wainwright.
   And in response to questions here today, you have stated your
agreement with the Mapp v. Ohio search and seizure case and
Escobedo and Miranda on warnings.
  And my question is, do you agree generally with the decisions of
the Warren court, which have been characterized in many quarters
as being a product of legal realism?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, there are two different questions at least,
implicit in your statement.
  One is this question of legal realism altogether. And the second
is the decisions of the Warren Court.
  I have indicated that I thought the decisions of the Warren Court
went to the very verge of the law at least. We are talking about
criminal procedure cases, the ones we have mentioned. That we
have paid a heavy cost for imposing those rules on the criminal
system; that they seem to be part of our constitutional system now;
and that I think a very strong argument would have to be mounted
in order to withdraw those decisions.
  I do think the decisions have evinced on an explicit basis, the
fact that they involve pragmatic, preventative rules announced by
the Court, and the Court itself has admitted that they are not nec-
essarily demanded by the Constitution.
  Now, so far as legal realism is concerned, that is a philosophy
which I think has a substantial grip on much of the profession, on
much of the bench. And it is probably a description of how we feel
and how we behave.
  But I think it has very little part in constitutional interpretation.
Legal realism is really an offspring of the school of historicism,
which is the idea that no principle, no institution, no charter, no
rule, survives its own generation, its own time; that everything is
up for grabs every generation.
  I think that is just completely inconsistent with the idea of a
Constitution. I think it just has no place in constitutional law.
  Now, it is true that in the lower courts this may be a description
of our process. Because we look at economics, and we look at soci-
ology, et cetera, in order to make our judgments. But in those
areas, the Senate of the United States and the Congress can correct
us if we are wrong.
  Senator SPECTER. But as a generalization, you do believe, and I
think you answered this in the prior question, that the American
courts have not departed from their mandate, and that as the con-
tinuum or tradition of American constitutional law has evolved,
the onlv case you picked out that you disagreed with was Dred
Scott.
  So that as a generalization, the established precedents are satis-
factory.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I have been rather cautious about going
through a list of cases that I agree with and disagree with. Because
                                         221

I think that the position of a Supreme Court Justice has to be that
precedents can be reexamined and we cannot commit to the Senate
Judiciary Committee otherwise.

  Senator SPECTER. Let me turn now to the Chadha decision, Judge
Kennedy. And to the statement which I had referred to in my
opening, which was somewhat critical of the Congress.

  And that was your statement at the end of the speech, which you
made at the Stanford law faculty back in 1984. where you said, the
ultimate question then is whether the Chadha decision will be the
catalyst for some basic Congressional changes.

  My view of this is not a sanguine one. I am not sure what it will
take for Congress to confront its own lack of self-discipline, its own
lack of party discipline, its own lack of a principled course of action
besides the ethic of ensuring its reelection.

  Those are fairly strong statements. And I do not bring them up
to disagree, necessarily, but to ask you if that view of the legisla-
tive process, and that view of the Congress, played any part, how-
ever minor, in your decision in Chadha.

  Judge KENNEDY. I think the answer is no. That statement is rap-
idly rising to the top of the list of things I wish 1 hadn't put in my
speech notes.

  It was designed to trigger a discussion with the Stanford law fac-
ulty, which I am not sure we ever got to, about whether or not the
Congress of the United States is in a position, under the Constitu-
tion, to make essential and important changes in its operations so
that it can police and supervise the regulatory agencies that we
said it could not in Chadha.

  Certainly I did not in the speech or in the speech notes mean to
indicate any disrespect for the Congress or the legislative process.
It is really the heart of our democracy.

  And I have said here repeatedly that in my view, it is the Con
gress of the United States that must take the lead in ensuring the
fact and the reality that we have the basic conditions necessary for
the enjoyment of the Constitution.

  Senator SPECTER. Judge Kennedy, you have testified about your
firm conviction on the propriety of Marbury v. Madison and of judi-
cial review.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. There was a comment in a speech you made
before the Los Angeles Patent Lawyers Association back in Febru-
ary of 1982, which I would like to call to your attention and ask
you about,
  Quote: As I have pointed out, the Constitution, in some of its
most critical aspects, is what the political branches of the govern-
ment have made it, whether the judiciary approves or not.
  By making that statement, you didn't intend to undercut, to any
extent at all, your conviction that the Supreme Court of the United
States has the final word on the interpretation of the Constitution?
  Judge KENNEDY. That is my conviction. And I think that the
Court has an important role to play in umpiring disputes between
the political branches.
  Senator SPECTER. What did you mean by that, that in most criti-
cal aspects, it is what the political branches of the government
have made it, whether the judiciary approves or not?
                                               222

  Judge KENNEDY. I was thinking in two different areas. One in
this area of separation of powers and the growth of the office of the
presidency. The courts just have had nothing to do with that.

  Second, and even more importantly, is the shape of federalism. It
seems to me that the independence of the States, or their non-inde-
pendence, as the case may be, is really largely now committed to
the Congress of the United States, in the enactment of its grants-
in-aid programs, and in the determination whether or not to
impose conditions that the States must comply with in order to re-
ceive federal monies; that kind of thing.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, this is a very important subject. And I
want to refer you to a comment which was made by Attorney Gen-
eral Meese in a speech last year at Tulane, and ask for your reac-
tion to it.

  He said this: But as constitutional historian Charles Warren once
noted, what is most important to remember is that, quote, however
the Court may interpret the provisions of the Constitution, it is
still the Constitution which is the law, not the decisions of the
Court.

  By this, of course, Charles Warren did not mean that a constitu-
tional decision by the Supreme Court lacks the character of law.
Obviously it does have binding quality. It binds the parties in a
case, and also the executive branch for whatever enforcement is
necessary.

  But such a decision does not establish a supreme law of the land
that is binding on all persons and parts of government henceforth
and evermore.

  Do you agree with that?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I am not sure--I am not sure I read that
entire speech. But if we can just take it as a question, whether or
not I agree that the decisions of the Supreme Court are or are not
the law of the land. They are the law of the land, and they must be
obeyed.
  I am somewhat reluctant to say that in all circumstances each
legislator is immediately bound by the full consequences of a Su-
preme Court decree.
  Senator SPECTER. Why not?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, as I have indicated before, the Constitu-
tion doesn't work very well if there is not a high degree of volun-
tary compliance, and, in the school desegregation cases, I think, it
was not permissible for any school board to refuse to implement
Brown v. Board of Education immediately.
  On the other hand, without specifying what the situations are, I
can think of instances, or I can accept the proposition that a chief
executive or a Congress might not accept as doctrine the law of the
Supreme Court.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, how can that be if the Supreme Court is
to have the final word?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, suppose that the Supreme Court of the
United States tomorrow morning in a sudden, unexpected develop-
ment were to overrule in New York Times v. Sullivan. Newspapers
no longer have protection under the libel laws. Could you, as a leg-
islator, say I think that decision is constitutionally wrong and I
                                                    223

want to have legislation to change it? I think you could. And I
think you should.

  Senator SPECTER, Well, there could be legislation
  Judge KENNEDY. And I think you could make that judgment as a
constitutional matter.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, there could be legislation in the hypothet-
ical you suggest which would give the newspapers immunity for
certain categories of writings.
  Judge KENNEDY. But I think you could stand up on the floor of
the U.S. Senate and say I am introducing this legislation because
in my view the Supreme Court of the United States is 180 degrees
wrong under the Constitution. And I think you would be fulfilling
your duty if you said that.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, you can always say it, but the issue is
whether or not I would comply with it.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I am just indicating that it doesn't seem
to me that just because the Supreme Court has said it legislators
cannot attempt to affect its decision in legitimate ways.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, but the critical aspect about the final
word that the Supreme Court has is that there is a significant
school of thought in this country that the Supreme Court does not
have the final word. That the President has the authority to inter-
pret the Constitution as the President chooses and the Congress
has the authority to interpret the Constitution as the Congress
chooses, and there is separate but equal and the Supreme Court
does not have the final word.
  And, if Marbury v. Madison is to have any substance, then it
seems to me that we do have to recognize the Supreme Court as
the final arbiter of the Constitution, just as rockbed.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, as I have indicated earlier in my testimo-
ny, I think it was a landmark in constitutional responsibility for
the Presidents in the Youngstown case and the Nixon case to in-
stantly comply with the Courts decisions. I think that was an exer-
cise of the constitutional obligation on their part. I have no prob-
lem with that at all.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, there has been compliance because it has
been accepted that the Supreme Court is the final arbiter. I just
want to be sure that you agree with that proposition.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, but there just may be instances in which I
think it is consistent with constitutional morality to challenge
those views. And I am not saying to avoid those views or to refuse
to obey a mandate.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I think it is fine to challenge them. You
can challenge them by constitutional amendment, you can chal-
lenge by taking another case to the Supreme Court. But, as long as
the Court has said what the Court concludes the Constitution
means, then I think it is critical that there be an acceptance that
that is the final word.
  Judge KENNEDY. I would agree with that as a general proposi-
tion. I am not sure there are not exceptions.
  Senator SPECTER. But you can't think of any at the moment?
  Judge KENNEDY. Not at the moment.
  Senator SPECTER. Okay. If you do think of any between now and
the time we vote, would you let me know?
                                               224

  Judge KENNEDY. I will let you know, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Let me pick up some specific issues on execu-
tive power and refer to a speech that you presented in Salzburg,
Austria, back in November of 1980, where you talk about the ex-
tensive discretion saying, "The blunt fact is that American Presi-
dents have in the past had a significant degree of discretion in de-
fining their constitutional powers."
  Then you refer to, "The President in the international sphere
can commit us to a course of conduct that is all but irrevocable de-
spite the authority of Congress to issue corrective instructions in
appropriate cases." Then you refer to President Truman, saying he
committed thousands of troops to Korea without a congressional
declaration. And then you say, "My position has always been that
as to some fundamental constitutional questions it is best not to
insist on definitive answers."
  And you say further, "I am not one who believes that all of the
important constitutional declarations of most important constitu-
tional evolutions come from pronouncements of the courts."
  And, without asking you for a specific statement on the War
Powers Act, that is a matter of enormous concern that engulfs us
with frequency. Major questions arise under the authority of the
Congress to require notice from the President on covert operations
coming out of the Iran-contra hearings. What is the appropriate
range of redress for the Congress? Do we cut off funding for mili-
tary action in the Persian Gulf? Do we cut off funding for covert
operations? Are these justiciable issues which we can expect the
Supreme Court of the United States to decide?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, whether or not they are justiciable issues,
of course, depends on the peculiar facts of the case, and I would not
like to commit myself on that. But the very examples you gave in-
dicate to me that there are within the political powers of the Con-
gress, within its great arsenal of powers under article I of the Con-
stitution, very strong remedies that it can take to bring a chief ex-
ecutive into compliance with its will, and this is the way the politi-
cal system was designed to work.
  The framers knew about fighting for turf. I don't think they
knew that term, but they deliberately set up a system wherein
each branch would compete somewhat with the other in an orderly
constitutional fashion for control over key policy areas. And these
are the kinds of things where the political branches of the govern-
ment may have a judgment that is much better than that of the
courts.
  Senator SPECTER. But isn't it unrealistic, Judge Kennedy, to
expect the Congress to respond by cutting off funds for U.S. forces
in the Persian Gulf? If you accept the proposition that the Presi-
dent can act to involve us in war without a formal declaration, and
the President and the Congress ought to decide those questions for
themselves, isn't that pretty much an abdication of the Supreme
Court's responsibility to be the arbiter and the interpreter of the
Constitution?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I don't know if it is an abdication of re-
sponsibility for a nominee not to say that under all circumstances
he thinks the Court can decide that broad of an issue. If the issue
is presented in a manageable judicial form, in a manageable form,
                                         225

I have no objection to the Court being the umpire between the
branches.

  On the other hand, I point out that having to rely on the courts
may infer, or may imply an institutional weakness on the part of
the Congress that is ultimately debilitating. It seems to me that in
some instances Congress is better off standing on its own feet and
making its position known, and then its strength in the federal
system will be greater than if it had relied on the assistance of the
courts.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you testified earlier that you could say
standing enhanced by legislative enactment.

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER. And some of the legislation is now pending to
give broader standing as was given in Buckley v. Valeo, so that you
would--obviously, you have to reserve judgment, but you could see
an appropriate role for a judicial decision on these tough constitu-
tional questions, notwithstanding the generalizations that I just
read to you?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think so. Dean Choper, of the University of
California at Berkeley, has a book in which he proposes the idea
that the Court should always withdraw from any dispute between
the branches. He would, I think, say Youngstown is wrong, that the
Nixon tapes case is wrong, and I disagree with that. I think there
is a role for the Court.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I think that is an important proposition,
and I think it may well be before you, and I obviously don't ask for
any commitments or any statements on it except to hear what one
Senator has to say about it and what is the prevailing view in the
Senate, that at some point we feel the War Powers Act has to be
tested. That it has been a very important response to the fact of
life that the United States is involved in wars without declarations,
that the constitutional authority of the Congress has eroded there,
the impracticality of cutting off funds once there is a military
action. You note the commitment of troops in Korea. There has
been many others.
  And I was just a little concerned about your statements that the
executive defines its own authority and your statements about the
courts keeping hands off. And I am assured, as you have testified
today, that there may be an appropriate role for the Supreme
Court of the United States, depending on the specific factual pres-
entation.
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes. And, as I think we would both agree, much
of what I was saying there was a recitation of simple facts. The
Presidency has grown to have power of tremendous proportions.
  Senator SPECTER. Judge Kennedy, I would like now to refer to a
number of cases where I have certain concerns where you have
reached conclusions as a matter of law which seem to me to under-
cut the fact-finding process. These are cases which you and I dis-
cussed when we talked informally in my office sometime ago.
  The case of the City of Pasadena School Board, quite a controver-
sial matter, was decided in an opinion which you wrote, or you
wrote a concurring opinion after a district court judge had sought
to retain jurisdiction. And the memorandum opinion of the district
court judge sets forth an extensive sequence of factual findings exT
                                                    226

pressing a concern about the conduct of the Board, election prom-
ises, which the district judge, the finder of fact, concluded required
the district court to retain jurisdiction.

  And, without going through them at great length, there boil
down in footnote 19 where the district court judge found "a majori-
ty of the defendants [those on the school board] have acted with un-
yielding zeal and overt antipathy to the desegregative concept of
the Pasadena Plan. Promising return to neighborhood schools with
a recognition that it cannot be accomplished without resegregation
of Pasadena schools is bad faith not only to the principles of consti-
tutional duty but also to their own constituency."

  One comment that you made in your opinion that I have a ques-
tion about, one I read to you when we met privately about 10 or 12
days ago, where you said at 611 Fed. 2nd at 1247, "Where the
Court retains jurisdiction a board may feel obliged to take racial
factors into account in each of its decisions so that it can justify its
actions to the supervising court. This may make it more, rather
than less, difficult to determine whether race impermissibly influ-
ences board decisions. Where the subject is injected artificially into
the decision process and the weight that racial considerations
might otherwise have had is more difficult to determine."

  And my question to you before, and I repeat now, what is wrong
with that, especially in the context of the very strong findings of
fact by the lower court judge of bad faith by the school board?

  Judge KENNEDY. This case had a long history. It went to the Su-
preme Court on more than one occasion. It was in our court on I
guess four different occasions. And this particular aspect of it pre-
sented one of the most troubling areas of desegregation laws, and
that is when does a court's supervision cease?

  In this case the City of Pasadena had, in compliance with a court
decree, been implementing a plan that was certified ultimately by
the Supreme Court to be a plan for a unitary district, which is the
parlance for saying a district that complies in all respects with a
desegregation decree.

  The findings of the Supreme Court of the United States and of
our court--and uncontradicted by the district court--were that the
district had met full compliance for a period of more than 2 years.
Now the question was how long does the district court's supervision
last? This was a case in which the district court judge at one time,
in response to that question from an attorney, had said that dis-
trict court supervision will last as long as I live.

  Now, at some point school districts must assume responsibilities
for their own affairs. At some point the jurisdiction of the court
must cease. At some point we must allow the school districts to
again resume charge of their affairs. And, if there is a further vio-
lation of the Constitution of the United States, an action can then
again be implemented.

  We concluded that because there had been full compliance, be-
cause a unitary district had been achieved, the court was acting
improperly in looking at election campaign promises and election
rhetoric in order to justify its continued decrees.

  What happened here was there were some schools--I forget if
they called them magnet schools or neighborhood schools--that
had been proposed in a district in which unitary compliance had
                                               227

been achieved, and we simply ruled that the district had to again
stand on its own feet, and that if there was a violation there could
again be a suit.

  It is a very difficult area of the law to determine how to with-
draw. The very fact that the court is involved affects the equation.

  Senator SPECTER. HOW much were you influenced by the judge's
statement that he would keep jurisdiction as long as he would live?
Did you consider having the judge replaced in the case, if that
statement really amounted to a declaration of a bias or prejudice?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it didn't amount to a declaration of bias
and prejudice but it indicated the difficulties that the district court
had in extricating itself from the decree of the court. And we felt
that the school district having been in good faith full compliance
for a period of years was entitled to a release of the jurisdiction of
the court.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, but that is the question. The question is
whether the school board was in compliance. You note in your
opinion, "The district court found that the board has acted and
failed to act with the same segregative intent that this court found
in 1970," and the memorandum opinion of the board is replete with
facts and, of course, we know that the lower court is in a better
position to find the facts, especially questions of intent. And it was
a little hard for me to follow the conclusion as a matter of law that
the lower court was wrong in the face of those very extensive factu-
al findings.

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, we looked at the findings and concluded
otherwise I think, Senator. I agree with you that the fact-finding
functions of a district court cannot be usurped by an appellate
body. On the other hand, they have to fit the ultimate remedy the
court gave, and in this event we thought that the Pasadena School
District should be restored to its own status.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, the other two cases that I want to talk to
you about, and there are many more but I have limited it to three
cases, are the AFSCME v. State of Washington case

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. And here again there were very
strong factual findings by the lower court. The district court said at
page 863 of 578 Fed. supp., "Evidence which when considered as a
whole shows discriminatory intent includes the historical contacts
out of which the challenge to failure to pay arose," and later in the
district court's opinion the comment is made, "There is little doubt
that the State produced evidence that the unlawful discrimination
was other than in bad faith the Manard and Norse decisions would
have persuaded this court that back pay would not have been in an
appropriate remedy."
  Then going on to say, "Rather the persistent and intransigent
conduct of defendant in refusing to pay plaintiffs indicates bad
faith."
  This is a very complicated case and there is a great deal involved
and you commented on it to some extent, and I don't cite it really
to--well, I cite it on the substantive law, but really more particu-
larly--and my time is up, and let me just finish it and then give
you a chance to respond.
                                                    228

   One of your concluding statements, as it appears on 77 Fed. 2nd
at 1408, "Absent the showing of discriminatory motive, which has
not been made here, the law does not permit the Federal courts to
interfere in a market-based system for the compensation of Wash-
ington's employees."

   And, in this one, like the City of Pasadena case, I question in
terms of your coming to a conclusion as a matter of law which
overturns very strong findings of fact by a lower court in the civil
rights area.

   Judge KENNEDY. I suppose I would disagree with your conclusion
about very strong findings, in that I don't think the findings at all
related to the remedy. I don't think the findings at all related to
the violation that the district court findings were--the part you
quoted was simply conclusory. The actual findings were that the
State of Washington had done a comparable worth study. The
actual findings were that the State of Washington had advertised
in some cases for male-only jobs and that it had ceased that. And
we simply found that as a matter of law this was wholly insuffi-
cient to say that Washington was violating the law by not adopting
a comparable worth scheme for every one of its female employees.

  So I would think that those are fact findings simply are not re-
lated to the judge's conclusion, and so I would disagree with the
characterization as strong.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Judge Kennedy. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator Byrd.
  Senator BYRD. Judge Kennedy, I am sure you feel you have had a
very fair hearing here, and that the questions have been tempered
and incisive, to the point; am I correct?
  Judge KENNEDY. YOU are certainly correct, Senator.
  Senator BYRD. I am pleased to have had an opportunity to meet
with you privately. I am sure that everybody else on here probably
have done the same thing. But based on my own private conversa-
tions with you, and you didn't promise me anything or commit to
anything in those conversations, and I didn't ask you to, and based
on what I have read and heard and my observations of the hearing,
I don't believe you are in any trouble.

  I am inclined to vote for you, barring some unforeseen happen-
ing. I am a conservative when it comes to the courts. Probably a
liberal on some matters and moderate in others. I hope I am not an
extremist in anything.

  Disraeli said that he was a conservative to conserve all that was
good in his constitution and that the radicals would do all that was
bad. I believe in the death penalty. I believe it is constitutional.
The Constitution refers to capital crimes.

  What are your comments, or would you have any on the subject?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, with reference to the death penalty, Sena-
tor, I have taken the position with your colleagues on the commit-
tee that the constitutionality of the death penalty has not come to
my attention as an appellate judge and that I will not take a posi-
tion on it, but that if it is found constitutional I think it should be
efficiently enforced.
                                      229
  Senator BYRD. We had a little difficulty with another nominee
for this position recently in connection with congressional standing,
and I was left to believe that the Congress would not be allowed in
the Court in the event there were disputes between the legislative
branch and the executive on that occasion.
  Perhaps others have asked questions on this subject, but would
you care to indicate whether or not you feel that there is--do you
have any problem with Congress being able to get standing to re-
ceive justice in the Court if you become a member of the Supreme
Court and there is a serious question that arises between the exec-
utive branch and the legislative and the country's national security
interests, let's say, are involved?
  Judge KENNEDY. In a colloquy that we had earlier this afternoon,
Senator
  Senator BYRD. NO, I did not hear the colloquy.
  Judge KENNEDY. Right. I mean one that I had before you came
in. I made it clear that in my view it is quite appropriate for the
Court to act as an umpire between the political branches of the
government. The circumstances in which a case that meets the
case or controversy doctrine are ones that we would have to exam-
ine in a particular case. I think that in the Youngstown case, the
steel seizure case, and the Nixon tapes case, the Court acted com-
pletely appropriately in defining and determining the bounds of
power between the two political branches. I think that is a com-
pletely appropriate role for the Court to play.
  Senator BYRD. Why would you want to be a Supreme Court Jus-
tice? Has anybody asked you that question yet?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think Senator Leahy asked me that question.
  Senator BYRD. Well, then you don't need to answer it for me.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I would be pleased to tell you, Senator,
that I am committed to constitutional rule and I think every
person in this Senate is, and I think every American is; and I want
to do the best I can to honor that commitment.
  Senator BYRD. I suppose you have been queried as to your posi-
tion on judicial restraint, how you view the responsibilities and
role of the Supreme Court under the Constitution.
  Judge KENNEDY. I have, Senator, and I believe the role of the Su-
preme Court must be to maintain its independence but at all times
to obey the Constitution and the law.
  Senator BYRD. And I suppose you would view the Court not as a
traveling constitutional convention?
  Judge KENNEDY. Absolutely.
  Senator BYRD. Or as an erstwhile legislative branch?
  Judge KENNEDY. Not at all, Senator. I would not so view it.
  Senator BYRD. Well, what is the role of the Supreme Court? Is it
merely that of interpreting the law and the Constitution and apply-
ing the law and the Constitution to the facts of the case, or is it
that of blazing new trails and, in essence, changing the laws, enact-
ing the laws, enacting new laws?
  I am sure you have probably been asked these questions already,
and I apologize to you. You need not elaborate at great length on
my questions if others have asked them because I will be reading
the hearing.
                                               230

  Judge KENNEDY. Senator, the Court can use history in order to
make the meaning of the Constitution more clear. As the Court has
the advantage of a perspective of 200 years, the Constitution be-
comes clearer to it, not more murky. The Court is in a superior ad-
vantage to the position held by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall when he
was beginning to stake out the meanings of the Constitution in the
great decisions that he wrote.

  And this doesn't mean the Constitution changes. It just means
that we have a better perspective of it. This is no disparagement of
the Constitution. It is no disparagement of the idea that the inten-
tions and the purposes of the framers should prevail. To say that
new generations yield new insights and new perspectives does not
mean the Constitution changes. It just means that our understand-
ing of it changes.

  The idea that the framers of the Constitution made a covenant
with the future is what our people respect and that is why they
follow the judgments of the Supreme Court, because they perceive
that we are implementing the understanding of the framers. I am
committed to that principle.

  Senator BYRD. HOW do you view previous decisions, precedent,
the doctrine of stare decisis? Do you feel that precedent should be
given a great deal of weight? Is precedent supreme, or is precedent
to be given a strong place but in the light of changing circum-
stances, perhaps? That you would not have any great difficulty in
overriding precedent?

  Judge KENNEDY. AS you know, Senator, stare decisis has an ele-
ment of certainty to it, which most Latin phrases do, but it really
is a description of the entire legal process. Stare decisis is the guar-
antee of impartiality. It is the basis upon which the case system
proceeds, and without it we are simply going from day to day with
no stability, with no contact with our past.

  And so stare decisis is very important, but, obviously, if a case is
illogical, if it cannot be reconciled with all of the parallel prece-
dent, if it appears that it is simply out of accord with the purposes
of the Constitution, then it must be overruled.

  Senator BYRD. Well, I congratulate you again, and I think that in
due time the Senate will consider your nomination. I can assure
you that your nomination will be given a very fair and thorough
hearing in the course of Senate debate based on your testimony
thus far and your conduct in these hearings and my perception
based on what I have read and heard and seen and what I have
listened to among my colleagues, I have a feeling that you are
going to have the opportunity to don those robes and sit on that
Court. And if the good Lord does his will and nothing happens to
keep you from doing that, I certainly want to extend the hope that
you will be there a long time. I have a favorable impression from
the standpoint of my own measurements, my own standards, as one
who believes that the legislative branch under this system was cre-
ated to do the legislating and that the branches are equal, coordi-
nate. I believe strongly in our system of checks and balances, and I
believe the Court has the role of interpreting the laws and the Con-
stitution. I think the judges should exercise restraint and not allow
themselves to get over into the realm of the legislative branch.
                                      231
  And having said that, I will exercise a little restraint, Mr. Chair-
man, and say no more, except thank you for the hearing. I would
like to thank my colleagues for the dedication that they always
pursue in hearing the nominees, the questions that they ask, the
preparations that they make in advance of the hearings. And
again, to compliment you and wish you and your family a happy
holiday season.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you for those gracious remarks, Mr.
Chairman, and for the courtesy that all of your colleagues have
shown me. The advise and consent process is a very meaningful
one to me.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator.
  The Senator from New Hampshire.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Back to judicial restraint, Judge, if you don't
mind.
  Judge KENNEDY. Not at all, Senator.
  Senator HUMPHREY. The advise and consent role is very impor-
tant. We exercise it only once with each nominee.
  I am not fully satisfied that I have your views in this area pgr-
fectly in focus. Just how seriously do you view the absence of judi-
cial restraint, which I will call judicial activism? How seriously do
you view that as misconduct by judges?
  If you were a Senator, would you reject, refuse to confirm a can-
didate to the bench who rejected the philosophy and the doctrine of
judicial restraint?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, it is not clear to me that a Senator can
always reject a nominee because of some disagreement with philos-
ophy. But, if you have a nominee who tells you that he or she is
not bound by the law of the Constitution, that he or she is superior
to precedent, that he or she has some superior insights into the
great principles that made this country devoted to constitutional
rule, then I think you could very easily reject that nominee.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes, that would be easy but it doesn't
present itself that way, as you know.
  Judge KENNEDY. I think there may be a problem in that I am not
sure that, in the last 20 years, any nominee has not embraced the
doctrine of judicial restraint because that is a phrase that is rather
simple to adopt, and the question is whether or not it is given
meaning and given application in the deliberative approach that
the judge brings to his or her work. I can point to my record--12
years of opinions in which I think I indicate that careful approach.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Earlier you mentioned facts which judges
might consider in determining what activities are covered by the
privacy right. You mentioned things such as the essentiality of the
right to human dignity, the inability of a person to manifest his or
her own personality, the inability of the person to obtain his or her
own self-fulfillment.
  It seems to me that such broad subjective concepts are an invita-
tion, or can certainly lead to the exercise of political power, raw
political power that you spoke of disparagingly in your Stanford
speech.
  Judge KENNEDY. They are unless they are used with the view to
determining what the Constitution means. The framers had--by
that I mean those who ratified the Constitution--a very important
                                                    232

idea when they used the word "person" and when they used the
word "liberty." And these words have content in the history of
Western thought and in the history of our law and in the history of
the Constitution, and I think judges can give that content. They
cannot simply follow their own subjective views as to what is fair
or what is right or what is dignified. They can do that so that they
can understand what the Constitution has always meant.

  Senator HUMPHREY. I remain uneasy about what you said regard-
ing the ninth amendment. You said, it seems to me, the Court is
treating it as something of a reserve clause to be held in the event
the phrase "liberty" and the other spacious phrases in the Consti-
tution appear to be inadequate for the Court's decision.

  I don't know why you choose to be so vague, and in my mind
so--leave things in such a worrisome suspension, when the Court
has never used the ninth amendment to invent new rights. Indeed
one of the most liberal of the liberals, William O. Douglas, said in
his concurring opinion in Dole that the ninth amendment obviously
does not create federally enforceable rights, and against that find-
ing by Justice Douglas, against the history of the Court, against the
clear--there are few amendments that have a clearer historical
context, where the intent is clearer, than the ninth amendment.

  And now the thing has been reversed--if we apply the doctrine
of incorporation illogically to it, and you seem to hold open that
possibility, the thing is reversed in its intent

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator HUMPHREY [continuing]. Intended application, and now
you are saying that the Court is holding it in reserve. In case it
can't find something else in the Constitution, why it always has
this to fall back on.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, to begin with, don't shoot the messenger. I
am describing the jurisprudence of the Court as I think it exists.
The Court has simply not had the occasion to reach the ninth
amendment for the resolution of its cases, and it seems to me inap-
propriate for me to announce in advance what its meaning is. I
have indicated what I think, what I understand its original purpose
to be, which was actually a disclaimer that the Constitution of the
United States was intended to constrain the States in any respect
in the adoption of their Bills of Rights.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, do you find a--do you consider the
intent of the ninth amendment to be pretty clear?

  Judge KENNEDY. NO.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Even given the historical----
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, the purpose of it is as I believe I have de-
scribed it.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, what is the difference between the
purpose and the intent?
  Judge KENNEDY. Its meaning is somewhat unclear. The reason
for Madison's using it as a device is not completely clear. I think
the explanation I gave is the best one, but that is not completely
clear.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Well, his words are pretty clear on the
point, if I just knew where to find them. I am getting paper fatigue
at this point. You have got fatigue yourself I am sure. Here it is.
                                                   233

  He said that "It has been objected also against the Bill of Rights
that by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power it
would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enu-
meration, and it might follow by implication that those rights
which were not singled out were intended to be assigned into the
hands of the general government and were consequently insecure."

  And so this was a clarification on the part of the Federalists that
even though certain rights were enumerated that didn't mean that
everything else was denied to the States.

  Judge KENNEDY. I think that that is the most plausible interpre-
tation of the amendment.

  Senator HUMPHREY. Jumps right out at you. Couldn't be clearer.
  And then I am concerned likewise by your vagueness, unwilling-
ness to recognize 200 years or so of validation of capital punish-
ment. The Court has never, even in Furman the Court has never
suggested that capital punishment is unconstitutional per se, fun-
damentally. Why are you not willing to--why are you so vague on
a point that is so well settled?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I guess we have a disagreement as to
whether or not it is well settled, Senator. These decisions are very
close. Some Justices have indicated that it is unconstitutional, and
I simply think that I should not take a specific position on a consti-
tutional debate of ongoing dimension.
  I have indicated that in my view if held constitutional it should
be swiftly and efficiently enforced. I recognize also that capital
punishment is recognized in the Constitution, in the fifth amend-
ment.
  Senator HUMPHREY. I am sorry. I couldn't hear that last sen-
tence.
  Judge KENNEDY. Capital punishment is recognized in the Consti-
tution.
  Senator HUMPHREY. And you said something else that I didn't
hear.
  Judge KENNEDY. In the fifth amendment.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes.
  In your Stanford speech you point out that in the post-Griswold
privacy cases the debate shifts to the word "privacy" rather than
to the constitutional--to a constitutional term such as "liberty."
  What is the significance in that statement? What are you trying
to say?
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, I was trying to indicate that simply be-
cause we find a new word we don't avoid a whole lot of very diffi-
cult problems. It is not clear to me that substituting the word "pri-
vacy" is much of an advance over interpreting the word "liberty,"
which is already in the Constitution.
  And I indicated that, to illustrate that, that the Convention on
Human Rights, which contains the word "private," produced a case
which had many of the same issues in it that we would have to
confront, and so that the woru "privacy" should not be something
that convinces us that we have much certainty in this area.
   Senator HUMPHREY. Are you saying that these privacy cases
would be better dealt with under the liberty clause?
  Judge KENNEDY. That is why I have indicated that I think liber-
ty does protect the value of privacy in some instances.
                                                    234

   Senator HUMPHREY. YOU would prefer then to deal with privacy
cases under the liberty clause?

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
   Senator HUMPHREY. AS opposed to dealing with them under ema-
nations of penumbrae?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Ever seen an emanation? That is a real term
of art, isn't it? I am not a lawyer. Had that ever been used before?
  Judge KENNEDY. Certainly not in a constitutional case.
  Senator HUMPHREY. That is really a, that one is really a shame-
less case of
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, excuse me.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Yes?
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from West Virginia would like to
ask you a question.
  Senator BYRD. Did you say emanation? To emanate? What is the
word you are referring to?
  Judge KENNEDY. Emanations.
  Senator BYRD. Emanations?
  Judge KENNEDY. Emanations, yes. "Penumbras and emanations"
was the phrase used in the Griswold case.
  Senator BYRD. Thank you. That word is not in the Constitution,
though, is it?
  Judge KENNEDY. Not at all. And I have indicated it is not even in
any previous--the Senator indicated it was not even in any previ-
ous cases.
  Senator BYRD. But the word "liberty" is in the Constitution?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, sir.
  Senator BYRD. I like that word "liberty" in the Constitution.
  Senator HUMPHREY. DO you think there are a whole lot more
emanations from this penumbra?
  Judge KENNEDY. I don't find the phrase very helpful.
  Senator HUMPHREY. Good. Well, two hopes. Hope number one is
that you will at least once a year read your Stanford speech. Hope
number two is that you will not intrude on our turf. Thank you.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator. I will certainly commit to
the former, and I will try to comply with the latter.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, have you had a chance to read "The For-
gotten Ninth Amendment" by Bennett P. Patterson?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think I glanced at it some years ago, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, while we are hoping, I hope you read it
again.
  Judge KENNEDY. All right.
  The CHAIRMAN. We will have an opportunity, the Senator and I,
as long as we are here to debate the meaning of the ninth amend-
ment, but in here he liberally quoted from Madison's utterances at
the time. It may be somewhat selective, I think not. And the point
one of the authors makes is, "The last thought"--referring to the
ninth amendment--"The last thought in their minds was that the
Constitution would ever be construed as a grant to the individual
of inherent rights and liberties. Their theory"--meaning the
Founding Fathers--"Their theory of the Constitution was that it
was only a body of powers which were granted to the government
and nothing more than that."
                                      235

  And it seems, if you read the ninth amendment, how anyone
could avoid the conclusion that the word "retained" means "re-
tained." Now you can argue whether it is retained by the States, or
retained by individuals. That is a second argument. I won't go into
that at the moment. But it seems to me that one of the--I have not
found any reason, which I think in part disturbs my friend from
New Hampshire, to disagree with any of the points you have made
about your interpretations of the Constitution.

  As I have indicated earlier, I find your reading of the Constitu-
tion, your finding of the word "liberty" in the Constitution and
that it has some meaning and application, and your attitude about
the fourteenth amendment in general, the fifth amendment, to be
a conservative, mainstream and fundamentally different than
Judge Bork's.

  But having said all that, let me ask you a few questions, and
hopefully this will be the end of it for me. I indicated to you earlier
that staff received a telephone call from a former student and sub-
sequently, as we do with all these calls, followed up on the call and
apparently contacted four of your former students, all of whom are
supporters, and strong supporters, of your nomination to the bench.

  But the issue related to the question of a discussion you had in
1973 with students about the role of women in law firms at that
time; that is, in the context of 1973. Could you for the record just
tell us a little bit about it, without my characterizing it, because
you indicated you remember it vaguely, the incident? Just tell us a
little about it.

  Judge KENNEDY. Both the incident and the class discussion are
not very clear.

  The CHAIRMAN. Quite frankly, I don't think they are very impor-
tant, either.

  Judge KENNEDY. But I had the habit of talking to my students in
the course of a 3y2-hour lecture about the problems that lawyers
face in their practice, and I think it is imperative that lawyers re-
alize that they have an obligation, first of all, to know themselves,
to know their own motivations and to comply with the law strictly
so that they can be a model for their clients.

  And I recited to my class, as I recall, the incident of a lady who
had come to our office seeking employment, and at the time we did
not have a position open in any event, but I was pleased to chat
with her. She was extremely well qualified. She had sent in a
resume I think and I had said that if she was in town we would be
glad to talk to her. It wasn't clear to me from the resume that she
was male or female.

  And when she was a female I told her that she might find some
resistance in certain law firms and told her the story of a lawyer in
San Francisco whom I know very well and who is a man of re-
markable self-knowledge and remarkable honesty and who has a
remarkable admiration for the law, who had taken the position
that he would not have women in his law firm because he had a
very close relation with his partners and he did not want to share
that relation with another woman because of the respect he had
for his wife. He behaved the way he did in front of his partners, in
a way that he thought was very free, and he thought of his rela-
tions with the law partners as very intimate.
                                                    236

   And I told her that this was an attitude that many lawyers had
about their law partners. I said that in my own law firm that she
would find certain problems of adjustment because of the way my
partners behaved, but that I wanted to put this out in front for her,
to tell her that this was the kind of thinking that some people that
were sitting on the other side of an interview desk would be
having, and that if I were ever to either hire or not hire her and I
harbored those feelings that I wanted to make her sure that she
knew that I was trying to explore, for my own satisfaction, my own
motives, and my own intent.

   And I told her that the world was changing. I told her also the
story of when I was in the Harvard Law School and a certain pro-
fessor would have "Ladies Day," and ladies were not called on
unless it was "Ladies Day." And today this would not only be seen
as terribly stigmatizing and patronizing but probably actionable.

  And I recited this to my students to indicate that lawyers must
always be honest with themselves about their motivation, honest
with the people with which they deal about their motivation. And
the lady, as I recall, was very appreciative of the conversation. She
subsequently went to work in her own city of Los Angeles, I be-
lieve, which was where she was from. And that was all that the
incident was about.

  The CHAIRMAN. Have your views changed about the role of
women in law firms since 1973?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, of course that wasn't my view. I was
trying to indicate to her that I thought that the law was very much
in flux and that it would change, and it has. Women now
occupy

  The CHAIRMAN. IS it good or bad that it has changed?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think it is good that it has changed.
  The CHAIRMAN. Why?
  Judge KENNEDY. Women can bring marvelous insight to the legal
profession. Women, themselves, have been in a position where they
have been subjected to both overt and subtle barriers to their ad-
vancement, and the fact that women are on the bench and on our
court brings a very, very valuable insight and perspective.
  We now have, I would think, close to 35 or 40 percent women in
the night division of our law school class, and they are making
their way into the profession and are performing admirably. And it
is too bad they were not in it a hundred years ago.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you think the attitude of the profession has
changed as well?
  Judge KENNEDY. Absolutely. I have had female law clerks that I
have worked extremely closely with and it has been a really very
remarkable years when they have been with me. I have enjoyed it
very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. When did you hire your first female law clerk, if
you know?
  Judge KENNEDY. I think my second set of clerks had my first
female--I guess my third set of clerks, my third year.
  The CHAIRMAN. Roughly what year was that?
  Judge KENNEDY. 1978.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU indicated, and I am paraphrasing, in re-
sponse to a question from one of my colleagues, you said if someone
                                                  237

had been sitting here 20 years ago and had been asked to comment
on the law of the first amendment as it relates to the law of libel,
not even the greatest prophet could have predicted the state of the
law today. It may very well be that with respect to privacy we are
in the same rudimentary state of the law.

  Now, Judge, there has been, obviously, we have just had some
discussion about your view on the ninth amendment. As you know,
Justice Goldberg, as you mentioned, in the birth control case and
Justice Burger in the Richmond Newspaper case both treated the
ninth amendment as a rule of somewhat generous construction, not
just a reminder that States can protect individual rights in their
own constitution, an idea that would have made the ninth amend-
ment in my view redundant in light of the fact we had a 10th
amendment that provides for just that.

  In the view of Justices Goldberg and Burger the ninth amend-
ment announces that the word "liberty" in the fifth amendment
and later in the 14th amendment is broader than specifically enu-
merated rights contained in the Bill of Rights. The ninth amend-
ment, in other words, in my view confirms in the text of the Con-
stitution that spacious reading of liberty, the so-called Liberty
Clause, that you have said you thought was a proper reading.

  I understood you yesterday as embracing the view of Goldberg
and Burger in the regard that the notion of liberty, the Liberty
Clause as being one of those spacious phrases.

  Former Chief Justice Burger thought that the ninth amendment
shows a belief by the framers that fundamental rights exist that
are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments, and
the intent of the rights included in the first eight amendments are
not exhaustive.

  I would like to quote from a case. Justice Burger says:

   But arguments such as the State makes have not precluded recognition of impor-
tant rights not enumerated. Notwithstanding the appropriate caution against read-
ing into the Constitution rights not explicitly defined, the Court has acknowledged
that certain unarticulated rights are implicit in enumerated guarantees.

   For example, the rights of association and of privacy, the right to be presumed
innocent, the right to be judged by a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt in a
criminal trial, as well as the right to travel, appear nowhere in the Constitution or
the Bill of Rights. Yet, this important but unarticulated rights have nonetheless
been found to share Constitutional protection in common with explicit guarantees.

   The concerns expressed by Madison and others have been resolved. Fundamental
rights, even though not expressly guaranteed, have been recognized by the Court as
indispensable to the enjoyment of rights explicitly defined.

  Then there is a footnote, Footnote 15. It says, "Madison's com-
ments in the Congress also revealed a perceived need for some sort
of Constitutional saving clause, which, among other things, would
serve to foreclose application of the Bill of Rights of the maximum
that the affirmation of particular rights implies the negation of
those not expressly defined.

   "Madison's efforts, culminating in the ninth amendment, serve
to allay the fears of those who were concerned that expressing cer-
tain guarantees could be read as excluding others."

  Now, Judge, in general terms do you share the view of Justice
Burger about unenumerated rights?

  Judge KENNEDY. Well, in general terms, it is not clear to me that
Chief Justice Burger's position would be any different if the ninth
                                                    238

amendment were not in the Constitution. I think liberty can sup-
port those conclusions he reached, and the meaning, purpose, and
interpretation of the ninth amendment, 1 think the Court has very
deliberately not found it necessary to explore.

  The CHAIRMAN. But I think Justice Burger used almost the same
words you used yesterday that the Senator from New Hampshire
would very much like for you to recant. He uses the phrase "saving
clause."

  Judge KENNEDY. I think I used the words "reserve clause."
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU used the word "reserve" clause.
  Judge KENNEDY. And I think the Court as a whole--I am not
talking about individual Justices--has taken that view of the
amendment, that they just find it unnecessary to reach that point.
  The CHAIRMAN. Are they not also, with good reason, a little bit
afraid of the amendment, because once you start down the road on
that amendment--I find the ninth amendment clear, and I think
most Justices have found it clear, in fact.
  But they are reluctant to use it because once you start down the
road on the ninth amendment, then it becomes very difficult to
figure where to stop; what are those unenumerated rights.
  Judge KENNEDY. And it is the ultimate irony that an amendment
that was designed to assuage the States is being used by a federal
entity to tell the States that they cannot commit certain acts.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, ironically, I think that it was, in fact, not
designed, that amendment, in particular, to assuage the States as it
related to the rights of the States. I think it was designed to as-
suage the representatives of the various States to allay their fears
that any government--in this case, the only one they were dealing
with at the moment, the central government--was going to, as a
consequence of the first eight amendments, conclude that they
were the only rights that, in fact, were retained by the people.
  Judge KENNEDY. I understand that position.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is a very tactful answer and you would
make one heck of an ambassador. Maybe there are State Depart-
ment representatives, but I do not think it is appropriate for me to
push you any further on this because I, quite frankly, think you
have left us all where I think it is proper to be left, quite frankly,
and that is I do not think anybody here and anybody not here, in-
cluding the President of the United States, and I suspect, Judge,
not even you, knows how you are going to rule on some of these
issues.

  Quite frankly, I said at the outset when Judge Powell announced
his resignation that, for me, that is just what I was looking for, as
long as whomever came before us came with an open mind, did not
have an ideological brief in their back pocket that they wished to
enforce or move into law once they got on the Court, did not have
an agenda.

  The one thing that has come clear to me is that you are extreme-
ly bright, extremely well informed, extremely honorable, and open-
minded. I suspect you are going to rule in ways that I am going to
go, oh, my goodness, how could he have ruled that way. And I sus-
pect you are going to rule in ways where Senator Humphrey is
going to go, oh, my goodness, why did I let him get on the Court.
But it seems to me that is the way it should be. We are not entitled
                                      239

to guarantees. We are only entitled to know that you have an open
mind.

  I just realized that I had told the Senator from Pennsylvania
that I would allow more questions, and here I was about to wrap
up. I apologize to the Senator from Pennsylvania.

  I will yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania and then to the
Senator from New Hampshire if he has any further questions, and
then

  Senator HUMPHREY. I have no further questions.
  The CHAIRMAN. And then I will yield to the clock.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have just a few.
  When the last round ended, Judge Kennedy, I was questioning
certain findings you made as a matter of law in the face of certain
underlying factual situations, and have referred to the Pasadena
school desegregation case, and also AFSCME v. Washington State
on the comparable worth case.
  And the other case that I want to discuss with you, and I shall do
so relatively briefly, is the Arnada case, which has already been
the subject of some discussion.
  Judge KENNEDY. Pardon me. Which case, Senator?
  Senator SPECTER. The case of Aranda v. Van Sickle.
  Judge KENNEDY. Aranda v. Van Sickle, yes, sir.
  Senator SPECTER. And this is a voting rights case, a civil rights
case, involving Mexican Americans, and I do not want to suggest,
Judge Kennedy, that there are not many cases where you have
been on the other side in the findings.
  The case of Flores v. Pierce where you made findings in favor of
Mexican Americans, and the case of James v. Ball, you made a
finding for civil rights, so that there is balance and representation
on both sides.
  But the Aranda case is unique and, I think, significantly ques-
tionable, and the reason that I question it, Judge Kennedy, turns
on the issue of summary judgment in a context where you say in
your concurrence that it was not overwhelming.
  And the law on summary judgment--and you and I had dis-
cussed this in our last session in my office--the standard for sum-
mary judgment requires that it be entered only when there is no
genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is enti-
tled to judgment as a matter of law, and where summary judgment
is considered it is particularly inappropriate where there are issues
involving intention and motivation, which were present in this
case, and especially in the context where the lower court had
denied a request for additional discovery.
  It just seems hard to understand the use of summary judgment
and the refusal to allow the facts to be submitted to a factfinder in
view of the very substantial constitutional issues involved here.
  And the other aspect of the case, and then I will ask you to com-
ment on it, turns on your very thoughtful opinion which comes to
the conclusion that other remedies were appropriate in terms of lo-
cation of polling places and employment of Mexican Americans by
commissions.
  And the case might have been remanded for further factfinding
or it might have been remanded for an amendment on the plead-
ings or you might have considered, as we lawyers do, to conform
                                                    240

the pleadings to the proof in the case and you might have entered
a remedy which was not specifically asked for.

   Most complaints in equity have the prayer or other equitable
relief as may appear just and appropriate under the circumstances,
and I understand your statement that the plaintiff sought to
change the at-large representation here. But it just seems to me
that all the facts of this case really cry out for some different
result than was reached in this case as a matter of basic justice.

  Judge KENNEDY. Weil, Senator, I have some obligation to be in-
teresting and creative, and I am disturbed by the fact that I may
sound very repetitive because I have been through this with the
other Senators this morning and again earlier this afternoon.

  The parties and the attorneys have the right to determine the
shape and the contours of their lawsuit. The repeated questioning
in the court indicated to me that the attorneys were there for one
remedy, and one remedy only, and that was the invalidation of at-
large elections and the substitution of district elections.

  Senator SPECTER. But, Judge Kennedy, was that not made in the
context that that is what he wanted and did not want to accept any
compromises?

  And when you say that the parties have the right to determine
the shape of the lawsuit, I understand what you are saying. We
had discussed in the context of this case the issue as to whether a
court ought to consider on appeal issues which were not raised by
the parties.

  And it seems to me that as to procedural matters, there is a
broader responsibility on the court. Now, we are not talking about
breaking new ground and about establishing new rights, and no
generalizations, but a broader responsibility of the court to do jus-
tice where there are procedural issues involved.

  And I can see a lawyer making the argument to you, no, Judge,
this is what I want, all or nothing. And it is really in the context,
in a sense, of putting the court's back to the wall as a far as a liti-
gant can.

  But in the context where the facts were as present here, where
there was really injustice to Mexican Americans under this circum-
stance, and important factors on location of polling places and
hiring by commissions, is there not a responsibility for a court of
appeals to mold the verdict, to mold the finding to do justice under
the circumstances?

  Judge KENNEDY. The law that we were applying at the time was
that the remedy had to fit the violation, and the insistence was
that this was the only remedy they wanted. And I was sufficiently
concerned about it that I wrote the separate opinion indicating
with every hint I could that I was very concerned about some sub-
stantive violations, but that I had to agree with my colleagues that
the remedy was not permitted.

  Senator SPECTER. But another remedy could have been ordered.
  Judge KENNEDY. Certainly.
  Senator SPECTER. Why not?
  Judge KENNEDY. Yes, I think another remedy could have been
ordered. So I think all we are talking about is whether or not I as a
single judge should have said that I would remand. I certainly did
                                         241

not have that authority because I did not have the votes. I did not
have the authority to write the mandate in this case.

  Senator SPECTER. DO you recall whether you raised that issue
specifically with the other two judges on the panel?

  Judge KENNEDY. I cannot recall.
  Senator SPECTER. One final point, Judge Kennedy, and it follows
up from our discussion earlier today with respect to framers' intent
and then one of my colleagues had raised the subject again and
had talked about the difference on electronic surveillance on the
fourth amendment where electronic surveillance was not known at
the time the fourth amendment was adopted.
  But that seems to me to be a very different consideration from
the one which you and I had discussed previously, and that in-
volves the framers' intent in the issue of segregated schools on the
basic question to the propriety of the court in some extraordinary
circumstances making a conclusion which is directly contrary to
the framers' intent.

  And in the discussion which you had today you talked about the
fact that it was not subjective intent that the framers were looking
toward, and my question is what kind of intent is there besides the
intent in the minds of the individuals who frame the amendment.

  Whether you call it subjective intent or objective intent, what is
there besides what they are thinking about, as reflected by the
facts surrounding the times when D.C. schools were segregated and
schools were segregated all over the country and the gallery in the
Senate was segregated?

  They must have had in mind the segregation because that was
the only fact of life that they knew.

  Judge KENNEDY. That may have been, but they committed them-
selves to something that in legal consequence was entirely dif-
ferent, and they simply have to bear the consequences of that
decision.

  They made an agreement among themselves that racial discrimi-
nation would not be permitted when it was at the behest of the
State, and I think they are bound by the consequences of what they
did, regardless of whether .

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge, when you say the legal conse-
quences, they committed themselves to legal consequences which
were something different. I agree with the morality, the propriety,
and the prevailing law on the subject, but I just do not see how you
can say that they agreed to those consequences, given their under-
standing of what was happening in, their world.

   Our world is different. The world was different in 1954 with
Brown v. Board, but what seems to me to come through from your
approach, and quite properly so, but I think this is an important
principle, is that there are some extraordinary cases where there is
an appropriate finding by the Supreme Court of the United States,
as they did in Brown v. Board of Education, which goes right into
the teeth of the intent of the framers who wrote the Equal Protec-
tion Clause of the fourteenth amendment.

   Judge KENNEDY. Well, I guess, again, it comes down to a differ-
ence of the use of the term "intent."
                                                    242

   Senator SPECTER. IS there any question in your mind about the
Equal Protection Clause applying beyond blacks to women, to
aliens, to indigents, to mentally retarded?

  Judge KENNEDY. NO. In fact, once again, the framers could have
drafted the amendment so that it applied to blacks only, but they
did not. They used the word "person."

  Senator SPECTER. And is there any question in your mind about
the propriety of the longstanding rule in the Supreme Court of the
United States about the clear and present danger test or freedom
of speech?

  Judge KENNEDY. I am not sure that the clear and present danger
test is a full description of the full protection that the Court gives
to freedom of speech. I think Brandenburg goes a little further
than the clear and present danger test.

  Senator SPECTER. SO you have the clear and present danger test,
plus Brandenburg v. Ohio

  Judge KENNEDY. Yes.
  Senator SPECTER [continuing]. And Hess v. Indiana, and you
agree with that statement of the
  Judge KENNEDY. I know of no substantial, responsible argument
which would require the overruling of that precedent.
  Senator SPECTER. I know of none either, but some do.
  That concludes my questioning. Thank you very much, Judge
Kennedy.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you, Senator.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, you just proved that you did not listen to
any of the Bork hearings. We take you at your word.
  Do you have anything to say, Senator?
  Senator THURMOND. I have nothing else to say. I again want to
commend Judge Kennedy for the way in which he has handled
himself, and I hope we will not extend these hearings unduly.
  If the members would stay here and listen to questions asked,
they would not have to ask them over and over and over again, and
that is what is happening. We apologize to you.
  Judge KENNEDY. Well, no apologies are necessary, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. Of course, they have a right to do that, but
at the same time it takes a lot of time from all the people who are
attending, and I just hope we can speed along.
  Judge KENNEDY. NO apologies are necessary, and I appreciate,
Mr. Chairman and Senator, the great consideration and courtesy
that you have shown to me and my family. We have enjoyed it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Judge, as you can verify now, the Senator
from South Carolina--when they said "with all deliberate speed,"
they really meant it. He wanted to schedule your hearing 1 week
after the President had named you and 3 days before your name
was sent up, so he is always moving along rapidly.
  I think that our colleagues asked very good questions, and we
seldom disagree, but, Boss, it went smoothly. Here we are at 6
o'clock; we are about to close down, and so I hope you have a good
dinner.
  Let me ask one thing of the staff. Is there any Senator on his
way to ask further questions?
  [No response.]
  The CHAIRMAN. I have some| questions on criminal procedure
which I will submit to you in writing, Judge. There is no hurry,
obviously. As you know, because of the Senate schedule, we will
not be back in until the end of January, so we will not vote on your
nomination in committee until we get back.

  Senator THURMOND. Well, Mr. Chairman, I was hoping you
would change your mind and vote tomorrow when we finish, or the
next day.

  The CHAIRMAN. I thought you might, Senator, in contravention
of our own rules. You know, all the breaks I cut this man--he does
not cut me any on this score. All kidding aside

  Judge KENNEDY. I will abide by the will of the Senate, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, you have every reason, in my view, to
have a happy holiday. I appreciate your answering the questions.
You have kept your commitment that you would discuss in broad
terms the issues and the constitutional questions. You did that; we
much appreciate it.
  And unless Senator Thurmond has something good to say about
the way the hearings have been conducted, I am going to close.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, I think you, Mr. Chairman, are very
fair and I want to congratulate you for your fairness.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Senator THURMOND. I hope you and your family go out and have
a nice dinner, get a good night's rest, and we will see you tomorrow
morning.
  The CHAIRMAN. Hopefully, you will not have to see him tomor-
row morning because I do not think we are going to have to
call
  Senator THURMOND. Are we through?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. I do not think we are going to have to
  Senator THURMOND. Well, if that is the case, we will excuse you,
then.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. In case you observed, I am no longer the Chair-
man. I just do this, you know. [Laughter.]
  Senator THURMOND. Are you going to excuse him, too?
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, Senator, if you have excused him, then
there is no reason for me to excuse him.
  I would just like to thank your family. I realize it is both boring
and tedious to sit back there not able to move all this time for 2
days, but we truly appreciate it.
  With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I will recess for the day.
  Senator THURMOND. What time are you going to meet tomorrow?
  The CHAIRMAN. We will start tomorrow--we were going to
start at 10. You asked me to start at 9:30. We will start at 9:30
tomorrow.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much. You are very accom-
modating and I appreciate it.
  Judge, if everybody is through with you, again, I just want to
compliment you on the great service you have rendered, and say
again I do not think anybody could be selected who is better quali-
fied for the Supreme Court.
  You have practiced law, you have taught law, you have been on
the court, you have been a judge; you have been reasonable, you

     90-878 0 - 8 9 - 9
                                               244

have been fair, and there is no reason in the world why anybody
should raise complaints about your conduct and about your career
and history. In my opinion, you will be confirmed.

  In the meantime, though, I hope you will have a nice Christmas
and you will get a fine message from us. The Chairman and I are
going to do all we can to confirm you when we come back.

  Thank you very much.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you very much, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, Senator Heflin indicated he will have a
few questions in writing.
  Now that I have gotten my marching orders from the Senator
from South Carolina, we will recess. We will not call you back to-
morrow, and I do not expect to call you back at all until this hear-
ing is concluded. The next action would be a vote on your nomina-
tion in the committee.
  We will resume tomorrow at 9:30. The American Bar Association
will be the first to testify and then we will have public witnesses
who, in all probability will take Wednesday and Thursday, but we
will see how the day goes.
  Thank you very much, Judge, and we thank your family.
  Judge KENNEDY. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. The hearing is recessed.
  [Whereupon, at 6:02 p.m., the committee was adjourned, to recon-
vene at 9:30 a.m., Wednesday, December 15, 1987.]
NOMINATION OF ANTHONY M. KENNEDY TO BE
 ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

               OF THE UNITED STATES

                     WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1987

                                                                     U.S. SENATE,
                                                 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY,

                                                         Washington, DC.
  The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:41 a.m., in room SR-
325, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,
chairman ot the >romittee, presiding.
  Present: Senators Kennedy, Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Leahy,
Heflin, Thuimond, Hatch, Simpson, Grassley, Specter, and Hum-
phrey.
  Senator KENNEDY. We will come to order.
  The chairman of the committee, Senator Biden, as all of us
know, travels down daily from Delaware to attend to his Senate
duties. On the train down this morning, there was a slight mishap,
a mechanical failure. I have talked to him in the last several min-
utes, and it seems that everything has been cleared away. But he
will be necessarily late and has asked us to proceed with the hear-
ings this morning. He did request that individuals be given 10 min-
utes for the opening statements and members of panels 5 minutes
for opening statements. He would also request that the questioning
be limited to 15 minutes per questioner.
  So with that understanding, we will look forward to hearing
from our first witnesses this morning. The first is the Hon. Harold
Tyler. Judge Tyler serves as the chairman of the Standing Commit-
tee of the Federal Judiciary on the American Bar Association;
second, Mr. J. David Andrews, who is the ninth circuit representa-
tive on the standing committee. Then we have John C. Elam, of Co-
lumbus, Ohio, who is the sixth circuit representative on the stand-
ing committee; and John D. Lane, of Washington, D.C., the federal
circuit representative on the standing committee.
  I want to welcome Judge Harold Tyler, the chairman of the ABA
Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Judge Tyler is cur-
rently a partner in the highly respected law firm of Patterson,
Belknap, Webb and Tyler in New York. He previously was a feder-
al judge in the southern district of New York, and from 1975
through 1977 was Deputy Attorney General of the United States.
  Judge Tyler, welcome. I know that your service as chairman of
the ABA standing committee is often a thankless job, and the com-
mittee is often praised by those who agree with its conclusions and
condemned by those who do not. But all of us appreciate the ex-

                                                        (245)
                                               246

traordinary amount of work that its members contribute to im-
prove the administration of justice in this country. We look for-
ward to your testimony.

  Judge Tyler, I will ask you if you would be good enough to take
the oath. We will follow the usual procedure of swearing in all of
our witnesses. Since all of them will be testifying, I would ask that
they all rise, please.

  Do you swear to give the truth, the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you, God?

  Judge TYLER. I do.

   Mr. ANDREWS. I do.
   Mr. ELAM. I do.
   Mr. LANE. I do.

  Senator KENNEDY. Judge Tyler, do you want to proceed so that
we might have the report from the American Bar Association?

TESTIMONY OF PANEL CONSISTING OF HAROLD R. TYLER, JR.,
  CHAIRMAN; J. DAVID ANDREWS, MEMBER, NINTH CIRCUIT
  REPRESENTATIVE; JOHN C. ELAM, MEMBER, SIXTH CIRCUIT
  REPRESENTATIVE; AND JOHN D. LANE, MEMBER, FEDERAL
  CIRCUIT REPRESENTATIVE, STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE
  FEDERAL JUDICIARY, AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION

  Judge TYLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning, gen-
tlemen.

  We on the American Bar Association Standing Committee for
the Federal Judiciary commenced our investigations in respect to
the nominee, Judge Anthony Kennedy, on November 11th. We fin-
ished our work on December 7th, and I reported in short form on
behalf of the committee to Chairman Biden that we had unani-
mously concluded that we should rate Judge Kennedy as well
qualified for consideration for the Supreme Court of the United
States.

  As the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee are certainly
aware, the rating of well qualified is the highest rating under our
procedures that we could possibly vote for any Supreme Court can-
didate.

  In the course of our investigation, we interviewed in excess of
480 judges, practicing lawyers and people in academic life in the
legal world across this country. We asked the three law schools in
the United States--the University of Pennsylvania Law School, the
Vermont Law School, and Fordham University Law School--to
assist us in appraising and reviewing the opinions of Judge Kenne-
dy, more than 430 in number. A team of lawyers in my own office
also assisted us in reviewing the opinions of the nominee.

  I should hasten to add that, in addition, three members of our
committee interviewed Judge Kennedy face to face in San Francis-
co, California, on or about November 30th.

  As a result of that investigation which I have summarily de-
scribed, we as a committee met and unanimously concluded that
Judge Kennedy was entitled to our highest rating.

  I will say no more, Mr. Chairman, subject, of course, to any ques-
tions which you wish to pose in the course of our appearance here
this morning.

Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:

       My name is Harold R. Tyler. I practice law in New
York City, and I am Chairman of the American Bar
Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary.
I appear here to present the views of the American Bar
Association on the nomination of the Honorable Anthony
M. Kennedy, Judge of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit, to be Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States.

       At the request of the Attorney General, our
Committee investigated the professional competence,
judicial temperament and integrity of Judge Kennedy.
Our work included discussions with 480 persons,
including (1) the Justices of the Supreme Court of the
United States and many federal and state judges
throughout the country; (2) practicing lawyers
throughout the country; (3) law school deans and
faculty members, including constitutional law and
Supreme Court scholars; and (4) Judge Kennedy himself,
who was interviewed by three members of our Commitee.
Panels of law professors from three distinguished law
schools and a separate group of practicing lawyers
reviewed Judge Kennedy's published judicial opinions for
the Committee.

       The Committee commenced its investigations of Judge
Kennedy on November 11 and completed its work on
December 8, 1987. This report was prepared after the
latter date.

       This Committee is satisfied that its investigations
reveal that Judge Kennedy's integrity is beyond
reproach, that he enjoys justifiably a reputation for
sound intellect and diligence in his judicial work and
that he is uniformly praised for his judicial
temperament. Hence, we have concluded that Judge
Kennedy is among the best available for appointment to
the Supreme Court of the United States from the
standpoint of professional competence, integrity and
judicial temperament and that he is entitled to this
Committee's highest evaluation of a nominee to that
Court because of the high standards which he meets.
Accordingly, this Committee has unanimously found him
"Well Qualified".

       Thank you very much.

  Senator KENNEDY. DO other members of the panel choose to
make any comments or will they just respond to questions?

  Judge TYLER. I think at the moment they would agree with me
we will be prepared to respond to questions.

  Senator KENNEDY. I believe we have submitted the report, and it
has been made a part of the record. If it is not, we will ask that it
be made a part of the record.

       3. Committee members interviewed a number of Deans and
faculty members of law schools in the United States, including a
number of colleagues of the nominee at McGeorge Law School.

       4. Members of the faculty of three law schools, Fordham
University, the University of Pennsylvania and Vermont Law School,
divided the task of evaluating the published opinions of Judge
Kennedy throughout his career as a member of the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit. In addition, all of the opinions of Judge
Kennedy were reviewed by a group of lawyers 4" the office of the
Chairman of the Committee.

       5. The Committee reviewed the relatively few available
speeches of Judge Kennedy.

       6. Three members of the Committee interviewed Judge Kennedy
in person on November 30, 1987. In addition, the chairman talked
with the nominee by telephone on several occasions.

Professional Background

       As is surely known to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge
Kennedy's career includes service as a practicing lawyer, a
Federal Circuit Judge and a law school professor. He received a
Bachelor of Arts degree with great distinction from Stanford
University in 1958. He also attended the London School of
Economics and Political Science at the University of London. He
then attended Harvard Law School, from which he graduated cum
laude in June, 1961, with an LL.B. degree. He was admitted to the
bar of the State of California in 1962.

       In the fall of 1961, he entered private practice as an
Associate in a San Francisco law firm. Following the death of his
father, he left San Francisco in 1963 to return to Sacramento,
where he assumed charge of his late father's law practice. He
continued to practice law in Sacramento from December, 1963 until
May, 1975, when he was appointed a United States Circuit Judge for
the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by President Gerald
Ford. Since 1965, he also has served as an Adjunct Professor of
Law at McGeorge Lav School, located in Sacramento, where he taught
constitutional law.

Interviews with Judges

       Of the more than 480 persons interviewed by this Committee,
over 300 are federal and state judges. All of those judges who
had direct knowledge of Judge Kennedy's professional work spoke
positively about his intellect, his thoughtful analyses of legal
problems presented to him, both as a lawyer and a judge, his
                                     254

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.

writing ability and his collegiality. He has been described by
various judges as "studious", "always well prepared", "collegial"
and "willing to listen to the submitted facts and law from the
parties and their counsel."

       Those judges who do not personally know Judge Kennedy have a
favorable impression of him based on his reputation and their
readings of his opinions.

       In sum, the judges interviewed by this Committee looked
favorably on Judge Kennedy's nomination.

Interviews with Lawyers

       The Committee interviewed approximately 100 practicing lawyers
throughout the United States, many of whom have appeared before a
panel of the Ninth Circuit of which Judge Kennedy was a member.
On the whole they spoke affirmatively about the nominee's intel-
lect, temperament and integrity. Specifically, some recalled that
"the Judge was always well prepared and asked pertinent questions";
that the Judge had a perceptive and inquiring mind; and that "he
was always fair and willing to listen." Other lawyers who knew the
Judge only by reputation were universal in their praise of his
reputation for decency, sound scholarship and willingness to decide
cases on a case-by-case basis without a particular preordained
agenda or set philosophical approach to the relevant areas of the
law.

Interviews with Law School Deans and Faculty Members

       The Committee interviewed more than 80 law school deans and
faculty members, including his colleagues at McGeorge Law School
and others who know Judge Kennedy only by reputation or through
occasional review of his opinions. None of these people in
academic life reported adverse or unduly critical opinions of
Judge Kennedy. Indeed, he was praised for a willingness to be
fair, to write with attention to all issues in each case, and to
proceed with reasonable thoroughness in his legal analyses.

Review of Judge Kennedy's Written Opinions

       Three law schools were asked to divide, study and comment on
Judge Kennedy's opinions. The Fordham University Law School
reviewed Judge Kennedy's constitutional law opinions in areas
other than the First Amendment and certain of his criminal law
opinions. Vermont Law School reviewed his environmental law
opinions and certain administrative law opinions, together with
his statutory civil rights opinions. Finally, the University of
                                     255

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden,
Page 4
December 15, 1987

Pennsylvania Law School reviewed Judge Kennedy's First Amendment,
antitrust, securities and labor law opinions.

       Moreovei, as heretofore stated, a team of lawyers in the
office of the undersigned reviewed all of Judge Kennedy's reported
decisions as a Circuit Judge.

       The consensus reached by all of the reviewers, whether strongly
affirmative or more reserved in their approval, was that Judge
Kennedy's opinions are on the whole technically and persuasively
crafted, fair and even-handed and generally do not go beyond
points at issue. Indeed, it is part of this consensus, in which
the members of this Committee concur, that Judge Kennedy has not
been prone to give long, expository opinions reflecting his philo-
sophy, but rather uses his analytic and writing skills to deal
with the issues raised by the litigants and their lawyers. Most
reviewers specifically commented favorably about his judicial
temperament. By way of illustration, most noted his fairness and
his effort to give parties and their lawyers a sense that their
arguments were listened to, carefully considered and decided on
the basis of the record. Moreover, it was frequently commented
that no bias was discerned; and Judge Kennedy always has
endeavored to convey a sense of balance, compassion and fairness.
Hence, he was frequently described as a "lawyers' judge" or a
"litigants' judge". There were occasional minor suggestions that
some of the nominee's opinions disclose that he is not always "a
good teaching judge." The characteristics giving rise to this
concern did not predominate over the great bulk of his opinions
and, in the view of the Committee, were not of sufficient signi-
ficance to affect the Committee's conclusions.

Conclusion

       This Committee is satisfied that its investigations reveal
that Judge Kennedy's integrity is beyond reproach, that he enjoys
justifiably a reputation for sound intellect and diligence in his
judicial work and that he is uniformly praised for his judicial
temperament. Hence, we have concluded that Judge Kennedy is among
the best available for appointment to the Supreme Court of the
United States from the standpoint of professional competence,
integrity and judicial temperament* and that he is entitled to

* This Committee confines its investigation to these three
    criteria. As in investigations of lower court nominees, it does
    not investigate a nominee's political or ideological philosophy
    "except to the extent that extreme views on such matters might
    bear upon judicial temperament or integrity."

this Committee's highest evaluation of a nominee to that Court
because of the high standards which he meets. Accordingly this
Committee has unanimously found him "Well Qualified".

       This report is being filed at the commencement of the Senate
Judiciary Committee's hearings. We will review our report at the
conclusion of the hearings and notify you if any circumstances have
developed that dictate modification of the views herein expressed.

  Senator KENNEDY. I have a question, Judge, and that is, I want
to be clear on the standing committee's conclusion with regard to
Judge Kennedy's former membership in the Olympic Club. It
seems clear that you did not believe that his former membership
affected your overall assessment of his qualifications for the Su-
preme Court, largely because he had tried to change the discrimi-
natory policies and because he had resigned when the club's mem-
bership refused to change those policies.

  My question is: Would the ABA standing committee view a feder-
al judge's continuing membership in an exclusive club that dis-
criminated on the basis of race or sex as adversely affecting the
nominee's qualifications for elevation to a higher federal court?

  Judge TYLER. Well, of course, what happened, we, as you know,
looked into this considerably. Earlier, Chairman Biden wrote us a
letter pointing out the language of Canon 2 of the Judicial Canon
of Ethics. You fairly summarized, I think, how we came out. Be-
cause of what happened, our committee unanimously concluded
that this business of membership in the Olympic Club was not a
disqualifying factor here at all.

  Very briefly, the record, as we understand it, is that he was a
non-voting, non-resident member for years. Back early in 1987, it
came to his attention, when the open golf tournament was played
in the Bay area, and I think also through an article which ap-
peared in the New Yorker Magazine dealing with the history of the
Olympic Club, that nothing had been done to change the rules
about admission of women and perhaps minorities. He then en-
deavored to work within to persuade the officers and others who
had control of club policies to change. They had a referendum; it
did not come out the way he hoped. I think your committee has
before you copies of two letters that he wrote in August of this
year about the problem to counsel for the club. Finally, he resigned
early this fall.

  I suppose that one could say, looking at this record, that maybe
he might have been more sensitive to the problem earlier than he
was, but we concluded that, on balance, he behaved in a respecta-
ble, responsible fashion and tried to live up to the sensible com-
mands of canon 2.

  Furthermore, I think it is perfectly fair, as your question sug-
gested, Mr. Chairman, that this matter should be looked into, and I
hope you understand that we do the same in respect to this prob-
lem, not only with regard to Supreme Court of the United States
nominees, but, as well, lower court nominees.

  Finally, I would say, as I am sure the committee is aware, if you
read the commentary under Canon 2 of the Judicial Ethics, that
commentary makes two things very clear: First of all, what is in-
vidious discrimination practiced by an organization is a complex
question; and, second, in the last analysis, of course, the canon
leaves it up to the conscience and good sense of the judge himself.

  It seems to us, that it is important to keep in mind those two
commentaries when this kind of a problem is appraised.

  Senator KENNEDY. Your ABA standing committee on the ethics
and professional responsibility explained the term "invidious dis-
crimination" as follows: An organization ordinarily would be con-
sidered to discriminate invidiously when it is exclusive, rather than
                                         258

inclusive; excludes from membership persons solely on the basis of
their race, sex, religion, or national origin; and, third, such exclu-
sions stigmatizes such persons as inferior. It does not, in that par-
ticular term, use the expression that there had to be an intention
of those that drafted the bylaws; effectively, what you are talking
about is the effect of those rules, regulations, standards, are you
not?

  Judge TYLER. Well, you see, the courts deal with the concept or
phrase "invidious discrimination" on the whole by viewing it as a
problem of whether or not there was intentional or purposeful dis-
crimination. Some people think that that is not the way to ap-
proach the problem.

  Senator KENNEDY. What is your position?
  Judge TYLER. Some people argue that you should only view this
as to the effect. I do not think that it is terribly significant to argue
that point one way or another. I think the real problem, and I
think the way we approached it in our deliberations, was: Was
there any evidence that Judge Kennedy purposely intended to be
part of an organization that purposely discriminated against some-
body? Second, we construed it in terms of what was the effect and
what did he do about it.
  It is on those two broad approaches that we viewed the problem
and concluded that, under the facts that are pretty well known
now, this history--particularly with respect to the Olympic Club--
is not a disqualifying factor.
  Senator KENNEDY. I am as interested right now to try and find
out what the standard is in terms of future judges. It is an impor-
tant message as well.
  If I can just mention this point, if you have a situation where as
a result of existing regulations, and it is a business club and the
effect of whatever the rules and regulations or understandings all
is to deny the involvement of women in a club where business asso-
ciations and meetings and contacts take place, or denies the oppor-
tunity for minorities to participate, would you find it permissible--
or do you find it objectionable--for members of the federal judici-
ary to continue membership in those clubs?
  Judge TYLER. Yes, I think we would. That is why I said a few
moments ago that it does not only apply to Supreme Court nomi-
nees.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Tyler, do you mind speaking in your
microphone so we can hear you better?
  Judge TYLER. I beg your pardon. I will do that, Senator.
  As I said a few moments ago, I think where, as you point out, the
record shows that a club is really used for business and profession-
al associations, meetings and so on, a judge should really, under
canon 2 and common sense, avoid that type of place. It leaves open,
however, the question of whether or not he should attempt to per-
suade, for a while at least, that organization to change its policies.
  I mention that because this has occurred recently in my own city
of New York where we have now a law which deals with this very
problem.
   Second, also, of course, I think our committee has to be con-
cerned whether or not a judge is continuing to be a member of a
club where he is well aware that there is purposeful activity to dis-
                                259

criminate against women and minorities So long as that is truly a

club where it is not small and it is not confined closely to simple

social events, et cetera.

I do not think there is any doubt that this committee for some

time has been concerned about approaching the problem on these

two levels.

Senator KENNEDY. I appreciate your response. I know you agree

that it is vitally important that all segments of the population have

confidence in the fairness and the impartiality of the judiciary, and

a judge's membership in a discriminatory club obviously under-

mines that confidence. A judge who hears a gender discrimination

case in the morning and then has lunch at an all-male club is just

not going to inspire the public's confidence.

Judge TYLER. Yes. You are dealing, of course, with the appear-

ance problem. We would agree that the appearance problem,

among others, is important.

Mr. ELAM. Senator Kennedy?

Senator KENNEDY. Yes?

Mr. ELAM. My name is John Elam. I was a member of the group

that interviewed Judge Kennedy. You mentioned lessons for

others. I think that our group was impressed in connection with

this club that in the summer of 1987, before he was under consider-

ation, he struggled with this question, brought it up to the board,

and then took action in that he ultimately resigned. We were im-

pressed by the fact that he was, over a period of time, increasingly

sensitive. And I believe if you are asking what does this tell others

in the future, I think his action expresses something that he came

to over time and advanced his consideration for a position on the

Supreme Court.

Senator KENNEDY. Senator Thurmond.

Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I am not too convinced that someone should be disqualified if he

belongs to a group of men who want to just meet in a personal

way, or if a woman wants to belong to a women's group that wants

to meet in a personal way. For instance, you may have a group of

women who have a sewing club. Why shouldn't they be allowed to

have that without having men required to be there?

In other words, I am not too sure that--a few years ago we have

a very high ranking officer, I think it was William French Smith, I

believe, who was one who belonged to some club, and he feels there

is nothing wrong with that whether there is no discrimination of

those of the same category. After all, there are some differences in

sexes, and there are some differences in other ways of people. So

long as there is no intent to discriminate and so long as they will

not discriminate when it comes to their official duties; but when it

is purely personal, it seems to me it is a little different situation.

People ought to be allowed to choose their own associates. I just

want to throw that out to you.

Now, I want to ask this question of Judge Tyler. Judge TyleY, I

believe you gave Judge Kennedy--or your committee did--the

rating of well qualified. Is that correct?          j

Judge TYLER. Yes, correct.
                                               260

  Senator THURMOND. The rating of well qualified is based, as I un-
derstand it, on three factors, more or less: integrity, judicial tem-
perament, and professional competence. Is that correct?

  Judge TYLER. That is correct.
  Senator THURMOND. Also, I understand that the persons in this
category must be among the best available for appointment to the
Supreme Court. Is that correct?
  Judge TYLER. That is certainly correct.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, you made a very searching investiga-
tion, I presume, of Judge Kennedy in all aspects and came up with
that final rating.
  Judge TYLER. We did.
  Senator THURMOND. DO you know of any reason that Judge Ken-
nedy should not be confirmed for the Supreme Court?
  Judge TYLER. Well, accepting our limited role and confining my
answer only to that limited role, we know of none.
  Senator THURMOND. SO, as I understand it, your committee rec-
ommends that Judge Kennedy be confirmed?
  Judge TYLER. We certainly agree that under our criteria
  Senator THURMOND. That is a
  Judge TYLER. Under our criteria, we certainly agree.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Andrews, I believe you are a member of
this committee. Do you agree with the conclusion of Judge Tyler?
  Mr. ANDREWS. Very definitely.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Elam, I believe you are a member of
this committee. Do you agree with the conclusion of Judge Tyler?
  Mr. ELAM. AS he stated it, yes.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Lane, how do you feel?
  Mr. LANE. I certainly agree.
  Senator THURMOND. Judge Tyler, were there any dissenting votes
in your committee on this matter?
  Judge TYLER. None, sir.
  Senator THURMOND. In other words, your entire committee, every
member favored approving Judge Kennedy for the Supreme Court?
  Judge TYLER. We all agreed, all fifteen, that his integrity, profes-
sional competence, and judicial temperament made it very clear
that he deserved our highest rating.
  Senator THURMOND. And therefore your committee unanimously
recommended Judge Kennedy for appointment to the Supreme
Court?
  Judge TYLER. We did.
  Senator THURMOND. I have no other questions. Thank you very
much, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. Senator Metzenbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Judge Tyler, it is good to have you before
us again, particularly with my old friend, John Elam, from my own
State. I just have a couple of questions.
  On page three, I guess it is, you talk about interviews with law-
yers. You say, on the whole they spoke affirmatively about the
nominee's intellect, temperament, and integrity.
  Your report is so effusive in its praise, that I am interested in
knowing what, if any, negatives did come up. I do not want to can-
onize Judge Kennedy, and I would like to find, if there were some
negatives, what they were.
                                      261
  We do not expect nominees for the Supreme Court, nor do we
expect Senators, not to have some negatives. Can you tell us some-
thing of those negatives, even though you did not consider them
significant enough to make a point.
  Judge TYLER. Very simply, Senator Metzenbaum, as always, we
encountered a few lawyers who were probably result-oriented as
much as anything else. In other words, frequently, with lawyers, it
depends on whether or not you and your client won or lost.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Never. As a former practicing lawyer,
never.
  Judge TYLER. I must say, in fairness, though, there were one or
two who did say that they thought that in connection with certain
appeals which they handled, that he might have gone further in
his discussion of the issues, and that sort of thing. But no one sug-
gested, even those who were result-oriented, or quarreled a little
bit with the opinions, doubted his integrity or his intellectual abili-
ty, and his willingness to try to address the issues in the case and
not do any more.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you. I want to say that I stand
shoulder to shoulder with Senator Kennedy, and many of us on
this committee, on this question of judges being a member of a dis-
criminatory club, or clubs. Yet in saying that, I also have to tell
you, that I feel somewhat sensitive about the fact that we in the
United States Senate act in connection with civil-rights laws, fair-
housing laws, equal-employment laws, discriminatory laws with re-
spect to women, and, yet I know that some Members of the United
States Senate who are acting in connection with such laws are
indeed members of clubs that have discriminatory policies with re-
spect to women, and with respect to minorities.
  And so I must tell you that--not that it is specifically relevant,
but maybe confession is good for the soul. I am not confessing that
I am a member of such a discriminatory club.
  But I think that the United States Senate, makes this a very
strict criterion in connection with the judicial appointments. I am
not sure we turn it around on ourselves, and we probably do not
have any opportunity to do that because, in the last analysis, the
only people who can judge us are those of our own constituencies.
  Whereas, in this case, we, in the Senate, and you, in the ABA,
are in a different role. I thought I'd comment on that. I do not need
any response from you, but I do feel a sense of sensitivity in this
area with respect to our own House. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. The Senator from Utah. Senator Hatch.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I would like to welcome each of you here,
and we appreciate the work that you attempt to do in all of these
matters. It is a lot of work, and you do not get much thanks for it,
and sometimes you get beaten up pretty badly for it.
  And I have been in both positions, where I have thanked you,
and also found a great deal of fault.
  In looking at what Senators Kennedy and Metzenbaum have
drawn your attention to, the Olympic Club, did you consider the
fact that Judge Kennedy had resigned from the Del Paso Country
Club due to a perception problem over women members, and did
you find--if you did look at that--that that illustrated the neces-
sary sensitivity to these problems and issues?
                                                262

  Judge TYLER. That is really why I pushed aside the other three
clubs, Senator Hatch. We obviously looked. One of the dubs I, per-
sonally--and I think most of my colleagues agreed--really is not a
club in the true sense we are discussing this under, say, the head-
ing of canon 2. When you join a athletic club which you pay a fee
for, and all members are--as long as they pay the fee--I do not
consider that a private club.

  The country club was a small place where it turned out--as we
found out at least--there were no set policies against minorities or
women anyhow. And then of course there was the Sutter Club
which he had resigned because he was uncomfortable with what
their attitudes were as long ago as seven years ago. That is so.

  Senator HATCH. Well, that is good. Part of the point with regard
to the Olympic Club is that the real sense of the problem did not
even arise until the U.S. Open last summer, is that correct?

  Judge TYLER. Well, I think that one could say that is not literal-
ly, perhaps, a total answer to the question because they had appar-
ently had policies for many years. What we looked at, though, was
the fact that the open tournament sort of brought this problem out
in the open, along with the article in the New Yorker Magazine.

  We recognize that the Olympic Club is a very large organization.
It is not what you would call a small, private kind of affair, and
therefore, we thought it was important to inquire deeply, in not
only the interview sense, but any other information we could
obtain.

  But as has been pointed out already, we believe that he was sen-
sitive to the issue when it surfaced, and then he tried to do some-
thing about it. Perhaps it could be said he should have been more
alert earlier, but we did not think that that was important now,
and that is why, among other reasons, we did not think it was a
disqualifying factor in connection with his nomination and these
hearings.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I appreciate that. Now, as I understand it,
your committee unanimously rated Judge Kennedy well-qualified
which is the highest rating he could be given for the Supreme
Court. Is that correct?

  Judge TYLER. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. NOW my own review of his record has left me
with the impression that he will be a fine addition to the Supreme
Court, and we have extensively reviewed his record.
  But let me just review, for the record, the degree to which your
committee did examine Judge Kennedy's background.
  For instance, how many federal judges did you interview in your
investigation?
  Judge TYLER. Well, including State judges, and federal judges, we
interviewed a little over three hundred. I would guess--and I have
not got the figures right in front of me--that we talked to about
260 federal judges at all levels.
  Senator HATCH. I see. Well, that group included members of the
Supreme Court as well, is that correct?
  Judge TYLER. Yes, sir.
  Senator HATCH. AS well as district and circuit court judges?
  Judge TYLER. Right. That is correct.
                                      263
  Senator HATCH. And you interviewed State court judges as well,
generally supreme court chief justices?
  Judge TYLER. Generally appellate, high-court judges in the sever-
al States. That is correct.
  Senator HATCH. All right. And some of those, I take it, were chief
judges of the supreme court?
  Judge TYLER. That is so.
  Senator HATCH. Were the judges that you interviewed basically
from the geographical area of the Ninth Federal Circuit, or, were
they from all over the country?
  Judge TYLER. NO. Across the country. Of course we made a spe-
cial effort to interview Judge Kennedy's colleagues on the ninth
circuit.
  Senator HATCH. Sure.
  Judge TYLER. But we covered the whole countryside.
  Senator HATCH. Yes, that is my understanding. How many law-
yers did you interview concerning Judge Kennedy?
  Judge TYLER. Well, as we say in the letter--but this is sort of a
shifting thing because sometimes lawyers' reports come in late. A
little over a hundred. We might have done more except that we got
such uniformly good reviews on the whole. As I explained to Sena-
tor Metzenbaum, we had some minor criticisms, but, uniformly, the
reports were so good that we decided that there was no need of just
building up the statistics in that area.
  Senator HATCH. That is great. I understand, then, that you also
interviewed lawyers nationwide, although I am sure you had to
interview a lot of lawyers in the area where he is best known?
  Judge TYLER. Well, of course the main burden, quite understand-
ably, fell within the ninth circuit, which, as you all know is a large
circuit. Mr. Andrews, who is here this morning, and our other
ninth circuit member, Samuel Williams--who would have been
here except he suffered a serious illness last week, much to our dis-
comfiture--of course spent a lot of time interviewing lawyers who
had appeared before a panel of which Judge Kennedy was a
member.
  Also, our second circuit representative, Mr. Willis of New York
City, and I, interviewed lawyers in New York who argued before
Judge Kennedy, and they were more or less--as I said to Senator
Metzenbaum--very affirmative about him.
  Senator HATCH. AS I understand it, these included lawyers who
had lost cases, as you have stated before?
  Judge TYLER. Well, occasionally, they were a little disgruntled,
but even they had to recognize that he was a pretty good judge.
  Senator HATCH. Sure. How many deans, law professors, and
scholars did you interview in reaching your opinion?
  Judge TYLER. Slightly in excess of eighty, and my recollection is
something like eighty-four.
  Senator HATCH. All right. What was the extent of your review of
his written opinions?
  Judge TYLER. Well, first of all, in the early going, we commenced
our work on December 11th, as I said to the Chairman--November
11th, I am sorry. I decided, as Chairman, that we ought to get sev-
eral law schools involved because of the time problem, and, frank-
ly, because I would like to see as many law schools get involved in
                                         264

these inquiries because they are very proud and eager to do this
work, for which we are eternally grateful, by the way.

   Also, as you would well understand, in the ninth circuit, the
judges have occasion to hear a number of environmental-law cases
of significance beyond the reach of the ninth circuit. I asked the
Vermont Law School, which has a very reputable group of environ-
mental-law people, to participate for that reason.

  Senator LEAHY. I see that was a good time to come in.
  Judge TYLER. Yes. And I hope Senator Leahy will agree with me
that they do have this capacity, because they, along with Fordham
and Pennsylvania were very useful. But basically, we tried to break
the work down so that we would get it done.
  The people in my office looked at every opinion of Judge Kenne-
dy. I do not want to say, however, that the people in my office did
the kind of analysis that a specialist, say, in the environmental-law
field would have done with environmental cases. We did not do it
that way.
  Senator HATCH. I understand that. You also reviewed opinions
where he sat on the panel but did not express a written opinion?
  Judge TYLER. Only to a very limited extent.
  Senator HATCH. Did you review his speeches and other writings?
  Judge TYLER. TO the extent we could uncover them, and I think
we saw 20 speeches, most of which were--I would call them rela-
tively informal. Those twenty I believe are the same twenty which
were delivered to this committee.
  Perhaps the most substantive one was the one which has already
come up in this hearing, I believe. The one he delivered at Stanford
in connection with what I think is called the Stanford-Canadian
Program.
  Senator HATCH. Well, it is apparent that you have done an ex-
haustive search, and done an awful lot of work as you do in all of
these Supreme Court nominations.
  Judge Tyler, during the confirmation hearings on the nomina-
tion of Judge Bork, you indicated that action would be taken to
prevent breaches of confidentiality by your committee.
  Shortly after President Reagan announced his intention to nomi-
nate Judge Ginsburg to the Supreme Court, we read commentary
in the papers from a member of your committee regarding the
problems with that nomination.
  Have you attempted to ascertain the source of that breach of
confidentiality?
  Judge TYLER. I believe I am familiar with the one that--that was
not a quotation which, if accurate, was very pleasant.
  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Judge TYLER. Not just from our internal point of view, but it
would certainly, if accurate, give the perception to the public that
the speaker had already decided in advance, before we have begun.
  Senator HATCH. Right.
  Judge TYLER. I can simply say, Senator Hatch, that as a result of
that, I called a meeting, had face-to-face conversations with every
member of our committee, and some several that could not get
there I conferred with separately later, to make it abundantly
clear, that aside and apart from our own rule, that only the chair-
man should respond to press inquiries, that the last thing that any-
                                               265

body could condone was to have somebody suggest, as a committee
member, that he or she had already made up his mind, or her
mind, before we even investigated the candidate.

  I am happy to say, that as a result, I believe that thought there
is the usual dispute as to who said what, I do not think I want to
go into that because I think that is unimportant.

  We believe that we have--knock on wood--corrected that prob-
lem, and that there has been a perception, not only in terms of any
particular individual member, but all of us, that this is something
where we are duty-bound to continue to struggle to avoid this kind
of thing.

  I do not want to say that we are perfect--we probably never will
be--but I do say that this was-I think at last came home to us all,
that whether we like it or not, we have got to be very careful about
what we say because it is harmful if we say things like that.

  Senator HATCH. Well, I appreciate that. I think that it is crucial
that this committee--I mean, you are 15 people who represent hun-
dreds of thousands of lawyers. You are 15 individuals who have
your own sets of likes and dislikes, biases and non-biases, and, to
the extent that you operate in a totally unbiased way I think you
do a terrific job.

  And we have seen it through the 11 years I have been here, and
I want to compliment you for it. But it is no secret: I was very,
very upset about the Bork matter, the way it was handled, the
press releases that occurred, the talking to the press, and then to
find it happen in Ginsburg just about blew my mind, to be honest
with you, and I just have to raise that issue.

  But I am not raising it to make your job uncomfortable here
today. I just want to make sure that in the future, that that type of
breach really does not occur, because to me, that is highly unethi-
cal for that to have occurred.

  And if there is a member on the committee who still exists there,
who did that, I really personally believe that member ought to be
removed. But be that as it may, you have satisfied me that you
have taken steps, and you are trying to do what is right here, and
you will in the future, and there will not be any breaches like this
in the future.

  Have you given any thought to removing the cloak of anonymity
from your proceedings? Now this, I will be frank to tell you, might
include making public the credentials and the selection process for
committee members, making public the individuals consulted, and
making any particular assessment, including informal contacts
with friends and political figures, and making public each mem-
ber's reasons for voting, so that we can really understand that this
is a democratic process and not some sort of a secretive process.

  Have you given any consideration to that? Because I happen to
agree with some of the editorials that have been written, particu-
larly those in the Washington Post, that this would help solve a lot
of problems, too.

  Judge TYLER. Well, I have to say in all due respect to you, Sena-
tor Hatch, and the Washington Post, I firmly disagree. We are, as I
said during the course of the hearings in September, a committee,
and not just 15 lawyers who are members of some bar association.
                                         266

  As you are well aware, and as my mail continually reminds me,
there are individuals in the ABA who do not agree with our com-
mittee's work.

  Senator HATCH. That is right.
  Judge TYLER. And indeed, we do not really speak for the entire
membership of the ABA in any event. We are a working commit-
tee.
  Senator HATCH. That is my point.
  Judge TYLER. The operational word is committee, and I, for one,
would have resigned summarily if I was just one of 15 people who
wandered in here occasionally and gave my personal views on any
candidate for appointment to the federal court, because I think it
would be a disservice to this committee, the entire Senate, and to
the nominating authority.
  Who needs me, as an individual, telling this committee what my
views are on any candidate? I think that would be monstrously off
point.
  Second of all, I do not think that I agree with the Washington
Post, which has continually said that we never gave any reasons at
all, which defies my understanding of the simple language of the
report we submitted to this committee in writing, in connection
with not only this nomination but the previous nomination.
  And third of all, I would point out that we are very hard-working
people who have to do our thing as lawyers. We are not full-time
public servants. We cannot be exposed in our offices to a camera,
or a microscope of every moment, or every conversation we have in
doing this work, which I might tell you on the record, consumes at
least 400, and often more hours a year, for which we get no com-
pensation at all.
  And by the way, in the last 5 months, this committee has proc-
essed and reported on more than twice as many nominations to
any federal court than in any previous 6 months within recent
memory, and that is not to mention the work we did on the nomi-
nation of Judge Bork, on the nomination of Judge Ginsburg, and
now, the nomination of this candidate.
  And I say to you, sir, with great firmness, that I cannot accept,
and my committee cannot accept, the constant references that we
have been reading about, that we do not tell what we do and that
we are operating in secrecy, and therefore in an invidious and
unfair manner.
  That is a totally baseless, unwarranted accusation, and I cannot
understand to this day how this persists. I am perfectly prepared
and used to the fact that we will be criticized, depending on what
happens.
  That has been true in the history of this committee for some 35
years, and we accept that. But to say that we have to have the sun-
shine laws apply to us, or that we have to individually account,
would really turn the whole process, and the work of your commit-
tee, sir, on its head.
  Senator HATCH. Well, Judge, let me just say this. Excuse me, Mr.
Chairman. I just want to make a couple of comments.
  I agree with most everything you have said, except the last part,
and I have total respect for you, and I think
  Judge TYLER. That is not the point. I understand that.
                                                    267

  Senator HATCH. Well, I understand that, but I am just making
the point, I have respect for you, and I have chatted with you, and
I know that you have tried to do the very best job you can, and it is
a very thankless job that you are not paid for, that takes a lot of
time that you could be using for many benefits for others.

  But let me tell you, in the most firm way I can, too: A lot of us
up here were pretty embittered by what happened to Judge Bork,
and by the report that occurred with regard to Judge Bork.

  And I do not have any problems when the committee completely
agrees, unanimously, that a judge is not qualified, or a judge is
well-qualified. I do not have any problems with questions. Maybe if
he is not qualified, I would, because I think the individual deserves,
perhaps, at least a public elucidation as to why he is unqualified
rather than just the general statements that normally come out in
these hearings.

  But let me tell you, when something happens to a judge, like
happened to Judge Bork, who 5 years before was given an excep-
tionally well-qualified rating, and then all of a sudden, 5 years
later, after writing better than a 100 opinions that were not re-
versed, and participating in over 400 that were not reversed, and
there were four who--it appears to me, for very partisan, political
reasons, did what they did--they ought to have to come in here
and explain why they did it.

  And I do not care whether they are volunteers in this process, or
not. We have to. We are elected, and we face this, and we choose to
do this. Well, you do, too.

  It just is not fair to these nominees whose whole lives are put on
the docket. It just is not fair to them to not have that.

  So you and I respectfully disagree on that point, and I will tell
you this. If we see another repeat of what happened to Judge Bork,
that this Senator is going to do everything in his power to make
sure that there will be explanations given in full, fair, and open
hearings. Fair to you, fair to the nominee.

  And that is regardless of what unpleasantness might occur. I just
think it has to be.

  Judge TYLER. If I may say so, Senator, I think our difference is
not really

  Senator THURMOND. Speak in your microphone. I cannot hear
you.

  Judge TYLER. Yes. I do not think we are really joining the argu-
ment fairly. We are not suggesting, or I am not suggesting that we
are being treated unfairly in the sense you have just mentioned.
Not at all. We have always been treated courteously.

  Senator HATCH. We think so.
  Judge TYLER. Where I think our problem is is this: we did our
level best to explain why we came out--both the majority and the
minority--in respect to Judge Bork. I certainly
  Senator HATCH. YOU did.
  Judge TYLER [continuing]. Do not think that it is fair, therefore,
to say that we never explained ourselves. Now it is true, I refused,
as you know, to identify who voted which way, and the reasons for
that I think I have explained sufficiently for you at least to under-
stand, whether you agree or not.
                                      268
   I think, therefore, what probably is at issue here is, that where
we come up and do not come out one way, or the other, unanimous-
ly, you seem to feel that that is a difficult problem
  Senator HATCH. It is.
  Judge TYLER [continuing]. And I do not quite understand that,
because it seems to me, that if we always came out unanimously on
everything, you will recall that years ago, this committee was criti-
cized because they always did come out unanimously.
  So we are sort of damned if we do, or damned if we do not. I do
not understand that argument, frankly.
  Senator HATCH. Well, I will tell you why I think it is a good ar-
gument. Because I think due process, in these proceedings, literally
does require that--yes, you tried to explain what the 15 members
had to say, in general, but of course nobody had a chance to hear
what the four had to say specifically, and see, that is where the
process seemed to break down to me.
  And you know, I just think that under those circumstances, the
nominee, especially for a position of this type of power and author-
ity, and prestige and capacity, really ought to have the benefit of
whether or not there were politics involved, whether or not there
was really that good of a consideration involved.
  Judge TYLER. YOU remember, Senator Hatch, that in September,
in response to a letter to me as chairperson, from Senator Metz-
enbaum, I wrote back saying that, look, we, as a committee, known
as the ABA standing committee on the federal judiciary, should not
be understood to be coming in and making the judgments that the
Senate of the United States is empowered to make, and we certain-
ly are not.
  That meant, among other things, that we had no right to tell you
when we made our recommendation--whatever it was under our
standards--that we were here to endorse a position that you would
take in your public role that you performed.
  Now that being so, I do not see what good it would do--and
indeed, I can see a lot of harm that would be done--realizing that
we are not a public group, that we suddenly become 15 separate
lawyers who, if we should vote one way as opposed to another,
would have to come in here and individually explain ourselves.
  I think that would make no sense at all, and I do not see how
anybody would want to be a member of this committee. I certainly
would not.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator
  Senator HATCH. My time has expired.
  The CHAIRMAN. I would like to suggest, in light of the fact that it
was raised, that the letter dated September 4th, to Senator Metz-
enbaum from Judge Tyler, and a letter dated August 26th to Judge
Tyler from Senator Metzenbaum, be entered in the record at this
time.

 Harold R. Tyler, Jr.
 Chairman, Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary

    of the American Bar Association
 Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler
 30 Rockefeller Plaza
 New York, New Tork 10112

 Dear Hr. Tyler:

         The Senate Committee on the Judiciary will soon consider the
 nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to be Associate Justice of the
 Supreme Court. Because of the importance of the nomination, I believe
 it is useful to clarify the role of the American Bar Association in
 reviewing this nomination and in submitting a report to the Committee.

         Traditionally, the ABA's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary
 has submitted a report on the qualifications of a judicial nominee to
 the Committee. For example, in the case of the nomination of William
Rehnquist, to Jbe.Cftief Justice, the ABA sent a letter dated July 29,
 1986, to the Committee and represenatives of the ABA testified before
 the Committee.

         The July 29 letter contains this statement: "Consistent with its
 long standing tradition, the Committee has not concerned itself with
 Justice Rehnquist's general political ideology or bis views on issues
 except to the extent that such matters might bear on Judicial
 temperament and integrity." The identical statement was included in
 the August 5, 1986, letter to the Committee regarding the nomination of
 Judge Antonin Scalia to be Associate Justice. Both these letters
 concluded with the statement that the nominees met the ABA standards
 for "professional competence, judicial temperament and integrity" and
 were well qualified.

          In testifying before the Committee regarding the nomination of
 Judge Scalia, the representative of the ABA stated: "I think we make it
 very clear in the second paragraph of our letter that the committee's
 evaluation of Judge Scalia is based on its investigation of his
 professional competence, judicial temperament, and integrity. We go on
 to say consistent with its long standing tradition, the committee's
                                 270

investigation did not cover Judge Scalia's general political ideology
or bis views on issues except to the extent that such matters might
bear on judicial temperament or integrity." (Hearings before the
Judiciary Committee regarding the nomination of Judge Scalia, August
5-6, 1987, pp. 125-6.)

        These statements indicate that the ABA Committee's report and
findings in the case of judicial nominees, including nominees to the
Supreme Court, are limited to issues of professional qualifications,
judicial temperament and integrity. The ABA's findings necessarily do
not include all issues possibly relevant to confirmation. Thus, the
committee does not and could not take a position on the ultimate issue
of whether the nominee should be confirmed. Neverthless, the
representative of the American Bar Association in testifying about the
nomination of Justice Rehnquist stated that the Committee recommended
that the nominee be confirmed. Senator Thurmond asked: "Do you
gentlemen of the Committee recommend him to the Senate Judiciary
Committee to be approved by this Committee and the Senate?" Mr.
Lafitte on behalf of the ABA replied: "That is our recommendation,
sir." (See Hearings regarding the nomination of Justice Rehnquist, July
29-August 1, 1987, p. 129.)

         Please clarify the position of the American Bar Association as to
whether its report and findings are limited to qualifications, judicial
temperament and integrity or whether they encompass other issues that
may be relevant to confirmation, including the views the nominee holds
on basic questions of Constitutional interpretation. Also, please state
whether the American Bar Association nevertheless takes a position on
the ultimate issue of confirmation.

         I would appreciate your reply at your earliest convenience. Thank
you for your assistance and cooperation.

            Jerome j Sheltack      me to report that the position of this Committee for many
                                   years has been and continues to be essentially as set

            FOURTH CIRCUIT                          In reviewing the history of the reports to the
         lame* A. Howard, Sr       Senate Judiciary Committee in connection with nominees for
110 Finl Vinrina Bank Tower        the Supreme Court of the United States, it seems clear
      101 SI Taufi Boulevard       that in order to best serve the interests of the Senate,
            Norfolk. VA23S1O       this committee has sought, as it should, to focus its re-

               Gene w Lafitte      Thus, this committee should not address the nominees' po-
                                   litical, ideological or philosophical views on specific
  --2 New Orleans. LA 70139      issues, except to the extent that such matters might bear
                                   on the aforesaid questions of judicial temperament or

                                                    Further, it would seem to follow that this com-
             S2 East Gay Street    mittee should not specifically recommend to the Senate how

                                   thetically, I recognize that a report of the committee
            SEVENTH CIRCUIT        finding a nominee Well Qualified might be construed by
                    loanM Hall     some as equivalent to a firm recommendation to the Senate.
                                   Yet, upon sober analysis, since the committee expressly
                 One IBM Plaza     disclaims any opinion u[on issues which we assume that the

                                   any finding we might make would not be justified.

   The CHAIRMAN. And Judge Tyler, you think you have a problem
with Senator Hatch, that you came in 10-4. If you had come in--or
10-5. If you had come in unanimous against Bork, he really would
have been upset.

  I yield to the Senator from Vermont.
  Senator LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will only take a few
minutes. I am going to have to leave. The Agriculture committees
have two conferences, one on farm credit, and one on the Reconcili-
ation Bill. The latter one is even more important, I would say to
my colleagues here, because I understand, from the Majority
Leader, depending upon what I and my committee do on that, will
affect whether we will recess, or adjourn this weekend, or whether
we will go into next week. So I will be urging my other colleagues
here to leave to go to that committee conference.
  The CHAIRMAN. We urge you to leave, Senator.
  Senator LEAHY. Probably the quicker the better.
  I would note, because of the comments that went on just in the
past few minutes, there seems to be some kind of a feeling here
that the ABA sunk the Bork nomination, or advertising groups
sunk the Bork nomination, or pressure groups sunk the Bork nomi-
nation. That is not so. Judge Bork is the one witness that really
counted on the Bork nomination, and it was his testimony--and I
think he was candid and honest--but it was his testimony that de-
termined that he was not going to go on the Supreme Court. It was
not the testimony of the ABA, or of anybody else.

  If you watched the public-opinion polls during that time, and the
American public during the time when Judge Bork was testifying,
the majority of people stated that they did not want him on the
Supreme Court. I have not heard of any Senators who voted either
for or against Judge Bork who said they based their decision on
anything other than his testimony here.

  Now I think the ABA was helpful, and I think you are helpful in
all of these. I think you are helpful here today. And the other wit-
nesses for and against Judge Bork were helpful. But ultimately it
was his testimony that was the only one that really counted.

  So I said at the beginning of these hearings, the same with Judge
Kennedy. He is the one indispensible witness, and the one witness
that makes or breaks the case. Now many have said that he will be
confirmed. If so, it will be because of his testimony. Your testimony
is valuable, certainly. It substantiates and buttresses the impres-
sions many have of Judge Kennedy.

  Others will testify against him, and that may also speak to con-
cerns that some members of this panel will have. But he really is
the one who makes or breaks it. I think ail of you would agree with
that, that it is the candidate himself, or herself, that affects the
final determination. No nefarious group, no cabal, no collective
conspiracy sunk the Bork nomination.

  After the testimony was heard from Judge Bork, the Senate,
with the largest vote against a Supreme Court nominee in history,
voted against him, Republicans and Democrats alike. That was not
because of some action behind closed doors at the ABA, and it was
not because of ads that ran either for or against him, and a lot did.
It was because of him himself.
                                               273

  And that is really something we should not lose sight of--that
each Senator ultimately has to make the judgment for himself, or
herself, on the testimony and the background, and the character,
and the judicial philosophy of the candidate. That is what we have
always done.

  Of course, none of us got to vote on Judge Ginsburg. There, the
determination was made by the White House, which sent him a
very pointed message to get out, and to his credit he/did. But that
was not because of the ABA or anybody else.

  Now let's not lose sight of the fact that the same thing will
happen here; Judge Kennedy will be confirmed, or not confirmed,
based on what he has said, his background, his capabilities, and his
judicial philosophy.

  And let's not put up red herrings, or straw men, to say this is
why the administration lost this particular one, or this is why they
won this particular one. I do not think the ABA would want to
think that they would have some kind of a power, that they could
automatically declare who would or would not go on the Court.
You do a very valuable service in giving us your information, and I
am pleased with that.

  You were split on Judge Bork. So was the United States Senate.
So were the people of this country. There were people passionately
for Judge Bork. There were people passionately against Judge
Bork. There were Senators strongly for him, there were Senators
strongly against him, and there were people within the administra-
tion, on both sides. Is it any wonder that the highly talented, com-
pletely competent--and I have every reason to believe--totally
honest lawyers on the American Bar Association--would also be
split? You know, it is only realistic to expect.

  Now I commented as I came in--if you will allow just a second of
parochialism--you were mentioning the Vermont law school and
their environmental program, and I am delighted to hear you men-
tion that. With the new dean, Doug Costle, I suspect that they will
probably even be more strenuously environmental, and I am glad
you called on them.

  Mr. Chairman, I am sorry to take so long, but I just do not want
anybody who is watching this hearing, or watched the last hearing,
or listened to it, or read about it, to think that the groups for or
against a nominee are here for anything other than to give guid-
ance or to give information to the Senators. But the Senators, each
one of us, have to ultimately make up our minds, based on the can-
didate, himself or herself.

  And that really is what decides whether the candidate, himself
or herself, will go on the Court or will not. And I think that this
committee will be pretty much reflective of the views of the Ameri-
can people. It has in the past, I think it was in the Judge Bork
nomination, and I suspect it will be with Judge Kennedy. Thank
you very much, Mr. Chairman.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. I hope your conference goes quicker
than the statements, so we can all get out of here.

  Senator LEAHY. I tried not to take more time than Senator Hatch
did.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU were well within your time and took about
a third as much time as Senator Hatch.
                                  274

     Nonetheless, I hdpe we move this along, and I am sure Judge
Tyler enjoys knowing what we think of him, we all love him with
great affection, and I imagine he hopes he does not have to be back
in this room for another year. The fact of the matter is, Judge,
your committee has had the dubious distinction of having to proc-
ess more judges in a shorter amount of time, of greater controversy
and consequence than probably any standing committee the ABA
has in the history of the committee.       \
     I think you have done it with great dispatch. I will not speak to
it any more. I yield to my colleague from South Carolina who
asked to intervene for a moment, and then I am going to make a
particular request.
     Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I am going to ask you to
excuse me until this afternoon, to attend a funeral in South Caroli-
na. J.P. Strom, the chief of the South Carolina Law Enforcement
Division passed away the day before yesterday. He happens to be a
cousin of mine as well as a friend, and I will return as soon as I
can this afternoon.
     Now I just want to say before leaving, on this question of dis-
crimination, that I am bitterly opposed to discrimination.
     An organization that deals with issues, and deals with the public,
and so forth, is one thing. A purely personal group that wants to
meet, whether it is women or men, it seems to me would have a
right to meet.
     So I just want to pass on to you what I think. I do not think
there ought to be any discrimination on account of race or color,
sex, religion, or national origin. As I say, I am greatly opposed to
it.
     A few years ago, Senator Kennedy and I wrote a letter to Judge
Bailey Brown opposing invidious discrimination. Invidious discrimi-
nation, as I interpret it from the dictionary--and I have a copy of
the dictionary here--is harmful or injurious. No rightful person
should favor discrimination of that kind.
     Now, I do want to say that some time ago we had a judge before
us who was a member of the Masons. I took the position that that
should not bar him from being a judge. George Washington was a
Mason. Many prominent people in the past were Masons. Six mem-
bers of this committee are Masons. A large number of the members
of the Senate and the Congress are Masons. The Majority Leader of
the Senate is a Mason, for instance. I do not think anyone should
be discriminated against on that account.
     Now, some time ago I believe the Federation of Women's Law-
yers wrote in. I understand that they do not have any men law-
yers. Well, I am looking into that organization to see whether it
deals with issues and deals with the public and should be in the
category of where there should be no discrimination. But just
purely personal, it seems to me, any group of persons could get to-
gether in a personal way, that does not have to deal with the
public, does not ask for any tax exemption, and does not take an
active part that involves the public, I see no reason why they
should be discriminated against.
     Now, Mr. Chairman, again, I want to thank you, and I will be
back as soon as I can.
                                                   275

  Judge, I want to thank you and the members of your committee
for coming here this morning and the fine report you made. I wish
you continued success in what you are doing.

  Judge TYLER. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Before you leave, Mr. Chairman, your asking my
permission to leave is a little bit like a 300-pound gorilla asking
whether or not he can get out of the cage. You can do whatever
you want to do, and I am delighted you even ask.
  But on a more serious note, let me ask unanimous consent of my
colleagues that we go for 2 minutes into executive session for the
purpose of passing on some nominees so they can get to the floor
and hopefully be confirmed prior to us adjourning.
  Senator THURMOND. I certainly favor that, Mr. Chairman, be-
cause I have advocated that, and I want to thank you for agreeing
to it.
  [Recess.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Our next questioner is the Senator from Wyo-
ming, Senator Simpson.
  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank
you, too, for moving along those nominations. We will make good
progress there, and I know that that is your goal, too.
  I wish the Senator from Vermont had stuck around for a minute
there. I did not want all that to go uncommented on. Someone will
come up to me often and say, "Oh, you are the bald, gray-haired
guy from Vermont." And I say, "No, I am not; no, I am not. That is
not true." I do not know what they say when he is confronted with
that, but Pat and I have some interesting and rich discussions. I
enjoy and admire him very much.
  I would just say that I would surely challenge what he just said.
I believe I said he did not want anybody to know that this had hap-
pened the way that people who were Bork supporters said it hap-
pened. That is really an extraordinary statement that the candi-
date himself makes or breaks the case. I would love to believe that.
It was indeed not the case with Judge Bork. He was clobbered from
seaside, coast to coast, to mountain range in the entire United
States in the most grotesque way.
  I just wanted to say if Pat had been here, "Bah, humbug," would
have been a proper phrase at this time of the year. So I would say
it now, because what was really interesting to me. I must share
with my colleagues, I received a great deal of mail from around the
United States after the Bork hearing. I kept a lot of them that
said: Let me tell you something, Simpson. I liked what you did, or I
did not like what you did. But I want to tell you, I am a McGovern
Democrat or a Kennedy Democrat. I have been a Democrat forever.
I will die a Democrat. I did not like Bork. I did not like what he
stood for, and I am glad he is not on the Supreme Court. But I am
offended and embarrassed at the way it was done. Shocked, sad-
dened and disappointed in my country.
  Now, that is what they said. I have got a nice bale of those, and
they are moving letters. And I send them to people who write
about Bork. Then to go through it on the floor and have some of
your colleagues you deeply respect come up to you and say: "Boy,
you know, I am embarrassed. I got trapped in August, and I could
not get out of the box. I got trapped in September when I was

   90-878 0 - 89 - 10
                                                  276

home because I read all the stuff and I believed it. I did not know
there was that other side, had not heard Jack Danforth speak
about this man who was his professor, has not heard these things
come up, did not know the intensity of fair-minded people when
they got into the blood spore tracking system."

  Now, that is the way that was. So I think we want to keep that
in perspective if we are going to keep anything in perspective with
regard to that. That is why I come back to it. It will not be me
coming back to it. They will be teaching that one in constitutional
law classes for the rest of the decades about how to do a number on
a man's reputation.

  Now, that is my view. Everybody has their own. I have never
been reluctant to express mine.

  Now, I want to thank the American Bar for your very swift work
on this nomination. You really did do this one; it must have taken
a tremendous effort to get this one to us. You see, the thing is is
whether you like it or not, somehow the American Bar has become
a bigger player than they should be here. I was a member of the
American Bar for many years. You are simply another player in
the group, and yet we have given you a status, we have elevated
you to a position of some type of omnipotence or something. We do
not have a hearing until we know where you are. We do not pro-
ceed until we have had the word from the ABA, and I do not think
that is right.

  I think you must remember that you have a limited role like
anyone else in the United States of America. Maybe that is our
fault. Maybe we have done that. I think probably it is. But it is a
limited role. You know, we look toward you. We love to toast you
to the heavens when you support our nominees, and we love to
hoot you down when you do not. We have all done that. Do not go
back and look at my collected mutterings. You will see, "I think
the ABA did a magnificent job with this nominee." Then I will say
it the other way when it goes the opposite direction.

  But I do have the same concern that was shared previously. I
will not belabor it, but it just seems, you know, to kind of crystal-
lize things, how could Robert Bork have deteriorated that much in
five-and-a-half years? I mean, how did he go from the toast of the
town to the poop of the year? And all the while, all the while, only
doing things which were never challenged by the U.S. Supreme
Court.

  So to come in and then tell us about these marvelous things
about political ideology or ideology, whichever term you wish to
use and the definition, that it is prohibited there, and then to do
that vote on Bork and then to release the figures and then to not
believe that that had something to do with this when it was front-
page news all over the United States: "ABA Rejects Bork." That is
what it said, all over the United States. When you read it and you
found out they had not rejected Bork; it was ten to four. But that is
the way it came out. The four were unknown to us and still remain
so, while we have to trot out all our work in here right under these
lights. That is the way it ought to be, and that is the way it ought
to be for the ABA the next time. I am going to help assure that it
is, because I think it is wrong to give anonymity to some guy who
                                                   277

has got a political idea about a nominee trying to shroud himself in
a bunch of stuff.

  Now, then another thing that is absolutely fascinating to me, we
hear about these clubs and we hear about discrimination. Discrimi-
nation against blacks and whites and women and Hispanics and
rights and all that. You know something? The U.S. Senate is not
bound by any of that stuff. Not a bit of it. We do not practice that
ourselves. We go through our day firing people, hiring people. We
have congressmen who discriminate against blacks, against whites,
against Hispanics, against women. They will never tell you that;
they do not have to. They have no legal reason to tell you. We can
hire and fire people. They have no employment rights. They have
no pension rights. They are just raw meat. That is us. Do not miss
who I am talking about. That is 535 of us.

  Isn't that fascinating? And yet you hear all this stuff all day
long. I do not see any of my colleagues putting in bills to change
that. I do not know of any hearings going on to change that. I do
not hear any speeches going on to change that. Yet I hear it all day
long.

  Let me tell you. L* -J them up in the other alley is the way we do
it here. And fhey do not nave any way to challenge it in any way.
Just hit the road, buster. You are done here. You are not working
for me any ir re.

  Now, that is the way it is. I think we ought to kind of bring that
back occasionally and kind of review it.

  Then I am going to throw out the eternal challenge, which may
be the death of me. But I am going to stay in the Elks Club, and
regardless of how long I stay here, I will remain in the Elks Club. I
am going to stay in the Alfalfa Club. I am the vice president now. I
have no choice.

  That is the way it is. I have not the slightest desire to spent a
whit of my life denigrating or belittling women. It is absolutely
absurd. I married a lady 33 years ago that was an activist then, an
activist now, and is a dazzling person. For heaven's sake, to go
through this exercise. * * *

  Well, enough of that. Good heavens; it's the Christmas season.
  "Anyone that goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips
should be boiled in his own pudding with a stake of holly through
his heart." I remember that. I shan't do that.
  Well, now, that was too much watching Ronald Colman or listen-
ing to Ronald Colman in my youth, doing Ebenezer Scrooge.
  I just have one question. As you did your work here--and you
did good work, and I commend you--it was swift work, and you
helped us. You did go through an extraordinary cross-section of
human beings in your work. I was very impressed by that.
  Would you say that as you came up with this very, I would call
it, glowing recommendation of Judge Kennedy that in view of that
should not your comments, unanimously held, should not those
comments properly alleviate the concerns of some representatives
of minorities and women's organizations who believe there is some
cause for concern in this nomination? Would you not say that
should be a helpful guide to them?
  Judge TYLER. Well, Senator, I really cannot answer that. We, as
you know, have expressed our views. Whether this will impress
                                         278

others, I am not sure at all. We can only say what we say on the
basis of what we found out.

   Senator SIMPSON. I am not arguing that. I am just saying what
you say, do you not think that should alleviate the concerns of
others who seem to have some feeling that he is going to be tough
on minorities' or women's rights?

  Judge TYLER. Well, I am not sure who is saying that.
   Senator SIMPSON. Well, we have some people that are going to
come here and say that.
  Judge TYLER. Well, we certainly encountered no evidence that
would support that. As we say in our letter, one of the pervasive
sentiments that we got in our interviews was that this was a man
who was a judge who sticks to the issues and tries to be fair within
the limits of his ability and to approach matters without a preor-
dained approach or agenda.
  There is no doubt that that is what we learned.
  Senator SIMPSON. I know. And in your letter, you said that you
had interviewed these various people, and you had also interviewed
people and judges who are women or members of minority groups.
Did any of them express to you a rich abiding concern about this
man?
  Judge TYLER. Well, we did not get any submissions that I know
of, with the possible exception of a copy of a letter from the Na-
tional Organization of Women. What we did was interview profes-
sionals who happened to be male and female and black and white.
There was no breakout on any ethnic, racial or religious lines that
we could perceive. This judge was viewed as a person in his career
who was, on the whole, very much respected, and it had nothing to
do with gender or sex or race at all, as best we could determine
from our interview.
  Senator SIMPSON. That is what I was inquiring about. It did not
arise with this man.
  Judge TYLER. NOW, that does not mean that some organization
does not have the right to disagree with us. Obviously, we can only
do what we do.
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes, fine. And you did interview sitting Jus-
tices and former Justices, did you not? I do not care to know their
names.
  Judge TYLER. NO, no. I do not think we interviewed any former
Justices. We interviewed senior appellate judges and I think one or
two senior district judges. As far as Justices, we confined ourselves
to the present members of the high court.
  Senator SIMPSON. Okay, but they were Supreme Court Justices?
  Judge TYLER. We interviewed them all, yes, sir.
  Senator SIMPSON. All of them?
  Judge TYLER. Yes, sir.
  Senator SIMPSON. And as I say, I do not want to know the con-
tent of those interviews, but apparently there were no concerns
that have been expressed to us?
  Judge TYLER. That is a fair inference, sir.
  Senator SIMPSON. I thank you very much, Judge Tyler.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  The Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin.
  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Tyler
                                         279

  The CHAIRMAN. Would you unsheathe your microphone, Senator?
Thank you.

  Senator HEFLIN. Judge Tyler, the American Bar Standing Com-
mittee on the Federal Judiciary is a little different in membership
from what it was in the consideration of when Judge Bork was
before the committee; is that not true?

  Judge TYLER. Well, let us see. That is not quite true simply be-
cause of the coincidental shifting. Remember, we started

  Senator HEFLIN. A new president comes in--I am seeking to find
out if there are members of the American Bar Standing Committee
now, who were not members when Judge Bork was considered. Are
they all the same?

  Judge TYLER. Yes, sir.
  Senator HEFLIN. I was under the impression, for example, that
Mr. Bob Fiske was on it, and that now Mr. Willis of New York is
on the committee.
  Judge TYLER. Well, what happened, Senator was this: When we
started the work on Judge Bork, as you point out and know, Mr.
Fiske was chairperson. Then I took over under the ABA proce-
dures, but we asked Mr. Fiske to come down here with me because
he had done so much work on the nomination of Judge Bork.

  Senator HEFLIN. I suppose Mr. Andrews probably dealt more
with lawyers that had appeared before Judge Kennedy and inter-
viewed those more than any other member of the committee; is
that correct?

  Mr. ANDREWS. Sir, I interviewed a number of them, but also the
members from the New York and East also interviewed a number
of lawyers that had appeared before him.

  Senator HEFLIN. Most of those were those in the ninth circuit?

   Mr. ANDREWS. Yes.

  Senator HEFLIN. NOW, did you have any assistance or help, or did
you do it yourself?

  Mr. ANDREWS. There are two representatives from the ninth cir-
cuit: Sam Williams out of California, and I am from Seattle. What
we do is divide up the ninth circuit because of its size. Sam does
most of those around California, and I do the fringes.

  Senator HEFLIN. I see. Now, there are a couple of matters that
probably are of no real consequence, but maybe I should ask you
about it. It appears that there was some complaint by Dr.
Hallowell about a lawsuit that challenged the State-wide legislative
redistricting and reapportionment made by the California legisla-
ture after 1980. I think that she and her husband even charged
that there was a conspiracy to thwart their lawsuit and named
Judge Kennedy in it.

  Would you give us some explanation pertaining to that?
  Judge TYLER. Let me answer that one, Senator, because the
Hallowells delivered a mound of documents to us very late in our
work. It is true that apparently they sent some to Mr. Williams,
who unfortunately suffered a stroke several days ago. So we were
never able to hear from him on this issue.
  However, the papers of the Hallowells--and there are many,
many, many. And I use that word three times with good basis in
the record. Applications to almost all of the judges on the ninth cir-
                                         280

cuit were presented to me. I am embarrassed and chagrined to
have to report that I read them, and my eyes glazed over early.

  The only tactful thing I can say is as follows: First, it is clear to
me that the Hallowells did not really appear before Judge Kenne-
dy, as much as they claim they did now. They were before every-
body, including Chief Judge Browning. Their arguments were con-
sidered ad nauseam by a number of panels.

  I am convinced that the notoriety of Judge Kennedy has dictated
that they now center their fire on him; whereas, if you analyze
their briefs, their petitions, their appeals, Judge Kennedy was a
very minor bit player in all of this.

  Hence, I did not even think at the last minute--getting all this
material--required that I recircuiate a vote of all of us. I concluded
that I would report to you or anybody else on this committee
myself since I had the dubious pleasure of getting all this material
and having read it over this past weekend.

  The CHAIRMAN. If the Senator will yield for a moment. If I am
not mistaken, I have literally a box or more of material relating to
this in my office. I believe the gentleman in question was the gen-
tleman who stopped me in the hall yesterday. He was insisting less
that I investigate Judge Kennedy than that, as he called it, the cor-
ruption of the ninth circuit. It was the ninth circuit, the entire cir-
cuit that he was seeking to be investigated. I am not at all sur-
prised, Judge Tyler, your eyes glazed over early.

  Judge TYLER. I am putting my reaction, I am afraid, even there
tactfully.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, as I said, I thought it was a matter that
probably not any great consequence ought to be given to.

  There is another matter that causes me slight concern, and that
is the matter pertaining to the Van Sickle matter. This largely was
reported on the basis of financial income coming in from his repre-
senting a woman in a divorce case before he went on the bench on
a contingent fee basis. He finally settled it, and there is no ques-
tion about the finance aspect of it.

  This raised some question in my mind because the American
Bar's Canons of Ethics indicate that a divorce proceeding should
not be taken on a contingent fee basis. Now, those Canons were
adopted, I believe, after the divorce case started. I believe it started
in 1979. Probably the canons of ethics were adopted after that. It
may have been a difference between a disciplinary rule and an eth-
ical consideration. I think whatever was adopted and whatever the
American Bar had was after. I do not raise that issue.

  But there is some issue, and I would like for you to give some
thought to it and maybe give me an answer. As I understood it, at
the time California was a community property State. Based on
that, is there any ethical issue that you would see under existing
rules at the time in 1969 that could cause any problem as to wheth-
er it might have been improper to have taken a divorce case on a
contingent fee basis?

  Judge TYLER. Senator, I am frank to say that this aspect that you
are now raising in that matter, I do not believe that we ever ad-
dressed. It seemed to us that because of the first point you made
that there was nothing wrong here with what happened. So I am
afraid that, unless one of my colleagues has an inspiration here, we
                                         281

will have to respond to you later, because we never focused on this
aspect.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I do not think there was any rule at that
particular time. This is in 1969. I have gone back into it and
checked it out. My State is not a community property State. But
the rationale that has motivated the American Bar now to promul-
gate a model canon of ethics pertaining to it does raise some issue.

  It is quite stale, and I do not really give it a great deal of consid-
eration. But I was interested since the American Bar has promul-
gated such a rule as to whether or not this is something that you
did consider. If so, what would be your feelings on it?

  Mr. ELAM. I do not think, Senator Heflin, we did consider that.
You are absolutely correct that there is an evolving standard in
the ABA as it relates to that subject; namely, that contingency fees
are not recommended in divorce matters. I also believe that was
clearly subsequent to the time that Judge Kennedy was in private
practice.

  Senator HEFLIN. I do not think there is any question about that;
it is subsequent.

  Now, has the report of the American Bar been entered into the
record?

  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, it has been.
  Senator HEFLIN. It has been. All right.
  Now, in evaluating Judge Kennedy's nomination, I suppose you
discussed the nomination with the sitting judges in the ninth cir-
cuit. Mr. Andrews, that is a pretty good number of judges. How
many judges are on the ninth circuit now?
  Mr. ANDREWS. We are over 20 now.
  Senator HEFLIN. Did you discuss with each of them Judge Kenne-
dy and his background, their opinions of him, their feelings about
him?
  Mr. ANDREWS. Yes, sir. Everyone that was available. I think
there were two that we did not get to. We got to every other one.
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU got to all except two?

   Mr. ANDREWS. Yes, sir.

  Senator HEFLIN. And what was generally your responses from
them?

  Mr. ANDREWS. In my experience in talking to judges in rating
other judges, he received the highest rating and highest acclaim of
any judge that I have ever talked to. They had a deep and abiding
respect for his sense of justice, for his ability to give everyone a fair
hearing, and to make a decision on the facts before him. That came
from judges that enjoyed a reputation of being liberal and judges
that also enjoyed a reputation of being conservative.

  Senator HEFLIN. I have been handed by a member of staff a
statement to the effect on the previous question about the model
code of professional responsibility, which the ABA adopted in 1969,
it served as a basis for professional responsibility in most States.
Now, that was in 1969, but it is my understanding that California
had not adopted it, and this was as of 1969.

  Mr. ANDREWS. That is my understanding.
  Senator HEFLIN. SO I think that even if it were to be in 1969 that
most of the States did not start adopting the model code or modi-
fied model codes until several years thereafter. So I do not think it
                                         282

was controlling. But that issue about community property and the
rationale is something that entered my mind. But there was no
prohibition even from an ethical consideration. As I understand it,
under this model you had disciplinary rules which were outright
prohibitions, ethical considerations which were aspirational rela-
tive to how a lawyer should carry out his conduct. This being an
ethical consideration, an EC, it was not then, even under the
American Bar as of that time, binding.

  Mr. ANDREWS. That is correct.
  Senator HEFLIN. Just to have that accurately stated.
  Are any of you from community property states?

   Mr. ANDREWS. Yes.

  Senator HEFLIN. IS there any more of a rationale which seeming-
ly motivated the American Bar in its promulgation of this rule
that would be applicable more to a community property State than
it would to a non-community property State?

  Mr. ANDREWS. Certainly. The problem of a contingent fee in a di-
vorce proceeding would be much more glaring in a community
property state. The ethical problems would be much more severe
there.

  Mr. ELAM. Senator Heflin, I am reminded, I do not believe Cali-
fornia now ever adopted the code of professional responsibility
which was recommended by the ABA in 1969.

  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I do not think there is any violation of
any rule. Of course, even in 1969 it was not a disciplinary rule; it
was an ethical consideration known as EC-220. But I just raised
the question about the rationale. I do not think, really, that is too
important, but it was just an issue that struck me.

  That is all.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Before I yield to my colleague from Iowa, I point out that we are
approaching 2 hours, and Christmas. The Senator from Iowa.
[Laughter.]
  Which is unfair. I did not pick you, Senator. It just struck me
now. It was not directed at you. It was directed at myself.
  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU will have a hard time convincing me of
that.
  The CHAIRMAN. I promise you. Take all the 3 minute you need.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Judge Tyler, referring again to the Washing-
ton Post article that Senator Hatch previously referred to, and re-
minding you that on November 4, 1987, six members of this com-
mittee sent you a letter about that article--and that letter was
signed by Senators Thurmond, Hatch, Simpson, Specter, Humphrey
and myself--I would like to quote three paragraphs from that
letter.
  "The committee member in question"--referring to the commit-
tee member of the ABA--"reportedly indicated that"--and I
quote--'"There are concerns that Ginsburg shares many of the con-
servative ideological beliefs that doomed the Bork nomination." He
or she was further quoted as stating, and I quote again, "It looks to
me like we may be going from a Bork to a Bork-let."
  Then going on in the letter, "This statement indicates that, con-
trary to the standing committee's own standards and guidelines,
the nominee's ideology will be a major focus of the evaluation. It
                                         283

also reveals a manifest prejudgment as to the nominee's ideological
beliefs before the investigation is ever begun. Moreover, the phras-
ing used by the anonymous member and the parallels he or she
draws to the Bork evaluation give every indication that the
member has prejudged the outcome."

  Then one last paragraph to quote from. "Aside from the content
of the remark, the very fact that they were given to the press is
very disturbing. The standing committee's own guidelines and past
testimony stressed the critical importance of confidentiality and
discretion in the evaluation process, yet the Post story reveals an
apparent breach of confidentiality and one highly prejudicial to the
nominee at the very outset of the investigation. The impropriety of
these prejudicial remarks is underscored by the fact that the
member in question was careful to give them under the cloak of
anonymity."

  Now, I listened to your lecture on the need for confidentiality,
but I think that I have got to know whether or not you did find out
who that anonymous committee member was.

  Judge TYLER. Well, first of all, Senator Grassley
  Senator GRASSLEY. Did you try to find out who the member was?
  Judge TYLER. Yes. I do not know why we have to go through this.
I answered this when Senator Hatch posed it.
  Senator GRASSLEY, YOU did try to find out?
  Judge TYLER. Surely. And I agreed, when Senator Hatch said
this, that we had a meeting. Those who could not make the meet-
ing were spoken
  Senator GRASSLEY. Did you discipline the person?
  Judge TYLER. I have no power to discipline any
  Senator GRASSLEY. IS the person still on the committee?
  Judge TYLER. AS I said before, he is. Surely.
  I have no power, Senator Grassley, to discipline anybody. You
have got to understand that I am not a
  Senator GRASSLEY. YOU mean the committee cannot take any
action when a member of the committee violates its own rules?
  Judge TYLER. Senator, I do not and no other one of us appoints
people to this committee. That is the prerogative of the president of
the ABA.
  The fact of the matter is, as I explained to Senator Hatch, this
report in the Washington Post was very unpleasant for the reasons
that you just quoted in your own letter, and that we endeavored to
deal with this; and I believe we have dealt with it as best we could
and effectively so within the limit of our powers.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, if the person has that kind of bias to-
wards a person expressed in
  Judge TYLER. Sir, he may not really. Many of us
  Senator GRASSLEY. HOW can he serve on the committee and
advise us impartially?
  Judge TYLER. Senator, he is not doing anything to ill advise you
now at all. He is one member of 15 people who have voted unani-
mously about this candidate.
  Also, let us be honest about it. In this world of ours, 1 have
known no person of any rank, status, race, creed, or color that does
not suddenly once in a while pop off and say things that he or she
later regrets.
                                         284

  You are right if you took these words literally as I have con-
fessed to you a thousand times before you this morning and how
many times do I have to do it this morning. He shouldn't, if he said
those things, said them for the very reasons you state.

  But it ill behooves this committee to keep repeating this, for
heaven sakes. How much time can we spend on this any more than
we've spent. I don't condone this if it happened the way it was said.
Nobody does.

  Senator GRASSLEY. I think it's been pointed out very well by Sen-
ator Hatch and by Senator Simpson the status that this committee
of the ABA is given. There isn't any other trade association in the
United States I know of that comes before a congressional commit-
tee that has the standing that this ABA Committee has in advising
the Senate.

  We don't give the testimony of the National Association of Man-
ufacturers or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce or any other trade
association the stature we give to the ABA and its ratings of feder-
al judicial nominees.

  So that's the difference. You ask me why be concerned about it.
That's why I'm concerned about it. That's why I wrote the letter to
you.

  Judge TYLER. And I answered, and I answered this morning. All
I'm saying to you, sir, is why repeat ourselves, and second of all,
we're not

  Senator GRASSLEY. Because I listened to a lecture on the need for
confidentiality and what I wanted to know is what

  Judge TYLER. And I'm sorry you feel I was lecturing.
  Senator GRASSLEY. What did you do about the individual that
showed this sort of bias? I would appreciate an answer to my ques-
tion.
  Judge TYLER. I said what happened, Senator, and I don't really
think I serve you or anybody else well by repeating it. I do not
have the power to appoint. I do not have the power to fire. I am
aggrieved as much as you have just pointed out. So are we all.
  We're doing our best.
  Now, whether or not our views are accredited is not our responsi-
bility. We appear at the request of this committee. If you don't like
what we say, you are free to ignore us. I'm sorry.
  But I just do not want to continually be put in the position of
being accused about this when we can only say what we've already
said.
  Senator GRASSLEY. It may be irritating, but I'm trying to have a
public dialogue with you based on the quasi-public function that
the ABA serves.
  Let's face it; like it or not, the ABA has taken on a quasi-public
function as far as its evaluation of federal judicial nominees is con-
cerned. It should be required to conduct its business according to
this status.
  Maybe you do not think you serve that sort of function?
  Judge TYLER. I agree we do. But what else can we say that has
not already been said.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Well, let me ask you this. Can the president
of the ABA step in and discipline this person for making those
biased remarks that were printed in the press?
                                         285

  Judge TYLEF. The president of the ABA, I suppose, could step in.
But the president of the ABA has not done so, particularly since
I've reported to him that we think we have worked this out.

  Now, since that episode occurred, since you wrote that letter,
since I responded, we have done the things that I said in response
to Senator Hatch.

  We have done no more; we have done no less. Now, I know that
you do not particularly care for us, apparently. But there is noth-
ing I can say about that or do about that, other than what we have
already said.

  Mr. ELAM. Senator, I would like to add one other thing.
  The chairman of this committee, Judge Tyler, gave that matter
careful attention. It was a subject of discussion within the commit-
tee.
  He was extremely concerned, and he totally agreed with the
thrust that it is absolutely important that we do have confidential-
ity, and that there not be any statements made.
  So I do not want it left that he's not concerned. He has been in-
tensely concerned and consistent with the other things he has said
today.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me inquire along a little bit different line
about the future, and forget about the past.
  Let me put it this way. When is the ABA going to start comply-
ing with the Federal Advisory Committee Act which requires open
public meetings of all advisory committees?
  Judge TYLER. Senator, again, that subject was covered earlier in
my response. We are not under the coverage of that act. We are
private lawyers.
  I cannot imagine anybody missing the point here. I do not want
to withhold anything.
  Senator GRASSLEY. Let me ask you this. With regard to the
advice that you give to the Department of Justice
  Judge TYLER. The advice we give to the Department of Justice is
very simple and succinct. We do not show them our reports.
  And we are people who cannot agree with your apparent view
that there is some right on the part of the public to know exactly
what I and other committee members do or say in our work in our
private offices on judicial investigations. I just do not think that
makes sense at all.
  And it does not make sense with respect to our appearing here
before the Senate.
  We are what we are, and you are free to treat us as you see fit.
That is the point of my letter this fall to Senator Metzenbaum.
  We do not expect we have the right to do what the Senate Judici-
ary Committee does. You are a legally constituted body; we are not.
  You are free to accept or reject our views. Any time on any nom-
ination for any court in the federal system.
  Senator GRASSLEY. That is all, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Judge, what do you think the reaction would be
if we concluded, as I guess is implied by some of my colleagues,
that we no longer were going to seek the advice of the American
Bar Association?
  What would be the reaction of the bar? Other than your being
momentarily relieved. Seriously. It is a serious question. Because I
                                         286

assume I am going to be confronted with that as chairman at some
point.

   Because it is obvious to me you are a private organization. We
asked you 35 years ago for the purpose. Everybody forgets the pur-
pose.

  The purpose of all this was to keep political cronies from ending
up being placed on the bench. So we went to people who--our pred-
ecessors went to people who were, and are, highly respected, and
said, we want you to give us your best professional opinion about
the competence of these people, not their political content, but
their professional competence.

  And that is why it came into being. It seems kind of funny, we
have sort of turned this on its head now. Now we are accusing you
of being political--at least that is the inference I draw from some
of the questions that are being asked--and when the very purpose
was for you to help keep it from being political, which I think you
are still doing.

  But what would be the response, if in fact, at the American Bar
Association's annual meeting, as chairman of this committee, I an-
nounced that we are no longer going to seek the advice of any
standing committee of the American Bar Association with regard
to judges, in the name of Senators Grassley, et al.?

  Mr. ANDREWS. Mr. Chairman, let me answer from a practical
standpoint, as one of the worker ants out there, and not as chair-
man of the committee.

  I come from the State of Washington, and I do a number of
States. A person is nominated. And let us suppose it is a lower
court. I go to the judges that that man or woman appears before.
That judge has to have confidence in David Andrews that what he
or she tells me will be confidential; that what I say will not become
public.

  The CHAIRMAN. Why?
  Mr. ANDREWS. Because that man or woman may well, the next
day, be back before that judge. And the system of justice simply
won't work that way.

  It is doubly true when I am asking that judge to comment on an-
other judge. Will that judge be candid with me and tell me what I
need to know if I have to come before you and tell you what Judge
So and So told me?

  And that is the basis of my opinion.
  The CHAIRMAN. The reason I ask the question, I think it is im-
portant that, I think we have sort of lost the essence of what this is
all about, and what in fact, if it is going to be done, and I admit it
is debatable whether or not it should be done; I happen to think it
should.

  But it seems to me the central issue is whether or not we seek
your opinion at all, period.

  Once you cross the threshold that we seek your opinion, and we
think it has some value, then it is bizarre, it is preposterous, for us
to suggest that in fact you become accountable to every public ac-
commodations act or anything else that is out there that in fact re-
quires you to have everything in public.
                                         287

  It is a little bit like an FBI investigation. It is a little like saying
that the FBI, that everything will be said and the FBI file will be
released.

   Some of what you hear is hearsay. Some of what you hear is
gossip. Some of what you hear is substantive. And you make a
judgment and direct it toward us.

   I do not want to belabor it. But really, at some point, I think it
warrants, and with good reason--I am not being in any way disre-
spectful to the point of view of my colleagues. I think we in the
committee should debate this, whether or not to have the bar asso-
ciation at all.

  Mr. ELAM. Senator Biden
  The CHAIRMAN. I yield to my colleague.
   Senator GRASSLEY. The remarks that Mr. Andrews just made
about what a lawyer does in regard to reviewing a judicial nominee
who he might have to appear before sometime in the future, you
know, I've heard this before. It was 30 years ago as a freshman
member of the Iowa legislature that I listened to Judge Harvey
Uhlenhopp, of the Iowa supreme court and a leader of the reforma-
tion of the Iowa judiciary. Incidentally, I think we have a pretty
decent judicial system in Iowa.
  But Judge Uhlenhopp used that very same argument then. He
was comparing the need to change the Iowa system so that it
would be more like the federal system, because he said we had to
be careful. We could not have judges running for office, with law-
yers campaigning for and against each other, because after the
election, they might have to appear in the courtroom of the win-
ning candidate someday.
  And, for over 30 years, the ABA has reviewed nominees for the
federal judicial system--a system that many States like Iowa have
emulated. Yet, there is still the "future appearance before the
judge" problem, as I see it.
   Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Chairman, might I
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I yield to the Senator who has been seeking
recognition from Massachusetts, and then we will go to you.
   Senator KENNEDY. I know we want to move on.
   Senator HEFLIN. Well, I would like to be heard.
  The CHAIRMAN. I know you would like to be heard, but he sought
recognition first.
   Senator HEFLIN. Well, I know, but you said after him you were
going to someone eise.
   The CHAIRMAN. Because he had not had an opportunity to speak
yet.
   Senator HEFLIN. Well, I am merely trying to comment on this
one issue.
   The CHAIRMAN. We will do our post-mortem after Senator Spec-
ter has completed.
   Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it.
   I just want to sound perhaps a discordant note, and commend
Judge Tyler and the panel that is here today for the work that
they have done on these various nominations.
   I think it is a commitment and a dedication to public service that
Judge Tyler has been associated with over the course of his life,
and which the bar association has also performed.
                                         288

  It is a thankless job. And I think they have done well.
  It is interesting, Mr. Chairman, at this point in the course of the
hearings on Judge Kennedy that the real controversy is still Judge
Bork.
  And I think that the American people are beginning to under-
stand it. Because in the course of the two days of hearings, they
have seen that Judge Kennedy's America is quite different from
Judge Bork's America.
  The American Bar Association understood that. This Senate Ju-
diciary Committee understood it. The United States Senate under-
stood it. And America understood it.
  And because of that, I believe that the cause of justice in Amer-
ica is better served. In spite of, quite frankly, the sour grapes of
some of our friends on the right about a battle that has been long
ago fought and decided.
  And I just want to express my own appreciation for the work of
these witnesses. And I have hope that after Senator Specter has an
opportunity to speak, that we can get on with the other witnesses
who will speak of the qualification of the nominee who we are
charged to evaluate as members of this Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee.
  I thank the Chair.
  The CHAIRMAN. I apologize to the Senator from Pennsylvania for
the two interventions. I will go back to the Senator from Alabama
upon conclusion of the Senator from Pennsylvania's 15 minutes or
less of questioning.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  At the outset, I want to agree with both Senator Kennedy and
Senator Grassley. [Laughter.]
  Senator METZENBAUM. NO wonder you got elected.
  Senator SPECTER. Speaking as a long standing member of the
American Bar Association and as a member of this committee, I do
applaud your work.
  But I think that Senator Grassley has raised some questions
which are very, very important. And I do disagree just slightly
with Senator Kennedy. I do not think we are talking about Judge
Bork here today on this issue; I think we are talking about Judge
Ginsburg on this issue.
  Judge Tyler, with all respect, not just due respect, because I have
tremendous respect for what you have done in a public service
way, and especially what you are doing now pro bono, I do not
think that it really advances our interest here to say that it ill be-
hooves the committee to spend more time on the issue of the disclo-
sure by the anonymous ABA member, or to say to Senator Grass-
ley that you cannot imagine anybody missing the point.
  I do not believe that on this record the point has yet been estab-
lished. And I believe, without being unduly repetitious, that it is a
very important point. And I took the time to write to you separate-
ly back on November 11 concerning this issue.
  And I will ask that my letter and your response be made a part
of the record at the conclusion of our discussion.
  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be.
   Senator SPECTER. And just a couple of lines from my letter. I
said, as hard as it is to do, I hope that you will make every effort to
                                         289

find out if that was actually said, referring to the Post article, and
if so, who said it.

  If it turns out that a member of the ABA screening committee
actually said that, I believe some action should be taken.

  I would appreciate knowing what action if any you have taken or
do take on checking out the accuracy of that quote from the anony-
mous source.

  And I won't take the time now, Judge Tyler, to read your re-
sponse. But as I read your response, you did not respond.

  When Senator Hatch asked the question of you earlier this morn-
ing, you said, as I wrote it down: The usual dispute occurred as to
who said what. But in response to Senator Hatch you didn't state
whether you had identified the person; what the person said; or
what action you took.

  Senator Grassley pursued the issue, asking you if you tried to
find out. I don't think he ever quite asked you if he did find out,
but I do believe that you said you did find out.

  And then the question or the comment was made by you that
you do not have the authority to appoint, you do not have the au-
thority to fire. And then you did get around to saying that you
hadn't asked the president, who had the power to appoint, and pre-
sumably the power to fire, what had taken place.

  Now, the American Bar Association has enormous standing, and
I think it would be a mistake for this committee not to invite your
participation, and not to listen carefully to what you say.

  And in saying that, I immediately say that it is our responsibility
to make the judgment. We listen to what you say, but you have
great standing. You have great tradition.

  And there will exist a lot of concern, if not a bitterness, about
what happened in the previous proceeding.

  And to have the comment about a Bork or a Bork-let appear in
the paper I think requires that we know what the process is and
what you have done about it.

  For years, I dealt in a business, as you gentlemen do, of interrog-
atories, the ad nauseam interrogatories, and the motions to compel
more specific answers.

  But I believe it is important to know, if it was said, sending us a
Bork instead of a Bork-let, if you identified who it was who said it.
And I do not ask you for the identity of the person. I am not sure
whether you are right or wrong in keeping your minorities secret,
but I respect that conclusion, and I think it would not be up to us
to say on that.

  And I am not asking you to disclose who said it. But I would like
to know specifically what was done, either by the chairman, Judge
Tyler, or by the committee.

  And I think we are entitled to know the specifics so that we can
be confident about the processes. And it is more than just taking
the generalization that it is all fine for the future.

  I think we are entitled to know more details on it
  Judge TYLER. Well, let me start, point by point.
  It appears that you think I did not answer all of these things,
and I will try.
                                         290

   First of all, with regard to my letter, it is so long ago I have for-
gotten exactly when I sent it to you. But I do recall that I know
more now than I did when I wrote it.

   Second of all, I believe that I know the identity of the person.
  Third of all, I said what I meant, and I meant what I said, that I
have no right to appoint anybody to this committee, or to fire any-
body from the committee.
  When it appeared that this happened, and I certainly agree with
you and Senator Grassley and anyone else that that kind of com-
ment not only violated our rules, but conveyed the impression to
any reader, as you point out, and Senator Grassley pointed out,
that the person is proceeding with a preordained view before we
had even begun to investigate the candidate in question.

  And it appeared on a date, by the way, on which that inference
was particularly clear cut.

  We had a meeting. Not everybody could come, because we have
lawyers who have court appearances and so on. Most everybody
was there.

  We talked it through. We made it very clear that the criticisms
that we could contemplate as a result of this were serious; not just
because of our own rules, but because of public perception of the
work of this committee.

  After some struggle, and conversations between me and the indi-
vidual, that person took the position that the conversation with the
press representative took place.

  Then we had what I consider, Senator Specter, based on my long
career in the executive and judicial branches of the United States,
the inevitable problem: A difference as to who said what.

  How do you answer that? I have never found there is any sure
answer to that.

  But we will pass that. I believe, and I reported to the president
and through him the president-elect of the ABA that we had done
what we could to try and seal off this kind of comment. Again, as I
think I have already said, you have to keep in mind that I, at least,
have never met a human being, no matter what his position in life,
who doesn't occasionally sound off and say things that really he
does not quite mean.

  I suppose it will come as no surprise to you, with your experi-
ence, that the person who I think was involved in this, and certain-
ly admits the conversation with the reporter, may have, you know,
lost control and said things that ought not to have been said.

  The CHAIRMAN. It has never happened to any of us.
  Judge TYLER. I assure you that during the deliberations of our
committee, this person was a responsible, careful, and direct inves-
tigator, in connection with the nomination of Judge Kennedy.
  It would be easy for me to come before this committee with my
colleagues today and say, oh, yes, as a result of that Post article,
the president of the ABA or the president-elect has stripped that
committee member of his post or position.
  That is not so easy to do, at least at this point. I certainly agree
with you, and I repeat--I thought I made this clear before, but I
will repeat it--I am not happy about this. My colleagues are not
happy about this.
                                         291

  This has been an enormous cross to bear during one of the busi-
est times in the history of this committee.

  I wish I were a great solver of leak problems. Having been a resi-
dent of Washington, DC, I assure you, I doubt that we will ever be
leakproof, but we are trying.

  What I am trying to convey to Senator Grassley and others is, we
come in and offer our opinion. I underscore the word opinion.
There is no legal or practical reason why your committee has to
accept our opinion as controlling.

  I appreciate your concerns, which you are entitled to, about
leaks. You are absolutely right. There is no good answer to that
that we are proud of, or should be.

  But believe me, it is very easy for me who has a lot of things to
do everyday, having nothing to do with this committee, to say to
this committee, well, you know, we will solve this.

  I would be guilty of dissembling at best. But I think at the
moment, we are in better shape than we were 5 months ago when I
came to this committee, because we have struggled with this.

  I assure you that if we cannot solve it now, I am going to go back
to not only the president of the ABA, who appointed me by the
way, and has the right to fire me, and the president elect.

  Because if we have to change how we appoint people to avoid
this problem, I for one would like to see it done.

  But we are not quite there yet. This has been a high draft, high
pressure, time consuming period, since July 1, for this committee.

  I do not know if you were here when I reported that in the last 5
months we have done a lot of work. I do not want to boast about
that, but I want to make the record clear that we are beset with a
lot of work in a confined period of time of great importance to this
country.

  And to bedevil you or ourselves with these problems any more
than we have tried to do has been impossible.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, Judge Tyler, I understand what you are
saying. I do not expect you to solve problems of leaks.

  I do not think that is susceptible to solution in a democratic soci-
ety, nor should it be. If there is one, all you can do is try to find
out, and after you find out, if you have, take what action you con-
sider to be appropriate.

  That is all that can be done. Then, to respond to us on those lim-
ited questions.

  Judge TYLER. And I am sorry I did not know as much when I
wrote you as I know now.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, you could have supplemented your an-
swers to interrogatories.

  Judge TYLER. I could have.
  Senator SPECTER. But let us not go over that.
  You said a couple of things on which I have just a small bit of
follow up.
  First you said that you believed you knew the identity. And
later
  Judge TYLER. NO one has come forward and gotten down on his
bony knees or her bony knees and said, I did it.
   Senator SPECTER. HOW about standing up?
  Judge TYLER. They have not done it standing up or sitting down.
                                         292

   Senator SPECTER. There is a dispute as to what was said. But you
commented, you testified, that a member of the committee admit-
ted to the conversation, to a conversation.

  Judge TYLER. That is correct, sir. Admitted to talking to that par-
ticular reporter about that

  Senator SPECTER. But disputed the substance of the report?
  Judge TYLER. Right.
  Senator SPECTER. SO you're not sure that that person said Bork
and Bork-let, et cetera. You don't have to be.
  My only concern, Judge Tyler, is simply that you asked.
  Judge TYLER. I surely did.
  Senator SPECTER. Okay. You asked all the people who could have
been the sources.
  Judge TYLER. Right.
  Senator SPECTER. And one said, he had a conversation with the
reporter, and disputed the context as to what was said.
  Judge TYLER. Precisely.
  Senator SPECTER. Okay. I do not expect you to make a federal in-
vestigation of it beyond that point. And after that was done, you
made a judgement that you had found as much of the facts as you
could reasonably, and that no further action should be taken
beyond the admonition for confidentiality for the future.

  Judge TYLER. Well, at the time when this was going on, in be-
tween everything else, we had a meeting, that is, the committee.
We sat with each other. It was really the only agenda item; this is
that serious.

  I hoped that by looking each other in the eye, it would finally
come home that this is not a game we are playing, and it has very
serious repercussions, for the very reasons that you wrote the
letter.

  We talked to each other. Inevitably, some people could not come.
I talked to them, face to face, man to man, woman to man, or
whatever.

  Now, as a result of that, we got letters, not only from this com-
mittee or some of its members, but from other highly reputable
people in this country, raising the same point, and legitimately so,
once again.

  That material was sent around to the committee, not just to the
person I am dealing with.

  I hope, in short, Senator Specter, that this will solve the prob-
lem. As I say, if it does not, then I plan to discuss this matter with
the hierarchy of the ABA. Because it is offensive to all of us to
have to work in this kind of atmosphere.

  I cannot believe there is any doubt about that. It is not pleasant
to do this kind of work, only to worry about people leaking or
saying things that though they may not have meant them, they are
embarrassing to our work and to our appearance before the Senate
Judiciary Committee.

  Senator SPECTER, Judge Tyler, I thank you for your explanation.
I have accomplished my two purposes. One, to find out, to the
extent possible, to find out what happened.

  And second, I think that the exchanges with the committee
today may help you on maintaining confidentiality in the future.
                                         293

  Because when the members of the committee, past and future,
see the way this matter is viewed by the committee, and the con-
cern, that we may be of some assistance to you in maintaining con-
fidentiality in the future.

  And I think that we should not conduct this inquiry further, and
not even consider use of our subpoena power.

  Judge TYLER. May I ask a favor of you, sir?
  Senator SPECTER. Of course.
  Judge TYLER. I noticed that Senator Grassley departed before I
could answer your question. Would you convey to him what I said?
Because I did not mean to avoid his question, number one, and
number two, convey to him that I agree that the letters that he
wrote, and the letter you wrote, individually, were a help in this
exercise I was just trying to describe.
  Senator SPECTER. I think he will be very pleased to hear of your
request, and I shall do so man to man. [Laughter.]

The Honorable Harold R. Tyler, J r .
Chairman
ABA Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary
1800 M Street, N.W.
Washington, D. C. 20036

Dear Judge Tyler:

        While the nominating process for Judge Ginsburg is now moot, I am writing
concerning a statement attributed to you and a statement attributed to an
anonymous member of the ABA screening committee.

        The enclosed article in the Washington Post by Mary Thornton quotes Judiciary
Committee sources as saying that you hoped the "ABA Committee would finish its
investigation of Judge Ginsburg by December 1 but were net sure that it could be
completed that quickly.

        I would hope that all of us, the A M and the Judiciary Committee, would move
promptly on Judge Kennedy's nomination. I totally agr;'" that we aave to do a
thorough job, but I believe it should be dono as exped. '.sly as possible. If we
do not finish the work on Judge Kennedy promr'iy but instead Jet ix await action
as late as March or April as some have suggested, it may wall turn out that there
will be no confirmation in 1988 because of presidential politics. That could mean
that there would not be a confirmation until the spring of 3989 winch would leave the
Court without a full complement for two years. That would rxssjtly present a big
backlog of cases which would have to be reargued.

        I am also very much concerned about the reference to one anonymous member of
the ABA screening committee who is referred to in the enclosed Post article as
saying that there are concerns that Ginsburg shares many of the conservative
ideological beliefs that doomed the Bork nomination and that it looks like we may
be going from a Bork to a Borklet. ^Hard as it is to do, I hope that you will make
every effort to find out if that was actually said; and, if so, who said it. If
it turns out that a member of the ABA screening committee actually said that, I
believe some action should be taken.

        I would appreciate knowing what action, if any, you have taken or do take on
checking out the accuracy of that quote from that anonymous source.)

        These matters are obviously difficult to handle, and I want you to know that
I applaud your continuing pro bono work and the contributions of the ABA screening
committee and the American Bar Association generally in this important area.

                  My best.                                                                                     P.S. I am sending a copy of this

                                                Judiciary Committee sources reported that I had hoped that

            FEDFRAl CIRCUIT                     concern. Indeed, I had called a special meeting of this

                             Suite 600          remind everybody that only the Chairman by our rules is
                                                entitled to talk to the press. That is a rule which, as far
            1666 K Street NW                    as I know, has been in place for many years so far as this

BOARD OF COVFRNORS                              problem which you and others have noticed in the October 31
                                                Post article. I wish I could say that we have absolutely

                                                is, I cannot be sure that this is so. Now that I have been
                                                Chairman or the Committee for about two months, I have some

                                                ABA to assist in this area. Unfortunately, as long as we

  The CHAIRMAN. And they are very close on the issues, so they
will have a lot to talk about, too.

  Would you like to conclude briefly, Senator?
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I was under the impression that these
hearings were about Judge Kennedy.
  And we have listened, and there are 12 other witnesses. If there
are sufficient reasons to look at this overall situation, I would only
suggest that it be done at some other time in order that we might
try to finish here on Judge Kennedy before the Christmas recess.
  Senator KENNEDY. I second the motion.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, we are finished, I hope. I would like to, and
I will put this in writing, Judge Tyler, I will invite you and the
president of the ABA, after the 1st of the year, to sit down with me
and interested members of the committee to, not to discuss this
particular matter, but to discuss the entire relationship.
   You need not come. If you do not come, you will never be invited
back again, as long as I am chairman. If you come, we can work
something out. [Laughter.]
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, may I just add, I think that
would be an excellent idea. And I would be glad to participate.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is not necessary.
  Senator SIMPSON. YOU would not want me not to be there, would
you? Is that what you are saying? [Laughter.]
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, I would love you to be there.
  Senator SIMFSON. But I think it is important. I have put 18 years
of dues into that outfit, and I have the greatest regard for them.
  The CHAIRMAN. I think you have all paid your dues today. I hope
you have a happy holiday. Thank you for your contribution. And
goodbye.
  Now, let me ask my colleagues. It is ten minutes of 12. We have
been breaking usually at 12. but we have a number of important
witnesses today.
  Our next witness is Professor Tribe, who will be testifying. Is it
the will of the committee for us to continue, which is my instinct?
Or to break at this point?
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, our ranking member is not
here. But I think we ought to proceed. Just go right on through.
  If people want to break for activities, I think that would be the
way I would certainly
  The CHAIRMAN. All right, why do we not begin.
  And I would suggest to our next witness, a very distinguished
former solicitor general, Mr. Griswold, now is the time for him to
go to lunch.
  I am not being facetious. So we give the witnesses who are
behind us some opportunity to plan their schedules also.
  Well, Professor Tribe, welcome back. I doubt whether, when you
first appeared here, you thought you would be back testifying so
soon on a Supreme Court Justice.
  Professor Tribe, for the record, as we all know, is a distinguished
Harvard Law School professor.
  Professor Tribe is the author of a widely used treatise on consti-
tutional law.
  And purely coincidentally, I understand that today that second
edition is being released on this very day that we meet.
                                         299

  Professor Tribe, welcome. I would like to ask you to stand to
please be sworn in.

  Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you
God?

  Professor TRIBE. I do.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome again, Professor. And I will begin the
questioning.
  You have an opening statement. I realize it is difficult, but we
have asked you to limit your statement if you can to 10 minutes,
and then we are going to limit the questions by our colleagues to 5
minutes per round.
  And we will move on. And we will have as many rounds as Sena-
tors feel they need.
  So if you will proceed with your statement, Professor. And then I
will begin with my questions.

        TESTIMONY OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE, PROFESSOR OF

           CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL

   Professor TRIBE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
   The prepared statement that I have analyzes Judge Kennedy's
speeches and his principal judicial opinions. And I do not want to
repeat it here.
   With the Chair's permission, I will simply submit that for the
record.
   The CHAIRMAN. The entire statement will be placed in the
record.
   Professor TRIBE. Thank you. I want to talk more generally about
Judge Kennedy's approach before answering whatever questions
the committee might have.
  From Anthony Kennedy's speeches and opinions and his testimo-
ny, there emerges a clear picture. But it is a picture in which a
number of people, I think, wish they could see some harder edges,
some sharper boundaries, and a more easily defined perspective.
  What I find most appealing and promising about the picture that
emerges is precisely the absence of any simplistic, single, fixed
point of view.
  There is, I think, great intelligence and fair-mindedness and com-
mitment to principle; but not unitary vision. Nothing you could put
on a bumper sticker.
  Now, some of Judge Kennedy's detractors, or some who I should
say damn him with faint praise, confuse the absence of simple slo-
gans with a lack of clarity or brilliance. And with all respect, I
think they are wrong.
  What Judge Kennedy said to Senator Specter yesterday morning
is extremely revealing. Let me just quote a few of his words.
  He said: "It is somewhat difficult for me to offer myself as one
with a complete cosmology of the Constitution. I do not have an
overarching theory, a unitary theory of interpretation.
  "I am searching for the correct balance."
  That seems to me exactly right. I have written that I do not
think any "unitary theory" of the Constitution is likely to reflect
the complexity or the compromise of that document, or to accom-
modate evolution in our understanding about it.
  Judge Kennedy is really quite eloquent when he testifies about
an evolving understanding of the Constitution. In an exchange
with Senator Grassley this Monday, Judge Kennedy said, "we can
see from history more clearly now, I think, what the framers in-
tended, than if we were sitting back in 1789.
  "They had just written a constitution 2 or 3 years ago. They
knew the draftsmen. And yet, they were, it seemed to me, more at
sea as to what it meant than we were."
  Judge Kennedy said, "we have a great benefit in that we have
had 200 years of history."
  Now, there is no dogmatism, no self assured ideology about that.
Instead, there is, I think, the humility that marks the essence of
true judicial restraint, and potentially, of genuine judicial great-
ness.
  I take Judge Kennedy seriously when he said, and I quote him,
"I think courts have the obligation always to remind themselves of
                                         301

their own fallibility." But we are not without guidance in his
speeches and his opinions and his testimony here as to how he
would go about resolving constitutional questions.

  Again, he was quite eloquent in addressing that issue on Monday
afternoon. He said, and I quote him: "When a judge hears a consti-
tutional case, a judge gets an understanding of the Constitution
from many sources: from arguments of counsel, from the nature of
the injuries and claims asserted by the particular person; from the
reading of the precedents of the court, from the writings of those
who have studied the Constitution."

  All of these factors, he said, "are, in essence, voices through
which the Constitution is being heard."

  And the Constitution says some things very loudly and very
clearly to Judge Kennedy. Speaking with Senator Specter yester-
day about why the specific subjective intentions of the Constitu-
tion's framers should not bind the judges of the present, Judge
Kennedy said this.

  He said, "the whole lesson of our constitutional experience has
been that a people could rise above its own injustice, above the in-
equities that prevail at a particular time.

  "The framers of the Constitution * * * knew that they did not
live in a constitutionally perfect society, but they promulgated the
Constitution anyway. They were willing to be bound by its conse-
quences."

  And he said, "I do not think that the 14th amendment was de-
signed to freeze into society all of the inequities that then existed."

  "It would serve no purpose," he added, "to have a Constitution
which simply enacted the status quo." So that, even though some
of the framers were fully aware that they lived in a segregated so-
ciety, they promulgated grand words by which they were willing to
be bound.

  Now, I am frank to say that the aspirations to fairness and jus-
tice reflected in those words impress me, but that I am troubled by
Judge Kennedy's prior memberships in some exclusive clubs.

  I see a tension between the aspiration and some of the prior re-
ality.

  But I believe that Judge Kennedy has acted honorably; that he
should be taken at his word on the subject of discrimination
against women and discrimination against minorities; and I find in
the opinions that he has written and the speeches and the testimo-
ny reason to take him at his word.

  Now, those opinions and speeches contain much with which I
agree; they leave me with no doubt that there is also some stuff
there with which I disagree.

  I do not doubt that as a justice, if he is confirmed, he will render
decisions with which I sometimes disagree.

  But I am left with no doubt that he shares this nation's core
commitment to a Constitution that is broad enough and flexible
enough to protect basic liberties, including "liberties that may not
be spelled out in the fine print," to use a phrase that Senator Metz-
enbaum used a couple of days ago.

   In an exchange on that subject with Senator Leahy, Judge Ken-
nedy said this: "I think the concept of 'liberty' in the due process
clause is quite expansive, quite sufficient, to protect the values of
                                              302

privacy that Americans legitimately think are part of their consti-
tutional heritage."

   And when Senator Biden asked, "is there a right to marital pri-
vacy protected by the Constitution." Judge Kennedy unhesitatingly
replied, "yes."

   He does prefer the term, "liberty," but that term is in the Consti-
tution. And of course, it is a capacious and a spacious term.

   He adds, though, and I quote him: "Privacy is a most helpful
noun in that it seems to sum up rather quickly values that we hold
very deeply."

   Now, Judge Kennedy fully recognizes, as I think all of us should,
that privacy is not an unlimited right. It is a red herring to talk
about a boundless, unlimited right of privacy.

  Its contours and its limits are debatable. But that process of
debate is what the judicial process is all about.

  Judge Kennedy said, and I quote him, "with reference to the
right of privacy, we are very much in a state of evolution and
debate. The Constitution is made for that kind of debate.

  The Constitution is not weak because we do not know the answer
to a difficult problem. It is strong because we can find that answer
through what he called the general and "gradual process of inclu-
sion and exclusion." And he has not left us without some criteria of
what he would include and what he would exclude in deciding
what the word "liberty" means in our Constitution.

  He testified that he would seek "objective referents" for how "es-
sential" something is to "human dignity," how much "anguish"
would result if Government were to deny it, how great would be
the impact on a person's "ability to manifest his or her own per-
sonality," and to obtain "self-fulfillment."

  When he was pressed by Senator Grassley, and others, on wheth-
er these were not fluid terms, he admitted they were, but he said
that is the judicial task, to try to make them objective.

  Now, at the same time, Judge Kennedy candidly and fairly testi-
fied--and his opinions make clear that he believes this as well--
that the Constitution does not empower judges to "create" what, in
their personal vision, happens to be "a just society."

  It gives courts no mandate to enforce a general "right to happi-
ness." I think he was surely right when he said that most of our
material needs, the needs for adequate housing and education, rep-
resent a constitutional responsibility of legislatures beyond the
power of courts to enforce.

  But even there, I was gratified to see that Judge Kennedy under-
stands a limited role for the judiciary. He referred, approvingly, to
a Supreme Court decision holding that a State cannot altogether
deprive illegal aliens of a free education, and he concluded that
"even here, there is an area for courts to participate in."

  So I want to stress that sometimes I agree with Judge Kennedy,
sometimes I disagree. None of us is entitled to a Justice who mir-
rors our own legal or political perspectives, or even our own consti-
tutional views. What I think we are entitled to, and what I believe
the Senate of the United States has insisted upon in this Bicenten-
nial Year, is a Justice who is deeply committed to an evolving un-
derstanding of the Constitution, and to the role of the Supreme
                                                  303

Court in the development of principles that make the Constitution
live.

  And I believe, from everything that I have read and heard, that
Anthony Kennedy would be such a Justice. The fact that he is a
conservative rather than a liberal does not prevent me from sup-
porting his confirmation.

                       ON THE NOMINATION OF ANTHONY M. KENNEDY

                                   TO BE AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE
                           OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

                                           December 16, 1987

        My name is Laurence Tribe. I am the Tyler Professor of
Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School. I have taught there
since completing a clerkship with Justice Potter Stewart in 1968.
I have served as an expert witness on numerous constitutional
matters in Congress and have frequently argued in the United
States Supreme Court. Among the books and articles I have
written is a 1978 treatise entitled American Constitutional Law,
the second edition of which has just been published. In 1980, I
was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences,, and my treatise received the Order of the Coif Award
for distinguished legal scholarship.

         On September 22, 1987, I testified before this Committee on
another Supreme Court nomination. It was with regret that I
found myself unable, on that occasion, to support the nominee.
It is a great honor -- and, on this occasion, a distinct pleasure
-- to appear at the Committee's invitation to testify on the
nomination of Anthony M. Kennedy as an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court. This time, I am glad to say, I am here to testify
in favor of President Reagan's nominee.

                          I. INTRODUCTION: THE SENATE'S ROLE

         In a speech delivered at Columbia Law School in New York
City last month, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist called
attention to the role of "the Senate as well as . . . the
President" in conducting "inquiry . . . into what may be called
the 'judicial philosophy' of a nominee to [the] Court." The
Chief Justice expressed the view that such inquiry by the Senate
is "entirely consistent with our constitution and serves as a way
of reconciling judicial independence with majority rule." I
share the Chief Justice's view. Nonetheless I am convinced, for
reasons I developed at some length in a 1985 book (God Save This
Honorable Court), that the Senate's proper function under the
Advice and Consent Clause of Article II, Section 2, does not
include enforcing the Senate's own political preferences as
between liberalism and conservatism, or as among any other set of
"isms". It is one thing for the Senate to reject a nominee whom
it perceives, rightly or wrongly, as a threat to the Supreme
Court's basic role in our constitutional scheme. It would be
another thing entirely if the Senate were to reject a nominee
simply because a majority of the Senators would have preferred
someone with different views, either more liberal or more
conservative, either in general or on some set of specific
issues.

         Assuming a nominee is otherwise superbly qualified,
therefore, the issue for the Senate, as I see it, is not whether
                             306

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 3
December 16, 1987

it agrees or disagrees with where the President's Supreme Court
nominee stands, or is likely to stand in the future, on such
matters as the exclusionary rule, comparable worth, or
affirmative action. Today's burning agenda may not be
tomorrow's. The issue, rather, is how Senators assess the
nominee's commitment to fundamental constitutional principles at
the most general level, and how Senators evaluate the nominee's
capacity to contribute to the ongoing development and refinement
of those principles as a member of our nation's highest court.

        My purpose today is to be of whatever help I can to the
Senate as it makes that assessment and undertakes that
evaluation.

                             II. EVALUATION OF JUDGE KENNEDY

        With this purpose in mind, I have studied all of the
speeches Judge Kennedy has made available to this Committee and
have read a large number of his judicial opinions. Although I
obviously do not agree with everything Judge Kennedy has said or
written, and although I fully expect to disagree with some of the
opinions he would be likely to write and votes he would be likely
to cast as a Supreme Court Justice, it seems to me indisputable
that Judge Kennedy's very considerable intellectual strengths are
coupled with a deep and abiding commitment to basic
constitutional values and principles. There is every reason to
expect that, if confirmed as a Justice, Judge Kennedy would make
                             307

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 4
December 16, 1987

a significant and enduring contribution to the Supreme Court's
crucial work of elaborating, explaining and enforcing the
Constitution of the United States.

         It is true that Judge Kennedy does not espouse any single,
simple theory of constitutional interpretation. This makes his
writings harder to characterize than is sometimes the case. But
the nominee should not be faulted for having views of a more
complex character -- views not susceptible to simplistic
labeling. Indeed, in the second edition of my treatise, American
Constitutional Law, I address this very matter. On page one of
that book, I suggest that little "can be gained by seeking any
single, unitary theory for construing the Constitution . . . .
For the Constitution is an historically discontinuous
composition; it is the product, over time, of a series of not
altogether coherent compromises; it mirrors no single vision or
philosophy but reflects instead a set of sometimes reinforcing
and sometimes conflicting ideals and notions."

                                           A. The Speeches

        Judge Kennedy's speeches consistently reflect the highest
level of sensitivity to precisely this complexity. In speech
after speech -- and in his many years as a professor of
constitutional law -- Judge Kennedy has resisted the temptation
to offer dogmatic, definitive answers to the most perplexing
puzzles of our constitutional order. Speaking of presidential

authority and the separation of powers in Salzburg, Austria, in
November 1980, for example, Judge Kennedy explained why answers
to some of the most pressing constitutional questions "must await
an evolutionary process" and observed that, "as to some
fundamental constitutional questions it is best not to insist on
definitive answers." In his view -- a view I share -- "[t]he
constitutional system works best if there remain twilight zones
of uncertainty and tension between the component parts of the
government. The surest protection of constitutional rule lies
not in definitive announcements of power boundaries but in a
mutual respect and deference among all the- component parts."
(Pg. 11.)

         1. On Structural Principles.

                  In dealing with the structural principles underlying the
         Constitution, Judge Kennedy's discussions of federalism and
/"> states' rights reflect an unusually subtle appreciation for
         constitutional history and for the perennial tensions and
         paradoxes of our constitutional system. In a speech on October
         15, 1987, in Sacramento, Judge Kennedy called federalism's
         division of power into two distinct levels of government
         "[w]ithout question . . . [the] most daring contribution made by
         the framers to the science of government" -- the "conception that
         this dual allocation of authority would be protective of
         freedom." (Pg. 7.) In an address emphasizing the historical
         background of the concept, delivered on October 26, 1987, before
                             309

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 6
December 16, 1987

the Historical Society for the United States District Court for
the Northern District of California, he emphasized the "moral and
ethical content inherent in federalism" -- the framers'
conclusion that it is wrong "for an individual to surrender
essential power over his or her own personality to a ramote
government that he or she cannot control in a direct and
practical way." He concluded that "[t]he states, and their
subdivisions, with more visible and approachable legislators, and
often with an initiative and referendum process, are likely to be
more responsiv *o the citizen than the federal government."
(Pg. 13.)

         Yet r_dge Kennedy does not let his strong belief in
federalism blind him to the difficulties of direct judicial
protection of states' rights under our Constitution. In the
Historical Society speech, he recognized that "[o]ne of the most
intriguing aspects of the Constitution is that it says very
little about the power of the states or their place in the
federal system," and that "it is difficult to find effective
structural mechanisms designed to protect the states." (Pgs.
7-8.) He noted that, when selection of United States Senators by
state legislatures was replaced by direct election by the people,
the states lost their sole institutional check on the national
government, leaving them little ability to fight the national
government for turf in the way the three branches of the national
government can fight among themselves. (Pg. 8.) As to other
guarantees in the Constitution shielding the states from the
                             310

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 7
December 16, 1987

national government, Judge Kennedy noted that "[t]he guarantee of
a republican form of government and the prohibition against
depriving states of equal suffrage in the Senate are there, but
nothing more." (Pg. 9.)

         Indeed, Judge Kennedy recognized in this speech that "[t]he
principal protection for the states is that the national
government is one of limited powers." (Pg. 9.) But even this
protection has in recent decades exhibited little promise, given
developments in how broad those powers are viewed as being. In
his 1987 Sacramento speech, Judge Kennedy recognized that, "of
all of the structural elements of the Constitution,
federalism remains today the most in doubt," given the
nationalization of the economy and the growth of national
governmental power in both domestic and foreign realms. (Pg- 7.)
As a result, Judge Kennedy explained in a February, 1982, speech
in Los Angeles, protection of the states is "remitted primarily
to the exercise of self-restraint by the political branches."
(Pg. 6.) To Judge Kennedy, despite the vital importance of
federalism, *[t]here is no easy answer" to the question of how
its vitality can be retained. (1987 Historical Society speech,
pg. 13.)

        Judge Kennedy has also stressed the importance of other
structural principles implicit in our system of government --
namely, the separation of powers between the three national
branches of government; the checks and balances among the
                             311

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 8
December 16, 1987

branches; and, in particular, the power and duty of the judiciary
to invalidate unconstitutional actions of the political
branches. In his 1987 Sacramento speech, Judge Kennedy defended
his emphasis on structural principles by demonstrating that the
Constitution's specific protections of individual rights, while
obviously crucial, are not by themselves sufficient to preserve
liberty. He noted that "there are over 160 constitutions in the
world today, many of which contain ringing affirmations of
individual liberties, affirmations as eloquent as our own. But
absent a structure to guarantee their enforcement, these are
shams, what Madision scorned as parchment barriers. Eloquence is
easily achieved; freedom and real equality are rare and
elusive." (Pg. 9.)

2. On Individual Rights.

        As to the Constitution's protections of individual rights as
such, Judge Kennedy has made clear his belief in the need for
vigorous and open-minded defense of those rights by the federal
judiciary. At his induction as a member of the Court of Appeals
on June 1, 1975, Judge Kennedy recognized that the Framers of the
Constitution drafted "strong words that after all the arguments
and interpretations subside, still remain as powerful and
forceful shields for individual liberty." (Pg. 5.) His
commitment to a strong federal judiciary was highlighted in an
August, 1978, speech in Phoenix to his fellow Circuit Judges, in
which he attacked a then-pending legislative proposal to
                             312

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 9
December 16, 1987

establish a federal judicial commission to police the behavior of

federal judges. Regarding such a device as a threat to judicial

independence, Judge Kennedy warned that, "once the independence

of the judiciary is undermined, it can never be restored."

Rather than taking a more measured approach, Judge Kennedy

declared that "[t]here is a time to compromise and a time to

stand on principle; and I submit we must stand on the principle

of judicial independence in this case and refuse to support or

endorse or amend this bill." (Pg. 25.)

         Defending the record of the independent judiciary in

American history, Judge Kennedy observed:

         "I simply must remind you, although it should be clear
         enough, that it was not the political branches of the
         government that decided Brown v. Board of Education;
         and it was not the political branches of the government
         that wrought the revolution of Baker v. Carr (the
         reapportionment decision), or that decided the right of
         counsel case (Gideon v. Wainright). It was the
         courts. And I submit that if the courts were not
         independent, those decisions might not have been made,
         or if made, might not properly have been enforced."
         (Pg. 31.)

         Whether Judge Kennedy was right or wrong in perceiving the

proposed judicial commission as a grave threat to the

independence of the federal judiciary, it is noteworthy how

deeply he cared about the progress that the judiciary had

wrought.

         Most crucially, Judge Kennedy has recognized that the great

protections afforded individual liberty by the Constitution

cannot be defined by any scientific process or conception of the
                             313

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 10
December 16, 1987

Framers' specific intentions, but are bound up in a continuing

examination of the principles of human freedom. In a 1981

commencement speech at the McGeorge School of Law, Judge Kennedy

reviewed the concept of "fundamental law," and said that

         *[i]n our own time, the idea is most fully, although
        not entirely, expressed in the Constitution. The plain
         fact is that the scholarship of the American legal
        profession on questions of fundamental law is one of
        the great contributions to Western civilization in
        modern times. Our work on this subject is the major
         source of reliance by every other court in the world
        that cares about justice." (Pg. 7.)

        As understood by Judge Kennedy, the Constitution's

fundamental law is plainly an evolving concept. In a speech in

Sacramento delivered in February, 1984, Judge Kennedy stated that

         "[c]hange within the mainstream of our constitutional
         tradition is necessary. . . . The framers of the
         Constitution would not have used such spacious phrases
         as due process, cruel and unusual punishment, [or]
         equal protection of the laws, if they had thought
         otherwise. The great Chief Justice, John Marshall,
         said that 'The Constitution was intended to endure for
         ages to come, and consequently to be adopted to the
        various crises of human affairs.'" (Pg. 6.)

        Judge Kennedy's careful analysis of the broadly phrased

constitutional guarantees is best illustrated by his speech at

Stanford in July, 198 6, on "Unenumerated Rights and the Dictates

of Judicial Restraint." Some academics, jurists and others have

read the Constitution so narrowly that they are unable to find in

it a basis for protecting so-called "unenumerated" rights --

those fundamental personal freedoms which, although not

surrendered to any level of government when the people of the

United States adopted the Constitution, did not happen to be
                             314

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 11
December 16, 1987

specifically mentioned in the Bill of Rights or elsewhere. Such
commentators ignore the broad protection of "liberty* under the
Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, as
well as the command of the Ninth Amendment that "[t]he
enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."

         Other legal thinkers urge that the expansive phrases of the
Constitution be read extraordinarily broadly -- as a means of
guaranteeing all the prerequisites of a just society, forgetting
the Constitution's character as a sometimes uneasy and
unsatisfying product of conflict and compromise.

         In his 198 6 Stanford speech, Judge Kennedy steered a middle
course, arguing that it flouts "constitutional dynamics, and it
defies the [precedential] method to announce in a categorical way
that there can be no unenumerated rights," but that "it is
imprudent as well to say that there are broadly defined
categories of unenumerated rights, and to say so apart from the
factual premises of decided cases. This follows from the
dictates of judicial restraint." (Pg. 5.)

         In this spirit, Judge Kennedy, through a discussion of the
rights to travel and to vote, and the right of privacy, explored
in some detail and with considerable subtlety "the boundaries of
judicial power and the difficulties encountered in defining
fundamental protection[s] that do not have a readily discernible
basis in the constitutional text," (pg. 1) demonstrating his
                             315

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 12
December 16, 1987

preference for detailed attention to the factual nuances of
particular situations, with close heed to the Constitution's
text, structure, and history, and to the traditions surrounding
its evolving interpretation. In Judge Kennedy's view, this
process is most in line with the judicial role of deciding
"specific cases, from which general propositions later evolve,
and this approach is the surest safeguard of liberty." (Pgs.
4-5.)

        Judge Kennedy's analysis of the "right of privacy" decisions
protecting fundamental matters of family life and individual
autonomy and intimacy is particularly perceptive. That these
specific words do not appear in the Constitution, he suggests, is
a distraction. Some of the most difficult constitutional
controversies involved in this area, he points out, would persist
even if the Constitution's text were explicitly to grant a "right
to respect for private and family life," as is afforded under
European law. (Pg. 9.) Judges would still have to struggle with
intractable problems of defining and delimiting this right's
outer boundaries. And some of the confusion in this area, he
suggests, stems from use of "the word 'privacy,' rather than . .
. a constitutional term, such as 'liberty'" -- shifting attention
to "[t]he mystic attraction of [an] untested and undefined word .
. . . " (Pg. 10.)

         The difficult questions in addressing such divisive
constitutional issues are, therefore, ones that at times not even
                             316

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 13
December 16, 1987

the most explicit text can answer. Yet Judge Kennedy recognizes

the federal judiciary's obligation to examine these issues:

         "The fact that we are not sure how ultimate legal
        principles are weighed in reconciling conflicting
         claims between society and individual freedom, or that
        we may disagree on the subject, does not mean that our
         duty to address such questions can be abandoned or
         treated with indifference. . . . [I]t is the nature of
         the judicial process that ultimate principles unfold
         gradually and over time." (1981 McGeorge speech, pg.
         7.)

        Judge Kennedy has made it equally clear, however, that the

Constitution is not an instrument for the enshrinement of judges'

own political or moral values. In his 1986 Stanford speech,

Judge Kennedy admitted that "[o]ne can conclude that certain

essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just

society," but that "[i]t does not follow that each of those

essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the

written Constitution." (Pg. 13.) At a speech delivered in

Sacramento during February, 1984, he noted that "[t]o recognize

the necessity of continued interpretation does not give us a

license to interpret the document for utilitarian ends," and that

"[t]he Constitution cannot be thrown about as a panacea for every

social ill" -- "cannot be divorced from its logic and its

language, the intention of its framers, the precedents of the

law, and the shared traditions and historic values of our

people." (Pg. 7.) In this way, Judge Kennedy properly stressed

the very considerable differences between identifying the rights

implicit in our Constitution and deciding what rights ought to

exist in an ideally just society.

        Given the limits of judicial interpretation, Judge Kennedy
quite rightly has pointed out that many claims "that courts must
enforce certain minimum entitlements" requiring positive action
by government, such as "education, nutrition, and housing .

     if the constitutional system is to work," appear implausible
under our Constitution as written. One may argue, he noted,
"that the political branch has a responsibility to furnish an
entitlement that is necessary to make the constitutional system
work, but this simply underscores the proposition that the
legislature has the authority to initiate actions that the
judiciary does not." (1S86 Stanford speech, pgs. 17-18.) The
alternative of federal courts instructing government "what
minimum level of entitlements each citizen must receive .
would be a fundamental change of our constitutional tradition,"
and "a further erosion of the sovereignty of separate states."
(1984 Sacramento speech, pgs. 5-6.) Judge Kennedy therefore
recognizes that the legislative branches may have constitutional
responsibilities to furnish the entitlements needed to make the
system work even when those responsibilities are not fully and
perfectly enforceable by courts of law. This view -- one that a
number of scholars have defended -- stands in sharp contrast with
a doctrinaire commitment to judicial enforcement of every right
that our Constitution might be said to support.

         It would be wrong to suggest, said Judge Kennedy in a 1982
Los Angeles speech, that "the judiciary is the sole force for the
preservation of constitutional values .   ." Indeed, he
                             318                                   /

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 15 /
December 16, 1987                             /

recognizes that "the Constitution in some of its most critical

aspects is what the political branches of the government/have

made it, whether the judiciary approves or not," an that

"Congress must acknowledge its constitutional responsibility and

begin to articulate its legislative judgments in constitutional

terms." (Pg. 9.) In his 1986 Stanford speech, Judge Kennedy

elaborated on this theme: "If there are claims of basic rights .

. . not cognizable by the courts, claims that must be honored if

the Constitution is to have its fullest meaning, the political

parts of the government ought to address them" so those branches

are held accountable; a degree of judicial restraint in

addressing such matters ensures that the political branches will

not "deem themselves excused from addressing constitutional

imperatives  ." (Pg. 21.) Judge Kennedy is not concerned

"that there is a zone of ambiguity, even one of tension, between

the courts and the political branches over the appropriate bounds

of governmental power," believing that "[uncertainty is itself a

restraint on the political branch, causing it to act with

deliberation and with conscious reference to constitutional

principles." (Pg. 22.)

         These views do not derive from Judge Kennedy's personal
views about the nature of good judging. Rather, Judge Kennedy
believes that "[t]he imperatives of judicial restraint spring
from the Constitution itself," a document "written with care and
deliberation, not by accident," and that restraint by judges is
part of our structural system of checks and balances. (Pg. 20.)
                             319

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 16
December 16, 1987

Principled limits on judicial power are necessary, Judge Kennedy
argued in his 1987 Sacramento speech, because "judges are in the
fortunate, or unfortunate, position of making up the rules in
[their] own game"; they must therefore avoid both the fact and
the perception that they hold "uncontrolled authority lead[ing]
to the raw exercise of will, the . . . insolence of office."
(Pg. 6.)

3. Assessment.

         In remarks to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference in
August, 1987, Judge Kennedy referred to the notion of an
unwritten Constitution, stressing its embodiment of cultural and
ethical constraints that limit government in general, including
the federal judiciary. He believes that this notion "counsels
the morality of restraint," and "teaches that any branch of the
government which attempts to exercise its powers to the full,
literal extent of the language of the Constitution is both
indecorous and destabilizing to the constitutional order." (Pgs.
5-6.)

         Some critics of these observations -- and of the measured
tone of Judge Kennedy's speeches generally -- have read in them a
distressing signal of reluctance to invoke judicial power boldly
to vindicate unconventional or unpopular claims against the will
of a determined majority. A candid assessment requires one to
concede that there is a risk that the thoughtful generalities
                             320

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 17
December 16, 1987

contained in Judge Kennedy's speeches could serve as excuses for
an insufficiently vigilant judicial role. But it seems
fundamentally improper to read Judge Kennedy's speeches in their
entirety as presenting any such threat. There is no ground for
drawing sinister inferences from language which seems entirely
responsible and which does not suggest an agenda to diminish the
established role of the federal judiciary in protecting
individual rights.

         It is perhaps ironic that a principal criticism of Judge
Kennedy, from both ends of the ideological spectrum, has focused
on his supposed tendency to accept legal doctrine as pronounced
by the Supreme Court -- a tendency that some criticize as
insensitive to claims of freedom and equality, and that others
criticize as insufficiently protective of the majority's
prerogatives. Thus, I have heard him attacked both from the
right for his failure to criticize the Supreme Court's
controversial 1973 abortion decision, and from the left for his
failure to criticize the Court's 1986 decision limiting the
rights of sexual privacy.

         I find neither attack fair or persuasive. As a sitting
federal judge, Anthony Kennedy might have felt less free to
criticize than others would. Or perhaps it is simply not his
style to tilt too hard against prevailing legal winds. But what
I have read of Judge Kennedy's work belies any notion that he
lacks the independence of mind or the critical edge that would
                             321

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 18
December 16, 1987

enable him to bring his powerful intellect and his evident sense
of fairness to bear upon the novel challenges that would confront
him as a Supreme Court Justice.

        Nor should the intellectual quality of Judge Kennedy's work
be underestimated. It might be easier to perceive brilliance in
constitutional arguments that stake out bold, extreme positions
-- in speeches and essays (or, for that matter, opinions) that
simplify for the sake of emphasis or clarity. But it would be a
great mistake in Judge Kennedy's case to attribute the cautious
and measured character of his analyses to any lack of
intellectual force, lucidity of mind, or conviction. The caution
that characterizes Judge Kennedy's speeches reflects not a mind
lacking in boldness but a temperment resistant to
oversimplification. In sum, Judge Kennedy's speeches reward
close attention precisely because they reveal an admirably
complex and balanced understanding of constitutional problems.

                                   B. The Judicial Opinions

        In light of these qualities of mind, it should not be too
surprising that Judge Kennedy's views, as reflected in his Court
of Appeals opinions, resist easy categorization.

        Judge Kennedy's opinions on the Court of Appeals
consistent with the views he has expressed in his unpublished
speeches -- demonstrate a sensitive approach to the problems of
constitutional interpretation. Ultimately, Judge Kennedy's
                             322

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 19
December 16, 1987

opinions reveal a belief in the fundamental constitutional
principles that have been of concern to this Committee. In
particular, they demonstrate the absence of any categorical
opposition to a view of the Constitution as an organic, evolving
document; dedication to the fundamental role of the courts in our
constitutional system as protectors of individuals and minorities
from oppressive government; and a commitment to the special place
of courts in elaborating and enforcing principles implicit in the
Constitution's structure, even when those principles may not be
explicitly stated within the four corners of the document.

        Judge Kennedy has limited his holdings quite closely to the
facts of the case before him, avoiding the broad, inevitably
oversimplified pronouncements of the dogmatist. In this he
reminds me of the late Justice Stewart, for whom I clerked in
1967 and of whom I wrote in a tribute: "He was less interested in
pursuing a unified philosophical vision than in determining what
the law, as he understood it, required in the case at hand."
Tribe, Justice Stewart; A Tale of Two Portraits, 95 Yale L.J.
1328, 1328 (1986). Judge Kennedy espouses no all-inclusive
constitutional theory, and his opinions reflect a cautious,
thoughtful, case-by-case approach to judicial decisionmaking.
The "judicial restraint" revealed in his opinions is the
restraint that avoids categorical answers to complex issues whose
resolution requires subtlety and flexibility.
                             323

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 20
December 16, 1987

1. A Belief in Implicit and Evolving Constitutional Principles.

        Judge Kennedy's opinions are illustrative of his willingness
to draw inferences from the broader principles underlying the
Constitution's text. His decisions concerning the right to
privacy, for example, reveal a cautious acceptance of certain
constitutionally protected unenumerated rights.

        In Beller v. Middendorf, 632 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1980), cert,
denied sub nom. Beller v. Lehman, 452 U.S. 905 (1981), for
example, Judge Kennedy ruled that the constitutional right to
privacy did not protect naval personnel from discharge for
homosexual conduct. While I am inclined to disagree with Judge
Kennedy's conclusion, there can be little doubt that the Supreme
Court as then composed would have reached the same result he
did. Indeed, the Court subsequently upheld the power of state
governments to go so far as to impose criminal penalties on
private, consensual homosexual conduct in Bowers v. Hardwick, 106
S. Ct. 2841 (1986) -- a case that I argued in support of the
privacy claim.

        In Middendorf, Judge Kennedy did not conclude that the
consensual conduct at issue was constitutionally unprotected, but
that the needs of the military outweighed whatever solicitude
such conduct was due. Judge Kennedy's ultimate conclusion --
that the right to privacy must yield in some circumstances -- is
surely defensible. Indeed, even the brief I submitted in
Hardwick invited a distinction between crimininalizing consensual
                             324

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 21
December 16, 1987

intimacies and subjecting them to less intrusive forms of
regulation. The language of Judge Kennedy's opinion evidences
recognition of the courts' role in the protection of certain
unenumerated rights grounded in historical understandings or
inferrable from the structure of the Constitution.

         The Middendorf opinion also demonstrates the type of
cautious restraint characteristic of Judge Kennedy's judicial
philosophy. In Middendorf Judge Kennedy decided only the
question before him -- the permissibility of military discharge
for homosexual conduct -- leaving open the question of privacy in
other contexts until a case concretely presenting the issue might
come before the court. At a time when other judges -- in the
name of judicial "restraint" -- were shutting the door to future
litigation of related issues of individual liberty, Judge Kennedy
properly went out of his way to avoid such judicial activism.

         United States v. Penn, 647 F.2d 876 (9th Cir.), cert,
denied, 449 U.S. 903 (1980), reveals the extent of Judge
Kennedy's commitment to constitutional protection for fundamental
rights involving privacy and the family. In Penn, Judge Kennedy
dissented when the Court of Appeals upheld the legality of a
five-dollar police bribe to a five-year-old child -- offered to
the child in his parents' absence -- to obtain evidence to be
used against his mother. Judge Kennedy would have excluded the
evidence that the bribed child had shown to the police. Most
significantly, he based his ruling on more than the ad hoc
                             325

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 22
December 16, 1987

conclusion, relied on by the district court, that the police
behavior was so "shocking to the conscience" as to violate due
process. See id. at 879 (citing Rochin v. California, 342 U.S.
165 (1952) (per Frankfurter, J.)). Rather, Judge Kennedy viewed
the governmental intrusion into the parent-child relationship as
violative of the broad principles animating such Supreme Court
privacy decisions as Moore v. City of East Cleveland, 431 U.S.
494 (1977) , and Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510
(1925). While others have attacked the Supreme Court's privacy
decisions as "unprincipled," Judge Kennedy's ability to apply
those decisions in a principled way to a new situation
demonstrates a genuine commitment to the idea of a living
Constitution.

         Nor is Judge Kennedy's commitment to the Constitution as a
set of principles going beyond the explicit textual provisions
limited to the elaboration of unenumerated personal rights. It
extends as well to discerning structural limits in the
constitutional system of checks and balances which is, in the
end, one of the fundamental guarantors of individual liberty. In
Chadha v. INS, 634 F.2d 408 (9th Cir. 1980), aff'd sub nom. INS
v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), Judge Kennedy foreshadowed the
Supreme Court's landmark invalidation of the legislative veto,
see INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), reasoning that to place
the disapproval power in the hands of one house of the
legislature threatens the tyranny of concentrated power that the
separation of powers was designed to prevent. In so holding,
                             326

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 23
December 16, 1987

Judge Kennedy relied not only on the intentions of the Framers,
but also on principles inherent in the system of government they
created. Judge Kennedy's Chadha opinion confronted the
complexities of the legislative veto even more forthrightly than
did the Supreme Court; indeed, many commentators, I among them,
have found Judge Kennedy's opinion in Chadha to be more subtle
and insightful than the opinion for the Court written by Chief
Justice Burger, demonstrating a thoughtful -- even scholarly --
approach to the Constitution's most fundamental architectural
principles.

         The Chadha opinion, too, reveals again what might be called
Judge Kennedy's most consistent philosophy. He himself has
described the aspect of the case to which I refer, in the Hoover
Lecture delivered at Stanford in May, 1984: "In our court we left
open the possibility of further analysis or doctrinal elaboration
by confining the opinion to the case before us. This was implied
acknowledgement that some forms of legislative veto might
survive." (Pg. 1.)

2. A Positive Commitment to the Judicial Role.

        Rather than uniformly evidencing only a grudging acceptance
of the judicial role in elaborating and enforcing fundamental
constitutional principles, Judge Kennedy's opinions often display
a powerful affirmative commitment to judicial protection of
liberty and equality. He has at times sought positively to
                             327

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 24
December 16, 1987

extend protections of these fundamental rights beyond the point
undeniably compelled by Supreme Court precedent.

         Perhaps the most prominent example is Judge Kennedy's
opinion in James v. Ball, 613 F.2d 180 (9th Cir. 1979), rev'd sub
nom. Ball v. James, 451 U.S. 355 (1981). Six years before James,
the Supreme Court, by a divided vote, had qualified its basic
commitment to the "one person-one vote'' principle with a dubious
notion that a "one acre-one vote" allocation of electoral power
is permissible for a governmental body that has a "special
limited purpose," if its activities have a "disproportionate
effect . . . on landowners as a group . . . ." Salyer Land Co.
v. Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District, 410 U.S. 719, 728
(1973).

         Sensing the tension between this decision and the promise of
equal participation explicit in Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186
(1962), and its earlier progeny, Judge Kennedy refused to extend
the approach of Salyer to the Arizona Agricultural Improvement
and Power District -- a governmental entity that provided
utilities and water services to many of the citizens of Arizona,
landowners and non-landowners alike -- and held unconstitutional
an electoral system in which the franchise was restricted to
landowners, with voting power essentially apportioned on the
basis of the amount of land owned.

         Unfortunately, only four Supreme Court Justices were
persuaded by Judge Kennedy's reasoning. A 5-4 Court reversed
                             328

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 25
December 16, 1987

James v. Ball, and retreated further from the principle of one
person-one vote. See Ball v. James, 451 U.S. 355 (1981). In
dissent, Justice White, joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall and
Blackmun, quoted at some length from Judge Kennedy's opinion,
sharing his conclusion that "'it would elevate form over
substance to characterize the District as functioning solely for
the benefit of the landowners.'" 451 U.S. at 383-84 (quoting 613
F.2d at 184).

         Similarly, in CBS, Inc. v. United States District Court, 765
F.2d 823 (9th Cir. 1985), Judge Kennedy extended the First
Amendment right of access to criminal proceedings -- a right
first recognized in Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448
U.S. 555 (1980) -- to the post-conviction context, and to a right
of documentary access. CBS sought access in this case to a
sealed motion for a reduced sentence submitted by a defendant as
part of a plea bargain in which he agreed to testify against
automobile executive John DeLorean, then on trial for narcotics
offenses. Judge Kennedy held that *[t]he primary justifications
for access to criminal proceedings . . . apply with as much force
to post-conviction proceedings as to the trial itself," 765 F.2d
at 825, and ordered the district court to unseal both the
defendant's motion and the government's response. His decision
thus expanded the scope of the government's affirmative duty to
provide access to information in order to make meaningful the
liberty implicitly guaranteed by the First Amendment.
                             329

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 26
December 16, 1987

        Even in cases where Judge Kennedy might be faulted for
having afforded insufficient judicial protection to minorities,
his opinions display a willingness to suggest other possible
avenues for judicial relief. In Aranda v. Van Sickle, 600 F.2d
1267 (9th Cir. 1979), cert, denied, 446 U.S. 951 (1980), for
example, Judge Kennedy was faced with a challenge to San
Fernando, California's at-large voting system. A group of
Mexican-Americans alleged that the electoral scheme was intended
to discriminate against them. In a separate concurring opinion,
after reluctantly finding the evidence insufficient to create an
inference of intentional discrmination in the creation or
maintenance of the entire at-large voting system -- a decision
with which I disagree -- Judge Kennedy went on to suggest that
some of the evidence presented might justify other types of
judicial relief, including "a remedial requirement of increased
consideration and/or appointment of Mexican-Americans" to San
Fernando's city commissions, on which Mexican-Americans had been
historically underrepresented. 600 F.2d at 1279. Thus Judge
Kennedy went out of his way to suggest alternative possibilities
to the litigants against whom he ruled.

3. Willingness to Absolve Government of Responsibility.

        None of this is to say that Judge Kennedy could plausibly be
described as a judicial "liberal." He has, for example, been
quick at times to absolve government of responsibility for its
complicity in inequality arising from the marketplace in
                             330

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 27
December 16, 1987

employment and housing. In his famous opinion in AFSCME v. State
of Washington, 770 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir. 1985), Judge Kennedy wrote
the nation's leading opinion rejecting the comparable worth
theory of gender-based wage discrimination. He held that the
employees of the State of Washington, in job categories at least
seventy percent female, could make out neither a disparate impact
nor a disparate treatment claim under Title VII based upon
inequality of pay for comparable work. Writing that "[n]either
law nor logic deems the free market system a suspect enterprise,"
Judge Kennedy concluded that "the State did not create the market
disparity and has not been shown to have been motivated by
impermissible sex-based considerations in setting salaries." 770
F.2d at 406-07. While it seems likely that the Supreme Court
would have reached the same conclusion, Judge Kennedy was perhaps
too quick to conclude that the state bore no responsibility for
deciding in its own practices to mirror the "private" wrong of a
structural, gender-based wage disparity.

         In Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, 611 F.2d
1239, 1242 (9th Cir. 1979) (Kennedy, J., concurring), following
the Supreme Court's lead, Judge Kennedy concluded that a court
should not retain jurisdiction over a school desegregation action
where the school board had substantially complied with a court
order designed to remove the vestiges of past discrimination even
where the result -- because of such "private" wrongs as
segregated neighborhoods -- will almost certainly be schools as
segregated as they were prior to the court-ordered desegregation
                             331

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 28
December 16, 1987

plan. While Judge Kennedy's opinion was consistent with Supreme
Court precedent, see Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of
Education, 427 U.S. 424 (1976), a more sensitive approach might
have recognized that even such 'natural" and "private" factors as
residential choices that cause discriminatory racial consequences
may themselves be products of prior official policies and public
programs. A deeper commitment to the elimination, "root and
branch," Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 438 (1968),
of racial separation in our public schools requires complex --
and continuing -- judicial remedies, even reaching at times into
the field of racially segregated housing. Indeed, the rigid
compartmentalization of state action that underlies the Court's
desegregation remedy decisions is reflected daily in the
continuing racial segregation in our schools, exposing the sadly
unkept promise of Brown.

         In the latter regard, Judge Kennedy's reading of  3 612 of
the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C.  3612, in TOPIC v. Circle
Realty, 532 F.2d 1273 (9th Cir. 1976), was strikingly restrictive
of the class of people to whom the Act granted standing to sue.
TOPIC, an integrated organization dedicated to eliminating racial
discrimination in housing, had discovered -- through use of black
and white couples posing as home seekers -- realtors engaging in
racially based "steering," that is, directing of black customers
to homes in predominantly black residential areas. Judge Kennedy
ruled that this section of the Act did not permit suits to
vindicate the rights of third parties, and that only a narrow
                             332

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 29
December 16, 1987

class of "direct victims" of housing discrimination -- persons
directly faced with discriminatory practices -- were "granted
rights" under the Act. Judge Kennedy's decision would
effectively have limited the right to sue under  3612 to this
small group of "direct victims."

         This conclusion seems particularly hard to defend in light
of the Supreme Court's prior holding that *[a]ny person who
claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice"
-- language contained in another section of the Fair Housing Act
-- includes a renter or homeowner denied by discriminatory
practices against others "the important benefits from interracial
associations." Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. ,
409 U.S. 205, 210 (1972). Judge Kennedy sought to distinguish
the harms of residential segregation suffered by TOPIC members as
"caused by no specific single act of the defendants, but by a
prolonged practice spanning many years" -- and thus somehow as
less worthy of immediate judicial redress. That distinction is
unpersuasive. I think it fortunate that the Supreme Court -- by
a vote of 7-2 in an opinion written for the Court by Justice
Powell -- disapproved of TOPIC in Gladstone, Realtors v. Village
of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91 (1979).

         It must be conceded that more than a few individuals and
groups have found something to criticize in decisions such as
these; some of the criticism seems to me well founded. But no
nominee may be required to be free from error. And nothing in
                             333

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 30
December 16, 1987

Judge Kennedy's judicial performance suggests that he should not
be confirmed, for nothing in it overcomes the overall picture,
presented by his speeches and opinions taken as a whole, of Judge
Kennedy as a sensitive and powerful proponent of judicial
vindication of basic rights -- and as an intelligent and fair
judge. None of his judicial work evidences the antipathy to
fundamental constitutional principles that might bring into
question his suitability as a nominee to the Supreme Court.

        On the contrary, Anthony Kennedy's public service as a
Circuit Judge, like his scholarly work, evidences qualities of
mind and spirit that well suit him to distinguished service on
any court. His is not a nomination that challenges the role that
the post-World War II Supreme Court has come to play in defending
constitutional principles of liberty and equality, within a
system of separated and divided powers. On the the contrary, his
nomination is entirely consistent with that evolving role.

                                          III. CONCLUSIONS

        When all is said and done, Judge Kennedy is, in most senses
of the word, a "conservative." But it is not a play on words to
say that there is much worth conserving in our constitutional
tradition. And, in any event, the role our Constitution assigns
to federal judges is in some respects inescapably a
"conservative" one. Such judges are, after all, bound by a legal
tradition that leaves them free to make significant choices --
                             334

Testimony of Laurence Tribe       page 31
December 16, 1987

but only within a fairly significant set of constraints. Within
these constraints, some would prefer a jurist with more "liberal"
leanings than Judge Kennedy is likely to display. But liberals
are not entitled to demand that of the President. The Senate
should not withhold its consent from a nomination that honors and
seems likely to advance, rather than jeopardize, our core
constitutional traditions even if some Senators would have
favored a differently inclined Justice.

        There is good reason to believe that Anthony Kennedy would
serve with distinction, and would work to preserve and protect
basic constitutional values, if confirmed as a Justice of the
Supreme Court. And, assuming these hearings contain no
surprises, there is no good reason to believe that his approach
to the Constitution, or to the Court's role in enforcing it,
would threaten either our fundamental law or the judicial
function. Thus I urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to report
favorably the nomination of Judge Kennedy to the full Senate,
which I hope will promptly confirm his appointment as an
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.
                                      335
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Professor. As I said, I have some pre-
pared questions. I may submit them to you in writing, but I have
one question at the top here.
  I read with some interest yesterday, an editorial saying that
Kennedy was the same as Bork. His views on unenumerated rights
were no different than Judge Bork's. Some of my colleagues have
suggested that.
  How can you say, as you have here, that he is different? Summa-
rize for me, if you can in a minute or so, so I will have a chance to
ask you another question, in what fundamental sense is his view
on unenumerated rights different than Judge Bork's?
  Professor TRIBE. Well, I guess, Mr. Chairman, he put it rather
well lunjself. Judge Kennedy said that, rather than talk about "un-
enumerated rights"--he does not like that phrase a lot either--we
are simply talking about how far "liberty" extends, and the differ-
ence is that to him--and he has made this clear in several of his
opinions, and his votes on the court, and clear in his speeches, and
clear in his testimony--"liberty" extends beyond the substantive
points that are marked out in the Bill of Rights.
  It includes a substantive protection for privacy, it includes mari-
tal privacy, it includes an evolving understanding of what it is that
makes us human beings, and where we draw what he called the
"wavering line" is between us and the State.
  The CHAIRMAN. HOW did Judge Bork draw that line?
  Professor TRIBE. Judge Bork said if the line wavers, if it is not
clearly spelled out in the fine print, if it is not a liberty specifically
mentioned, then he does not find it in the Constitution.
  The CHAIRMAN. And if he cannot find it in the Constitution,
therefore it does not warrant constitutional protection?
  Professor TRIBE. And I think that is where they agree. You have
got to find it in the Constitution, but the Constitution, as Judge
Kennedy reads it, is considerably broader than the Constitution as
Judge Bork seems to have read it.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW much that Judge Kennedy said yesterday,
and the day before, I found not only compelling but reassuring. I,
like you, do not think I have a right to--and I have said this from
the beginning, as long as I have been on this Committee--to insist
that the person who goes to this Court, or any other court, share
all of my views, or even the majority of my views on the substan-
tive issues, but has some constitutional philosophy that resembles
what I think should be on the Court.
  But I have to tell you, I still have some concerns about Judge
Kennedy, and I would like to list several of them for you, and then
stop and let you respond.
  In the area of privacy, as I said, I found much of what Judge
Kennedy said to be within a tradition of evolving human dignity
and human liberty that I find in the Constitution, and that the Su-
preme Court has protected and advanced over our 200-year history.
  But frankly, Professor, Judge Kennedy has a point of view that
you and I both know, may--at least I speak for myself--may chal-
lenge, may cramp what he may do in terms of the challenges the
Court will face--not the ones they have already faced, but what
they will face in the area of privacy.
                                                336

  And that I wonder whether or not he will continue to be part of
this evolution that has taken place over the last 200 years regard-
ing human dignity and human liberty.

  These new problems will demand Justices committed to, I think,
sustaining and promoting that tradition by being sensitive to the
role of government in its confrontation with individuals, and those
concerns of individuals' personal zones of privacy, to which he re-
ferred.

  Do you see anything in his record that reassures you, that Judge
Kennedy will be part of the continuing tradition of liberty as it ap-
plies to new situations and new problems that the Justices are
going to have to face?

  Professor TRIBE. Senator, I think we have no guarantees, but in
the thoughtfulness, the articulateness, the openmindedness, the
passion with which he expressed his vision of a Constitution that
we come to understand better as we develop as a society--through
that expression, I have as good a reason as I can to hope. He does
seem, to me, to be openminded, and, in opinions that he has writ-
ten, when he could have decided simply--in the case where, for ex-
ample, a child was bribed to tell where his mother had hidden
something--he could have said this shocks my conscience, but in-
stead, he connected his decision with an evolving understanding of
family privacy.

  Now I do not know where he will go with that, but we are not
entitled to that kind of guarantee.

  The CHAIRMAN. In the area of affirmative action, Judge Kennedy
has expressed what would seem to me to be a very cautious atti-
tude toward remedies for discrimination.

  We discussed his opinion in the Aranda case, in particular.
  Do you see anything in Judge Kennedy's record, that reassures
you that he will provide a moderating voice on the Court?
  Will the Court, with a Justice Kennedy, continue to recognize
the need for carefully considered affirmative-action programs and
remedies? I know you cannot say for sure, but what does your in-
stinct tell you?
  Professor TRIBE. Well, my instinct is to hope so, and to think that
this is an area where the Court has been cautious, and ought to be
cautious. It ought not to run head-long into areas that are deemed
terribly controversial.
  But even in the Aranda case, where I am troubled by his ruling
with respect to Mexican-Americans--even in that case, unlike the
two colleagues that he had on the bench, he went out of his way to
suggest--not just before this committee, but in the opinion that he
wrote, a concurring opinion--that narrower remedies, including a
movement in the polling places to places within the Mexican-Amer-
ican community, might have been appropriate.
  Now I wish he had made that opinion a dissent rather than a
concurrence. It would not have changed the outcome, but it would
have sent a better signal.
  And I am pleased that, in his list of heroes of Justices on the
Court, he did not include only those who always go along in order
to get along.
  His list, as I remember it, to Senator Heflin, included at least
five great dissenters--people like Holmes, and Brandeis, and Car-
                                               337

dozo, and the first Harlan, and Black, in the early years of his
career.

  So it seems to me that there is reason to believe that we have
here someone who is truly groping for justice, and who will be even
more sensitive in the future than he has sometimes been in the
past.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I have more questions but my time is up.

      QUESTION FROM SENATOR BIDEN FOR PROFESSOR LAURENCE TRIBE

         1. One of the most significant controversies regarding
Judge Bork's nomination involved his views on the role of stare
decisis. Many of Judge Bork's critics argued that his record
indicated that he would have little respect for Supreme Court
decisions, and would not hesitate to overrule those decisions
with which he disagreed. Some of Judge Kennedy's critics have
questioned the strength of his respect for precedent. Do you
see a substantial difference between the views of Judge Bork
and Judge Kennedy's position on this issue?

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr.
Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510-6275

Dear Senator Biden:

        The following is in response to your question of December 18
concerning the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Anthony
Kennedy.

        My review of Judge Kennedy's judicial opinions and of his
speeches suggests to me that he has an entirely appropriate view
of the role of stare decisis, presenting none of the peculiar
difficulties posed by Judge Bork's apparent views on that
subject. The Committee will recall that, in the case of Judge
Bork, numerous pronouncements, some of them made after his
appointment as a circuit court judge, strongly suggested not only
that he recognized a judicial obligation to reconsider clearly
erroneous constitutional rulings -- an obligation virtually all
Supreme Court Justices have acknowledged -- but also that he felt
no hesitation to overturn decisions that departed from his quite
rigid notions of "original intent." On numerous occasions, in
fact, Judge Bork had suggested that, unless entire industries or
institutions had been constructed in reliance on a long line of
well-settled rulings, a Supreme Court Justice committed to
following the Framers' original intent should have no reluctance
at all to overrule a Supreme Court precedent of a non-originalist
sort. The upshot was that Judge Bork came to the Committee as a
jurist with a program that seemed to portend constitutional
revolution rather than continuous evolution of constitutional
doctrine.

        Judge Kennedy, in sharp contrast, has both expressed in his
speeches, and exemplified in his judicial work, a commitment to
gradual evolution of doctrine and precedent, within the context
of a principled exposition of constitutional text, history, and
structure that is not tied down by any doctrinaire and
backward-looking philosophy of an originalist sort. Of course,
Judge Kennedy recognizes a judicial duty to reexamine prior
decisions when powerful arguments are mounted that those
decisions were profoundly misguided -- especially in the
constitutional setting, where a judicial refusal to reconsider
past errors may be particularly devastating given the difficulty
of changing the constitutional text through the amendment

process. But such a willingness to reexamine the past seems, for
Judge Kennedy, to be part and parcel of a generally open-minded
and evolutionary approach to law itself as an organic, developing
body of understanding.

        Indeed, among the most striking of Judge Kennedy's views as
expressed in his testimony before this Committee in December 1987
was his notion that, with the passage of time and the flow of
history, judges become not less capable of divining the original
meaning of constitutional provisions enacted long ago but more
capable of understanding what those provisions truly meant and
should be interpreted to mean. For the understanding judges seek
is not a strictly historicist unearthing of the subjective
beliefs or assumptions of particular individuals who may have
written, or voted for, specific texts but, rather, an
appreciation of the objective principles and premises implicit in
the texts promulgated through the institutional process of
const itut ion-making.

        In the context of this quite subtle and indeed profound
conception of the judicial process, it is not surprising that
Judge Kennedy should have testified, as he did, that stare
decisis is less a method or doctrine than a summary of how
courts, building their understanding of texts and traditions in
part upon the perceptions of their judicial predecessors,
inevitably operate in a system such as ours. Just as Judge
Kennedy opined that the search for "original intent" is less a
method to be followed than a goal to be sought, so he opined that
respect for precedent is less a technique to be codified --
complete with rules as to when precedent should be deemed less
binding than usual -- than an objective to be pursued. Ideally,
in the judicial world envisioned by Judge Kennedy, it is the
ongoing process of refining and perfecting the vision of the
future implicit in the work of the past that marks the judge's
mission. By definition, that mission is respectful of, but not
rigidly bound by, decisions made by prior courts. That view of
stare decisis, if I understand Judge Kennedy correctly, is
considerably more humble, more modest, and more attuned to each
judge's need to draw on the wisdom of those who came before him,
than was true of the approach championed by Judge Bork. I count
myself a critic of the Bork approach and an admirer of the
Kennedy approach.

                                                      Respect fully submitted,

  The CHAIRMAN. Before I yield to my colleague from Wyoming, let
me do a little bit of housekeeping. It will take 30 seconds. For those
witnesses who will come later. I asked yesterday if one panel, the
only panel we know that is in dissent, wanted to go earlier in the
day. They said they did not want to go earlier in the day.

  They have now requested that they go earlier in the day. In
keeping with the tradition that we go with a panel that is for, and
then one that is against, and one that is for, I am going to move
the dissenting panel up after Mr. Griswold testifies.

  So they should be read. And then we will move with the panel
that is listed as next on the agenda, and we will end with a panel
that is for.

  So the panel including National Organization for Women, and
ADA, who are against, will go after Mr. Griswold.

  I yield to my colleague from Wyoming,
  Senator SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. I do want the
record to reflect that--you know--as we bring up the similarities
and differences of this nomination, and Robert Bork, that it is not
confined to jast t! ~ie of us on this side of the table.
  I think we can already determine that. That it comes from both
sides of the table, because that is the thing that is seared closest in
our minds, and so it is not coming from this side, or, from the
right. It is cc aing from that side, and the left.
  So I just want to kind of get that out, for whatever purpose it is,
for the record, because I think it is very vital.
  It is good to see you, sir. We had a very lively and interesting
exchange during the--I was going to say the Bork hearings--but
we will just say, from now on, the previous matter.
  Professor TRIBE. I enjoyed that exchange too, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. Yes, the previous matter. And I enjoyed that
because I have the greatest respect for you, and I really believe,
hopefully, God willing, and the voters, that you will be here at that
table with an opening statement in a different capacity, if there is
a different President, a President of the Democratic Party. I think
you would be one of the first choices.

  And you are a spirited and articulate man, and we did differ, but
I enjoyed that very much. And now, you are here to testify for
Judge Kennedy. Now when you add that to your support of Judge
Scalia and Justice O'Connor, you are batting 750.

  Professor TRIBE. I think it is more like a thousand, Senator.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, not quite, you see. We have the other
matter to refer to.
  Professor TRIBE. Yes. We have a difference on the other matter.
  Senator SIMPSON. The other matter.
  Professor TRIBE. Right. I thought I was right and you thought I
was wrong.
  Senator SIMPSON. That is right, but you are batting 750 which is
better than Ted Williams ever did, and that is good, and that shows
your balance, and, indeed, it is so.
  You have referred to in your remarks, and in your oral presenta-
tion, to "sensitivity," the sensitivity, the passion of this man, and I
see that, too, and I agree with you, and it is very evident.
                                              342

   And indeed his writings, his opinions, do show that important
willingness to go as far as he can without necessarily going any
further into his own philosophies, or own opinions, if you will.

   But I was struck--and I agree with you, totally--that is a very
critical thing for a judge to have, or a politician to have, and that
is "sensitivity," and it is something that is very important to me,
and to you, obviously, and to Judge Kennedy.

   I was interested, as I have reviewed the transcript of "the other
matter," and this. Let me just share a couple of phrases with you.
It is kind of a quiz. Now they never gave me true or false quizzes in
law school, I needed them to get through--I can tell you--but I
never got them.

   But here are a couple of comments, and just tell me which one, if
you can, the nominee in the other proceedings, or this one, who
said: "The framers wrote a Constitution and well understood it was
to apply in circumstances they could not foresee."

  Professor TRIBE. That is Judge Bork speaking, as I recall.
   Senator SIMPSON. That is Judge Kennedy.
   Professor TRIBE. Well, you got me once.
   Senator SIMPSON. NO, wait. I know. We are not
   Professor TRIBE. But actually, Judge Bork said exactly that in a
couple of articles.
   Senator SIMPSON. YOU are right.
  Professor TRIBE. We all start with that premise. The framers
were not prophets.
  Senator SIMPSON. I know, and I am not going to do that. I do not
want to be, you know, a smart ass.
  Who said this? "Constitutional law is not static. It will evolve as
judges modify doctrine to meet new circumstances."
   Professor TRIBE. Well, I do not think I want to fall for this a
second time, Senator.
   Senator SIMPSON. NO, and don't fall for it.
   Professor TRIBE. What are you trying to ask me?
   Senator SIMPSON. I am just saying that the same things that
were said in "the other matter," under oath by this other man
   Professor TRIBE. Yes, but out of context, perhaps.
   Senator SIMPSON. Well, out of context or not, they were said
under oath, rather meaningfully.
  Professor TRIBE. Let me stipulate that Judge Bork has said many
very fine things. I said that when I testified.
   Senator SIMPSON. Let's get back, just quickly, to the right to pri-
vacy, because it keeps coming up again and again and again, but I
still think nobody has said it any better than Judge Griffin Bell,
when he said: "It's the right to be left alone."
   Professor TRIBE. Actually, Louis Brandeis had said that.
   Senator SIMPSON. Was that his?
   Professor TRIBE. That was his line. That was his line. [Laughter.]
   Senator SIMPSON. All right.
   Professor TRIBE. Are you keeping score?
   The CHAIRMAN. This is not time to quibble about things like that.
   Professor TRIBE. But Judge Bell did--I think he quoted him.
   The CHAIRMAN. Did he attribute the quote? That is the question.
That is the question. [Laughter.]
                                                   343

  Professor TRIBE. I think he quoted him without attribution, as a
matter of fact.

  Senator SIMPSON. Well, this is going to deteriorate, terribly, but I
want to just ask on privacy, because it is so critical, it comes up
again and again, and again.

  Here are the two phrases, and I will tell you who said what, but
they seem similar to me.

  Judge Bork said: ''No civilized person wants to live in a society
without a lot of privacy in it, and the framers in fact protected pri-
vacy in a variety of ways." That is what he said.

  Professor TRIBE. But then he listed specific provisions of the Bill
of Rights.

  Senator SIMPSON. Yes, yes, I know. And then Judge Kennedy
said: "It seems to me, to most Americans, lawyers and judges, liber-
ty includes protection of the value we call privacy."

  All I am saying is--and I have several others here--the sole task
of a judge is his duty in judicial restraint. He said a judge has
power over people, it is important since he is unelected, and prob-
ably unrepresentative of the American people, that he demonstrate
by his reasoning that there is a law that he is applying, that he is
not applying his personal values or principles. That was Judge
Bork.

  The sole task of a judge, according to Judge Kennedy, is to trans-
fer the framers' or legislators' morality into a rule to govern un-
foreseen circumstances, that abstinence from giving his own desires
free play, that continuing and self-conscious renunciation of power,
that is the morality of the jurist.

  So, it is interesting to me that there are similarities, to a great
extent, in their philosophies, and in the process, those things were
said under oath in the previous proceedings, and apparently disre-
garded.

  Professor TRIBE. Senator.
   Senator SIMPSON. YOU will win this test.
  Professor TRIBE. Actually, it was not a test, Senator. I just
wanted to ask if you remember a test that Senator Biden gave--I
guess it was Judge Kennedy--when he asked about the Griswold
case, and Judge Kennedy said:

   Well, I can't tell you that particular case, whether I like the opinion, but I can
say that if a hypothetical case were to be imagined that fits better within the priva-
cy that I believe the Constitution protects, I couldn't think of a hypothetical better
than Griswold.

   Whereas, Judge Bork said that Griswold--you know--the right
of a married couple to decide about birth control, and the right of a
company to pollute, are the same to him. I mean, they take the test
differently.

   Senator SIMPSON. But Judge Bork said it was a "goofy law," too.
We want to remember that.

   The CHAIRMAN. Judge Bork also said--if I may interject here--
that he could find no marital right to privacy in the Constitution,
and Judge Kennedy said specifically he found a marital right to
privacy in the Constitution. Fundamental difference.

   Senator METZENBAUM. IS this a test this morning as to who re-
members better what somebody said on a previous occasion?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes, and you are about to flunk if
                                                344

  Senator METZENBAUM. NO question about it, but I am going to at-
tribute my flunking appropriately.

  Senator SIMPSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Senator KENNEDY. Professor Tribe, I want to join in welcoming
you back, again, to this hearing, and to our committee, and also to
commend you for the work that you have done with our committee
over a long period of time on a variety of issues; and we are always
well-served by your appearance, and your responses to questions.
  Just, again, quickly. In your formal presentation, at page 20, and
continuing on for several pages, you express some concern about
the Judge's decisions in the areas of civil rights.
  I am wondering what you might tell us, given what he had writ-
ten, and also, what his responses have been in the course of these
hearings, whether it is the Aranda case, the Circle Realty case,
some of the others that are related to the problems--I will come to
the gender issue, the women's issues after. But one of the concerns
that at least I was addressing is his sensitivity to those who have
been left out, and really left behind, whether it is minorities, or the
handicapped, or the poor, or women in our society.
  You comment on that in a general way in your formal presenta-
tion. You have heard him speak. I want to hear you, briefly, on
that, and then, if that bell goes off, I hope you will take a moment
or two to talk about what assurances women should be able to
reach, both in terms of the cases that he has decided--the
AFSCME case--and also, his responses to the questions on discrim-
ination, invidious discrimination, and his general comments in that
area.
  Those are really the things I would be most interested in, in the
time that I have available.
  Professor TRIBE. Senator, I think the primary assurance is an as-
surance that here is someone who listens, who has evidenced at
least the sensitivity to grow.
  He talked about the fact that he was not really proud of some of
what he had done with respect to those private clubs. He talked
about how much he has come to realize that, even if discrimination
is not intended, that it can hurt, that it can retard the develop-
ment of a fully integrated society, and the ending of discrimina-
tion.
  A number of his quite narrow interpretations of some of the stat-
utes, civil-rights statutes protecting minorities, protecting women,
protecting the handicapped--interpretations in which the United
States Supreme Court ended up going the other way, some times
nine to nothing--these are cases in which he said he now fully ac-
cepts the correctness of what the Supreme Court did.
  He said, in response to, I think a question that you asked, Sena-
tor Kennedy--"I do not think that those statutes"--referring to
the civil-rights statutes--"should be interpreted grudgingly."
  "There is," he said, "a certain amount of finger-pointing that
goes on here, where the courts say the Congress didn't write the
statute clearly enough." But he says: "I have come to recognize
that the workload of the Congress is such that we have to interpret
the statutes as they are given to us."
                                         345

  Now I read no promise, no promise in that statement, but I hear
the voice of someone who is saying, "perhaps I have been, at times,
a bit narrow in my reading of these statutes."

  This is not someone with a fixed commitment to a particular
grudging view of the law. This is someone who is 51 years old, who
I think is capable of development, and, in the particular cases that
are most troubling, this is someone who does reach out.

  I do not agree with his decision in the Mexican-American at-
large voting case. I think he should have gone further. I think he
should have made his separate opinion a dissent. Maybe he would
have had more persuasive force with his colleagues if he had.

  But it is to his credit that, rather than saying, "I'm slamming
the courthouse door on you, go away, I'm giving you no help," he
went out of his way--as he put it correctly in his testimony--virtu-
ally to outline an alternative, and a more creative complaint that
would have provided possible relief to those people.

  So it seems to me that, though one might hope for something
more, or different, there is here a very real basis for believing that
there is an openminded commitment to justice.

  Senator KENNEDY. Just--and I think you have referred to it--
what do you think that you could tell women m our society, based
upon his writings, and in terms of the statements that he has
made--about his understanding of the real problems of discrimina-
tion that may not be so explicit--where the tracks may not be so
evident as to be found in a clear statement of bylaws or statutes--
but which would be hi existence in a world like today.

  What do you gather from his statements, or his comments, or
any of his writings--what would you say by way of assurances to
women in our society that their interests and rights will be protect-
ed?

  Professor TRIBE. Weil, I think, Senator, it would be presumptu-
ous of me to offer assurances to anybody. I mean, people who are
concerned, based on this record, I think have a ^gitimate reason to
speak. But I, at least for myself, took some assurance from his tes-
timony here, that he recognized that when injuries to various
groups, including women, are--I think these were his words--"en-
during, visible, hurtful, and condoned," then that is bad enough to
call it intentional.

  And I think his views of original intent, strangely enough, have
a relevance here. He realizes that what is really important is the
institutional meaning of an act, not just the subjective intent of
those who did it. That is why he reads the Constitution in a sense
that does not require trying to get inside James Madison's head.

  And it seems to me that he has made progress toward under-
standing that when clubs and institutions and government bodies
do things, even thoughtlessly, not necessarily with hostile animus,
that do hurt those who have been left out, that there is a real prob-
lem, and I think he has made progress towards understanding that.

  I think it is interesting that he volunteered here--he was not
pressed--he volunteered that he thought we do not have a "free so-
ciety" as long as people are left out because of their race, or be-
cause of their sex.

  He had no trouble with Senator DeConcini's questions about
whether the Court has moved in the right direction when it comes
                                             346

to extending the guarantees of equality to deal with problems of
gender.

  In fact the only issue he raised about equal protection and
gender was whether the Court had gone far enough. He said maybe
we should have strict scrutiny and not just heightened scrutiny in
gender cases.

  He was unwilling, as others have been--and I take Senator
Simpson's suggestion that perhaps we put this in more anonymous
terms--he was unwilling, as others have been, to say that mere ra-
tionality and reasonableness are enough for gender.

  So there is a real basis for promise here.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania. Senator Spec-
ter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Professor Tribe, I note in your prepared statement, your observa-
tion that, "Little can be gained from seeking any single unitary
theory for construing the Constitution."
  I believe that Judge Kennedy's testimony approximates that gen-
eralization, but in some of his writings he had commented about
the requirement that there be some connection between original
intent and the holding of the Court.
  I had explored with him, at some length, the Brown v. Board
case, on the proposition that in seeking framers' intent, it was
pretty clear-cut that the prevailing practice, in many parts of the
United States, called for segregated schools, including the District
of Columbia. That the Senate Gallery was in fact segregated.

  So that if one seeks original intent as the lodestone for interpre-
tation of the Equal Protection Clause, Brown v. Board of Education
went contrary to original intent.

  I would start by asking you your judgement, as to whether there
is any way to construe Brown v. Board to comply with the intent of
the framers of the 14th amendment, Equal Protection Clause,
where they lived in a segregated society with segregated schools?

  Professor TRIBE. Senator Specter, on that one I think my answer
is almost exactly the same as Judge Kennedy's. That is, he draws a
distinction, and I would draw it as well, between the intent at an
institutional and general level, that is expressed in the public acts
of those who promulgated and those who ratified the 14th amend-
ment, and the subjective, specific assumptions of the particular in-
dividuals involved.

  I think we all recognize that they lived, at that time, in a segre-
gated society, and if someone had asked them, "are the practices of
your society consistent with what you have projected into the
future, in the Constitution, as a compact with the future," I think
most of them would have had to concede, "no, they are not neces-
sarily consistent, we do not yet practice what--through the Consti-
tution--we have decided to preach."

  But I think Judge Kennedy was right when he said that they
promulgated the Constitution anyway, and were willing to be
bound by its consequences.

  They wanted to rise above its injustices. So that it is, I think, en-
tirely right to say that if by original intent we mean the specific
                                               347

subjective assumptions of those who wrote it, then you cannot justi-
fy decisions like Brown v. Board.

  Such a decision is right, it is moral, it is lawful, precisely because
the relevant intent is not what was going on inside the private
thoughts and assumptions of a particular set of draftsmen.

  We are bound by the objective intent, and as Senator Hatch I
think likes to express it--the "original meaning" of the Constitu-
tion. And when the Constitution is promulgated with words as gen-
eral as "equal protection of the laws", then we are bound--we are
trying to interpret those words to seek not the subjective specific
intent of those who wrote them, but the objective intent that was
expressed through the words they chose.

  Senator SPECTER. Professor Tribe, where the 14th amendment
contains the language, "equal protection of the law," which is a
generalization, and then you have the issue as to whether there
ought to be segregated schools, which is a specification--if you ele-
vate constitutional doctrine to require the application of the intent
of the framers, and you deal with the specific of desegregating the
schools, how can you say that looking to what was in the minds of
the framers, as it applies to the specific issue--segregated schools--
that there is anything but an intent that equal protection does not
include integration?

  Professor TRIBE. Senator, your premise, if you look into the
"minds of the framers" as to their specific intent--given that
premise, your conclusion surely follows, and what I would argue,
what Judge Kennedy seems to believe, is that the premise is
wrong.

  We should not have a jurisprudence of original specific subjective
intent, but that does not mean that the purpose of the Constitution
somehow becomes irrelevant.

  The mistake is to ignore that you can seek the meaning of the
Constitution and resist imposing your own will, without suddenly
falling into the trap of enforcing the specific subjective intentions
of the framers.

  Those specific subjective intentions never became part of the
Constitution. So that I think we agree, though the labelling may be
different.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, we all agree with the conclusion of Brown
v. Board of Education, but what I am looking toward is whether
there is an ideological straitjacket to be applied on framers' intent?

  Professor TRIBE. And I agree with you, Senator, that there is not,
and oughtn't to be. That if there were, if there were a narrow, spe-
cific subjective straitjacket, not only would particular decisions like
Brown be wrong, but the Constitution would be frozen. It would be
stillborn.

  It would preserve the status quo that they assumed was perhaps
lawful, and then why bother--as Judge Kennedy asked--why
bother promulgating a Constitution? So that straitjacket seems to
me to be wrong, and I agree with you.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, do you believe that it is ever appropriate
for the Supreme Court to decide a case at variance with framers'
intent?
                                      348

  Professor TRIBE. With the specific subjective intent, yes. At vari-
ance with the general purpose that the framers had, as expressed
in the general language they chose, no.

  I think that judges are bound to enforce the Constitution, and
that doing that requires--and here is where I think Judge Kenne-
dy's subtlety is really very powerful--it requires recognizing that
we can learn from the history and the tradition of interpreting the
Constitution.

  It is not as though, by getting further from the moment at which
they wrote, we somehow lose our understanding of what they did.
By getting further from it, by looking at it in the light of what has
transpired since, we can develop a clearer understanding of the
meaning of the grand promises that they wrote into the Constitu-
tion.

  I think it was really very insightful for Judge Kennedy to formu-
late it that way. I have not read it formulated that way.

  Senator SPECTER. That is news to you?
  Professor TRIBE. Well, the idea is not entirely new, but for those
who often say of Judge Kennedy, he is not as brilliant, not as ar-
ticulate as some others, they are wrong.
  This man is capable of articulating a powerful, coherent vision,
and of making it understandable and appealing.
  Senator SPECTER. I agree
  Senator KENNEDY. The Senator's time is up. The Senator from
Ohio has indicated he is ready for questioning, so I will recognize
him, and then return. The Senator from Ohio.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I just have a few questions, Mr. Tribe. I
am happy to see you before our committee again.
  You did testify, quite eloquently, in connection with the earlier
nominee. What would you say is the most important difference be-
tween Judge Kennedy and Judge Bork?
  Professor TRIBE. If I had to reduce it to a single, most important
difference, I suppose it would be that Judge Kennedy is not an
ideologue with a clear agenda of revisionism.
  He is an openminded person with a commitment to an evolving
Constitution. He is more cautious, more respectful of tradition,
more flexible in his understanding of the Constitution, and I think
he means it when he says, in response to--I think it was a question
from Senator Humphrey--he has no list of major constitutional ad-
vances that he would like to see undone.
  Then there are a lot of specific differences, about liberty, about
free speech, where he says that the free-speech clause protects all
ways in which we express ourselves as persons. With respect to
equal protection, with respect to Congress' power to enforce the
Constitution. With respect to the role of the Court as an umpire of
disputes between the legislative and the executive branches.
  There are enormous, specific differences, but the fundamental,
the most general difference is that, in the nominee that the Presi-
dent has sent to this committee now, I see a fundamental, princi-
pled commitment to an evolving constitutional understanding and
not a clear agenda of going back to some narrow concept of specific
original intent, and wiping away a number of very fundamental,
important gains in our understanding of constitutional justice.
                                         349

  Senator METZENBAUM. DO you see a potential leadership role for
Judge Kennedy with respect to the rights of individuals under the
ninth amendment?

  Professor TRIBE. Well, Judge Kennedy was very careful in ex-
pressing his views of the ninth amendment. He described one
theory of it, that it was primarily designed to protect the ability of
the States to confer and create rights beyond those of the Bill of
Rights.

  He, on the other hand, also explained that he thought it was de-
signed to make clear that the specific rights of the Bill of Rights do
not completely exhaust all of those rights that are protected.

  But what was most important, I thought, was his statement in
response to the Chairman's question about Chief Justice Burger's
opinion in the Richmond Newspapers case.

  Chief Justice Burger said it does not matter if the basic right of
the press and the public to attend criminal trials is not spelled out
"in fine print," to use your phrase.

  It is basic to liberty. And Chief Justice Burger pointed to the
ninth amendment as what he called a "savings clause," in order to
bolster that conclusion.

  Judge Kennedy referred to the ninth amendment as a "reserve
clause", but importantly, he said you do not necessarily need it if
you have a broad enough understanding of that spacious word, "lib-
erty," and I do see a possible leadership role in the broader under-
standing of liberty, that Judge Kennedy articulated.

  Senator METZENBAUM. This calls for an opinion only, because it
is easy to speculate.

  But sitting there, as you do, and having been involved in this
issue, and other issues having to do with Supreme Court nominees,
do you have an opinion as to what special contribution, if any, yo
think Judge Kennedy might make to the Supreme Court?

  Professor TRIBE. Senator Metzenbaum, I think he would bring to
the Court a distinctive combination of intellect, openmindedness
and experience.

  He has had experience as a practicing lawyer dealing with ordi-
nary human problems. He has had an experience as a distin-
guished judge.

  He has shown in his writing that he is searching, that he is
searching for an understanding of the Constitution. In that sense
he would differ from those members of the Court who think they
have already found it.

  He would also differ, I think, from those members of the Court
who have a very ad hoc approach to particular problems, who are
not engaged in quite the same intellectual quest for a set of princi-
ples that is faithful to an evolving understanding of the original
intent of the Constitution.

  What was most distinctive about the vision, as he described it,
was that as we develop, and as we build up decisions interpreting
the Constitution, we can perfect an understanding of the principles
implicit in that document.

   It is not as though, by getting further from the founding
moment, we become somehow lost at sea, and that we need to be
returned to a "golden age" of constitutional truth. I think that
                                          350

those perspectives are distinctive, and I would look forward to
seeing the way he developed them on the Court.

   Senator METZENBAUM. I have one last question. In your written
testimony, you criticized Judge Kennedy's decisions in the TOPIC
v. Circle Realty case, the Aranda case, and the AFSCME case.

   What did Judge Kennedy do wrong in those cases? And what
advice, if any, do you have for him when he encounters similar
cases in the future?

   Professor TRIBE. Well, if there are similar cases in the future, I
suppose that that advice would be better presented in the form of
briefs and arguments than in the form of testimony now. But what
I think he may have done wrong differs from case to case.

   In TOPIC, I think he read the relevant statute too narrowly in
not providing access to court of a kind that the Supreme Court
itself was willing later on to recognize.

   In the AFSCME case, I think he was not as sensitive as he
should have been to the factual findings indicating government
complicity in a discriminatory structure.

   And in the Aranda case about which you questioned him, I think
perhaps he should have gone further and made his opinion a dis-
sent. He should have suggested that, on the basis of the evidence
before him, there was enough to at least have a trial with respect
to narrower remedies. But at least he did move separately to sug-
gest possibilities to the litigants. And I think that he is quite capa-
ble of getting along without my suggestions.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  The Senator from Pennsylvania has a couple more questions.
   Senator SPECTER. Mr. Chairman, one comment and one question.
   I am intrigued, Professor Tribe, by your description of institu-
tional intent, picking up on what Judge Kennedy testified to yes-
terday, and your statement that Judge Kennedy had a novel ap-
proach to institutional intent. It may be that realistically we have
read out framers' intent as a doctrine that has to be observed in
judicial interpretation, but sort of mythologically have left it in in
calling it institutional intent. We may have established some sort
of a precedent here.
  The one question which I have for you at this stage involves the
appropriate practice of the Judiciary Committee in looking to judi-
cial philosophy. And I note at the outset of your prepared state-
ment you have quoted Chief Justice Rehnquist's recent speech
which goes back to his approach in 1959, when as a lawyer he took
the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate generally to task
for not probing Judge Whittaker on judicial philosophy on equal
protection of the law and due process.
   I know from your statement you have concluded that it is appro-
priate to ask about judicial philosophy, and my question to you is:
What value do you see from the back-to-back proceedings of Judge
Bork and now Judge Kennedy, with both Judge Bork's detailed re-
sponses on judicial philosophy and Judge Kennedy's equally de-
tailed responses on judicial philosophy on questions which were ad-
dressed to him in establishing a precedent, a solid precedent for the
Judiciary Committee to insist on such answers from future nomi-
nees?
                                         351

  Professor TRIBE. Senator Specter, I think that there is enormous
value, both to constitutional democracy and to public education,
from the role that this committee has played in pressing the nomi-
nees before it to explain in some detail the way they think about
legal and constitutional problems. And I think that both nominees,
both the one who was rejected and the one who is currentty before
the committee, are to be praised for having cooperated in such
detail.

   Whatever one thinks--and I know there are differences between
members of this committee--whatever one thinks of why the
Senate ultimately did what it did with respect to Judge Bork--and
I tend to think that it acted responsibly--whatever one thinks
about that, it is impossible to deny that the spectacle of detailed,
thoughtful questioning--questioning in which you played, obvious-
ly, a very important role, and questioning in which the Chairman
and everyone played, I think, a very important role--the spectacle
of that kind of questioning on national television, during the year
of the Bicentennial, made an incredibly important impact in popu-
lar participation in the processes of constitutional democracy, and
in popular understanding of what the Constitution is about and
what the Court's role is.

   There is no tension at all between that kind of give and take and
the ideal of judicial independence. That is where I most particular-
ly agree with Chief Justice Rehnquist when he said that this kind
of inquiry serves as a way of "reconciling judicial independence
with majority rule." The reason, in part, that we can entrust
judges with life tenure to interpret the Constitution and make deci-
sions of such great moment in our lives is that we do not leave it
just to the President unilaterally to decide, "well, this is my kind
of judge." We now engage--and I think the Senate has sometimes
engaged in the past, but less consistently--in really close inquiry
into what the philosophy is.

   I think the committee is to be commended for it and the nation
is better off for it.

   Senator SPECTER. SO that is a yes answer. We have a little stare
decisis going for us now?

   Professor TRIBE. A long yes answer.
   Senator SPECTER. We have a little stare decisis going for us now
on this issue?
   Professor TRIBE. I think so, Senator.
   Senator SPECTER. Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. Professor, you have made a significant contribu-
tion to the establishment of that stare decisis, and I think your ob-
jectivity has been shown and reinforced. You are here today to tes-
tify on behalf of a nominee with whom you do not agree on every-
thing, and you had the courage to testify in opposition to a nomi-
nee. You make complicated notions very explainable and under-
standable to people, and you have done a great service to the com-
mittee and, I think, to the country.
   I want to thank you for being here, and I hope you are not of-
fended by the fact you have not been kept on the stand for a half a
day like you were last time.
   Professor TRIBE. I am not offended at all. I am quite relieved,
Senator. Thank you.
                                      352

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Our next witness, Erwin Griswold, is one of America's most dis-
tinguished legal scholars. He was for many years the dean and
Langdell Professor at Harvard Law School. He served as Solicitor
General of the United States from 1967 to 1973 for Presidents
Johnson and Nixon, and he has since been in private practice with
the law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue here in Washington.
  Dean Griswold, it is, indeed, an honor to have you back before
the committee and to have your testimony today. Would you please
stand and be sworn?
  Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give will be
the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

   Mr. GRISWOLD. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. Dean, do you have an opening statement you
would like to make?
                                         353

  TESTIMONY OF ERWIN GRISWOLD, FORMER DEAN, HARVARD

             LAW SCHOOL; FORMER SOLICITOR GENERAL

  Mr. GRISWOLD. Yes, I have a few informal remarks.
  My acquaintance with Judge Kennedy began just short of 30
years ago when I was Dean of the Harvard Lav/ School and he
came as a student in the fall of 1958. His mother and my wife had
gone to Stanford together, and his mother wrote to my wife. And
we had him out for Thanksgiving dinner. I mention that only to
indicate that I had some reason for watching him among the many
students that we had.

  He was very successful in his first year and became a n)ember of
the Board of Student Advisers, one of the honor organizations at
the law school. And he was a student in my tax class and was par-
ticularly interested in becoming a tax lawyer. He graduated in
1961 cum laude, which meant that he was well within the top ten
percent of a highly selected class.

  After that, he went to San Francisco where he practiced in a sub-
stantial law office for 3 years, and then came back to his home city
of Sacramento where he had a quite wide-ranging practice includ-
ing resolving problems for people and dealing with the State legis
lature, which, of course, met in Sacramento. So he had a very
broad experience in the operation of the courts and of the Govern-
ment.

  Then in 1975, President Ford appointed hirr to tht Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals, lie was then 38 years old, not as young as Joseph
Storey was when he was appointed to the Supiorae Court at the
ago of 32, which now seems rather miraculous to us. But he was
one of the younger judges.

  I had followed him in his career at a distance. He was out on the
West Coast, and I was on the ^ast Coast. We have never been inti-
mates. I have never been in his home, but 1 he ye seen him from
time to time at Harvard Law School gatherings. Also, in the course
of my practice the last 15 y^ars--which has 1'tvn larger- appel-
late--I have had occasion to see his opinions, and I have read many
of them and have been consistently well impressed by them. Thi?y
seemed to me to be thorough and careful and narrowly written to
deal with the specific issue. He does not write in sweeping terms.
He does not lay down broad general propositions and then deduce
his conclusion from what he has already assumed in stating his
broad major premise. He does not have an agenda. He is not reach-
ing out for goals. He seems to me to follow the true spirit of the
case approach which is the heart of the common law; that is, take
up this case, consider the facts which are applicable to this case,
determine the law which you think applies to those facts, and
decide this case. There are other cases out there, but do not decide
them now. Wait until they come and see what the facts are when
that time comes.

  He interprets and applies the Constitution, including those many
parts of it which are not stated in specific terms, like problems of
federalism, the relations between the federal government and the
States. That is nowhere spelled out in the Constitution. It is simply
implicit in it. It is a federal government. Courts have to determine
where the boundaries lie between federal power and State power.
                                              354

   The Commerce Clause is, in turn, somewhat sweeping. It says
that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce. But it does
not say what happens if Congress does not exercise that power.
There is in that realm a wide range for judicial consideration not
spelled out in specific language in the Constitution as to how far
the States can regulate commerce in what the Supreme Court has
referred to as the silence of Congress.

   Then there are clauses like the Due Process Clause and the
Equal Protection Clause and Cruel and Unusual Punishment,
which I will not say are wide open but which are certainly not spe-
cific and which are subject to evaluation from time to time in the
light of the circumstances which exist at that time.

  There is one aspect of Judge Kennedy's work with which I was
not familiar until he was nominated and some material was fur-
nished me, and that is the speeches which he has given. I have
read them in the past 2 weeks with great interest and with contin-
ued admiration for not only the clarity with which he writes, but
for the views which he has expressed in them.

  One of the speeches which I read recently was one he gave in
1986 to the Canadian Institute for Advanced Legal Studies which
met that summer at Stanford. It just happens that this past
summer, 1987, I was invited to speak to the Canadian Institute for
Advanced Legal Studies, this time in Cambridge, England. As I
read Judge Kennedy's speech, I must say 1 was chagrined. His
speech is very much better than mine and had in it many things
that I wished that I had thought of and had said.

  He spoke particularly in that speech of rights which are not
clearly stated in the Constitution: the right to travel, the right of
privacy, and the right to vote. And by the right to vote, he did not
mean particularly the 13th amendment, which is now quite widely
applied in fact, though it was not when I was a boy growing up and
learning about the law. He was speaking primarily of the decision
in Baker v. Carr, the one-man, one-vote rule which came as some-
thing of a surprised--even occasionally, I guess, a shock--when it
was announced by the Supreme Court, but which is now very
widely accepted.

  In my view, his discussion of these rights in that address is mas-
terful, clear, yet never sweeping, never rigid. He writes well; in one
sense I think much of his writing is brilliant. But not in the gaudy
sense. I do not think he is a phrase-maker. He does not use things
which have been used by some Supreme Court judges and which
are quotable. But brilliant phrase-makers sometimes get carried
away with their own rhetoric, and I see no sign of that.

  It seems to me that all of the evidence shows that he is wise,
careful, thorough, sound. In my opinion, he will be a great Justice
of the Supreme Court, and I am glad to support his confirmation.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Dean.
  Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dean Giiswold, for ap-
pearing here today.
  I just have one question for you, Dean, and that relates to the
process that we are following here. I know you were present when
Professor Tribe testified. I would be interested in your observations
about the propriety of the kind of inquiry which the committee has
                                             355

made into judicial philosophy with Judge Kennedy and also with
Judge Bork. Contrast it, for example, with the very limited re-
sponses given by Justice Scalia during his confirmation process.

  Mr. GRISWOLD. Well, Senator, I think that is a very important
and a very difficult question. As a matter of fact, when I appeared
in support of now Justice Scalia, I referred to the fact that until
Felix Frankfurter was nominated, it had been the practice that the
candidate did not appear before the committee.

  For example, Justice Brandeis' confirmation was strongly op-
posed, an extensive hearing, and he never left Boston. Then Profes-
sor Frankfurter did come. He was questioned rather extensively,
and since that time it has been done more widely.

  Senator SPECTER. DO you recall or know, aptly stated, the circum-
stances surrounding Justice Frankfurter's appearance before the
Judiciary Committee? Did he think he had to appear to get con-
firmed?

  Mr. GRISWOLD. That I could not say. I do know that Dean Ach-
eson was his counsel, and he came with his counsel and had advice,
I assume, from Mr. Acheson. But having known the Professor very
well, I am quite sure he acted on his own determination.

  Senator SPECTER. With the kind of tug and haul we have around
here, it has been my thinking that the nominees answer the ques-
tions they think they really pretty much have to. When Judge
Scalia was before the committee, he answered very little, almost
nothing. Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Rehnquist in his confir-
mation proceedings answered some questions but not too many. I
think in Judge Bork's situation, with his extensive writings and his
extensive opinions, he felt that there had to be responses.

  I think we have carried it forward with Judge Kennedy in some-
what different circumstances, where Judge Kennedy did not ap-
proach the Judiciary Committee with a vast array of writings that
had to be explained, so to speak; and that had he chosen not to
answer so fully, that might have proved to have been acceptable.
But he did answer, I think, virtually every question put to him, ex-
pansively and I think appropriately.

  I would be interested in your conclusion as to how firmly you
think this precedent has been established for future nominations.

  Mr. GRISWOLD. Well, I think, Senator, there is a fine line. Cer-
tainly, the nominee should not be asked how he will decide a spe-
cific case. There should be no effort, even by intimation, to get any-
thing which is or can seem to be a commitment from him with re-
spect to a decision.

  Having said that, I think that has been honored as I have fol-
lowed fairly closely the recent confirmation hearings. Then it
seems to me to be entirely appropriate to interrogate the nominee
with respect to his outlook, his approach, to anything he has done
in his writings which he may want to explain or enlarge or maybe
correct.

  So with careful regard to the limits which I think this committee
has followed, I think this not only is an important part of the con-
firmation process, but I think that it has been an extraordinary
educational event for the American public.

  Indeed, at this meeting with the Canadians I went to last
summer, I found that all of the Canadian lawyers and judges had
                                         356

been watching the previous hearings on television and were filled
with questions and learned a considerable amount about the Amer-
ican Constitution and approach from those hearings.

   Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Dean Griswold.
  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Dean Griswold, thank you very much. Your testi-
mony is always sought and much appreciated when given. It means
a great deal to us. We thank you very much for coming today.
  Mr. GRISWOLD. Thank you, Senator.
  The CHAIRMAN. Before we move on, let me explain what will be
the remainder of today's schedule.
  We will break very shortly for lunch until 2 o'clock. We will
begin, then, with a panel that has announced it wishes to testify
against the confirmation of Judge Kennedy: Ms. Molly Yard, presi-
dent of the National Organization for Women; Joseph Rauh, Jr.,
vice chairman of the Americans for Democratic Action, Inc.; Susan
Deller Ross, professor, Georgetown University Law Center, NOW
Legal Defense and Education Fund; and Jeffrey Levi, executive di-
rector of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
  Then we will move to a panel immediately after that that has
come to testify on behalf of Judge Kennedy: Gordon Schaber, dean
of McGeorge School of Law, University of the Pacific; Leo Levin,
professor, University of Pennsylvania Law School; Paul Bator, pro-
fessor, University of Chicago Law School; Susan Westerberg
Prager, dean, University of California at Los Angeles School of
Law.
  Then we will have our concluding panel for the day, those who
have come to testify, raise questions, but as I understand it, not
take any position--although it is their right between now and then
to take a position if they wish. I am just trying to explain why we
have it in this order: Mr. Martinez, the national president, Hispan-
ic National Bar; Audrey Feinberg, consultant, the Nation Institu-
tion; and Antonia Hernandez, president and general counsel, Mexi-
can American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
  Several witnesses have indicated, depending on the time, who
were scheduled for tomorrow, may decide they wish to testify
today. We will make a judgment as the day goes on whether or net
that is possible.
  The hearing will now recess and resume at 2 o'clock.
  [Whereupon, at 1:10 p.m.; the committee recessed, to reconvene
at 2 p.m., the same day,]

                                      AFTERNOON SESSION

  The CHAIRMAN. I apologize for the delay in getting started again.
We are having a moveable witness list here today, in terms of wit-
nesses who indicated they wanted to testify, or might want to testi-
fy, who are now reconsidering that and deciding they may submit
statements.

  So it only relates to tomorrow's witness list; not to today's.
  Our next panel consists of four witnesses. Molly Yard is the
president of the National Organization for Women. Joseph Rauh is
the vice chairman of Americans for Democratic Action. Susan
Deller Ross is a professor at Georgetown University, and is here
                                             357

today representing NOW, the National Organization for Women,
Legal Defense and Education Fund. And Jeffrey Levi is the execu-
tive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.

  We welcome you all. If you would all please approach the table
and remain standing to be sworn.

  Is the testimony you are about to give the whole truth, nothing
but the truth, so help you, God?

   Ms. YARD. Yes.

   Mr. RAUH. Yes.

  Ms. Ross. Yes.

   Mr. LEVI. Yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. We welcome such a distinguished panel and are
anxious to hear what you have to say.

  We would like very much if you would confine your statements,
each panel member, to a statement of 5 minutes.

  If you have a longer written statement, it will be placed in the
record as if read, and you will not be limited, obviously, in the an-
swers to the questions that are posited to you.

  I suggest we start with you, Ms. Yard, and then go to Mr. Rauh
and on down the line, unless you all have a preferred order.

  Ms. YARD. We have not talked about.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, thanks very much for coming. And Ms.
Yard, would you please begin.

TESTIMONY OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF MOLLY YARD, PRESI-
  DENT, NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN, INC.; PATRICIA
  IRELAND, VICE PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR
  WOMEN, INC.; JOSEPH RAUH, JR., VICE CHAIRMAN, AMERICANS
  FOR DEMOCRATIC ACTION, INC.; SUSAN DELLER ROSS, PRO-
  FESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER, ON BEHALF
  OF THE LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND OF THE NA-
  TIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WOMEN; AND JEFFREY LEVI, EX-
  ECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL GAY AND LESBIAN TASK
  FORCE

  Ms. YARD. Thank you. I have, Senator, a much longer statement
here than I will deal with at this particular point. And we will ap-
preciate your having the whole record in your report.

  The CHAIRMAN. It will be.
  Ms. YARD. We are concerned about Judge Kennedy's appoint-
ment to the U.S. Supreme Court because of his positions on civil
rights cases, and on cases of discrimination against women and em-
ployment.
  I have with me our vice president, Patricia Ireland, who is a
lawyer, who has had a long experience in title VII cases herself.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Ireland is sitting behind you to your right?
  Ms. YARD. Right. And of course Professor Ross also has a long
experience with title VII cases. So for us it is a landmark decision,
a case which has gone against us, which has gone against our long
struggle to improve wages and salaries for women in this country.
  And we find it a very unsatisfactory decision because we believe
that Judge Kennedy totally ignored the findings of fact which are
very clear if read.
  And we see no reason for his having ignored those facts except
that he apparently wanted to come to a certain conclusion and
therefore conveniently ignored the facts, which showed invidious
discrimination, in the words of the district court judge; and which
are clearly spelled out if you read the lower court case, and if you
read AFSCME's appeal for a rehearing en bane, which was never
gone into, because the State of Washington chose to settle out of
court.
  I want to deal with his membership in private, exclusive clubs,
clubs which have not permitted the membership of minorities nor
the membership of women; and I must say that I was somewhat
horrified by his answers given here.
  I think, if you will forgive me, I would like to have a lesson in
what discrimination is. I think everyone in this room understands
what Rosa Parks was doing and what she meant when she refused
finally to move to the back of the bus.
  She was saying, just because I am black, I am not going to be
treated differently, and I am just as good as anyone else in this
country, and I will sit at the front of the bus.
  When a woman is invited to a club which discriminates against
her, but she is invited by a member to go to lunch, and she goes to
the front door, and she is told to go to the back door, the kitchen
door, that is saying, to a woman, just as surely as it was said to
Rosa Parks, you are inferior; you are a second class citizen; and we
will not treat you the same as we treat white males.
                                      359

  It is unacceptable. We refuse to be put in that category. And to
make the matter worse, the men who belong to these clubs, take
their dues as a tax deductible business expense.

  I think it is time we started to understand what discrimination is
all about.

  And our third reason for opposing Judge Kennedy is that we
have no idea what he would do in Roe v. Wade. And I know you
haven't either. And he won't answer it.

  But I do think it is very alarming, his one case on privacy,
where, in Beller v. Middendorf, he seemed to be saying there may
be a right to privacy but that the requirements of the military su-
persede.

  Is he saying that there may be a constitutional right for women
to control their reproductive rights but the requirements of the
State can supersede that?

  All I can say to this judiciary committee is that I can conceive of
very few situations which could be worse for this country than to
overturn Roe v. Wade.

  He is replacing Justice Powell, who was with the majority of the
court on women's privacy rights. Women will not obey the law if
that case is overturned.

  Women will go, if they have got money, abroad to get abortions.
Poor women will have no choice but to seek back alley abortions,
or to self abort themselves. We will again have Saturday night
massacres in the hospitals of this country, where women have des-
perately gone for whatever reasons in their life dictate that they
must take this course, who will come to hospitals, hemorrhaging,
ravaged from fever from infection, and they will either die or their
reproductive lives will be ruined for all time.

  It is an unacceptable position for women to be put in in this
country, and I think it will bring back the underworld. The whole
world of crime was into the business of abortion. It was a totally
intolerable situation.

  And we simply say, Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, and it
must remain the law of the land. We are talking about living
human beings, wives, your wives, your mothers, your sisters, your
daughters, and mine.

  And they should have the right to control their lives; and the
State should have nothing to say about it.

  Thank you.

                         Before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary
                         Against the Nomination of Anthony M. Kennedy
              for Associate Justice to the United States Supreme Court

                                                   December 16, 1987

         I am Molly Yard, President of the National Organization for Woman,
the largest feminist organization in the United States working on
behalf of equality for women. I speak today for NOW and am honored
also to speak on behalf of the National Women's Political Caucus in
opposing confirmation of Anthony M. Kennedy as Associate Justice of the
United States Supreme Court.

         Our concern over Kennedy's court opinions on employment
discrimination, right to privacy, school desegregation, voting rights
and access to courts is heightened by Kennedy's own hiring practices on
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and his long-time memberships in
segregated clubs. While touted as a "moderate conservative," Kennedy's
record reveals a total lack of commitment to equality and justice under
law, a commitment which all Americans have a right to expect from those
who sit on the bench at every level, but especially on the United
States Supreme Court.

         We oppose Kennedy's confirmation because of our serious concern
                                      361

about the Impartiality of his legal reasoning and analysis of statutory
as well as constitutional law. We are also disturbed to find that in
his hostility to enforcement of remedial anti-discrimination laws
passed by Congress, Kennedy has demonstrated a wholly inappropriate
willingness to go beyond the lawful role of an appellate court judge
and to substitute his own version of the facts when the facts found by
the trial court do not fit with Kennedy's desired result.

          Even when clearly established by the evidence and the lower
court's findings of fact, Kennedy has refused to see discrimination as
intentional. Because he also interprets anti-discrimination statutes
as narrowly as possible. Judge Kennedy has used his failure to see
discrimination as intentional for an excuse to deny women and
minorities a legal remedy against discrimination.

          Kennedy's refusal to see discrimination as intentional and his
great willingness to excuse it, is also evident in his attempts to
justify his own long-time memberships in discriminatory clubs. To
avoid the proscription against judges belonging to clubs which
invidiously discriminate, Kennedy tries to create for himself a
loophole by saying that the clubs' segregated membership practices were
not "intended to impose a stigma" based on sex, race, religion or
national origin and were not "the result of ill-will." This novel
redefinition of invidious discrimination would, if carried into his
court rulings, severely restrict the constitutional guarantee of equal
protection under the law.

          I hope, but I wonder whether members of the Judiciary Committee
really understand race and sex discrimination. You are, after all,
                                     362

white males who have never suffered such discrimination. I suppose it
is fair to say many have come to understand race discrimination after
all the civil rights campaigns of the last thirty years and
Congressional legislation as well as court decisions dealing with the
problem of discrimination against minorities. We now all understand, I
believe, that when Rosa Parks finally refused to sit in the back of the
Montgomery bus -- a refusal that reached the far corners of the earth -
- she was refusing any longer to be treated differently from white
citizens simply because she was black.

        When a woman is invited to an all-male club for a meal and is
refused admittance at the front door and told she must go through the
kitchen door, she knows she is being told she is an inferior being, a
second-class citizen unworthy of first-class treatment. Or if her
professional colleagues, who are male, belong to clubs which refuse her
admittance because she is female, she again knows she is being treated
as a second-class citizen by men who seem afraid to compete with her on
their own merits. To add insult to injury she also pays for that
discrimination, because her colleagues take their dues payments as a
legitimate business expense and so claim a tax deduction.

        Just as Rosa Parks refused to be treated as an inferior second-
class citizen, so do all women refuse such treatment. Membership in
clubs refusing membership to minorities and women is racist and sexist.
I for one do not understand how any man who believed in equal treatment
for all could possibly belong to any club which practiced
discrimination. It is a total denial of one's commitment to justice,
because such clubs, whether they are aware of it or not, stigmatize all
                                    363

against whom they discriminate.
         Judge Kennedy says he tried to change the rules. However, his

leaving the Sutter Club over this issue (after enjoying its benefits
for seventeen years) but keeping his membership in the Olympic Club
belies his commitment to any real change. One may, furthermore, argue
that some persons should remain in discriminatory clubs to affect
change. That may well be, but those who sit in judgment in a court of
law deciding on the rights of those petitioning for redress of their
grievances are persons who should never belong to such clubs, for as
the ABA has said, "Membership of a judge in an organization that
practices invidious discrimination may give rise to perceptions,..that
the judge's impartiality is impaired."

                                            EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION

         Because his opinion in AFSCME v. Washington exemplifies many of
our concerns about Judge Kennedy, we will discuss this decision in some
detail.

         In this case, a class of state employees in job categories that
were predominantly female brought a Title VII suit against the state,
alleging sex discrimination in employment. The trial court judge found
"that the State had knowledge of the sex discrimination in employment
before and after the March 24, 1972 Amendment to Title VII; that the
evidence shows the discrimination is pervasive and intentional and is
still being practiced by the State; and that the State is adhering to a
practice of sex discrimination in violation of the terms of Title VII
                                      364

with full knowledge of, and indifference to, its effect ...."
        Despite the findings by the trial judge that the state had paid

discriminatory wages based on sex and had done so intentionally, Judge
Kennedy ruled on appeal that there was no violation of Title VII.
Kennedy premised his decision on his finding that the state had based
its compensation system on the "free market." Kennedy then found
"nothing in the language of Title VII or its legislative history to
indicate Congress intended to abrogate fundamental economic principles
such as the laws of supply ard demand or to prevent employers trom
competing in the labor market." And, although Kennedy admitted that
there is djscrinin.mt.ion in the free market, he held that "Title VII
docs not cLi-i-ate [the State] to eliminate an economic inequality that
it did not. create."

        Thus, tiie linchpin of Kennedy's decision *as his assus^cion that
the state had baaed its wage structure on market rates. Based on this
premise, Kennedy culed that the pay discrimination by the state W3
justified.

        The problan with Kennedy's pr-amise is that the trial judge made no
such finding and it is clearly contrary to the evidence.1 In fact, the
trial court opinion does not aven mention the words "free market." If
anything about the market rate defense can be argued from the trial
court opinion, it is that the trial jur'gs implicitly rejected this

        ""-State officials had testified that, among other subjective
considerations, they attempted to "keep the peace" by maintaining
"internal alignment" and "historical relationships" in the salary
structure. Such efforts to maintain these historical relationships, of
course, have the effect of permanently locking into place pay
discrimination in female-dominated jobs, irrespective of change in the
"free market."
                                      365

defense by concluding that "there is no credible evidence in the record
that would support a finding that the State's practices and procedures
were based on any factor other than sex."

        Kennedy's willingness to assume as true a factual natter at best
not included in the trial court's findings of fact and arguably at
odds with the trial court's findings, flies in the face of the federal
court rules and Supreme Court precedent on the lawful role of an
appellate judge. Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
requires an appellate court judge to take the trial court's findings of
fact as true unless they are "clearly erroneous." The Supreme Court
has emphasized that appellate court judges may not substitute their
judgment for that of the trial court on factual issues, but must accept
the trial court's findings of fact unless they are so clearly erroneous
that no reasonable fact-finder could come to the same conclusion.
Anderson v. Bessemer City. 470 U.S. 64 (1985).

        Under the federal rules and Supreme Court precedent, one of two
courses was properly open to Judge Kennedy. If he believed that the
trial court had not given sufficient consideration to whether the
underpayment of women's jobs by the state reflected prevailing market
rates, he should have remanded the case to the trial judge with
directions to make specific findings on this point. If he believed
that no reasonable fact-finder could have come to the same conclusion
that the trial judge did (that there was no credible evidence that the
state's practices were based on any factor other than sex), he should
have discussed the evidence regarding market rates to demonstrate why
this conclusion was not reasonable or possible. Instead, he took the
                                     366

wholly inappropriate step of substituting his version of the facts for

those of the trial judge.

         In a second significant matter, again ignoring the legal

restrictions on his authority, Kennedy directly overruled the trial

court's findings of fact and held on appeal that the state's wage

discrimination had not been intentional. He admitted that an inference

of intentional discrimination can be drawn from statistical evidence,

such as had been presented in the trial court on behalf of the

plaintiffs. He also conceded that there had been independent
corroborative evidence of discrimination.2 However, Kennedy noted that

none of the individually-named plaintiffs had testified about specific

incidents of discrimination and characterized the other evidence of

discrimination as "isolated events."

         Thus, Kennedy concluded that the evidence of discrimination was

insufficient to establish intent under a disparate treatment analysis,

saying in effect that the evidence which convinced the trial judge did

not convince him, a clearly inappropriate position under Rule 52(a) and
Supreme Court precedent.3

         2This evidence included sex-segregated job classifications, job
advertisements placed under "help wanted - male" and "help wanted -
female" columns through 1973, equal pay violations, subjective
classification decisions based on sex and statements by state officials
and decisionmakers admitting wage discrimination.

         3Kennedy's consideration of the disparate impact analysis under
Title VII was also affected by his inappropriate assumption of a
market-based wage system. Selectively citing cases which supported his
conclusion and ignoring even Ninth Circuit cases going the other way,
he concluded "a compensation system that is responsive to supply and
demand and other market forces is not the type of specific, clearly-
delineated employment policy...that suffices to support a claim under
disparate impact theory." Ultimately the conflict in the Ninth Circuit
was resolved against the position taken by Judge Kennedy. Antonio v.
                                    367

         Kennedy went far beyond his lawful authority to achieve the result
he wanted in AFSCME v. Washington and to promote a political and
economic position with far broader implications than the immediate
case. His reliance on the free-market system as an excuse for wage
discrimination and his refusal to require an employer, even a public
employer, to take any action to correct the discrimination raises a
significant threat not only to pay equity, but also to affirmative
action and other legal remedies against discrimination. His theories
sound a warning not just to women, but also to minority men and all
workers who depend on the law for their protection.

         Judge Kennedy's failure to understand employment discrimination
and the broad remedial purpose of the laws against it, can also be seen
in an earlier Title VTI case, Gerndom v. Continental Airlines. Inc. In
Gerndom. the majority on the Court of Appeals held that female flight
attendants were entitled to a judgment of liability against the airline
for firing or suspending them under a strict weight restriction
program. Despite the fact that the weight requirements applied only to
the all-female "flight hostesses" and not to the all-male "directors of
passenger service," Kennedy joined the minority on the court in a
dissenting opinion accepting as justification for this blatant sex
discrimination the airline's excuse that it needed to offer passengers
service by thin, attractive "girls."

         To accept as a legitimate, non-discriminatory business reason in
response to the plaintiffs' prima facie case of discrimination, the
employer's excuse "that the degree of customer contact with flight

Wards Cove Packing Co.. 810 F.2d 1477 (9th Cir. 1987) fen bane).
                                                                       8
                                     368

hostesses dictated that they maintain a more attractive appearance" is
wholly unacceptable. One can only imagine the outcry which would ensue
if the case had dealt with a job category that was all-Black rather
than all-female and the dissent had accepted the employer's argument
that customer preference dictated the hiring of only light-skinned
Blacks. Yet women can be told that in order to hold a job they must be
thin and, of course, attractive, and a judge holding such a view is
considered a judicial "moderate."

         Kennedy goes out of his way to interpret narrowly both substantive
and procedural law fco rule against plaintiffs in employment
discrimination cases. For example, in White v. Washington Public Power
Supply System. Kennedy reversed and remanded a $160,000 award to a
Native American woman who sued her employer for race and sex
discrimination. In his opinion remanding the case for a new trial
because of the trial court's incorrect allocation of the burden of
proof, Kennedy gratuitously added that Section 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 does
not give any protection against sex discrimination. This narrow
application of Section 1981 is contrary to decisions in other courts.

         A second example is Koucky v. Department of Wavy. In Kouckv.
Judga Kennedy authored the Court of Appeals opinion throwing out the
discrimination claim of a handicapped former Navy man because he had
named as defendant the Department of the Navy instead of the Secretary
of the Navy. Saying that this meant the Secretary of the Navy had not
had timely notice of the suit, Kennedy refused to allow the plaintiff
to amend his pleadings, thus denying the man any opportunity to
litigate his employment discrimination claim.
                                      369

        Our concern with Judge Kennedy's lack of commitment to eliminating
employment discrimination extends to his own employment practices as an
appellate court judge. Since Judge Kennedy's appointment to the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals in 1975 he has had 35 law clerks. None has
been Black; none has been Hispanic; only five have been women. During
a time in which the percentage of women in law school has risen from
19.2% in 1975 to 40.4% in 1986, Kennedy has employed only 14.2% women
law clerks. During the same period as the enrollment of Blacks rose
from 4.5% to 5.9% and Hispanics from .3% to 1.9%, Kennedy hired 0%
Blacks and Hispanics. Non-discriminatory hiring would be expected to
result in the numbers of women, Blacks and Hispanics among Kennedy's
law clerks being roughly proportional to their numbers in law school.
Their grossly disproportionate exclusion creates an inference of
discrimination and again reflects at best a total insensitivity to
equal opportunity in employment, an insensitivity that we submit is
underlined by his membership in clubs which practice discrimination.

                                     SEGREGATED CUJB MEMBERSHIPS
        Our concern over both the perception and the reality of Judge
Kennedy's impartiality in discrimination cases and of his commitment to
equality is intensified by his long-time memberships in clubs that
exclude women and Blacks.
        After twenty-five years' membership, Kennedy finally resigned from
the Olympic Club on October 27, 1987. From 1958 through October 22,
1987, he also belonged to the Del Paso Country Club. In September
1980, after seventeen years' membership in the Sutter Club, Kennedy
resigned. His membership in the Elks continued for fourteen years,

                                                             10
                                    370

through March 1978.
         All of these clubs are segregated by race or sex or both.

Although he now professes to recognize that "real harm can result from
membership exclusion regardless of its purported justification,"
Kennedy enjoyed the benefits of membership in these clubs for many long
years.

         When Kennedy joined the Olympic Club in 1962 it was restricted in
membership to white men only. He remained a member of the club after
the Board unanimously voted in February 1967 to retain its whites-only
policy. Although the whites-only language was dropped the following
year, the Olympic club retains to this day a male-only requirement for
membership under its bylaws and still does not have any Black members.
We have also been advised that the Del Paso Country Club does not have
any Black members.

         Kennedy could not have been unaware of the problems raised by his
discriminatory club memberships. As early as 1978, the American Bar
Association had adopted policy that no ABA functions could be held in
clubs which exclude women or minorities. In 1980, the U.S. Judicial
Conference adopted a principle "that it is inappropriate for a judge to
hold membership in an organization which practices invidious
discrimination." The following year the U.S. Judicial Conference
passed a resolution that the commentary to the Code of Judicial Conduct
be amended to include this principle.

         Although a member of the committee which recommended adoption of
this principle by the Judicial Conference, unbelievably, Judge Kennedy
continued to maintain his memberships in the Olympic and Del Paso Clubs

                                                                     11
                                     371

for more than seven and one half years more.
         In August 1984, the principle that "it is inappropriate for a

judge to hold membership in any organization that practices invidious
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin"
was adopted by the ABA House of Delegates. Still Kennedy maintained
his memberships in the Olympic and Del Paso Country Clubs.

         In September 1986, the California Code of Judicial Conduct was
amended to include the principle adopted by the ABA. In June 1987, the
San Francisco City attorney warned the Olympic club that its membership
policies violated California's civil rights laws. Still, Kennedy
maintained his membership.

         Finally, in August 1987, twenty-five years after joining (and
nearly seven and one-half years after the U.S. Judicial Conference
adopted the principle that it was inappropriate for a judge to belong
to invidiously discriminatory organizations), Kennedy wrote a single
letter to the Olympic Club urging the club to change its male-only
policy. He apparently never took any action to correct the de facto
exclusion of Blacks.

         Kennedy did not resign from the Del Paso Country Club until the
day before Bork was defeated in the Senate, and he did not resign from
the Olympic Club until four days later. The timing of his resignations
from the Olympic and Del Paso Clubs cannot help but raise the
impression of political expediency rather than principle. After
enjoying the business and other benefits of membership in the Olympic

substitute for a genuine commitment to equality.
         His attempts to define away the invidious discrimination of the

Olympic Club against women and Blacks is not only offensive, but also
gives rise to the question whether he would carry this narrow
definition of invidious discrimination over to cases arising under the
equal protection clause of the Constitution.

                                                    RIGHT TO PRIVACY
         Lesbian and Gav Rights: Equally disturbing are the implications
for the constitutional right to privacy found in Kennedy's opinion in
Beller v. Middendorf. In that case, Kennedy approved as constitutional
the Navy's policy of mandatory dismissal of lesbian and gay sailors
with otherwise excellent service records. Although Kennedy conceded
that there may be a constitutional right to privacy for lesbians and
gay men, he overruled the individuals' right in these cases, citing the
special needs of the armed forces.
         However, even in the context of the military, limitations on
individual constitutional rights should be drafted no more broadly than
necessary to meet what Kennedy calls the "military necessities.1* In
light of Kennedy's admission that the Navy's mandatory dismissal rule
was "perhaps broader than necessary to accomplish some of its goals,"
we find it troubling that he saw no need to require the Navy to more
carefully tailor alternative means of achieving its goals. Less
restrictive means were clearly possible, since after the cases before
Judge Kennedy arose, but before he wrote his opinion, the Navy had
adopted narrower regulations permitting at least some flexibility in

                                                                      13
                                      373

dealing with the discharge of homosexuals.
        Although he claimed to be mindful that the rule discharging the

plaintiffs was a harsh one in the individual cases before him, Kennedy
brushed this aside with a reference to the "relative impracticality" of
regulations which would turn more specifically on the facts of each
individual case.

        In an earlier opinion, Singer v. U.S. Civil Service Commission.
Kennedy had signed on to an opinion which allowed a gay activist to be
dismissed from his EEOC job for being, according to the Civil Service
Commission, "an advocate for a socially repugnant concept." The
Supreme Court vacated the decisicn saying that an employee cannot be
summarily discharged without some showing that his or her homosexual
conduct is likely . impair the efficiency of the civil Service. The
Singer reversal might well eyplain Kennedy's toned-down language in
Beller v. Middendorf. However, the result is the same -- mandatory
dismissal, irrespective of the ability to do the job required.

        Abortion and Birth Control: Judge Kennedy has not ruled as a
judge on the constitutional right to privacy in matters of birth
control and abortion. Especially in light of the Supreme Court's 4-4
split decision affirming the appellate court decision in Hartiaan v.
Zbaraz. the importance of Judge Kennedy's support for the
constitutional right to safe, legal abortion and birth control,
including access of minors and poor women to birth control and
abortion, cannot be overstated.

         Senator Jesse Helms has been quoted as saying that in his view
Kennedy would look favorably on any case in which the court's earlier

                                                             14
                                      374

decision legalizing abortion might be overturned. He is quoted as
saying that "I am as certain as I can be without having heard him say
'I shall vote to reverse Roe v. Wade'...."

         In light of his opinion in Beller v. Middendorf. the support of
his confirmation by anti-abortion leader Helms and the now wide
acceptance by right-to-life leaders that he is one of "theirs," we have
serious question whether Kennedy would uphold a woman's right to
privacy in birth control and abortion.

         We do not find any comfort in Judge Kennedy's analysis in his
speech "Unenumerated Rights and the Dictates of Judicial Restraint."

          [W]e must be careful about rhetoric and semantic categories
          in talking about fundamental rights. A helpful distinction
          is whether we are talking about essential rights in a just
         system or essential rights in our own constitutional system.
         Let me propose that the two are not coextensive. One can
         conclude that certain essential, or fundamental, rights
         should exist in any just society. It does not follow that
         each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can
         enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process
         Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere
          in an ideal system. (At p. 13.)

         Would Judge Kennedy, if confronted by Roe v. Wade, find that a
woman's right to choose abortion is one of the "essential rights in our
own constitutional system" or one of the unprotected "essential rights
in a just system"? Would he find that the state has some compelling
interest in preserving a fetus that outweighs a women's constitutional
right to abortion? How broadly would he allow limitations on a woman's
right to choose to be drafted to meet the perceived state need?

         Roe v. Wade remains the law of the land, with former Justice
Powell having voted in the majority to uphold it. To replace Justice
Powell with someone who would vote to reverse Roe v. Wage or erode it

                                                                      15
                                      375

piecemeal over a period of time would be unconscionable.
        The young woman who xs little more than a child herself, the older

woman who has an increased medical risk from pregnancy, the single
mother with two or three children who is already stretched to her
limits physically, financially and emotionally -- these women must have
protection for their right to make responsible decisions about their
own reproductive lives.

        The chaos which would ensue if Roe v. Wade were reversed would
rival that which resulted from Prohibition. We would see massive
breaking of the law, since women would continue to seek abortions when
the circumstances of their lives made it the right decision for them.
Organized crime would again move back in to provide abortions, as they
did before Roe v. Wade when millions of dollars filled their coffers
every year. Rich women would once again fly to other countries for
safe, legal abortions; middle-class women would seek out doctors in
this country willing to disregard the law; and poor or very young women
would once again be driven to back-alley butchers or to the extreme of
self-abortion. Hospitals would again know "Saturday night massacres'*
when women with botched abortions, suffering from high fever due to
infection or hemorrhaging profusely, would come in to save their lives,
sometimes in vain.

        We simply cannot afford to take the risk of having confirmed to
the Supreme Court a justice who does not support the constitutional
right of a woman to birth control and abortion. For women it is a
bottom line question. It is our lives which are at stake.

                                                                      16

                                    ADDITIONAL AREAS OF CONCERN

        Our belief that Judge Kennedy lacks a commitment to equality and
justice is strengthened by Judge Kennedy's earlier opinions on school
desegregation, voting rights and access to courts in fair housing
cases. These cases reflect the same disregard for individual and civil
rights seen in his later employment discrimination cases. They also
reflect the same disturbing pattern, seen later in AFSCME v.
Washington. of disregarding settled judicial principles which establish
fact-finding as the duty of the trial judge.

        School Desegregation: In Soangler v. Pasadena Board of Education,
the Board of Education had requested the District Court to relinquish
its continuing jurisdiction over a school desegregation plan. The
District Court, at the urging of the Justice Department, found that the
Board had been out of compliance with the court-approved desegregation
plan on thirteen occasions and that recently-elected Board members had
expressed their intent to revoke the desegregation plan and thereby to
resegregate the schools. As a result, the trial court decided to
retain continuing jurisdiction over the school district. The Appellate
Court reversed. Judge Kennedy filed a lengthy concurring opinion.
Sweeping aside the District Court findings, he said there was no
evidence of intent to return to a dual system and voted to relinquish
the court's continuing supervisory jurisdiction.

        Voting Rights: In Aranda v. Van Sickle. Kennedy wrote a
concurring opinion finding no illegal dilution of the Hispanic vote in
an at-large election system. He reached this conclusion despite the

                                                             17
                                      377

fact that in the city's entire 65-year history, this election system
had resulted in the election of only three Hispanics to the City
Council in a city which had grown to be 50% Hispanic. Kennedy
concluded that there was no intent to dilute the Hispanic vote by
maintaining the at-Iarge system for elections. Although this
effectively ended constitutional challenges to at-large elections
within the Ninth Circuit, legislative challenges continued, and in 1982
Congress amended Section 7 of the Voting Rights Act to clarify that
electoral practices which have a discriminatory effect are illegal.
irrespective of the intent behind them.

        Access to Courts; In TOPIC v. Circle Realty, Kennedy ruled
against a fair housing organization and three individual home owners
who brought suit against the racial steering practices of various real
estate brokers, Although the trial court had upheld the plaintiffs'
right to bring the suit, Judge Kennedy reversed and directed that the
case be dismissed, stating that the plaintiffs had no standing. This
view was squarely rejected three years later by the Supreme Court in an
opinion written by Justice Powell, the justice Kennady is proposed to
replace.

                                                   CONCIOSION
        On his record in Title VII cases, civil rights cases, his
questionable support of the right to privacy, and its view of Judge
Kennedy's own hiring practices and his life-long memberships in clubs
which practice sexism and racism, we find him totally insensitive to
the long struggle of women and minorities for equality in this country.
Our society has made real progress, much of it through legislation

                                                             IS

passed by Congress, in achieving a more just union. President Reagan
and his Department of Justice have done much to obliterate that
progress. He should not, and he must not, be allowed to place on the
Supreme Court one who would continue that obliteration.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Ms. Yard.
  Mr. RAUH. I, too, have a written statement for the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. The entire statement will be placed in the
record.
  Mr. RAUH. I have a deep respect for the Supreme Court, its role,
its accomplishments.
  I was the last law clerk to Justice Cardozo and the first law clerk
to Justice Frankfurter.
  I have enjoyed arguing for the Bill of Rights in front of the Su-
preme Court.
  I have worked against putting someone on the Court who
oughtn't to be there: Haynsworth, Carswell, Bork and Ginsburg.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Would you pull the mike closer to you?
  The CHAIRMAN. The microphone that works in this room is not
the one with the wire on it; it's the other one.
  Mr. RAUH. Thank you.
  I think I have a somewhat deeper respect, most respectfully,
than this committee has for the Supreme Court.
  I think your performance has not been good. I think you have
put these hearings on too soon, when people were not prepared, at
a time when you cannot concentrate on it, when it is the end of the
term.
  I think you have not found out from the Justice Department
what they know about this man.
  I must say, and please don't--I have so many friends on the com-
mittee; please don't take this amiss--but I think you played patty
cake with Judge Kennedy. I don't think you found out what he
really thinks.
  There is no reason you should not know what this professor of
constitutional law, this judge, said at the time these great cases
like Roe v. Wade came down.
  We are not saying you should ask him what the results will be,
what he will do in any case. But you have a right to know the
views he expressed when those cases came down, and you never
asked him. So he got away with generalizations.
  Now, he talks a good game, but he does not play that game. His
decisions, in Aranda, TOPIC, the Pasadena case, the one that
Molly referred to, the AFSCME case, the Gerdom case, the Beller
case, demonstrate that he will almost always take the side against
rights.
  It is nice to talk about how you are for rights. But it is nicer to
rule for rights when the matter comes before you.
  Now it is not clear what he is going to do. I am not here saying I
know he is going to reverse Roe v. Wade. I do not know he is going
to reverse school prayer. I do not know that. But you do not know
that he is not going to reverse those and other cases.
  On his record, he is more likely to be on the side of reversal, on
the side of the four who presently would upset all these cases.
  The tendencies we know, what we have seen, is that he is lean-
ing the wrong way on the Bill of Rights.
  I have devoted my life to the Bill of Rights and I can truthfully
say that to me what you are doing is playing Russian roulette with
it.
  You are taking a frightening risk.
                                               380

  Now, if you want to say, well, the President has a right to take a
risk with the Bill of Rights--in fact, he is on the other side on most
of these issues--all right, say that.

  But the Senate has a right, if it does not want those cases re-
fought, if it does not want the Court to go against those cases, it
has a right to say "no" to the President.

  You have a right to say to the President of the United States,
"no, we will not take somebody without a proven record in favor
and in support of the Bill of Rights."

  I think that is what you should do. Our difference here is really
a philosophical one. You know this man has no record in support of
the Bill of Rights. Every one of you knows that.

  The question is, are you prepared to say, we have the right to
reject on that ground?

  The Constitutional Convention almost gave the Senate the full
power of judicial appointments. They didn't, so there wouldn't be
log rolling and cronyism and all that.

  But you have equal power. And it ought to be used.
  Thirdly and finally, I thought the testimony of the bar associa-
tion this morning was almost ludicrous. They have not gone into
the Judge's philosophy. Just remember, too, the bar association
found well qualified a fellow named Haynsworth; a fellow named
Carswell; a fellow named Bork; and they probably would have
found for Ginsburg.
  The bar association has never found against a single Supreme
Court nominee. It is an automatic OK.
  They do not speak for the public interest lawyers. They do not
speak for the Mexican lawyers. They do not speak for the black
lawyers. They do not speak for the women lawyers.
  They speak for the corporate lawyers. And that is all they speak
for.
  I must say, there was one wonderful thing the ABA gentleman
said this morning. Mr. Tyler, is another friend of mine, but I
cannot help pointing out that he says that Judge Kennedy acted in
a reasonable fashion--that is a quote--when he resigned from the
segregated clubs.
  He stayed in until about a month ago and that is the real point
here. Senator Hatch made a terrible misstatement. I wish he were
here.
  Senator Hatch said
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU may bring him back.
  Mr. RAUH. I would love to. Let me tell you what he said. I wrote
it down.
  He said that Judge Kennedy's name had not surfaced for the Su-
preme Court nomination when he wrote his letter in August of this
year.
  Judge Kennedy's name was on the list that was brought up here
before Judge Bork was nominated. In other words, when in August
Judge Kennedy resigned from that club, he was already a candi-
date for the Supreme Court.
  The then nominee, Judge Bork, was in real trouble by August. I
think to try to make it look like there was nothing wrong with
Judge Kennedy's action is outrageous.
                                      381
  Molly Yard is more eloquent than I am. She told you what it
means to women to be excluded from these clubs.
  Even worse than that, Judge Kennedy sat by and let Senator
Hatch make that absolutely 180 degrees wrong statement about his
action, and did not correct it. I have a lot of things additional I
would like to say, but I understand the problems of time. I see my
light is on, sir.

                                   BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
                                   ON THE NOMINATION OF ANTHONY KENNEDY

        Mr. Chairman, members of the Committee, I am Joseph L. Rauh, Jr., a
founder, former national chairman, and presently a national vice president of
Americans for Democratic Action, Inc. I have appeared before this Committee
many times on behalf of the ADA. I have also appeared here often on behalf of
the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, of which I am counsel, but I am not
acting in that capacity today.

        On December 12, 1987, the ADA Executive Committee voted to oppose the
confirmation of Anthony Kennedy as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. We
believe Judge Kennedy has not evidenced the devotion to the Bill of Rights that
we deem the prime requisite for a member of the Supreme Court at this time. In
that belief we urge the Committee and the full Senate to reject his nomination.

        ADA and I have the deepest respect for the institution and role of the
Supreme Court. I was Justice Benjamin Cardozo's last law clerk and Justice
Felix Frankfurter's first. I have enjoyed arguing many times before the Court
in support of the Bill of Rights and related subjects. And along with this
view ADA and I have worked hard in opposition to the nominations of Judges
Haynsworth, Carswell, Bork, and Ginsburg, whose records did not appear to
measure up to those standards of the final arbiter of these very rights.

        Most respectfully, Mr. Chairman, I believe I have a greater devotion to
the Supreme Court than has been evidenced by the Committee in the confirmation
process on this nomination. There has been woefully inadequate time (less than
half the time between the Bork nomination and Hearing) for a comprehensive
                                     384

p.2

study of the extensive record of Judge Kennedy -- his opinions, writings and
statements. (It is for this reason that our analysis is less comprehensive than
we would otherwise normally feel comfortable in submitting to the Committee.)
This hearing is being held in the shadow of year-end adjournment when Senators1
minds are quite naturally on last minute legislative problems of great concern
to their constituents. Also, we unsuccessfully sought the opportunity to
testify next month when Judge Kennedy's responses here could have been
adequately digested and analyzed. Finally and most importantly, the Committee
has failed to get from the Justice Department all the information available to
the Department on Judge Kennedy's views on the issues that will likely come
before the Court in the years ahead.

        It is not too late for the Committee to act on this last point even now.
For seven years this Administration has spared no effort to roll back the
advances in civil freedom of the last quarter-century, most importantly to
permit prayer in the schools, to ban abortion, to eliminate affirmative action
and to dilute vital remedies needed for school desegregation. In furtherance
of its roll-back effort, the Administration has sought constitutional
amendments, statutes and court reversals -- largely without success. Now the
Administration seeks, in a last ditch effort, to obtain a majority on the
Supreme Court to accomplish at long last what it has been unable to do up to
the present moment.

        It is inconceivable that the Administration has made this nomination
without knowing from Judge Kennedy, directly or indirectly, or from third
parties, what the Judge's views are on the issues of primary interest to the
Administration. This Committee, the full Senate, the press, and the public have
a right to know what Mr. Meese and his colleagues know. It is up to the
Committee to obtain that information from the Justice Department before it is
too late.

p.3

        I interpret the Senate's action in rejecting the Bork nomination as
expressing the Senate's unwillingness to see the civil rights and civil
liberties advances of recent decades refought at this time. Yet the
confirmation of Judge Kennedy would open the door to just sach a
reconsideration of the past. Even in the short time available since his
nomination, Judge Kennedy's insensibility to the Bill of fights has been
evidenced in at least six cases that have come to public notice. It is our
considered opinjon, given tne record of this nominee that had he been the first
choice, the battle which would have been waged by both the public and within
this Committee would have been 3ust as intense as fcor's.

        A word aboat a number of Judge Kennedy's cases whicn concern us is
appropriate:

                    *ftranflav. Van Sickle, 60ij F. 2d 1267 (197-5). In this case.-
Hxsp&nic plaintifft -hallengsd at-laige elections in San Ffrnando, California.
Although onl\ three Hibpanics out oi the larg"; Hispanic pc ulation n=d ever
been elected to the City Couicil in 61 years, Judge Kennedy's concurring
opinion upholds at-iarge joting. Tne Jjdge even approver- U1^ary judgnetit
against plaintiffs, riding roughshod over plaintiffs' all --} tions of long-
time and widespread discrimination of all kinds agdir.ot p Lr-\ntif f s. No one who
cared about the vctiig rights cf Hispanics could have written that opiiion.

                    * TOPIC v. Circle Realty, 532 F. 26 1273 (1976",. In this case,
plaintiffs, individual homeowners and an organization supporting fair housing,
sued under the Fair Housing law contending they were denied an integrated
environment Dy real estate brokers steering customers along racial lines.
Judge Kennedy, writing for the Court, dismissed the suit on standing grounds
even though plaintiffs had enough of an interest in an integrated neighborhood
                                     386

p.4

to act as testers and to sue on the basis of their testing results. Other
federal courts ruled to the contrary as did the Supreme Court in an opinion
written by Justice Powell, the man to whose seat Judge Kennedy aspires.

                    * Spangler v. Pasadena Board of Education, 611 F. 2d 1239 (1979).
Here the issue was whether the District Court's order concerning school
desegregation should be terminated. The District Court ruled in favor of
retaining jurisdiction. But Judge Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, became a
trier of facts without seeing the witnesses, overruled the District Court and
terminated its supervisory jurisdiction. Contradicting the record, Judge
Kennedy found there had been no showing of recent noncompliance with the
District Court's order and he rejected plaintiffs' contention that school board
members were seeking to return to a dual system; nor did he find it significant
that school board members favored returning to neighborhood schools with its
obvious resegregative effect. Judge Kennedy demonstrated here his
insensitivity to school integration in an area that will require the attention
of the Supreme Court in the years to come.

                    * AFSCME v. State of Washington, 770 F. 2d 1401 (1985). This case
involves a claim that the wages paid by the State of Washington for jobs
predominantly performed by women are sexually discriminatory and thus violate
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The District Court so found. Judge
Kennedy reversed on the ground that the State pays market rates. But there is
no finding by the District Court that the State pays market rates; on the
contrary, the District Court apparently resolved that issue in favor of the
plaintiffs who introduced strong evidence that the State did not set wages on
market rates. Again here, Judge Kennedy reached out for facts or assumptions
to bolster a decision against civil rights -- in this case the rights of women.
                                      387

p.5

This is, at best, insensitivity on an issue to come before the Supreme Court; at
worst, it reflects deep-seated hostility to the ever growing demand for women's
rights and against wage discrimination.

                    * Gerdom v. Continental Airlines, Inc., 692 F. 2d 602 (1982). Here
the airline terminated flight hostesses above a certain weight in the interest
of having only thin, attractive "girls" in passenger service. The weight limit
did not apply to male employees, even "directors of passenger services." The
Court, en bane, found this facially sex-discriminatory, but Judge Kennedy
joined the dissent which held there was no disparate impact because flight
hostesses were all females. What more could one do to show insensitivity to
women's rights?

                    * Beller v. Middendorf, 632 F. 2d 788 (1980). This case involved a
challenge to the Navy's rule requiring termination of homosexuals. Judge
Kennedy upheld the Navy's ban on homosexuals because of military need without
providing any substantial basis for those alleged military needs. The least
that can be said of this opinion is that privacy is low on the Judge's order of
priorities.

        Judge Kennedy's insensitivity to the Bill of Rights evidenced in these and
other cases is compounded by his continued membership over the years in private
clubs which excluded blacks and women. He even continued his membership after
the U.S. Judicial Conference adopted the principle "that it is inappropriate
for a judge in an organization which practices invidious discrimination." The
lame excuse he offered in his response to the questionnaire from this
Committee was that exclusion on race or sex grounds is invidious only where
"intended to impose a stigma" or resulted from "ill-will" only reinforces our
                                     388

belief in the insensitivity of the nominee to the rights of all persons. For
the Committee to ignore this behavior sends a most inappropriate message to the
public and futare nominees. You won't get the job if you quit smoking
marijuana ten years ago but you will if you happen to quit a discriminatory
clufc a month ago.

        The issues before the Supreme Court today differ substantially from those
in the 1930's when I was privileged to be a law clerk for the distinguished
Justices I mentioned earlier. Then the significant questions centered around
the constitutional validity of federal power to cope with the existing and
future depressions, or in short, aroarid the validity of the New Deal. Those
issue? have now been largely rasolved. Today the great issues concern the rights
of individuals and here the record ol Judge Kennedy is too muddy for the Senate
to risk his confirmation to this most important and pivotal position.

        Judge Kennedy, yes and even Judge Bork, might have been acceptable risks
on the Court with a majority clearly devoted to the Bill of Rights. Their
differing views might well have sharpened tne deliberations of such a Court.
But a Supreme Court balanced four to four en the primary rights issues of the
day (only this week the Court ^plit four to four on an abortion issue) requires
a ninth Justice who has evidenced clear devotion to the rights of all.
Especially at a time when our nation is deit^ndinq that other countries respect
human rights, we cannot afford to play Russian Roulette with our own dedication
to the Bill of Fights. A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kennedy is a vote
to take risks with the very fabric ol our society.

        It is for these reasons that ADA has taken this position. We are not so
naive as to think our testimony alone will change the tide of this Committee
or the entire Senate, but, having reviewed the record, we could not sit idly on
                                    389

the sidelines and not come out in opposition. Both on principle and our sense
of values, we urge this Committee to reject the nominee and force the President
to submit the name of one of the thousands of distinguished lawyers who
embrace whole heartedly the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans.

   The CHAIRMAN. We will give you plenty of time to beat up on us,
Joe. You will have all day, if you want it.

   Professor Ross.
  Professor Ross. With some reluctance, we are present today to
oppose the nomination of Judge Kennedy to the Supreme Court.
   We recognize that in certain areas of constitutional and statuto-
ry rights, he has displayed some sensitivity. However, that has not
characterized his approach to sex discrimination issues.
  We fear that if Judge Kennedy's treatment of these issues were
adopted, the court's precedents guaranteeing women's rights would
be seriously undermined.
  The positions Judge Kennedy has taken in a series of sex dis-
crimination and employment cases raise serious questions about
his respect for and adherence to Supreme Court precedent.

  These cases involve situations in which women and men were ex-
clusively and admittedly treated differently because of their sex.

  In such cases, the Supreme Court has held that such sex based
practices are discriminatory on their face, and has gone on to ex-
amine whether there might be a defense to such a policy.

  In contrast, Judge Kennedy does not appear to recognize the ex-
istence of such facial sex discrimination, or its significance.

  This leads him in turn not to find discrimination when the sex
discrimination is clear cut.

  We have related concerns about his interpretation of the mean-
ing of intentional discrimination. Where facially sex based classifi-
cations are used, the Supreme Court has never sought to require
any additional snowing of intent.

  As Justice O'Connor wrote in a 1982 case, because the challenged
policy expressly discriminates among applicants on the basis of
gender, it is subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.

  And as Justice Stevens wrote in a 1978 case, a policy which
treats people differently simply because each of them is a woman,
rather than a man, is in direct conflict with both the language and
the policy of title VII.

  It constitutes discriminations and is unlawful unless exempted
by some affirmative justification.

  In contrast, Judge Kennedy appears to want to apply some
higher, more difficult standard of proving intentional discrimina-
tion based on sex, which would result in overturning most of the
Supreme Court decisions finding sex based practices to violate the
Equal Protection clause.

  Finally, we are also very disturbed at Judge Kennedy's approach
to the doctrine of disparate impact, a doctrine central to the effort
to eradicate sex discrimination.

  He has indicated discomfort with following the Supreme Court
precedent in this area. And in a major wage discrimination case,
he basically refused the apply the doctrine at all.

  My written statement discusses in some detail cases in which
Judge Kennedy has refused to find facially discriminatory practices
directed against women to be discrimination.

  I will briefly summarize the facts of some of those cases.
  A facially discriminatory practice is the most obvious kind of dis-
crimination, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly found that
                                         391

facial discrimination is a per se violation of Section 703(a) of title
VII.

  The earliest example of that kind of Supreme Court decision was
a 1971 case involving an employer that refused to hire mothers of
preschool aged children while hiring fathers of preschool aged chil-
dren.

  Twelve years later, Judge Kennedy was faced with a similar em-
ployment policy. An airline required its flight hostesses to be thin
or lose their jobs.

  Men who also served passengers on the planes did not have to be
thin.

  The weight rule was quite strict. For example, a woman who was
5 feet 2 inches tall could weigh no more than 114 pounds dressed in
a full uniform with her shoes on.

  The airline fired or suspended many of the women for exceeding
the weight limit. They fired not men, because the rule did not
apply to men.

  The court's majority found the airline's policy to be facial dis-
crimination. Judge Kennedy did not.

  Another 1982 case involved a Native American woman who
claimed she suffered sex and race discrimination. She was awarded
$161,000 after a full trial.

  Her strongest evidence consisted of a statement by a supervisor
that she was passed over for a clerical position because he wanted
to hire a male in order to break up the female ghetto.

  What was this but an admission that the supervisor refused to
consider her for the job because she was a woman, not a male?

  It was the strongest possible evidence that the decision was based
on sex. Yet it was not strong enough to convince Judge Kennedy
that she was a victim of sex discrimination.

  He reversed the award and sent her back to the lower court.
  A similar case came before him in 1984. A woman in training to
be a police officer lost her job in the middle of training. After a full
trial, the court ruled she was a victim of sex discrimination and
awarded monetary relief.
  The court found that she performed as well as the male trainees,
yet was graded with lower scores than men whose performance was
no better, and often worse than, hers.
  Listen to the kinds of criticisms that the training officers leveled
at her. One suggested that she was "too much like a woman." An-
other suggested that she try not to look "too much like a lady."
Surely this evidence strongly suggested sex discrimination. Her
performance was acceptable, but she was judged to act like a
woman. The officer seemed to have preferred a man, someone who,
by definition, would never act "too much like a woman." Yet Judge
Kennedy reversed once more. Even the most obvious sex discrimi-
nation did not seem obvious to him.
  Judged by how he applies doctrine to facts, Judge Kennedy is im-
plicitly applying a narrow definition of discrimination, one never
adopted by the Supreme Court. If so, that would explain why even
facial discrimination does not seem like clear-cut discrimination to
him.
   The clearest indication of his thinking is found in his explana-
tion to this committee of why, in his view, clubs with admitted poli-
                                      392

cies of excluding women did not practice invidious discrimination.
He explained that invidious discrimination suggests that the exclu-
sion of particular individuals on the basis of their sex is intended
to impose a stigma on such persons, and that the policy was not
the result of ill will. In other words, the question of whether invidi-
ous discrimination has occurred turns not on the conduct but on
the subjective state of mind of the discriminator.

  Not a single Supreme Court decision on facial sex discrimination
has required women who were attacking facial discrimination to
show that the discriminators acted out of ill will or a desire to stig-
matize women. And if that were the test, women would have lost
most of the cases they had won before the Supreme Court. The
court has accepted that most facially sex discriminatory statutes
have been enacted to serve administrative convenience, to protect
women, or to comply with a set of stereotypical views about the dif-
ferent roles in life that men and women should play.

  I describe many of those cases in my statement. Let me just give
you one example here. In the court's landmark Craig v. Boren deci-
sion in 1976, the court rules that the Oklahoma law barring males
but not females from purchasing beer "invidiously discriminates
against males 18 to 20 years of age." There was no discussion of ill
will or stigma as to the males but, rather, an analysis of whether
the sex-based classification was substantially related to achieving
Oklahoma's traffic safety goals.

  My third point today focuses on Judge Kennedy's refusal to
apply the Supreme Court's disparate impact doctrine in a wage dis-
crimination case. Disparate impact analysis is a very important
doctrine in eliminating both sex and race discrimination and its
more subtle but nevertheless devastating forms. It says that even
when an employer takes apparently neutral action toward all
workers, that action is illegal if it has a harsher impact on blacks
than on whites, or on women than on men, if the employer cannot
justify it with solid business reason. Judge Kennedy appears not to
like the doctrine, having disparaged other judges who follow it in a
speech where he said that "Those judges were gripped by the auto-
matic rule syndrome." With this attitude, it is perhaps not surpris-
ing that he simply refused to apply the doctrine in the AFSCME v.
State of Washington case.

  In sum, Judge Kennedy has repeatedly failed to recognize and
remedy even the simplest and most blatant sex discrimination
cases. His record of enforcing title VII demonstrates that he does
not recognize, despite strong precedent, that explicit sex-based dis-
crimination is necessarily discrimination. He has developed a
result-oriented analysis rejecting disparate impact cases that would
undermine existing law. His judicial philosophy, taken together
with his failure to adequately appreciate the existence of facial dis-
crimination under title VII suggests that he may well undo anti-
discrimination precedent with respect to sex if given the chance by
setting new tests of ill will, malice or stigma--tests that will be im-
possible to meet in the sex discrimination context.

  The questions we raise are so serious in their implications for
how he would enforce the guarantees of equal rights for women
that we urge you to call him back for further questioning. Will he
recognize facial discrimination as discrimination? Will he adopt the
                                         393

court's existing precedents on proof of intentional discrimination?
Will he follow disparate impact doctrine?

  Thank you.

                                             Introduction

        With some reluctance, we are present today to oppose the
nomination of Judge Kennedy to the Supreme Court. We recognize
that in certain areas of constitutional and statutory rights he
has displayed some sensitivity. However, that has not
characterized his approach to sex discrimination issues. We fear
that if Judge Kennedy's treatment of these issues were adopted,
the Court's precedents guaranteeing women's rights under both the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VII
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would be seriously undermined.
In these circumstances, we feel it is our duty--in Justice
Marshall's recent words--to inform this Committee of our analysis
of Judge Kennedy's views on sex discrimination issues.

        We object to the nomination of Judge Kennedy on the ground,
first, that the position he has taken in a series of sex
discrimination in employment cases raise serious questions about
his respect for and adherence to Supreme Court precedent. These
cases involve situations in which women and men were explicitly
and admittedly treated differently because of their sex. In such
cases, the Supreme Court has held that such sex-based policies
are discriminatory on their face and gone on to examine whether
there might be a defense to such a policy. In contrast, Judge
Kennedy does not appear to recognize the existence of such facial
sex discrimination, or its significance. This leads him in turn

         42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. (as amended).
                                                      -1-
                                    396

not to find discrimination where the sex discrimination is
clearcut.

        We have related concerns about his interpretation of the
meaning of "intentional* discrimination in both the Title VII,
statutory context and under Equal Protection principles. Where
facially sex-based classifications are used, the Supreme Court
has never sought to require any additional showing of intent,
either in statutory or constitutionally-based cases. As Justice
O'Connor wrote in Mississippi University for Women v. Hoqan, 458
U.S. 718, 723 (1982), "Because the challenged policy expressly
discriminates arrsong applicants on the basis of gender, it is
subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amerdment," And as Justice Stevens wrote in City_of
Los Angeles, Dept. of Water and Power v. Manhart, 4 3 5 U.S. 702,
711 (1978), a policy which treats people differently

                siirply because each of them is a woman,
               rather than a man, is in direct conflict
               with both the lanquage and the policy of
                [Title VII]. Such a practice does net pass
               tha simple test of whether the evidence
               shows "treatment of a person in a manner
               which but for the parson's sex would be
               different." It constitutes discrimination
               and is unlawful unless exempted by ... some
                ... affirmative justification.

In contrast, Judge Kennedy appears to want to apply some higher,

more difficult standard of proving intentional discrimination

based on sex. Indeed, the test he suggested to this

Committee--looking for stigma or ill-will--in explaining why he

had not resigned from clubs which had facial policies of

excluding women is a test we believe would result in overturning
                                    397

most of the Supreme Court decisions finding sex-based state laws
to violate the Equal Protection Claus;.

        Finally, we are also very disturbed by Judge Kennedy's
approach to the doctrine of disparate impact in sex
discrimination cases brought under Title VII. He has indicated
discomfort with following the Supreme Court precedent on this
doctrine; and in a major wage discrimination case he basically
refused to apply the doctrine at all. Since the disparate impact
doctrine is a concept central to the effort to eradicate sex
discrimination, we are extremely concerned about Judge Kennedy's
approach.

                                                 Statement
                               Part I: Title VII Standards

         Since the Supreme Court decided Phillips v. Martin Marietta
Corp., 400 U.S. 542 (1971), its first Title VII case addressing
an issue of sex discrimination, the law of the land has been
clear that where an employer adopts an employment policy that
applies only to employees of one sex, the policy is discrimina-
tory on its face. In Phillips, the employer had a policy of
refusing to employ women with preschool age children, a policy
which the lower federal courts held did not discriminate on the

intent are discussed in Part I of this testimony; his views on
the Constitutional standards are examined in Part II.

basis of sex. The Supreme Court, unanimously and per curiam,

reversed, explaining: "Section 703(a) of the Civil Rights Act of

1964 requires that persons of like qualifications be given

employment opportunities regardless of their sex. The Court of

Appeals therefore erred in reading this section as permitting one

hiring policy for women and another for men--each having

preschool aged children.5

4 Section 703(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,
42 U.S.C. Sec. :000e - 2(a), provides that:

                It shall be an unlawful employment practice
                for an employer---(1) to fail or refuse to
               hire or to discharge, any individual, or
               otherwise to discriminate against any
                individual with respect to his compensation,
               terms, conditions, or privileges of
               employment, because of such individual's
               race, color, religion, sex, or national
               origin; or

                (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his
               employees or applicants for employment in
               any way which would deprive or tend to
               deprive any individual of employment
               opportunities or otherwise adversely affect
               his status as an employee because of such
                individual's race, color, religion, sex, or
               national origin.

5 Once it is established that the employer has discriminated
on the basis of sex ( 703(a)), the employer is permitted to
argue that the discrimination is justified (703(e)). To do so,
the employer must establish that sex is a "bona fide occupational
qualification* (bfoq) for the job. This exception is a narrow
one and the burden on the employer stringent indeed. See, e.g.,
Western Air Lines, Inc. v. Criswell, 472 U.S. 400 (1985); Dothard
v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321 (1977); Diaz v. Pan American World
Airways,~Inc., 422 F.2d 385 (5th Cir. 1971), cert, denied, 404
U.S. 950 (1971). In Phillips, the issue raised was what
constituted discrimination for the purposes of 703(a), not
whether the defense was established. As we shall show, it is on
this initial question, resolved by the Supreme Court in 1971,
that Judge Kennedy strays.

                                                      -4-

        Phillips v. Martin Marietta is but one prominent example of
a large body of case law sometimes referred to as "facial
discrimination cases.* These are the cases, many of which
appeared in the early years after passage of Title VII, in which
defendants explicitly used applicants' or employees' sex in some
manner to affect employment decision-making. An employer may
have, as in Phillips, applied an employment requirement only to
members of the female sex. An employer may have admitted that he
wanted a man for the job. Evidence may have been adduced that
the employer or its agents explicitly used the employee's sex,
rather than her actual job performance, as the basis for
evaluating her job performance.

        Facial discrimination cases are not difficult to adjudicate.
As Phillips illustrates, the process of evaluating the question
whether disparate treatment--that is, differential treatment
based upon the employee's sex--has occurred, is simple. One
simply asks whether the sexes are treated differently with
respect to a shared characteristic (in Phillips, parenthood).

        Most of the sex discrimination cases under Title VII in
which Judge Kennedy has addressed the question of whether
unlawful discrimination has occurred have presented "facial
discrimination" issues and, in each such case, Judge Kennedy has
undermined the principle that diffeiant treatment of the sexes
should be considered sex discrimination, contrary to the analysis
required by Phillips.

         In Gerdom v. Continential Airlines, 692 F.2d 602 (9th Cir.

                                                      -5-

1982), Judge Kennedy ignored straightforward evidence of explicit
sex-based treatment when he joined a dissenting opinion. At
issue in Gerdom was Continental Airlines' policy that flight
hostesses, all of whom were women, must meet certain weight
requirements while men who also served passengers in-flight
(albeit with different job titles) had no such requirement
imposed on them. The weight policy for female employees
"resulted in a loss of wages and employment only for women
employees and it was never applied to male employees, even those
who worked side by side with plaintiffs serving passengers on
flights." 692 F.2d at 606. In the rehearing en bane in the
Ninth Circuit, the majority held that flight hostesses who were
suspended or terminated under the strict weight restrictions had
been subjected to unlawful sex discrimination. The court then
granted summary judgment to the flight attendants since the
female-only policy was obviously sex-based and thus
discriminatory. The court rejected Continental's attempt to
justify the policy on the basis that it sought to compete with
other airlines by featuring thin, attractive, female cabin
attendants, stating that the justification was discriminatory on
its face. The majority explained its reasoning:

A facial examination of the weight program

here reveals that it is designed to apply

only to females. Where a claim of discrimi-

natory treatment is based upon a policy

which on its face applies less favorably to

one gender, this court has held that the

plaintiff need not otherwise establish the

presence of discriminatory intent. [Citing

Committee, 671 F.2d 330 (9th Cir. 1982)

               that this policy applied to an intentionally
               all-female job classification does not alter
               the analysis.... By Continental's own
               admission, the policy was enforced only
               against women because it was not merely
               slenderness, but slenderness of female
               employees which Continental considered
               critical

               The only justification that has been
               advanced for the weight program is
               Continental's desire to compete by featuring
               attractive cabin attendants. Subsumed in
               its assertion is the view that, to be
               attractive, a female may not exceed a fixed
               weight. Continental has never argued that
               all people, regardless of gender, are
               unattractive if they exceed fixed weight
               criteria. Nor has it suggested that the
               same competitive image would have been
               served by hiring thin males as well as
               females.

               The difficulty with the justification,
               therefore, is that it is not neutral. It is
               discriminatory on its face....

692 F.2d at 608-09. Under Phillips and its progeny, the majority

analysis is clearly correct: a weight limit was placed on women

that was not placed upon men, all of whom attended to passenger

needs on Continental's flights.

        A poorly-reasoned dissent rejected the majority's analysis

that this was obvious facial discrimination; Judge Kennedy joined

that dissent. The dissent argued, inter alia, that the disparate

treatment claim required a trial on the merits since the

airline's alleged justification for its facially discriminatory

policy--that the degree of customer contact with flight hostesses

dictated that they maintain a more attractive personal

appearance--created an issue of fact concerning whether the

weight requirement was based on sex or on customer contact needs.

The record already made it clear, however, that the men had
customer contact but were not subjected to weight requirements;
indeed, as the majority pointed out, the difficulty with the
asserted neutral justification was that it was in fact sex-based,
since Continental had only sought thin women, not thin men.
Thus, the dissent in which Judge Kennedy joined avoided
acknowledging the obvious sex discrimination in this case.

        In White v. Washington Public Power Supply System, 692 F.2d
1256 (9th Cir. 1982), Judge Kennedy again refused to recognize
the existence of obvious sex discrimination. There, Ms. White, a
Native American woman, alleged that her employer had discrimi-
nated against her in initial hiring and in later opportunities
for promotion based on her sex and race. At trial, the
plaintiff's strongest evidence was "a statement by a super-
visorial employer that she was passed over for a clerical
position because he wanted to hire a minority male in order 'to
break up a female ghetto"*--in other words, an admission that she
was barred from consideration for the position because she was a
woman, not a man. Additional evidence showed that women and
minorities were underrepresented in the work force, and that
White was more qualified than the persons hired for the jobs she
sought.

        The trial court found in favor of White and awarded her
$161,000 in compensatory and punitive damages, back pay and
attorneys' fees. On appeal, Judge Kennedy reversed and remanded.
He relied on Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine,

                                                      -8-
                                    403

450 U.S. 248 (1981), which sets forth a prima facie case and
shifting burdens of production of evidence from which courts can
infer whether or not a policy is based on sex when there is no
admission of a sex-based policy. Judge Kennedy reversed on the
basis that the trial court had not assigned the correct burden of
proof to the employer under Burdine. In explaining why he
thought a remand was necessary despite White's strong evidence of
discrimination, Judge Kennedy stated: "While we do not hold that
such evidence is insufficient to support liability, we do not
think White's case so clear that the court's error in allocating
the burden of proof can be disregarded." 692 F.2d at 1289.

        In fact, if there was ever a case where the evidence was
strong enough to avoid remand, this is such a case, with its
overwhelming evidence of sex-based intent in the supervisor's
desire "to break up a female ghetto" by hiring a "male." For
inexplicable reasons, however, Judge Kennedy did not even discuss
the supervisor's admission that he would not hire White because
he wanted a man. Under either the trial court standard or the
Burdine standard, this was clearly sufficient evidence of
sex-based discrimination.

         In Fadhl v. Police Department, 741 F.2d 1163 (9th Cir. 1984)

6 Although the trial judge orally applied the correct
standard, his written opinion did not, and Judge Kennedy felt
compelled to rely on the latter.
7 Judge Kennedy did discuss two other types of evidence about
which there was room for argument, but he failed to discuss the
clear evidence of sex-based discrimination which should have
defeated the remand.

Judge Kennedy again reversed and remanded a Title VII judgment
and damage award of $86,000 to a female probationary police
officer who was terminated in the middle of her field training
program. The defendants' action had seemed clearly based on sex:
one superior criticized plaintiff Fadhl for being "too much like
a woman;" another said that she was "very ladylike at all times
which in future may cause problems," and also suggested that she
try not to look "too much like a lady." Yet a third stated that,
"after work she can become feminine again." 741 F.2d at 1165.
In addition to supervisors' statements of sex bias, there was
evidence that the numerical evaluations given to Ms. Fadhl were
lower than scores given to men whose performance was similar or
worse, and that her scores did not correspond to guidelines that
had been established for numerical evaluation. There was also
evidence that Fadhl was denied certain training that the city
admitted was necessary for success in the program. In short, the
record was replete with evidence of sex-based discrimination
against plaintiff Fadhl. While the Police Department did not
explicitly admit that it wanted a man for the position, the
comments of the three supervisors who were upset that Fadhl acted
"like a woman", along with the other evidence, strongly suggested
that the Department would have preferred a man--someone who, by
definition, would never act "too much like a woman." Nonethe-
less, Judge Kennedy reversed and remanded for further
consideration of the impact on the finding of liability of the
trial court's erroneous finding that Ms. Fadhl was absent from

                                                    -10-
                                     405

her departmental termination hearing. Given the exceptionally

strong evidence of the Department's preference for policemen, it

is extremely difficult to see how Fadhl's possible appearance at

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Q

the hearing could have negated the finding of discrimination.

        Judge Kennedy later discussed this opinion in a speech

before the management lawyers' group, Defense Research and Trial

Lawyers Association. These remarks suggest that evidence of

clear sex-based evaluation of an employee will not be sufficient

for a finding of liability to survive remand in Judge Kennedy's

court. Something in excess of mere discrimination will be

required. Although Judge Kennedy has not openly declared what he

is looking for, his past statements suggest that he may well

require discrimination plus hostility to sustain a finding of

employer liabii^._y. If so, this might explain why he appears

8 Indeed, oi; remand, the district court deleted the erroneous
finding and reinstated its finding of discrimination--which was
then affirmed on the second appeal to the Ninth Circuit by a
panel on which Judge Kennedy was not sitting. Fadhl v. City and
County of San Francisco, 804 F.2d 1097, 1098 (9tn~ Cir. 1986).

9 He stated "There was ample evidence from which the district
court could, and did, find discriminatory, if not hostile,
attitudes toward her candidacy.* See n. 10, infra.

10 That Judge Kennedy remanded both Fadhl and White despite his
acknowledgement of the "ample," even "overwhelming" fin White)
evidence of discrimination, strongly suggests that, either
explicitly or implicitly, he requires proof of something more in
order for the plaintiff to obtain relief. What precisely that
"something more" is, is suggested by a variety of comments he has
made in several different contexts. Taken together, these
comments imply that Judge Kennedy believes, contrary to
well-established precedent, that a plaintiff must produce some
evidence that the defendant was motivated by hostility, in order
for the discrimination to be actionable. As noted above, with
respect to Fadhl, he stated, "There was ample evidence from which

                                       (Footnote continued)

to ignore facial discrimination in a number of cases. In his
speech, he also suggested that assessment of the amount of

damages would be "a specific, measurable, substance, i.e. money,
to demonstrate the merits of a particular position." Id. at 8.

But, the amount awarded is not the measure of practical liability

in Title VII. Unlike the garden variety tort case, the amount is
not reflective of the trier's sense of outrage, since back pay

and attorneys' fees are the only form of monetary liability that

may be awarded. Moreover, to use monies as a measure of merit in
a Title VII case would undermine the entire body of law which

emphasizes the importance of non-monetary relief--in the form of
declaratory and injunctive relief--in combatting discrimination.
Further, this standard (assessing the merits of a case by the

amount of money at stake) would undermine the Supreme Court's
landmark sexual harassment decision, Meritor Savings Bank v.

Vinson, 477 U.S.  , 106 S.Ct. 2399 (1986), because the

Supreme Court decided that the plaintiff (Vinson) had a valid

10(continued)
the district court could, and did, find discriminatory, if not
hostile, attitudes toward her candidacy." Kennedy Speech to
Defense Research and Trial Lawyers Association at p.8. Yet, he
remanded for further findings on whether the holding of liability
was justified. When asked whether any of the clubs to which he
has belonged practiced invidious discrimination, he responded
that "[a]s far as [he] is aware, none of [the clubs'] policies or
practices were the result of ill-will." Questionnaire at p.50.
Finally, in AFSCME v. State of Washington, 770 F.2d 1401, 1407
(9th Cir. 1985), he wrote that, "The requirement of intent is
linked at least in part to culpability." The content of Judge
Kennedy's concept of "culpability" or "ill-will" and the degree
to which be believes it is an essential element of a sex
discrimination case, are questions that must be explored.

                                                    -12-

Title VII claim for the maintenance of a discriminatory work
environment even if she could show no "economic harm," in the
sense of lost wages or benefits.

        The theme of ignoring facial sex discrimination can be seen
once again in Judge Kennedy's opinion in AFSCME v. State of
Washington, 770 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir. 1985). Plaintiffs charged
that the State of Washington discriminated in compensation based
on sex Zf paying predominantly female jobs about 20% less than
predominantly male jobs where employees in both the male and
female jobs had the same knowledge and skills, mental demands,
accountability, and working conditions. In addition to
documenting the pay disparity between men and women and the
equivalence of their jobs, the plaintiffs put on evidence that
the State of Washington had practiced facial sex discrimination
for many years by barring women from some jobs and men from
others, and advertising for jobs on that basis. Plaintiffs also
presented expert witnesses who testified that facial sex
segregation of this sort has a causal relationship with sex-based
wage discrimination and often persists after the sex segregation
has been discontinued. Judge Kennedy completely discounted the
evidence of facial sex discrimination and its impact on wages,
ruling that the official policy of sex-based job assignments did
not "justify an inference of discriminatory motive by the State

11 The claimed harassment in that case involved a concerted
pattern of sexual harassment including brutal sexual attacks upon
Ms. Vinson by a Vice President of the Bank, her supervisor.

                                                    -13-

in the setting of salaries* because individual plaintiffs had not
testified, and because, in his view, the segregation consisted of
"isolated incidents."

         In contrast, the Supreme Court has taken quite a different
view of the conclusions to be drawn from evidence concerning
other acts of discrimination by an employer in examining the
acts alleged to be discriminatory in a pending lawsuit against
the same employer. In McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.
792, 805 (1973) the Court ruled that "statistics as to [the
company's] employment policy and practice may be helpful to a
determination of whether [the company's] refusal to rehire [the
plaintiff] in this case conformed to a general pattern of
discrimination against blacks." In other words, evidence that an
employer practiced one form of race or sex-based discrimination
can lead to the conclusion that the same employer was likewise
motivated by race or sex in making another different employment
decision. This has obvious relevance to the AFSCME case; if the
state discriminated on the basis of sex in hiring and job
assignments, that could well support the conclusion that it also
discriminated on the basis of sex in setting wages.

        Judge Kennedy's opinion in AFSCME is also troubling in two
other respects--his interpretation of what is intentional
discrimination, and his negative result-oriented examination of
disparate impact analysis. The standard Judge Kennedy used in

12 The trial court made no factual finding that the sex
segregation was isolated.

                                                    -14-
                                     409

AFSCME to analyze whether intentional discrimination was proven
was not drawn from Title VII precedent, but rather from case law
analyzing equal protection cases, where a heavier burden of proof
is placed on plaintiffs. See, e.g., Personnal Administrator of
Massachusetts v. Fpeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979). Moreover, the
standard he used was not appropriate for facially sex-based cases
but was drawn from the one used for analyzing neutral policies;
in such cases plaintiffs must meet a higher burden to show that
the employer's policy was actually based on sex despite its
neutral appearance. In AFSCME, Judge Kennedy quoted this higher
standard as the appropriate Title VII standard without
acknowledging that there is more than one standard. Thus, he
ruled that "the plaintiff must show the employer chose the
particular policy because of its effect on members of a protected
class." Id., at 14 05, quoting Personnel Administrator of
Massachusetts v. Teeney, 442 U,S. at 279, and that, "discrimi-
natory intent implies selection of a particular course oi action
at least in part 'because-' of not. nterely 'in ^pLtt oi', its
adverse effects upon an identifiable grjup." Id, Judge Kennedy
gave a passing nod to the less onerous Title VII standard dravr
from thra Supreme Court's opinion in International Brotherhood of
Teamsters v. United States, 431 U S . 325, 33b n.15 (1977)
 ("plaintiff must allege the employer 'treats som<3 people less
favorably than others because of their race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin'"). However, his discussion of intent
elsewhere in the opinion makes clear that he demands adherence to

                                                    -15-
                                   410

a higher and more difficult standard than Teamsters requires.
Thus, while he acknowledges that the Supreme Court allows an
inference of intent to be drawn from statistical evidence, he
also implies that the Court demands independent corroboration in
addition to the statistics. In fact, the holding in Teamsters
specifically allowed a prima facie case of intentional
discrimination to be established based on statistics alone. Seen
in this light, his AFSCME holding is doubly troubling--for it
first erects a new and difficult standard requiring statistics to
be corroborated by other evidence of discrimination, while
concurrently dismissing highly probative evidence of
long-standing facial sex discrimination as such corroboration.

        With regard to disparate impact, Judge Kennedy's AFSCME
opinion entirely rules out the possibility of disparate impact
analysis applying to wage discrimination cases in any way. He
argues that the two leading Supreme Court cases on disparate
impact (Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), a race
case, and Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321 (1977), a sex

13 The rule of law in disparate impact cases under Title VII is
that, where a plaintiff can show that a neutral employment policy
or practice has a disparate impact on members of one protected
group (women or racial minorities, for example), such proof is
sufficient to prove unlawful discrimination unless the employer
can meet the burden of proving that the policy or practice in
question serves a genuine business necessity. See Dothard v.
Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321 (1977)(minimum height and weight
requirement has disparate impact on women and is not justified by
business necessity); Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424
(1971)(education and testing requirements having disparate impact
on minorities insufficiently related to employer's job needs for
manual labor jobs).

                                                    -16-

case) require that disparate impact analysis be "confined to
cases that challenge a specific, clearly delineated employment
practice applied at a single point in the job selection process."
Id. at 1405. But no such limitation can be found in these
cases.14 Indeed, the employment tests that were at issue in the
landmark. Griggs decision shared many of the characteristics of
the wage-setting system in AFSCME that led Judge Kennedy to
conclude that disparate impact analysis was inappropriate. Both
the test and grading scale used for assessing candidates at Dukes
Power Company and the final wage under the wage system
implemented for Washington State employees involved "the
assessment of a number of complex factors, not easily
ascertainable" and were the result of complex deliberations on
the part of each employer. Both the test and the wage system
arrived at one quantifiable number (a grade or a wage), the
impact of which on protected classes could be readily assessed
using statistical measures. In short, Judge Kennedy analyzed the
disparate impact doctrine in such a manner as to preclude its use
in wage discrimination cases. Such a negative result-oriented
analysis finds support neither in Supreme Court precedent nor in
logic. But an explanation for Kennedy's position may be found in
a speech he made to the Defense Research and Trial Lawyers

14 Judge Kennedy's views in this regard also relied on Circuit
Court cases which held that disparate impact analysis may not be
applied to subjective employment practices. This view was
recently rejected by the Ninth Circuit en bane in Atonio v. Wards
Cove Packing Co., Inc., 810 F.2d 1477 (9th Cir. 1987).

Association, when he suggested *[t]he rule, for instance, that a

prima facie case of disparate impact is established by a

comprehensive statistical case might be seized upon by a judge

gripped by the automatic rule syndrome as an automatic,

conclusive, simple way to resolve the case.* These seem to be

the remarks of someone who is less than comfortable with the

doctrine.

        That his ruling on disparate impact was a result-oriented

decision not based on precedent is also suggested by the way his

decision supports the conservative consensus that sex-based wage

differentials attributable in part to sex discriminatory market

forces should not be actionable under Title VII. Again, however,

Supreme Court precedent suggests otherwise. In Corning Glass

Works v. Brennan, 417 U.S. 188, 205 (1974), the Court ruled on a

15 In addition to the Title VII cases discussed above, Judge
Kennedy joined, but did not write, four other Ninth Circuit
decisions involving claims of sex discrimination under Title VII
in which the lower court rendered summary judgment against the
plaintiff. In none of these cases did he join a decision finding
sex discrimination. In two of these cases, the court of appeals
affirmed the summary judgment against the plaintiff. See LaBorde
v. Regents of the University of California, 686 F.2d 715,
rehearing and rehearing en bane denied, 686 F.2d 719 (9th Cir.
1982); Fountain v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 555 F.2d 753 (9th Cir.
1977). In the two other cases, the Court of Appeals affirmed the
summary judgment in part but found that genuine issues of
material fact remained that, under Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure 56, required trial on the merits with respect to
certain issues. See Nolan v. Cleland, 686 F.2d 806 (9th Cir.
1982)(affirming dismissal of Equal Pay claim; reversing summary
judgment on Title VII claim because issues of material fact
remain); Abramson v. University of Hawaii, 594 F.2d 202 (9th Cir.
1979)(reversing summary judgment concerning claims of sex
discrimination and retaliation under Title VII because genuine
issues of material fact remain; affirming summary judgment on
Equal Pay claim).

sex-based pay disparity that "arose simply because men would not
work at the low rates paid women inspectors." "[The disparity]
reflected a job market in which Corning could pay women less than
men for the same work. That the company took advantage of such a
situation may be understandable as a matter of economics, but its
differential nevertheless became illegal once Congress enacted
into law the principle of equal pay for equal work."

                          Part II: Equal Protection Doctrine

        Judge Kennedy has decided only two Equal Protection Clause
cases involving sex discrimination and the analysis of the sex
discrimination issues in them was cursory, at best. However,
Judge Kennedy's performance in the Title VII cases involving
facial discrimination and his judicial philosophy generally raise
serious questions about whether he would apply existing equal
protection doctrine to facial sex discrimination. In particular,
we question whether he would require a new test for finding
sex-based classifications unconstitutional--a test requiring that
a plaintiff show the government was motivated by ill-will or
hostility or a desire to impose a stigma upon one sex in adopting
a sex-based classification.

         Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court has
considered essentially twc kinds of cases--cases involving an
explicitly sex-based government policy and cases involving a
purportedly neutral governmental practice that has harmful

                                                    -19-
                                    414

effects on a protected class. In the early 1970's, the Supreme

Court adopted a heightened standard for judging the

constitutionality of a governmental policy involving explicit

sex-based treatment, although it did not settle on the final form

of that heightened scrutiny until 1976. See, e^g., Frontiero v.

Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973) (plurality applies strict

scrutiny)17; Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971)(applying a

16 In the case of a purportedly neutral practice having a
harmful effect upon members of one class, the Supreme Court has
required that a plaintiff show that the group-based effect was
intended in the use of the purportedly neutral practice or
procedure. See Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v.
Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229
(1976). This requirement of proof of intent in the equal
protection cases where there is a challenge to a neutral rule or
practice seems to have led Judge Kennedy to require special proof
of "intent* in the form of ill-will even in cases involving
explicit sex-based classifications. (Judge Kennedy applies such
a standard in his discussion of the ABA standard of judicial
conduct concerning membership in exclusionary clubs. See pp.
26-30 below. See also our discussion above of his imposition of
this intent requirement governing neutral rules into a Title VII
disparate treatment context--i.e, the AFSCME case.) But Judge
Kennedy misconstrues the intent standards of Feeney. The
"intent" required is not special hostility, but rather a showing
that the conduct or policy in question was adopted with an intent
to effect an unfavorable result based upon an individual's group
membership, i.e., sex or race. With explicit sex-based
classification, that intent is obvious.

17 In Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 (1973) the Supreme
Court invalidated a statute which automatically allowed certain
fringe benefits to dependents of male members of the uniformed
services, but required dependents of similarly situated service
women to prove the status of their dependents, thus denying some
women such benefits for their families. In so doing, the Court
was deeply influenced by the historical reality that traditional
"romantic paternalism" had served as a rationalization for
relegating women to an inferior status. The Court held that the
classification itself constituted unconstitutional discrimination
in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,
rejecting the government's rationale that the classification was
justified and motivated by administrative convenience concerns.

heightened rationality test to strike down sex-based statute).

In 1976, the Court settled on an intermediate standard of review

for sex-based classifications, in the case of Craig v. Boren, 429

U.S. 190 (1976). The Craig standard applies to a governmental

law, regulation, rule or practice in which sex is explicitly used

as a basis for classification. It provides that:
                [to] withstand constitutional challenge,...
               classifications by gender must serve impor-
               tant governmental objectives and must be
               substantially related to the achievement of
               those objectives. 429 U.S. at 197.

        Under this test, the Supreme Court found that the Oklahoma

statute at issue in Craig--making it unlawful for males, but not

females, under the age of 21 to purchase 3.2% beer--"invidiously

discriminates against males 18-20 years of age." Id. at 204. As

in the prior cases, there was no discussion of ill-will or

hostility directed toward males, but rather simply an analysis of

whether the ban on boys purchasing beer was necessary in order

for Oklahoma to achieve its traffic safety goals. Under the

Craig analysis and the results in Reed and Frontiero, the Supreme

18 In Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71 (1971), the Supreme Court
struck down a provision of a probate statute which required the
automatic appointment of a male of a decedent's estate over a
similarly situated female. That statute had not been enacted
specifically in order to disadvantage women, but rather it
reflected the policy that men had more business experience than
women, and it was therefore rational to prefer men over women in
designating the administrators of estates. The specific
justification for preferring men was to save the courts time by
automatic appointment of persons more likely to have business
experience. The Court did not discuss intent in the holding,
because the statute, on its face, created an impermissible
sex-based classification subject to scrutiny under the Fourteenth
Amendment

Court has consistently struck down other laws explicitly using

                                               19

sex as a classification.
        For example, in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636,

(1975), a challenge to a federal statute allowing social security
survivors' benefits only to women with minor children, the
Supreme Court held that the statute was invidiously
discriminatory on its face in violation of the Fifth Amendment
guarantee of equal protection. Recognizing that the true purpose
of this provision was to protect families by enabling widows to
remain home and care for their children, id. at 644, the Court
found that the "gender-based generalization" nevertheless
operated to denigrate the efforts of wage-earning women and
offended the Constitution. Id. at 645. There was no ill-will
toward women intended in the statutory scheme, however; indeed,
the government argued the statute was designed to help widows.
In Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7 (1975), the Court invalidated a
state statute which set a greater age of majority for male
dependents than for female dependants for purposes of terminating
child support payments. The Court had no trouble concluding that
Reed was controlling and that the arbitrary distinction denied
women (the female children receiving child support) equal
protection of the laws. Id. at 17. The presence or absence of

19 The exceptions to this pattern occur where the Court has
refused to strike down a statute because it was convinced that
the use of gender classifications was adopted to redress "'our
society's longstanding disparate treatment of women.'" See,
Califano v. Webster, 430 U.S. 317 (1977); Kahn v. Shevin, 416
U.S. 351 (1974).

                                                    -22-

malice on the part of the Utah legislature was not of concern to
the Court, since the classification was, on its face, irrational
and discriminatory. Among the "old notions" on which the
distinction was based was the idea that a boy's education must be
ensured, while a girl was destined to marry and remain at home.
Id. at 15. This was not a reflection of ill-will or malice, but
just a remnant of the view that men and women shoui-i have
different roles in society. In Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S.
139 (1977) , the Court struck down a gender-based classification
which provided that survivor's benefits would be payab]e to a
widower only upon showing that he "was receiving at least
one-naif of his support" from his deceased wife. A widow was not
required, under the st.atuta, to make such a showing. The Court
held that Weinberger and Front\ero were controlling on the
question cf whether this distinction constituted an equal
protection violation under tha Fifrh Amendment Dun Process
Clause. Far from finding that Congress was motivated by a desire
to harm women when It struck down the statute, the Court held
that its intention was to "aid the dependent sp&uses of decreased
wage earners, coupled with a presumption that wive-i ire usual?y
dependent.* Id. at 217-

         In these and other cases addressing sex-bas^d classifica-
tions in the law, the Supreme Court carefully analyzed the
statutory purpose behind the sex-based classification, its
importance, and whether the different treatm"=;:t of rer; and women
was really necessary in order to achieve the government's stated

                                                    -23-
                                    418

purpose. In none of these cases did the court consider whether
the government had been motivated by ill-will or hostility toward
men or women, or whether it intended to stigmatize one group.
Rather, the question was whether the governmental purpose was
sufficiently important, and the sex-based classification really
necessary to achieve this purpose. If not, the statute violated
equal protection principles.

        By contrast, in approximately the same time period as these
cases, in United States v. Reiser, 532 F.2d 673 (9th Cir. 1976),
Judge Kennedy joined a three paragraph per curiam decision
upholding male-only registration for the draft. Without
explanation or analysis, the opinion merely stated in the most
conclusory terms that there was "a clear rational relationship
between the government's legitimate interests, as expressed in
the Act, and the classification by sex." 532 F.2d at 673.
Whatever the appropriate outcome may have been, see Rostker v.
Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981), the treatment of the equal
protection question is troubling. The opinion used the lowest
standard of review despite the fact that it came five years after
the Supreme Court first applied heightened review in Reed v.
Reed. Moreover, it in no way grappled with the nature of the
governmental interest or the necessity for the sex-based
classification.'20

20 Kennedy's other sex-based classification equal protection
decision similarly exhibits a lack of the kind of analysis the
Supreme Court undertakes in equal protection cases. The case was
United States v. Smith, 574 F.2d 988 (9th Cir. 1978), cert.

        Judge Kennedy's refusal to recognize facial discrimination

in Title VII cases casts doubt upon his willingness or ability to

recognize the circumstances in which the Craig analysis (or for

that matter Reed or Frontiero) should apply. More importantly,

Judge Kennedy's apparent lack of concern for enforcing the clear

dictates of Title VII raises questions about the position that he

will take with respect to equal protection of the sexes under the

Constitution. In his comments to the Ninth Circuit Judicial

Conference on August 21, 1987, Judge Kennedy provided insight

into his judicial philosophy on Constitutional analysis. He

stated that he believed in the doctrine of "original intent," and

20(continued)
denied, 439 U.S. 852 (1979), in which a statute resulting in
harsher penalties for forcible sodomy of a man than for forcible
rape of a women (presumably vaginal rape) was upheld against an
equal protection challenge by the man convicted of sodomy. While
the opinion started by quoting the Craig intermediate review
standard, it ended by merely saying the two crimes were
rationally distinguishable, without explaining what the govern-
mental interest was in punishing sodomy more harshly than rape or
why it was necessary to use a sex-based classification to achieve
that purpose. Thus, Judge Kennedy's opinion stated:

               The physical abuses against the victim's anatomy
                committed in this case were acts distinct in kind
                from the act of rape as .. defined by common
                law. It is rational to determine that the harm,
               both physical and mental, suffered by victims of
                these two crimes are of a different quality, in
                each instance. These distinctions are reflected
                in traditions and community attitudes that have
                prevailed for centuries, and penal laws may
                properly take account of such differences by
                assigning a separate generic classification to
                each offense.

574 F.2d at 991. This analysis is merely the old rational review
analysis, which results in automatically upholding a statute.

that this doctrine is "responsive* to some of his concerns "when
you have spacious phrases like are contained in the Fourteenth
Amendment [and] the answer in the text clearly is not there."
Id. at p. 5, Judge Kennedy has also stated his belief that the
Constitution is not the "panacea for every social ill", Speech to
Sacramento Chapter of the Rotary Club, February, 1984, p.7, and
that such ills should b% rectified in the political arena. This
philosophy raises substantial questions whether Judge Kennedy, as
a sitting Supreme Court Justice, while giving lip service to the
idea that the Constitution guarantees equal protection to women,
will not apply the standard as rigorously as it has been applied
by the existing Court.

        Judge Kennedy's membership in discriminatory organizations,
and his recent attempts to justify those actions, further reflect
his misunderstanding of the basic concepts of discrimination and
equal protection law. Over the past twenty-five years Judge
Kennedy has belonged to clubs that specifically have excluded
women as well as, in some cases, minorities. Most of those clubs
have not only practiced this discrimination but have also
incorporated thsir discriminatory policies directly into their
by-laws. In other words, the policies of those clubs on their
face discriminated against women and minorities.

        Because these organizations had, or continue to have,
policies which discriminate on their face,21 there is no need for

21 Judge Kennedy was appointed to the 9th Circuit in March,
1975. At that time he belonged to the Olympic and Sutter Clubs,

                                       (Footnote continued)
                                                    -26-
                                    421

further inquiry as to whether or not the organizations were or

are discriminatory. Certainly were the equal protection doctrine

or the prohibitions of Title VII to apply to such clubs the

answer would be clear that they had engaged in unlawful

discrimination.

        But in answer to questions posed to him by this Committee in

21(continued)
both of which excluded women (See Judge Kennedy's Response to
Senate Judiciary Committee Questionnaire, 47-48) and the Del Paso
Country Club, which had no formal policy of exclusion but had no
black and almost no female members. In March, 1980, the U.S.
Judicial Conference adopted the principle "that it is
inappropriate for a judge to hold membership in an organization
which practices invidious discrimination." In September, 1980,
Kennedy resigned from the Sutter Club. Id. at 45.

        However, despite the August 1984 adoption by the ABA House
of Delegates of a Commentary to Canon 2, ABA Code of Judicial
Conduct, echoing the 1980 Judicial Conference principle, id. 49,
and the September 1986 amendment of Canon 2, California Cod"e of
Judicial Conduct to state that same principle, Judge Kennedy
continued his memberships with the Olympic and Del Paso Country
Clubs until October 1987. He resigned from the Del Paso Country
Club the day before Judge Bork's nomination to the Court was
rejected by the Senate; he resigned from the Olympic Club three
days after that defeat and two days before the nomination of
Judge Ginsburg. l[d. at 45-46.

22 Of course, equal protection doctrine applies only to
governmental action and Title VII applies only to "employers" as
defined by that statute. Challenges to clubs' exclusionary
membership policies have been made under state and local
antidiscrimination statutes--public accommodations or human
rights laws--which usually adopt an analysis similar to that
under Title VII. In litigation pursuant to state and local human
rights or public accommodations laws concerning clubs having
exclusionary policies, the question has not typically been
whether such exclusion is "discrimination" but rather whether the
club is properly covered by the antidiscrimination statute and,
if so, whether the statute's coverage of the club is an
unconstitutional infringement upon the freedom of association.
See, e.g., Rotary Int'l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. ,
107 S.Ct. , 95 L.Ed 2d 474 (1987); Roberts v. United States
Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609 (1984).

this nomination process, Judge Kennedy constructs a new and
additional standard for invidious discrimination to explain why
these exclusionary policies are not discriminatory. He thereby
attempts to excuse his membership in these organizations. In his
response to this Committee's questionnaire, Judge Kennedy defines
invidious discrimination as follows:

                "Invidious discrimination" suggests that the
               exclusion of particular individuals on the
               basis of their sex, race, religion or national
                origin is intended to impose a stigma on such
               persons.
Response of Judge Kennedy to Senate Judiciary Committee
Questionnaire, p.50. In justifying why various club policies
were not "invidious discrimination," Judge Kennedy also says they
were not the result of "ill-will." Id.
         If this definition of "invidious discrimination" were in
fact the law, there would be virtually no actionable sex
discrimination cases. Indeed, all of the equal protection cases
discussed above would have been decided differently, since none
of them were motivated by ill-will or an intent to stigmatize one
sex. See Reed v. Reed; Frontiero v. Richardson; Weinberger v.
Weisenfeld; Stanton v. Stanton; Califano v. Goldfarb. Most
facially sex discriminatory statutes and policies have
historically been enacted to "protect" women and have been rooted
in sterotypical notions of taking care of the weaker sex rather
than motivated by malice. With "ill-will" as the standard for
liability, those discriminatory laws would still be with us
today. Moreover, it is almost always impossible to determine the

                                                    -28-
                                   423

exact internal state of mind or reasoning of any person,
organization or group in adopting discriminatory practices.
Judge Kennedy implicitly recognizes this in his answer to this
Committee's questions. With regard to the policies of the
Olympic Club he states:

               I was not involved in the club's decisions to
                limit membership and, consequently, do not feel
               competent to articulate the reasons for such
               restrictive policies.
Id. at 47. With regard to the Sacramento Elks Lodge #6's
policies he provides the identical excuse. Id. at 49. How,
then, can Judge Kennedy, using his incorrect standard for
invidious discrimination, state with certainty that the
discriminatory policies of these clubs were not based on ill-will
and intended to impose a stigma? He cannot have it both ways.
         The standard for discrimination articulated by Judge Kennedy
is also at variance with the commentary to the ABA Code of
Judicial Conduct, as amended in 1984, concerning membership in
organizations that practice invidious discrimination. The ABA
commentary expresses the concern and rationale for the standard,
by stating that membership in such organizations "may give rise
to perceptions by minorities, women and others, that the judge's
impartiality is impaired." In other words, a judge should avoid
any appearance of lack of impartiality. Judge Kennedy failed to
do that by continuing to maintain membership in clubs having
facially exclusionary policies that he now acknowledges could
harm women or minorities or even result in stigma, long after
he took the bench and long after questions concerning such club

                                                    -29-
                                    424

memberships had been raised in the ABA and before Congress. His
justification for doing so in no way redeems his behavior but
only serves to highlight his apparent lack of concern for
eradicating sex discrimination or his lack of knowledge about
Supreme Court jurisprudence on sex discrimination cases.

                                               Conclusion

        Judge Kennedy has repeatedly failed to recognize and remedy
even the simplest and most blatant sex discrimination. His
record of enforcing Title VII demonstrates that he does not
recognize, despite strong precedent, that explicit, sex-based
discrimination is necessarily discrimination. He has taken the
position that sven where we recognize its occurrence it may be
discounted. He has even suggested that it may be excused if it
does not translate into cognizable monetary harm. He has
developed a result-oriented analysis rejecting disparate impact
cases that would undermine existing law. His judicial philosophy
taken together with his failure to adequately appreciate the
existence of facial discrimination under Title VII suggest that
he may well undo constitutional equal protection doctrine with
respect to sex if given the chance, by setting new tests of
ill-will, malice, or stigma--tests it will be impossible to meet

23 We understand that Judge Kennedy's recognition that stigma
could result from facial exclusion came only in response to
Senator Kennedy's questioning before this Committee, and not in
his original written response to the Committee.

                                                    -30-
                                    425

in the sex discrimination context. Finally, Judge Kennedy's
analysis of the ABA standards of judicial conduct with respect to
exclusionary clubs, in two of which he was a member until nearly
the eve of these hearings, reflects the chilling reality that
Judge Kennedy takes an aggressively apologist approach to the
exclusionary practices, in effect arguing that such practices are
not discriminatory. Such analysis is fundamentally inconsistent
and flawed and flies in the face of any acceptable analysis of
discrimination in existing law.

        The testimony that we present here is necessarily limited,
focusing only upon publicly available materials bearing on the
nominee's thinking about sex-based equity. The hasty scheduling
of these hearings has not afforded the time for an analysis of
the nominee's judicial philosophy that would provide this
Committee a precise understanding of the impact that confirmation
of Judge Kennedy could have on decision-making by the highest
court of this land in sex discrimination cases. The Committee
has not even garnered all the materials that are reflective of
the nominee's thinking. We urge you not only to hold the record
open but also to continue the hearings at a later date, after
this Committee has gathered all of the relevant materials on
Judge Kennedy. Finally, we urge you to call him back for further
questioning concerning the extent to which he will recognize
facial discrimination as discrimination, and whether he will
adopt the Court's existing precedents on proof of intentional
discrimination and the use of disparate impact doctrine.

   Mr. Levi.
   Mr. LEVI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for the
opportunity to testify before you today on the nomination of Judge
Kennedy.
  The CHAIRMAN. Welcome back.
  Mr. LEVI. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force is the na-
tion's oldest and largest gay and lesbian civil rights advocacy orga-
nization representing the 10 percent of the American population
that is lesbian and gay.
  The gay and lesbian community seeks from a Supreme Court
nominee
  The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me. Is that a membership, 10 percent of
the population are members?
  Mr. LEVI. NO. Ten percent of the American population that is les-
bian and gay.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU presume to speak for that 10 percent. They
are not like NOW, for example, have actual members.
  Mr. LEVI. We are a membership organization.
  The CHAIRMAN. HOW many members do you have?
  Mr. LEVI. We have 10,000 members, and we represent about a
hundred local organizations around the country.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Mr. LEVI. The gay and lesbian community seeks from a Supreme
Court nominee nothing more or less than other Americans: We
seek a nominee committed to the concept that the rights contained
in the Constitution are meant to be inclusive of all Americans, in-
cluding gay and lesbian Americans. If there is one trend that is
clear in modern American constitutional history, it is our contin-
ued expansion of the definition of groups and minorities who have
come to be protected by the Constitution's umbrella.

  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court still fails to include gay and
lesbian Americans under that umbrella. The court and Judge Ken-
nedy continue to deny us rights that most Americans take for
granted. These rights include privacy in consensual, adult sexual
expression as well as protections against simpler forms of discrimi-
nation from employment to child custody. This leaves gay and les-
bian Americans as perhaps the last--and fairly large--minority
lacking such constitutional protections. Our appeals for inclusion
in the American constitutional family have been rejected at almost
every turn, most dramatically last year in Bowers v. Hardwick.
That decision affected privacy rights of gays and nongays alike in
the half of the country that still has sodomy laws.

  With that as a preface, we look to Judge Kennedy's record in
hope of finding indication that his definition of American society
and the Constitution is more inclusive. Unfortunately, little hope
can be found. It can be said that Judge Kennedy has, over the last
decade, repeatedly ruled to deny gays equality under the law.

  Judge Kennedy supported exclusion of gay and lesbian service
people from the military, deferring to the Defense Department's
claim of the special circumstances of military life. He said this de-
spite the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that gays are a
security risk or in any other way less capable than their heterosex-
ual counterparts to serve their country. The morale argument used
                                                   427

against gays in the military are painfully similar to those used 40
years ago to justify continued racial segregation in the armed
forces. And Judge Kennedy bought those tired arguments.

  Judge Kennedy has disagreed with other court decisions holding
that government employees may not be fired because they are gay
unless an adverse impact on job performance can be chown. He
joined in denying former civil servants relief as a class even though
they had been unconstitutionally fired because they were lesbian
or gay. He also saw no constitutional protection for federal employ-
ees who were openly gay, thus seeking to relegate lesbians and
gays to the closet. It seems that in Judge Kennedy's view it is all
right for gays to be so--just as long as they do not tell anyone.
Imagine saying that to other minorities, such as Jews. Such an
opinion would then be seen for what it is--reducing a minority to
second-class citizenship.

  Finally, Judge Kennedy wrote an opinion in an immigration case
that devalued the legitimacy of gay relationships in denying a
hardship claim involving separation of life partners who happened
to be gay. Judge Kennedy was, in effect, saying that gay relation-
ships--simply because they involve persons of the same sex--are
by definition less committed than those of heterosexuals, hardly a
provable concept.

  Time does not permit a consideration of Judge Kennedy's record
toward other minorities--minorities of which gays and lesbians are
also a part. But my colleagues on this panel and others will cer-
tainly address them adequately.

  If this brief survey shows anything, it is that Judge Kennedy's
record, at least toward one minority, has a far too narrow defini-
tion of the universe of Americans entitled to the rights guaranteed
under the Constitution. His past opinions offer little hope to gays
and lesbians challenging adverse treatment in the courts. Judge
Kennedy's views may be expressed without the vitriolic rhetoric as-
sociated with Judge Bork, but his conclusions are the same. I ask
that you examine Judge Kennedy's record by the same standard as
you did Judge Bork's. If you do so, 1 think your conclusion will
have to be the same: Judge Kennedy's notion of justice is too
narrow for him to be worthy of a role as a final arbiter of the
meaning of the U.S. Constitution.

  Thank you.

        o Judge Kennedy supported exclusion of gay and lesbian service people
from the military, deferring to the Defense Department's claim of the
special circumstances of military life. He said this despite the fact that
there is no evidence to suggest gays are a security risk or in any other
way less capable than their heterosexual counterparts to serve their
country. The morale argument used against gays in the military are
painfully similar to those used forty years ago to Justify continued racial
segregation in the armed forces. And Judge Kennedy bought those tired
arguments.

        o Judge Kennedy has disagreed with other court decisions holding that
government employees may not be fired because they are gay unless an
adverse impact on job performance can be shown. He joined in denying
former civil servants relief as a class even though they had been
unconstitutionally fired because they were lesbian or gay. He also saw no
constitutional protection for federal employees who were openly gay, thus
seeking to relegate lesbians and gays to the closet. It seems that in
Judge Kennedy's view it is all right for gays to be so--Just as long as
they don't tell anyone. Imagine saying that to other minorities, such as
Jews. Such an opinion would then be seen for what it ls--reduclng a
minority to second-class citizenship.

        o Finally, Judge Kennedy wrote an opinion in an immigration case that
devalued the legitimacy of gay relationships in denying a hardship claim
involving separation of life partners who happened to be gay. Judge
Kennedy was, in effect, saying that gay relationships -- simply because they
Involve persons of the same sex--are by definition less committed than
those of heterosexuals, hardly a proveable concept.

        Time does not permit a consideration of Judge Kennedy's record toward
other minorities--minorities of which gays and lesbians are also a part.
But I am sure other witnesses will address these concerns as well.

        If this brief survey shows anything, it is that Judge Kennedy's
record--at least toward one minority--has a far too narrow definition of
the universe of Americans entitled to the rights guaranteed under the
Constitution. His past opinions offer little hope to gays and lesbians
challenging adverse treatment in the courts. Judge Kennedy's views may be
expressed without the vitriolic rhetoric associated with Judge Bork, but
his conclusions are the same. I ask that you examine Judge Kennedy's
record by the sane standard as you did Judge Bork's. If you do so, I think
your conclusion will have to be the same: Judge Kennedy's notion of Justice
is too narrow for him to be worthy of a role as a final arbiter of the
meaning of the U.S. Constitution.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
   Ms. YARD. Mr. Chairman, I made a grievous omission. Can I cor-
rect my opening?
   The CHAIRMAN. Certainly.
   Ms. YARD. I spoke on behalf of the National Organization for
Women, which is a membership organization of women and men,
but I also am here on behalf of the National Women's Political
Caucus, who joins us in opposing the confirmation of Judge Kenne-
dy.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you for that clarification.
  We are, on our first round, going to limit ourselves to 5 minutes.
I have an umber of questions. To the extent you can help me keep
within my 5 minutes, I would appreciate it very much.
  Professor, did you find any solace at all--and I, quite frankly, am
most disturbed by the flight attendant decision. That one I find--I
do not know how you explain that one.
  But did you find any solace, when Judge Kennedy was pressed
on what standard that he would seek to apply in making decisions
based on gender discrimination? He indicated that he wanted a
higher scrutiny standard, and he said although he was not sure--
correct me, if your recollection is different, and my staff I ask to
correct me--somewhere between Marshall's sliding scale and the
existing standard that has been used by the Court, and the majori-
ty of the Court.

  What did you read from that, if anything?
  Professor Ross. My concern is how a standard is applied, not the
standard that is articulated. I think it is easy to articulate a given
standard. The difficult and tough question comes up when you look
at how somebody applies it.

  It happens that he has written a couple of minor equal-protection
decisions which are cited, and discussed very briefly in my longer,
written statement.

  The thing that struck me, in looking at those, is that they did
not exhibit a thorough kind of analysis, and the second one is a
rather peculiar situation where the challenge was to a criminal
statute which resulted in heavier penalty for rape of a man than
for rape of a woman.

  He cited the
  The CHAIRMAN. The heavier penalty for the rape of a man rather
than the rape of a woman?
  Professor Ross. Yes. That is right. That is right. It was chal-
lenged, and he upheld the distinction. I found his reasoning a little
difficult to understand. He seemed to be implying that it was more
painful or traumatic for a man to be raped than for a woman to be,
and so that was the justification. He cited
  The CHAIRMAN. And that case is cited in your statement?
  Professor Ross. Yes. It is. It is U.S. v. Smith. And he started by
citing the language from Craig v. Boren, but if you look at the con-
cluding paragraph--it is not a very long excerpt--he is really using
rational relationship language.
  He is saying that there is a rational distinction between the two
forms of rape. He does not really explain why it necessary to have
a sex-based classification.
                                                    433

  So my concern would be, how does he really apply it? And that is
the question that I have, too, in terms of the other sex-discrimina-
tion cases that we have looked at. There is verbal adherence to the
correct standards, but when you look at how it has actually been
applied, he justifies obvious sex discrimination.

  The CHAIRMAN. Based on what you have read--and I presume
you have read all his speeches, and a number of his cases--obvious-
ly you will not know the answer to this but I would like your pro-
fessional judgment as to what you think would be the outcome.

  Do you have a sense of how he would rule on Roe v. Wade, a
similar case, if it came before the Court?

  Professor Ross. I am afraid I have no sense at all of that.
  The CHAIRMAN. Neither do I. You have provided me no solace,
which takes me now to Mr. Rauh.
  Mr. Rauh, you seem to be suggesting that--and you may be
right--that none of us should vote for any Justice with whom we
have any doubt about how he would rule, or she would rule on the
case.
  In other words, in Roe v. Wade, unless I was certain that he
would not vote to overrule Roe v. Wade, are you suggesting that
members of this committee should therefore not vote for the Jus-
tice? Is that what you mean by "Russian roulette"?

  Mr. RAUH. NO. I do not mean that, Senator, and I am sorry that I
did not make myself clear enough. I believe you should not vote for
anybody who has not demonstrated support for the Bill of Rights.

  You cannot have certainty on how a person is going to go on a
particular case. But you can satisfy yourself, Senator, that you
have someone before you who has demonstrated that support, who
has done things in this world for rights, who has stood up in court
and argued for the Bill of Rights, who, as a judge, in the lower
courts, argued for the Bill of Rights.

  I am saying there should be some demonstrated support for the
Bill of Rights. Then you can take your chances. You are not going
to get certitude, but it is Russian roulette

  The CHAIRMAN. And what part of the Bill of Rights do you have
uncertainty about with regard to Mr. Kennedy?

  Mr. RAUH. I have uncertainty on the three great current issues,
and I would like to give two reasons why I have that uncertainty.
First, let me say what I think we all agree are the three greatest
issues before the Supreme Court. Number one, of course, is Roe v.
Wade. Number two is separation of church and State. Number
three is affirmative action and school desegregation.

  Those are the three areas where you have a four to four split,
and where Judge Kennedy is going to be the deciding factor--
where Justice Powell was the deciding factor for the Bill of Rights.

   Now those are the areas on which I would think you should
assure yourself, because they are the

  The CHAIRMAN. And that is, you would have to know the answer
to

   Mr. RAUH. NO, sir. You have to have somebody who has spoken
out for civil rights. Who has done something for civil rights in the
courts as a lawyer. Who has done something for civil rights as a
judge. There are thousands, literally thousands of lawyers in this
                                                    434

country--black, white, brown, everything--who would meet this
test.

   The CHAIRMAN. Are you saying there are people who have done
something for civil rights who could be against affirmative action?

  Mr. RAUH. There are people like that, certainly.
  The CHAIRMAN. And there are people who have done something
for women who could be against Roe v. Wade. Is that what you are
saying?
  Mr. RAUH. That could be true, although it is an unlikely event.
  The CHAIRMAN. Aren't you playing games with me, Mr. Rauh?
Aren't you really saying
  Mr. RAUH. On the contrary. I am very serious. And I think the
standard, as I stated it in my prepared statement should be:
"Judge Kennedy has not evidenced a devotion to the Bill of Rights
that we deem the prime requisite for a member of the Supreme
Court at this time."
  The CHAIRMAN. And you have just defined that in terms of
issues. You defined it in terms of Roe v. Wade, you defined it in
terms of affirmative action, and you defined it terms of--what was
the third issue?--separation of church and State.

  Mr. RAUH. It is not that it is defined in those terms. Support for
the Bill of Rights covers literally hundreds of different things, but
these are the three areas where the Supreme Court is balanced,
and therefore, you should want some assurance on them. I think
you could have

  The CHAIRMAN. Assurance on what? The outcome?
  Mr. RAUH. NO. YOU are not giving me a chance to make it clear,
and it is a difficult concept. The concept is that the nominee should
be someone who has shown clear support for the Bill of Rights. I do
not care where he has shown it. He might have shown it in some
area involving the Japanese--on the internment--for example. I do
not care where he showed it. If a person has shown some devotion
for civil rights, I think you could then very well say we are confi-
dent in the other areas of civil rights.

  Second, let me make this point because I think it is so clear. It is
not guilt by association to say that the Justice Department has
spent 7 years trying to reverse the Supreme Court in the three
areas that I have mentioned where the court is balanced 4 to 4.

  Don't tell me they do not know where Judge Kennedy stands.
This is their last-ditch effort to reverse the Supreme Court's deci-
sions. I think they know more about him than you know. I think
this was a failure on your part. I want to second the suggestion of
Professor Ross, that he be called back for some real questioning on
this. The job has not been finished.

  The CHAIRMAN. I asked him under oath, in great detail, about
what commitments he had made, what questions had been asked.

  Mr. RAUH. Oh, nobody is suggesting he made commitments. You
do not make commitments in this world before going on a court. I
am not suggesting he made commitments to the Justice Depart-
ment.

  I simply think they know how he feels, and I think you could
have

  The CHAIRMAN. HOW would they know how he feels?
                                         435

  Mr. RAUH. By the various people they have spoken to. And I
think you could have found out, not how he would vote, but how he
feels, by asking him what he said when these cases came down. He
is a man who lives in the constitutional field. He lives in that field
as much as the Senators up here.

  All of you live in that field. I will bet every one of you comment-
ed on all these cases when they came down. I will bet Judge Ken-
nedy talked to people about these cases when they came down.

  I think you ought to know what he said then. I think we ought to
know. I think the public ought to know.

  Professor Ross. If I could just add a note, I understand he did not
turn over his teaching notes from constitutional law courses, and I
would imagine there might be some very interesting explanations
of his views in those notes.

  Ms. YARD. I would also like to add another note. We know very
well--you know better than I do--that Senator Helms has one
issue on which he will not give an inch, and he is obviously satis-
fied with Judge Kennedy, and if you read the newspaper clips,
which I do from all over the country on this whole subject, it is
well established that the right-to-life people are convinced that he
is one of theirs. All you have to do is read what they are saying.

  The CHAIRMAN. SO the fact that they are convinced is evidence
that we should be against?

  Ms. YARD. I am very worried about what it means, and we are
talking about women's lives, and it is not a laughing matter.

  The CHAIRMAN. I understand. I am not laughing. No one else is
laughing. I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you
are saying, and what you are saying

  Ms. YARD. Well, I cannot prove what he said to Jesse Helms. Nei-
ther can you. He said he did not say

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask you another question. Do either of
you, or Mr. Rauh, think there is any possibility you could be for
any judge that would be sent up by this administration?

  Ms. YARD. Well, you know, lightening might strike. They might
nominate Barbara Jordan. I would sure be for her. I mean, who
knows?

  Mr. RAUH. I would like to answer that. The answer is that if this
committee, and the Senate, were to make clear they will not con-
firm someone who has not shown a dedicated support for the Bill of
Rights, you will either have a choice next year, or they will send
up somebody who will meet that qualification.

  Don't forget that President Nixon did that, after we had defeat-
ed

  The CHAIRMAN. That is a fine role model to follow.
  Mr. RAUH. Well, it is a role model that I would not ordinarily
propose, but it seems to me to be appropriate here. After Hayns-
worth and Carswell were beaten, President Nixon sent up a man
who, on the eighth circuit, had evidenced great support for the Bill
of Rights in a number of cases. There was no opposition to the
judge in that third
  The CHAIRMAN. Who was that?
   Ms. YARD. Blackmun.

       90-878 0 - 89 - 15
                                                    436

   Mr. RAUH. Judge Blackmun who ultimately wrote the great Roe
v. Wade case. We did not oppose him. What we did was declare a
victory because he was obviously pro Bill of Rights.

   The CHAIRMAN. He was a member of the Cosmos Club, wasn't
he?

   Mr. RAUH. I have no idea.

   The CHAIRMAN. He was.

   Mr. RAUH. And the clubs were not quite the issue in 1970 that
they are today.

   The CHAIRMAN. That is a good point you just made. I am way
over my time. I yield.

   Senator SIMPSON. We could yield you some time from the senior
Senator from South Carolina, if you would like a little more.

   The CHAIRMAN. NO. I think he is coming back to question Mr.
Levi.

   Senator SIMPSON. I would be glad to let you continue. I am fasci-
nated by it, and I mean that. I think it is, you know, good

   The CHAIRMAN. NO. I have many questions. I will come back. I
yield.

   Senator SIMPSON. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I suppose it
would have been a good time to duck, and let the chairman take all
the lumps, but I am not going to let that happen.

   The CHAIRMAN. Please don't help me too much, Alan. [Laughter.]
   Senator SIMPSON. I know, Joe. Just relax. It is all right. You can
just feel comfortable now. Just settle down. Don't let the meter
run, though.
  Anyway, to say that the Chairman has not been fair, and that
somehow he has played "pattycake"--and that was the phrase--
with this exercise, is just absurd, and it is offensive to me.
  The reason it has not come to pass, I guess, like some of you
would like it to come to pass, is that the digging has actually been
done, but the diggers broke their pick during the last mother lode,
and they cannot get it sharpened up again. It will not work. It is
fascinating to watch.
  I believe the Chairman is absolutely right. There is not any
nominee that is going to pass your test, that comes out of this
President. Why don't we just get right down to honesty on this one,
at least from these two witnesses.
  And to say that we should wait for the Justice Department, Mr.
Rauh--and I have the greatest respect for you. I have been reading
your material since I was a young lawyer in Cody, Wyoming--to
say you want the Justice Department to enter in here before we go
further, with some of the things you have said about Ed Meese and
the Justice Department, is the "chuckle deluxe" of the whole year.
   I mean, it has got to make you just gasp, and pitch forward on
your ear.
   Now, apparently Justice Stevens did not pass the test, O'Connor
did not pass the test, Scalia did not pass the test, Rehnquist did not
pass the test, and yet they are on the bench. Yes, they all are.
   And so here we are, getting back to things about Rosa Parks, and
the back of the bus, and into the kitchen, and Roe v. Wade. Wait a
minute. You know, you all will get your shots here.
   But this is not what we are talking about. We are trying to be
reasonable. We are not going back and digging through the stacks
                                                    437

of things. And these are quotes of you. I know it may be puzzling
but I scribbled them as you spoke.

  I happen to believe in the result of Roe v. Wade. I do not believe
in some of the tortuous reasoning that got them there, but I believe
in Roe v. Wade, and I am not at all concerned about what this
nominee will do, and I do not have any idea, what he will do.

   But it will be done in a legal way, and a thoughtful way, but I do
not think highly charged phrases are appropriate here.

   If you want to know about what Judge Kennedy did, instead of
just "romancing the rocks", he did 500 hours of pro bono work for
a development project in his home community, called the Plaza de
la Flores, Five hundred hours plus of pro bono work. I called that
"putting your money where your mouth is."

   So what are we talking about, this slicing up decisions, and
coming to this kind of activity, when you see a guy who laid him-
self on the line for the Hispanic community in his own community?
Five hundred hours plus of pro bono.

   Is there anybody around who has done that much in their lives?
I never did that much pro bono, I do not think, and I practiced law
for 18 years.

   Now that is what v.c sse talking about, and so, you know, I
would just like to kind of "put the English back on the cue ball"
and bring it Sack across the green here, instead of just off into the
vapors.

   Now, you know, I think it is absurd to try to nail the Chairman
as not having performed his function, and let's just look, if I may,
at this issue of comparable worth. Comparable worth. There is not
one soul here, or in this chamber listening

   Mr. RAUH. YOU are not going to give me a chance to answer the
point you made before?

   Senator SIMPSON. Yes. I have not asked you a question yet. You
cannot possibly answer anything. I am not through yet.

   Mr. RAUH. NO, but I thought the subject of the things you said
about me ought to be answered while you did it.

   Senator SIMPSON. I know, but you can have your shot, and I will
have it privately, or publicly. You know, you had yours.

   Mr. RAUH. Well, I want it publicly.
   Senator SIMPSON. I only get 5 minutes. To come in and then
begin to talk about things of comparable worth, as if somehow we
were setting up the sinister idea that nobody believes in equal pay
for equal work. That is a given.
   There is not anybody here that does not believe in equal pay for
equal work. But when you get into comparable worth--and it is in-
teresting to listen to that--comparable worth is never going to sell
because it is incomprehensible.
   It is a tangled skein of gnarled and convoluted concepts that
makes a Gordian knot look like a straight rope. And whoever de-
scribed it as--a good phrase--"a wild, inextricable maze"--is right.
And so, why is it the States should not be free to do their own
thing with comparable worth, if they so choose, without judicial im-
perialism commanding that they enact laws which apparently the
legislature is unwilling to enact, and which would "break the
bank" of most States in the Union.
                                                    438

   Now that is a question, and then you can respond in any way
you wish, but I mean, I get my time to talk, too. Shoot.

   Mr. RAUH. I will leave to Molly Yard or Professor Ross the an-
swers to your point on comparable worth because they know more
about it than I do. But I would like to answer the earlier part of
your discussion where you said that we had broken our pick be-
cause there was nothing there.

   Nothing was asked that would have shown what was there. But
secondly, you were criticizing us for saying, well, we would like to
know what Mr. Meese knows. I am not a great advocate or lover of
Mr. Meese, but I would like to know what he knows about Judge
Kennedy's views.

   Furthermore, you made two mistakes of fact.
  Senator SIMPSON. Please. What are they?
  Mr. RAUH. We did not oppose Stevens. We did not oppose
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I was talking about the National Organi-
zation for Women. They did oppose Justice Stevens. I have a quote
from there
  Mr. RAUH. YOU were talking to me at the time. And you also said
we opposed Justice O'Connor, that we would oppose anybody that
President Reagan sent up. We did not oppose Justice O'Connor. We
did not. There was very little opposition to Justice O'Connor, and,
as a matter of fact, did you oppose her, Molly?
  Ms. YARD. We testified on her behalf. We supported her nomina-
tion.
  Mr. RAUH. SO your statement that we would not support any-
body, or would oppose anybody from the Reagan administration, is
simply erroneous, sir.
  Senator SIMPSON. Well, I will split the difference with you. We
have a quote from the National Organization for Women which
says, "We oppose the confirmation of Judge Stevens. His antago-
nism to women's rights is clear." Now, that is what the National
Organization of Women did, and that is a quote.
  On the other one, I still think that I do not know who would
please you from this President. I hold that view.
  The CHAIRMAN. Would anyone else like to comment?
  Ms. YARD. I would like to say quickly that it is the National Or-
ganization for Women. We are an organization of men and women
for women's rights. We did support Sandra Day O'Connor. Eleanor
Smeal testified on her behalf.
  To play out Joe Rauh's belief that you can know where a person
stands on rights, her record was very clear, and that is why we
supported her.
  On the comparable worth, the pay equity case, which is the
AFSCME case, it is common practice in business and industry to do
job evaluations, to classify them, and to assign wages and salaries
according to the classifications. And the evaluation is based upon
educational requirements, skill requirements, experience, and judg-
ment.
   The State of Washington did study three percent of their many,
many jobs in the marketplace to find out what the marketplace
was paying them. Then not doing a job evaluation, they simply as-
signed the rest of the jobs according to a system which they set up.
That was that if you were, for instance, in one example, a school
                                         439

security guard, female, you got assigned to the clerical classifica-
tion. And if you were a school security guard, male, you got as-
signed to the security classification. Needless to say, the security
classification paid a much higher rate of pay, and it was filled by
men.

  It is very clear from the studies which the State of Washington
made over and over again and from their very own admission, in
the words of Governor Dan Evans and, subsequent to that, Gover-
nor Ray, that they did discriminate in jobs that were simply
women's jobs. And they did it because they wanted to keep the
peace. They wanted to keep the historical alignment. They did not
want to make any adjustments.

  Judge Kennedy totally ignored the findings, which showed sex
discrimination, because I guess he has problems with the whole
concept of equality for women.

  The CHAIRMAN. Professor Ross?
  Professor Ross. I do think there is some academic criticisms that
can be leveled at his opinion in AFSCME, and in particular a fail-
ure to follow Supreme Court precedent and, I think, a real distor-
tion of Supreme Court precedent. That is what concerns me very
seriously about his opinion.
  I lay it out somewhat in my written testimony. I think there are
two basic criticisms that can be leveled. One is that in terms of in-
tentional discrimination, he is trying to use this new higher stand-
ard that I referenced in my oral statement a moment ago. Without
really discussing the difference between the two standards, he
starts by quoting from 14th amendment law, dealing not with
facial sex-based classifications, but rather with neutral classifica-
tions where the court has imposed a special requirement as to how
to show intent. He suggests that that higher level of intent has to
be shown in a case which is about facial discrimination, about dis-
crimination based on sex, where you are not alleging a neutral
practice.
  Second, he suggests that the Supreme Court in title VII areas
has required that statistical evidence of discrimination which is
used to show intent to discriminate must be corroborated by other
additional evidence of discrimination. Well, that is flatly untrue.
The holding of the Supreme Court in Teamsters was precisely that
statistics alone were sufficient to make out a prima facie case of
intentional discrimination.
  Having said that he had to have corroborative evidence, he then
went on to discount the corroborative evidence that was, indeed,
put forth in that case. Now, the corroborative evidence was very
strong, but it was the kind of evidence that, as I said earlier, I
think he tends to discount the significance of. The corroborative
evidence was that the State had for many years officially segregat-
ed jobs on the basis of sex. Women were not allowed to apply to
some jobs, and men were not allowed to apply for others. Jobs were
kept as sex segregated.
  And in addition to that evidence that the jobs were officially seg-
regated by sex--it was an official policy--they brought in expert
witnesses to say that the effect of segregation is to carry over on to
wage discrimination that often persists long after sex segregation is
discontinued.
                                                    440

   He ignored all that evidence, basically, and said that the corrobo-
ration of the statistical evidence was not sufficient. Now, I think
the statistical evidence alone should have been sufficient, but sta-
tistics plus this corroboration of a long-standing practice of segre-
gating workers on the basis of sex has to be read to say something
about the State's intent to discriminate within the meaning of in-
tention under title VII.

  Indeed, the Supreme Court in another case, McDonnell-Douglas,
which is a very early and landmark case, has said that you can
take an employer's general practice of discrimination and reason
from that that, in some other act committed by that same employ-
er, it makes it more likely than not that the employer has discrimi-
nated.

  Okay. So that is a whole area of law where I think he was dis-
torting existing Supreme Court precedent to reach a result he
wanted. That is only one area.

  The second area was this new doctrine he came up with, with no
support in Supreme Court law at all, that disparate impact doc-
trine does not apply to wage discrimination cases. There is simply
no support in the Supreme Court cases for that notion. In fact, I
show in my written statement that many of the criticisms he levels
at using disparate impact analysis for wage discrimination can be
applied to the kind of employment testing decision in Griggs, that
was involved in Griggs, the very first disparate impact decision by
the Supreme Court. He says, gee, wage systems take account of a
multi-faceted number of factors. That is true of tests. He says em-
ployers go through a lot of different steps to arrive at the final
result. That is true of tests. It is true of both tests and a wage
system that there is a final number; you pass or you do not pass
the test. You have a wage. Those numbers can be used to quantify
the effects on a certain sex or race of the particular system.

  So I do not think there is any support in the Supreme Court doc-
trine for the result he reached, which was: I refuse to apply this
doctrine at all. I just will not apply it. So I think it is very serious-
ly attackable for not following existing Supreme Court precedent,
and it gives me great concern that in an area of wage discrimina-
tion, when we are dealing with a statue which says simply employ-
ers may not discriminate on the basis of sex in compensation--that
is the broad, comprehensive language of title VII--that he is inter-
preting it in such a narrow and hostile way.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU answered two of my questions.
  Senator Kennedy.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I want to express
real appreciation for the testimony that we have received, and I
think any fair listening and viewing of our witnesses would have to
show that they have spent a great deal of time in reviewing the
writings and reviewing the cases and identifying these issues for
this committee. I think they have given us much to think about.
  I must say that these are always--well, in this case--a close
question and a close call. The areas which have been reviewed
here, perhaps as stated by Mr. Rauh, touch on many of the areas
which I have been most concerned about. There are those words
"equal justice under law." This nominee is important not for those
that are going to have the well-financed lawyers who are going to
                                         441

appear before the Supreme Court, but for those that may be left
out or behind. That covers a wide range of groups.

  It is in the areas of civil rights where we reviewed with him his
thinking on Circle Realty and found out that that reasoning that
he had was overruled by a very substantial group in the Supreme
Court, seven to two. We had the Mountain View case involving
handicapped children, and that was overruled in the Supreme
Court by a unanimous court.

  Then his view about the various class action suits, which are
really rather basic to individuals to be able to continue to redress
their grievances--in the Pavlac case his view was overruled.

  So these points which you raise, I just would hope that you recog-
nize, are enormously troublesome and disturbing. We have re-
viewed the AFSCME case, the Beller case to some extent.

  We have got very short time. I would like to take each of those
areas that we have spent the better part of a couple of days coming
at, perhaps in different ways, by members of this committee. But
say in those cases involving civil rights; I think we already have
heard a good deal on comparable worth in response to other ques-
tions.

  But with regards to minorities and women, and perhaps the
handicapped or those that want to have their day in court and re-
dress their grievances through the court system, how concerned
should they be? How concerned should they really be if this nomi-
nee is advanced to the Supreme Court?

  I will ask the question to Mr. Rauh, and then any of the others,
if you want to comment on it. I think they are going to use all my
time.

  Mr. RAUH. I guess I may in part have answered that question out
of my own very deep concern. I believe that minorities and women
have a deep concern, and properly have that concern, about where
he is going to come out.

  It is not that I know for sure that he is always coming out wrong
on the Bill of Rights. It is that, with a four-to-four split which we
had as recently as the day before yesterday, a four-to-four split in
the Court, he becomes the number one man in the legal world:
Where is he going to come down?

  Should we not have a better reading now? It is not that we
should have a hundred percent certainty. But should we not have
the feeling that it is more likely that he is coming down on the side
of minorities and women than he is coming down on the other
side?

  I would say that, looking at the cases--the ones I referred to and
the ones that you referred to, Senator Kennedy--looking at all
those cases, that amounts to nine, if you add to my six the three
that you referred to. If you take all those nine cases, is it not fair
to say that the probabilities are against minorities and women? Or
even if it was only 50-50 that he would come down against minori-
ties and women, I think we ought not take the risk.

  It all comes down in the last analysis this way: How much do
you care about the Bill of Rights? If you care about it as much as
the "rights" groups do, the women's groups, the minority groups,
then you are coming down one way. If you have a lesser priority
for "rights," you are coming down the other way. This is not a par-
                                                    442

tisan or mean battle. It is getting clearer and clearer that it is a
question of what test you are going to use. If you are going to use
the test that the President can do pretty much anything, then obvi-
ously you are going to confirm Judge Kennedy. On the other hand,
it seems to me that Judge Bork was defeated because you did not
want to re-fight the battles of the past and that is still the question
here.

  Do you want to take a chance that you are going to have to re-
fight the battles of the past? I think you should not.

  Ms. YARD. I would just like to add that, like Joe, I have spent my
entire life on working to end discrimination. He has done it bril-
liantly in law; I have simply worked to educate and to organize
people so that this country shall become a place of equality.

  I think the meaning of the whole last 25 to 30 years of this coun-
try is that we are moving to a more just society. I can see much
progress, and much of it has been because of the legislation which
Congress has passed and much of it has been because of the deci-
sions made by the courts of this country.

  Senator KENNEDY. If you want to come, fine. We thank you.
  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. Rauh, I support the Chairman's decision in starting these
hearings at the time he did. There have been some 5 weeks be-
tween November 11th and today.
  My staff and I have had a chance to review the opinions; read his
speeches; prepare; talk to Ms. Yard and her associates; do follow up
work on the AFSCME case.
  But it is important that the court be filled. I believe the Supreme
Court sent us a message on Monday. I do not think it was a matter
of coincidence that they handed down that four to four decision the
day they started these hearings.
  They need to have a full court to get on with the business of the
court.
  Professor Ross, I compliment you on a very fine brief. I only had
a chance to read it earlier today. It was filed yesterday. And there
are some matters there which I find very helpful, and it was a very
thorough job.
  Mr. Levi, in the interests of equal protection, nobody has asked
you a question yet. Let me start with you. And there is not much
time to ask questions on the very important subjects which this
panel has raised.
  And you have commented about Judge Kennedy's views on priva-
cy. He wrote a speech, delivered a speech, last year before this va-
cancy occurred, where he expressly recognized the right of privacy,
and commented on it extensively, among other rights which are
not specifically enumerated in the Constitution.
  And in that speech he made an analysis of the Bowers case, and
a case decided by Canadian courts on the issues of privacy, homo-
sexuality, in a way which I consider to be very sensitive and very
thoughtful.
  And in that same speech, he raised the issue that there might be
a different conclusion on Bowers if the issue was raised in an equal
protection context.
                                                    443

  And my question to you is, have you had an opportunity to read
that, or hearing my summary of it, if that gives you any assurances
of his sensitivity to these issues, and his thoughtfulness about
them, and a rather careful judicious approach to them?

  Mr. LEVI. Well, let me read you another passage from that
speech that to some degree does not reassure me. It is fairly brief,
so I will read the entire section.

  One can conclude that certain essentials
  Senator SPECTER. Where are you reading from?
  Mr. LEVI. This is from--I believe we are talking about the same
speech, the speech entitled, "Unenumerated Rights and the Dic-
tates of Judicial Restraint."
  Senator SPECTER. Yes, just what page?
  Mr. LEVI. I only have an excerpt from here. I can get you the
  Senator SPECTER. Okay, then I will listen.
  Mr. LEVI. Okay. One can conclude that certain essential or fun-
damental rights should exist in any just society.
  It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one that
we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution.
  The due process clause is not a guarantee of every right that
should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society
grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct.
  If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision, in effect, says the
State of Georgia has a right to make a wrong decision, wrong in
the sense that it violates some people's views of rights in a just so-
ciety.
  We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be
wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a
necessary component of its own political processes.

  Its citizens have the political liberty to direct the government
process to make decisions that might be wrong in the idea sense,
subject to correction in the ordinary political process.

  In other words, he is kicking this issue back to the State legisla-
tures. And we feel that this is an issue that should have been re-
solved differently than the Supreme Court.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, he may be or he may not be. And I agree
that there are passages of that speech, as there are passages of
most speeches or most opinions, which lean in different directions.

  I would, and have, noted his opinion in the Seller case where he
recognizes that there may be some consensual homosexual behav-
ior which may face substantial constitutional challenge.

  So that it is not clearcut as to where he is going to go. And the
question in my mind is, how much more we can ask for.

  But I would like to ask Mr. Rauh a question at this point. Mr.
Rauh, you have submitted also a very good statement, as did Ms.
Yard. They have all been very helpful.

  And you have taken up a number of cases that I questioned
Judge Kennedy about extensively yesterday, the Pasadena school
case, AFSCME v. State of Washington, Aranda. My concerns as to
the fact finding process there.

  But I wonder if you have seen other cases which he has read. I
only took up the ones with him where I had some concern and
some problem.
                                                    444

   But have you had a chance to look at Lynn v. Western Gillette,
where a case was brought by two female employees under title VII,
sex discrimination. And Judge Kennedy found in their favor,
saying that the statute of limitations had not begun to run.

  Or the case of Usury v. Lacey, where there was a broad interpre-
tation given to the interstate commerce clause, to uphold a remedi-
al OSHA statute.

  Or National Labor Relations Board v. Apollo, where Judge Ken-
nedy found aliens covered by the National Labor Relations Act.

  Quite a few cases where there is real concern about the rights,
and about civil rights. And you talk about the Bill of Rights, and
you have his support of Mapp v. Ohio, the Miranda decision.

  And one of his cases, which had not been noticed or commented
about, a fascinating case from the Oregon State courts, Burr v. Sul-
livan, where he reversed a conviction for arson on very highly
technical grounds, I thought overly technical.

  And I discussed this case with him at great length. But he gave
the clue away in the opening statement that there was no physical
evidence or corroborative evidence to support the conviction except
for testimony by two juveniles.

  And there was a complex question of cross-examination and
motion to strike and so forth.

  So that my question to you, Mr. Rauh, and I know how careful
you are, aside from the cases that you cited in your memorandum,
and the ones which I questioned Judge Kennedy on yesterday,
when you view the totality of the cases, haven't you found a good
many which are respectful of civil rights, and are extensions of the
law to achieve justice in the OSHA cases and the title VII pay dis-
crimination case and so forth?

  Mr. RAUH. I have not read everything, and I would be the first to
admit that. It really was not possible for me to read all of the
cases. I have no staff and I just have not read everything.

  I have read as much as I could. There are the six cases in my
statement, and there are some others, many others, three of them
were mentioned by Senator Kennedy.

  Then there are some the other way. But my general impression
has been that the cases he went with the plaintiffs were the clear
minority. I am glad he did it. But I don't feel that they prevent one
from saying this is not a man who has demonstrated support for
the Bill of Rights.

  I think more often Judge Kennedy has gone against "rights."
And I wanted to be able to say this to you, because I think you
have studied the cases as carefully as anyone. Of the six I men-
tioned on which you felt as I do, there is something that runs
through them that is very troublesome.

  He does not respect the findings below. He very often doesn't
even mention the finding below, as he overrules it. He simply goes
ahead and states the facts as he thinks of them.

  This gives you a feeling of a preconceived notion of what the
result should be.

  If the district court makes a finding, and the appeals judge does
not at least cite the finding and say I cannot accept it, but he
simply rides roughshod over it, I think that gives a very bad im-
pression of his judicial conduct.
                                                   445

  He talked beautifully here about how a judge should decide a
case. But he did not play that game. He took findings and just paid
no attention to them.

  I can understand overruling a finding of the district court. That
is what an appellate judge may have to do on occasion. But at least
he should state the finding, and state his reasons and the evidence
on which he overruled it.

  He did not do that in these and other cases.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Rauh. Thank you
all very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Yard, would you like to respond?
  Ms. YARD. If I could, I would like to ask our vice president. She
has a comment she would like to make in answer to your question.
  Patricia Ireland.
  Ms. IRELAND. The only thing I wanted to add is that in our read-
ing of the cases, we certainly agree with Mr. Rauh that he does not
have a respect for the lower courts' finding of facts.
  But in the cases where he has ruled in favor of minorities and
women we find to have a pattern; that is, basically, they are very
narrow cases limited to the facts, and except--he rules if the stat-
ute is so clear, the Supreme Court precedent is so clear, that he is
obviously going to be overruled if he does not rule that way.

  We do not find a serious commitment in the broad view of his
cases. And I do not know whether Professor Ross has seen that
same pattern.

  Professor Ross. Well, I would like to make a distinction between
procedural and substantive decisions in the sex discrimination
area.

  You are correct that he did issue this finding on this procedural
point.

  I have not found a single decision where on the merits he has
found a woman was a victim of sex discrimination. His only deci-
sions that are favorable are at procedural stages on procedural
issues.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, often the procedural stages are critical. If
you cannot stay in court, you cannot establish your substantive
point.

  Professor Ross. That is true, but when somebody gets to the
point where somebody has won after a full trial and has won a ver-
dict, and he goes to the trouble of remanding--in one situation he
remanded on a really peripheral issue; the district court just
changed the supposed wrong finding and sent it right back up. It
went up to another ninth circuit panel which upheld the finding of
the discrimination.

  So it was sort of a pointless exercise which this woman had to go
through.

  And I think it shows that he has trouble finding discrimination
where you had the full record available.

  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Ohio.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Joe, you and I have been on the same side
of many issues, which only goes to show your good judgment in the
past.
                                                    446

   But when you say to the Chair that the Chair has been taking a
patty cake attitude in rushing the hearing, I want to say that that
was not his decision alone; that was a decision that he arrived at
after discussing the subject with those of us who serve on this com-
mittee.

  And frankly, not only do I think it unfair, I think you are just
offbase because we had a choice. The choice was to go 33 days after
the announcement, or the other choice was to wait until we recon-
vene on January 25th, and that would have been 76 days after the
announcement.

  Now in all fairness, I must say that at that point we did not
know that we would not reconvene until the 25th; we were sup-
posed to reconvene on the 19th. So it would have been 69 days.

  But I want to say that this matter did not require the same
amount of time as we felt the Judge Bork case required. He cer-
tainly has not written as much. He certainly has not made as
many speeches. Nor, in all candor, has he been as controversial.

  And I would agree with your statement that we cannot afford to
play Russian roulette with our dedication to the Bill of Rights.

  And you have a perfect right to appear, and I respect your right
to appear to oppose Judge Kennedy's nomination.

  I challenge you, however, when you challenge that what I would
consider to be the integrity of the committee in its hearing process.

  I think this committee is determined to live up to its responsibil-
ities, and it took some real heat with respect to the Bork nomina-
tion. I think we came out the right way. I think the public purpose
was served.

  But I am not willing to just sit back and see all of us attacked
because you disagree with the conclusion which we might reach.

  Mr. RAUH. Senator, I would cut off my leg before I would ques-
tion your integrity. It was not a question of your integrity when I
said you did not give us enough time to prepare, you did not give
yourself enough time to prepare. I do not consider that a matter of
integrity.

  I would not ever consider doing that. I have the highest respect
for you, my gosh, after all we have gone through together. As a
matter of fact, I do not ever remember disagreeing with you before
on anything.

  My patty cake reference was to something else, sir. That was to
asking questions. I do not think Judge Kennedy was ever pressed
properly on his views on matters. I agree you cannot ask him how
are you going to vote on Roe v. Wade, but you can ask, what did
you say to your colleagues the day it came down.

  That is a perfectly relevant question. I think those are the very
kind of things the Justice Department knows when it sends up
somebody that you would not want if you knew as much as they
know.

  But anyway, please do not get any idea that I ever had the
slightest question about yours or anybody else's integrity on this
committee.

   I have fought with some of the people on the other side of the
aisle in my lifetime, but I have never questioned their integrity
either, and I wouldn't.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you.
                                                    447

  The CHAIRMAN. Your expressions of affection, Joe, are unusual.
  Senator METZENBAUM. NOW, the one other question I have is for
Molly Yard. Because it relates to something you just said, Joe.
  You said in your written testimony that you do not know Judge
Kennedy's position on Roe v. Wade, and therefore, I gather, there
is opposition to him.
  On that basis, we would have to know what his position is on cer-
tain antitrust issues, certain civil rights issues, certain labor issues,
certain human rights issues, and the whole panoply of issues.
  And I do not think that you really mean that this committee is
not meeting its responsibility if we don't find where a particular
nominee stands with respect to any particular Supreme Court
precedent.
  Do you, Molly?
  Ms. YARD. Well, what we are saying is that there is one case he
has written on privacy that troubles us, and that is Beller v. Mid-
dendorf, when he says there may be a right to privacy.
  We think there is a right to privacy, a constitutional right to
control our reproductive lives. And I think it is a question of such
overriding social importance to this country that I think you have
to do a very careful job to figure out where he is.
  Senator METZENBAUM. But we could not ask him, how do you
stand on Roe v. Wade.
  Ms. YARD. Well, all I can say to you is that we know very well,
and you know as well as I do, that Senator Helms said I will fili-
buster this man until he is turned down, and clearly what he was
talking about was the right of a woman to choose.
  He talked to Senator Helms. Senator Helms is satisfied. And I
read what the right to life people around the country are saying,
and they are all satisfied.
  And I am saying that this is such a serious problem that I do not
think you can take the risk of putting somebody on the court who
is going to bring back the days of illegal abortion to this country.
  It will be total chaos. And I think the Senate Judiciary Commit-
tee better understand that. Women will not accept overturning of
Roe v. Wade.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, you are preaching to the choir when
you are speaking to me, because I have taken my position on that.
  Ms. YARD. I know you--I know well.
  Senator METZENBAUM. But having said that, I do not know
whether or not the Rights to Lifers are proceeding under a false
assumption.
  We certainly know that Judge Kennedy specifically disavowed
the facts presented in that article which was referred to yesterday.
And he was very categorical and very unequivocal in saying it just
did not happen that way.
  I think my time has expired.
  Ms. YARD. Well, you have to look at the pattern, I think. He has
not found really very much discrimination against women in this
country in his cases. He certainly, I do not think, understands it.
  His answer to Senator Kennedy on the club thing, I just--I
thought he put his foot squarely in it. He said, well, I got out of the
Sutter Club because everybody knew me there as a judge, and I
was uncomfortable because of the exclusionary policy of the club.
                                          448

   But in the Olympic Club, people didn't really know me so it
didn't make any difference. It made a difference, because it said
what he believes about discrimination, and he believes it is unim-
portant.

   And that--I look at what he has done on cases affecting women.
And I think he will come down on the side that it is unimportant
what happens to our lives.

   Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,
Molly.

   The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Alabama.
   Senator HEFLJN. Mr. Chairman, I have had to be absent because
of a commitment I made. Therefore, I yield my time to Harry
Truman Simons next to me.
   The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Illinois. Welcome back.
   Senator SIMON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the Justice
from Alabama here, too.
  Joe Rauh, you said that Judge Kennedy has, in making decisions,
failed to take into consideration the previous decisions of the
court--and I am quoting--you say "He has a preconceived notion
of what the decision should be."

  Are you suggesting that he has an ideological agenda?
  Mr. RAUH. I would not use the words "ideological agenda." The
quotation is right. It is taken from my answer to Senator Specter.
What I said there was, if you take the cases where he has ruled
against rights, you will find a pattern in them of Judge Kennedy
running rough shod over findings of the lower courts.

  Now, if you will indulge me. I have read those cases, and there is
such a strain of overruling, rough shod, the findings of the district
court. He would not state the finding and then give the evidence to
the contrary. He simply would not mention the finding. He would
just state the facts the other way.

  I said if you have a pattern of continuous overruling of the find-
ings below, always resulting in holding against rights, this is a
tendency that could only come from some preconceived notion.

  If you really were grappling with the problem, if you really were
grappling with the effort to get the right answer on the facts, you
would either accept the finding below, or state it, and give the rea-
sons why you are rejecting it. It is on that basis that I said that
this was some evidence of a possible preconceived notion against
the rights.

  I think in that context, it is a perfectly correct statement. I do
not think it proves that he has an ideological agenda, and I would
not make that assertion.

  Senator SIMON. Let me rephrase it. There is not an ideological
predisposition toward a certain decision? Or is there?

  Mr. RAUH. There may be. I suggested this based on the unfair,
inadequate, and erroneous treatment of the findings below in these
cases. On that basis, there must be some preconception.

  The ordinary appellate judge--and gee, I am going to get it from
Judge Heflin because he probably knows more about this than I
do--but I have always thought that the first thing the appellate
judge has to do is decide whether he can accept the findings of the
court below.
                                         449

  And then, if he decides he cannot, he has to give some reason
why, from the record, why he is not accepting the findings of the
court below that saw the witnesses.

  Now, I think if you have a pattern of doing that, and it always
comes out against rights, this is some evidence of a preconceived
notion against those rights.

  Senator SIMON. YOU mentioned the sensitivity to the Bill of
Rights, and I agree. You mentioned three specifics areas: Roe v.
Wade, church/State, and the whole civil rights, affirmative-action
area.

  The one that has not come under discussion here is the church/
State area. I have four decisions that he has made in this area, and
they are fairly narrow decisions.

  Do you have any sense of where he is in this church/State sensi-
tivity on the Bill of Rights?

  Mr. RAUH. There is not much evidence one way or another, I
would admit. The best evidence I know is this piece in the
McGeorge Law School paper. There was an interview there, and I
think Judge Heflin referred to the interview.

  Let me just read this. It was an interview back in 1968. His views
may have changed. I simply do not know. It was disturbing then
and still is.

  This is an interview with Judge Kennedy before he was a judge.
  He concedes the difficulty of justifying tax exemptions for
churches under recent Court rhetoric, but "I would hope"--and
this is a quote from Judge Kennedy--"the Supreme Court finds
some way to allow them to continue to promote freedom of reli-
gion."

  And then continuing the quote, "And the Court should leave
room for some expressions of religion in State-operated places".

  The public school is the most obvious State-operated place. I
think at that time his view would not have been for a very strong
separation of State and church, but I do not think there is very
much after that, that I know about. That was the only thing I
know anything about.

  Senator SIMON. If I may ask one more question here. If I may
ask it of Ms. Yard and Ms. Ross.

  In the Beller v. Middendorf decision, Judge Kennedy cited Roe v.
Wade with approval, and I am told that there are some groups now
who are not pleased with the Kennedy nomination because of that.

  Any observations that either of you have on that?
  Ms. YARD. That is not my impression, that he cited it with ap-
proval. Patricia Ireland, who is our vice president, and is a lawyer,
and has read many of these cases, her reading of it was that he
simply cited it, not with approval, but just cited it.
  Professor Ross. I do not have anything to add to that.
  Mr. RAUH. It was the law, Senator Simon. It is the law, and it
was his obligation to, if it was relevant, to cite it. I do not think
that gives any evidence that he would have voted that way, or will
vote that way when it comes up again.
  Senator SIMON. All right. I thank you very much. I have no fur-
ther questions, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, in your statement, you say:
                                                  450

  Judge Kennedy, yes, and even Judge Bork, might have been acceptable risks on
the Court with the majority clearly devoted to the Bill of Rights. Their differing
views might have sharpened the deliberations of the Court, but the Supreme Court
is balanced, four to four, on the primary rights issues of the day. Only this week the
Court split four to four on an abortion issue.

  It requires a ninth Justice who has evidenced clear devotion to the rights of all,
especially at a time when our nation is demanding that other countries respect
human rights. We cannot afford to play Russian roulette with our own dedication to
the Bill of Rights. A vote to confirm Judge Kennedy is a vote to take that risk with
the very fabric of our society.

  And then you indicated, in response to Senator Kennedy, as you
were explaining the difference between your view and some others,
that those who would--in order to show your respect and concern
for the Bill of Rights, you should vote against him, and those who
might vote for him, would vote for him, would be evidencing the
fact they had less concern for the Bill of Rights.

  Is that correct?
  Mr. RAUH. Almost. It is substantially correct. I was simply distin-
guishing on the basis of how much devotion to the Bill of Rights
one would demand. Essentially what you said is a fair statement,
sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU have known Professor Tribe for a long time.
Do you think he lacks devotion to the Bill of Rights?
  Mr. RAUH. I think Professor Tribe, who also happens to be a good
friend of mine, has real devotion to the Bill of Rights. I think Pro-
fessor Tribe did not have adequate time to study the cases.
  The CHAIRMAN. He indicated to me he had plenty of time to
study the cases. He indicated to the committee he had plenty of
time to study the cases.
  Mr. RAUH. Well, he just, for example, was wrong on a case this
morning, the first case I cite. That is the San Fernando case, where
Larry said that it was in effect a dissent that Judge Kennedy gave.
That is not true at all.
  The issue there was whether you should have at-large or district
elections. Well, what Judge Kennedy said, and what Larry Tribe
bought, was that the remedy of district elections was not related to
the discrimination there in addition to the fact the Mexicans never
got elected.
  "Well," the Judge said in effect, "I would have given them a
remedy other than district elections." But the things that were
happening there, like polling places in white homes, and all the
other discriminations against Mexican-Americans there--they were
relevant to at-large elections versus district elections.
  In other words, Tribe mis-read that case. All I am saying is that
it seemed to me that it was not his normal, thorough preparation.
Maybe if that is an inadequate explanation of our differences,
maybe there are just differences here.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am not asking for an explanation of differ-
ences. I was asking directly, do you think that Professor Tribe is
less committed to the Bill of Rights than you are?
  Mr. RAUH. I plead the fifth amendment.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you think I am less committed to the Bill of
Rights than you are?
  Mr. RAUH. That is a question--if you ask that question

   The CHAIRMAN. I did.
                                         451

  Mr. RAUH [continuing]. And you insist on an answer, my answer
has to be yes.

  The CHAIRMAN. DO you think Senator Kennedy is less committed
to the Bill of Rights than you are?

  Mr. RAUH. I do not want to say less committed, but I will say
this. I have spent more of my life in the Bill of Rights area than
even Senator Kennedy, and even you. I want to change my answer
to the question about you.

  The CHAIRMAN. YOU do not have to.
  Mr. RAUH. Wait a minute. I want to do it because I want to be
precise. You are asking me something that involves our relation-
ship, which I treasure. I do not say you are less committed--I want
to withdraw the answer that you are less committed. I want to put
it this way.
  I have devoted more of my lifetime to the Bill of Rights than you
have, and that creates a feeling for the Bill of Rights that someone
who has not devoted that much of their life to it cannot have.
  I would rather state it that way than the way I stated it first.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, my time is about up. I have more ques-
tions, but do you have more questions?
  Senator HEFLIN. NO.
  The CHAIRMAN. Professor, I found your testimony, quite frankly,
your written testimony particularly, fairly compelling, to tell you
the truth, and I would like you to, if you would--I do not want to
delay the hearing--but I would like you to explain, once again, for
the committee, the essence of why you believe that Judge Kennedy
was wrong, and apparently result-oriented in the Washington State
case, the AFSCME case.
  Professor Ross. Okay. Well, to start with, he, in Washington
State, says this kind of case is inappropriate to apply disparate
impact analysis at all to, and he cites the two major Supreme
Court decisions on disparate impact analysis: Griggs v. Duke Power
Company, and Dothard v. Rawlinson. And he purports to claim
that those decisions require a single discrete policy.

  And there is nothing in either of those decisions that says that.
He is simply making that up. And if you look at the policy that
was at issue in Duke Power, which is the very first case on the
issue, in which the Supreme Court first articulated the doctrine, it
involved employment tests.

  Employment tests are, by definition, a device for taking account
of a lot of different factors--trying to decide how a person does on
a lot of different scales. And they are not a simple instrument to
put together. An employer has to go through a fairly sophisticated
process to decide what is the final employment test that he wants
to use.

   Now the criticisms that Judge Kennedy levelled at the use of dis-
parate impact as applied to a wage case was that essentially it took
account of multi-faceted information and therefore was inappropri-
ate, and also, that the employer had to go through a lot of different
steps in order to arrive at the wage disparity. I see no difference
between the employment system which the Court applied disparate
impact to in 1971 and the wage case.
                                                    452

   So I do not find his citation at all persuasive, and I think he is
really distorting existing Supreme Court law to arrive at a result
he likes.

   The CHAIRMAN. HOW have the other circuits ruled on similar
cases?

  Professor Ross. Well, there is only the seventh circuit that has
ruled in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in Gunther, and
the relevance of the Supreme Court's decision was that it, for the
first time said, we are not going to confine wage-discrimination
cases to cases that are like Equal Pay Act cases.

  That is, where men and women are doing exactly the same job.
So, in the wake of the Gunther decision which says we are not
going to confine cases to Equal Pay Act type cases--which is where
the courts were going before that--there have only been two circuit
court opinions since then, his and Judge Posner's in the seventh
circuit.

  And I personally just do not find his reasoning persuasive, and I
see him distorting existing law. I found very troubling his import-
ing of this 14th amendment standard for neutral rules, where the
Court said that you have to show that something was done in order
to have an effect on a certain group, and which is appropriate
where you are talking about a neutral policy, not a facial policy.

  He imports that into this title VII case where he is not dealing
with that, and goes on to say, to suggest that the Supreme Court
requires, to prove intentional discrimination, something more than
statistics showing that men and women are treated differently.

  But the Supreme Court, on the contrary, has ruled that statistics
are sufficient. That was its holding in the Teamsters' case in 1977.
The defendants, and Teamsters had said statistics are not sufficient
to make out a prima facie case, and the court replied yes, they are.

  So Kennedy says, well, statistics are okay but you have to cor-
roborate. Not true. Okay. But even accepting his point that you
have to corroborate, he goes on to say: oh, the corroboration we
have here is meaningless. The corroboration we have here was a
longstanding pattern of the State of Washington segregating its
workers by sex, and he just discounts it.

  Now what I am saying is that that is highly significant corrobo-
ration. It is an official State policy of sex segregation, and it is of a
piece with his prior--you know, I went through his inability, ap-
parently, to recognize facial discrimination.

  He tends to use a line of analysis that the Supreme Court has
come up with in a case called Burdeen, where the Court uses shift-
ing burdens of proof to figure out if a policy is based on sex when
the employer does not admit it. But you do not have to do that
when you have got an explicit sex-based policy.

  The CHAIRMAN. I understand.
  Professor Ross. And that is what you had in the Washington
State case.
  The CHAIRMAN. Let me shift gears to another subject with you,
and I will not trouble you much longer.
  There is a lot of concern, I think not only among the four of you,
and all the members, from Senator Humphrey to Senator Simon on
this committee--I say that in terms of seniority--the entire com-
mittee, about what the outcome of further decisions relating to the
                                         453

right of a woman to control her reproductive rights, and in particu-
lar, whether or not--we always hear discussed and debated, longed
for, or loathe the possibility that Roe v. Wade may be overturned.
And I for one think if that occurs, if we think we saw demonstra-
tions in the 1950's and 1960's in Washington, DC, I think we had
better batten down the hatches in terms of the extent to which this
issue is felt strongly by both sides, by hundreds of millions of
people, 200 million people, probably.

  And it is discussed in terms of the Court being split on Roe v.
Wade, and that whomever comes along to fill the ninth vacancy
will be the deciding vote on Roe v. Wade.

  Is it your professional opinion that in fact the Court is split on
Roe v. Wade, on the fundamental question of whether or not there
exists a woman's right to privacy, to any degree, to control her
body, her reproductive organs? Is there really a four to four split,
now, or is it in fact not now a five to three split?

  What is the state of play now as you see it?
  Professor Ross. I do think it is split, four-four.
  The CHAIRMAN. DO you think O'Connor would rule to overrule
Roe v. Wade?
  Professor Ross. It is impossible to predict for sure. So far, she has
voted in every occasion against the right to abortion in the cases
that have come before her.
  I suppose
  The CHAIRMAN. Hasn't she used language--I am sorry. Go ahead.
  Professor Ross. I suppose it is possible to read her language as
saying perhaps she would not support criminalization of abortion.
It is hard to tell. She doesn't articulate it very clearly.
  The CHAIRMAN. In any of her decisions, does she recognize the
right of privacy, the premise upon which the original decision was
based?
  Professor Ross. She talks about a substantial burden, that the
substantial burden can not be placed on it.
  The CHAIRMAN. On what?
  Professor Ross. On the right to privacy. But as I said, as Mr.
Rauh just pointed a moment ago, the decision came down four-four,
just 2 days ago.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that was a different decision.
   Professor Ross. But you know, it is not
  The CHAIRMAN. It is very important, but a different decision.
   Professor Ross. Well, it is not just the central decision that is im-
portant.
   The CHAIRMAN. I am not saying that. Let me ask the question--I
acknowledge that each of these decisions is important. I am asking
you about the central decision, because when we discuss it here
and you use the phrase "Roe v. Wade," most Americans watching
this, any Senator reading the record, thinks of it initially in terms
of the central decision.
   All of these decisions are critically important. I am asking you
about the central decision.
   Professor Ross. Well, you see, I am not so sure I think there is a
valid distinction between central and the others, because the essen-
tial question that is being decided in each of those cases is what
                                                    454

women are going to have the right to exercise their right to an
abortion.

   And my concern is that cases that are viewed as not central are
in fact very central for the women affected by those decisions who
might lose their right to abortion.

   The CHAIRMAN. I think there is a semantic difference. Okay. Ob-
viously you are not anxious to answer the question. I can under-
stand why.

   Mr. Levi, I would like to ask you one--I said that was my last
question, but I want to ask you a question, if I may.

   Do you find any solace, or do you think it was just a little bit of
theater on the part of Judge Kennedy when he indicated that--
when I pressed him on the right to privacy, and he indicated that
the right to privacy may be in the state of evolution not unlike--
and he made a comparison.

   Do you read anything into that, or do you just think that was
just

   Mr. LEVI. I think that is an almost an attempt to read tea leaves,
or to extract a conclusion that is not necessarily there in the
record. I think that certain rights are so fundamental that we
shouldn't be talking about evolution; we snould be talking about
"they are there, and I support it."

   The CHAIRMAN. I happen to agree with you, but let me ask you
though--I am trying to get a sense of what--well, let me ask it an-
other way, then.

  Could a lower-court judge applying the existing Supreme Court
law have ruled differently in the case you referred to, that con-
cerns you about Judge Kennedy?

  Mr. LEVI. I think in several of the cases he could have ruled dif-
ferently, and particularly in the Civil Service cases, where he es-
sentially rejected the notion, essentially stated that he disagreed
with the notion that civil servants who are gay have a right to con-
stitutional protection?

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Would anyone else like to make a
closing comment?

  Mr. RAUH. NO, you have been very patient.
  Ms. YARD. Very patient. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. That is good as I am ever going to get. Thank
you very much. I appreciate it.
  Our next panel is comprised of four witnesses. Gordon D.
Schaber--Dean Schaber has been Dean of McGeorge Law School
since 1957. He was a presiding judge of the Sacramento County Su-
perior Court for several years in the 1960s, and has also been a
member of the California--I am not sure why that is relevant--
Democratic State Central Committee since 1974. That is nice to
know, but I am not sure what relevance it has.
   Mr. Leo Levin is the Leon Meltzer Professor of Law at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania Law School, where he has taught since
1949, and Ms. Wendy Collins Purdue is Associate Professor of Law
at Georgetown University Law Center, and clerked for Judge Ken-
nedy in 1978 and 1979.
   And Dean Susan Prager is Dean of the UCLA Law School, and in
1986 was President of the American Association of Law Schools.
                                      455
  We welcome you all here, particularly you, Dean Prager, for the
distance you had to travel to get here, and also you Dean Schaber.
It is a long way from California.
  At any rate, happy to have you all here. And with that, why
don't we begin in the order that you have been called?

STATEMENT OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF GORDON SCHABER,
  DEAN, McGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF THE PA-
  CIFIC; A. LEO LEVIN, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYL-
  VANIA LAW SCHOOL; WENDY COLLINS PERDUE, ASSOCIATE
  PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL; AND
  SUSAN WESTERBERG PRAGER, DEAN, UNIVERSITY OF CALI-
  FORNIA AT LOS ANGELES SCHOOL OF LAW

   Mr. SCHABER. Thank you, Senator and members of the commit-
tee.

   The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me. I almost forgot. I have to swear you,
if I may.

  Mr. SCHABER. Oh, that is right.
  The CHAIRMAN. All of you, if you please, rise.
  Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give is the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you,
God?

   Mr. SCHABER. I do.

   Mr. LEVIN. I do.

   Ms. PERDUE. I do.

   Ms. PRAGER. I do.

  Mr. SCHABER. I appear here today in my individual capacity to
support the nomination of Judge Kennedy, and I am doing so after
an opportunity to observe him first as a person, a member of a
community, as a practicing lawyer, as a law teacher, and judge of
the court of appeals.

  My personal vantage points were from the iact that I was a prac-
ticing lawyer for 12 years in the same building where he undertook
the private practice of law after his father passed away.

  I was the presiding judge of the Superior Courts of California in
Sacramento while he was in active practice. And I also appear as a
Dean--at the time, Dean of the McGeorge School of Law of the
University of the Pacific, who sought him out to teach law some 23
years ago.

  He has excelled in all of the tasks that I have mentioned. His
interest, you heard, in government and our court systems started
when it was found that in his elementary-school curriculum, he
simply couldn't be confined, because of his intellect and his energy.
And as Senator Wilson told you, at age 10 years he was already a
full-time page in the State Senate in California, and was following
his father around at trials in California.

  The legal education you have heard about at Harvard Law
School and his service in the large San Francisco law firm pre-
pared him very well for the service that he rendered as a private
practitioner in Sacramento.

  In that private practice, I was able to observe skills that were
tremendous in terms of the scope of legal subjects, in an era, of
course, when generalists were more common than they are today.

  He quickly became known in our community as a practiced trial
lawyer, a skillful and able one. He was very effective in the courts,
a joy for me to see and hear about.

  As Dean, I decided to seek him out for law teaching. I did that
because I was aware of his intelligence, observed an analytical
                                                  457

skill, knew that he had excellent professional values, and he had
superb ability at communication, which includes a great wit.

  And during the past 22 years of that teaching, the program at
our law school, McGeorge, and the lives and the capacities of his
students have been greatly enriched.

  Testimonials to his teaching abound. The record contains the sa-
lutes of his students, and they acknowledge his legal capacity, his
fine judicial temperament, and particularly his balanced judgments
on the issues that were considered in the classroom.

  I observed a willingness during his practice to include pro bono
service, and his devotion that was mentioned here by one of the
Senators to the Hispanic community in Sacramento by the hun-
dreds of hours that he provided in assistance to them for the local
project which united thousands in the socio-economic spectrum of
Mexican-Americans in Sacramento.

  I was present at the installation when he became an appellate
judge. He reached out and closed by quoting Holmes in saying that
law had been the business in which he had devoted his life, and
that he would show less than total devotion if he did not do all that
he had within him to improve it. I think that is an accurate reflec-
tion of his dedication.

  Now, while those in constitutional law are better equipped than I
am as a contracts professor, my readings of his opinions demon-
strate to me a further intellectual refinement. I think Professor
Tribe said it best today.

  He is probing in his investigation. He is thoughtful and straight-
forward. I think he will continue this devotion in an objective
manner. I think he will have compassion and empathy for all those
who present themselves. He will do that without personal predilec-
tion, without a specific philosophical inclination, with an aim at
consensus-building, by a close examination of the facts, consider-
ation of the issues on a case-by-case basis, and an abiding respect
for precedent.

  I think that as I listened to these 2 days of testimony of his, I
was reconfirmed in my observations. I urge a vote of confirmation.
If I have a moment, I think I can explain to Senator Heflin the
concern he raised this morning about a contingent fee case, should
you want that to be explored. I was the presiding judge and know
about that case.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

TESTIMONY OF DEAN GORDON D. SCHABER BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE
JUDICIARY, UNITED STATES SENATE, IN SUPPORT OF THE NOMINATION OF
ANTHONY M. KENNEDY, DECEMBER 15 AND 16, 1987.

MR. CHAIRMAN, AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE:

       I APPEAR HERE IN MY INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE
NOMINATION OF JUDGE ANTHONY KENNEDY.

        I DO SO AFTER HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO OBSERVE HIM AS A
PERSON, A MEMBER OF A COMMUNITY, A PRACTICING ATTORNEY, A LAW
TEACHER AND A JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEALS.

       MY VANTAGE POINTS HAVE BEEN AS A PRACTICING MEMBER OF THE BAR
FOR TWELVE YEARS IN THE SAME BUILDING WHERE HE UNDERTOOK PRIVATE
PRACTICE AFTER HIS FATHER PASSED AWAY, AS THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF
THE SUPERIOR COURTS OF CALIFORNIA IN SACRAMENTO WHILE HE WAS IN
ACTIVE PRACTICE, AND AS THE DEAN OF THE McGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW OF
THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC WHO SOUGHT HIM OUT TO UNDERTAKE THE
TEACHING OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW TWENTY-THREE YEARS AGO.
                       459

HE HAS EXCELLED IN EACH OF THE ENDEAVORS I MENTIONED:

1. HIS INTEREST IN OUR GOVERNMENT AND COURT SYSTEMS BEGAN WHEN

HIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM SIMPLY COULD NOT CONTAIN HIS

INTELLECT AND ENERGY. HE BECAME AN ALMOST FULL-TIME PAGE IN

THE STATE SENATE OF CALIFORNIA AT TEN YEARS OF AGE AND WAS

SOON FOLLOWING HIS TRIAL LAWYER FATHER AROUND THE STATE TO

OBSERVE COURT TRIALS.  HIS LEGAL EDUCATION, AS AN HONOR

GRADUATE AT THE HARVARD LAW SCHOOL, AND HIS SUBSEQUENT

SERVICE IN A LARGE SAN FRANCISCO LAW FIRM PREPARED HIM WELL

FOR THE SUCCESSFUL PRIVATE PRACTICE THAT FOLLOWED IN

SACRAMENTO.

2. IN THAT PRIVATE PRACTICE, HE DISPLAYED SKILLS OVER AN IMMENSE

SCOPE OF LEGAL SUBJECTS AND WAS KNOWN FOR TREMENDOUS CAPACITY

IN MANY FIELDS IN AN ERA WHEN GENERALISTS IN THE PRACTICE

WERE MORE COMMON THAN NOW. HE QUICKLY BECAME KNOWN AS A

SKILLED TRIAL LAWYER, AND HIS EFFECTIVE WORK IN THE COURTS

WAS A JOY FOR ME TO OBSERVE AND TO HEAR ABOUT.

3. AS DEAN, I SOUGHT HIM OUT TO UNDERTAKE LAW TEACHING. I DID

SO BECAUSE I WAS AWARE OF HIS INTELLIGENCE, ANALYTICAL SKILL,

AND THE INTENSITY AND DEVOTION HE BROUGHT. TO HIS WORK. HE

HAD EXCELLENT PROFESSIONAL VALUES AND A SUBPERB ABILITY AT

COMMUNICATION, WHICH INCLUDES A GREAT WIT. DURING THE PAST

TWENTY-TWO YEARS OF HIS TEACHING, HE HAS ENRICHED THE LEGAL
                                  460

        EDUCATION PROGRAM AT McGEORGE AND THE LIVES AND CAPACITIES OF
       HIS STUDENTS. TESTIMONIALS TO HIS TEACHING ABOUND. THE
       RECORD CONTAINS THE SALUTES OF HIS STUDENTS, WHO ACKNOWLEDGE
       HIS LEGAL CAPACITY, HIS FINE JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT AND HIS
       BALANCED JUDGMENTS ON THE ISSUES.
        I OBSERVED A WILLINGNESS TO INCLUDE PRO BONO COMMUNITY
       SERVICE IN HIS PRACTICE SUCH AS HIS DEVOTION TO ASSISTING THE
       HISPANIC COMMUNITY IN A LOCAL PROJECT WHICH UNITED THOUSANDS
        IN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SPECTRUM OF THE MEXICAN-AMERICAN
       COMMUNITY IN SACRAMENTO.
       AT HIS INSTALLATION AS AN APPLELLATE JUDGE, HE CLOSED HIS
REMARKS BY QUOTING HOLMES WHEN HE SAID, "LAW IS THE BUSINESS TO
WHICH I HAVE DEVOTED MY LIFE, AND I WOULD SHOW LESS THAN DEVOTION
IF I DID NOT DO ALL THAT LIES WITHIN ME TO IMPROVE IT." THAT IS
AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF HIS DEDICATION.
       WHILE THOSE WHO SPECIALIZE IN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ARE BETTER
EQUIPPED THAN THIS CONTRACTS PROFESSOR TO INTERPRET OR CORWENT
UPON HIS HUNDREDS OF OPINIONS, MY READING OF SOME OF THEM
DEMONSTRATES TO ME FURTHER EVIDENCE OF HIS INTELLECTUAL
REFINEMENT -- HOW HE IS PROBING IN HIS INVESTIGATION OF LEGAL
MATTERS, THOUGHTFUL AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. HE HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO
HIS ASSIGNED TASK ON THE COURT OF APPEALS. HE WILL CONTINUE
THAT DEVOTION IN AN OBJECTIVE MANNER, WITH COMPASSION AND WITH
                                 461

EMPATHY FOR THOSE WHO PRESENT THEMSELVES. HE WILL DO SO WITHOUT
PERSONAL PREDILECTIONS OR SPECIFIC PHILOSOPHICAL INCLINATIONS,
WITH AN AIM AT CONSENSUS BUILDING, BY CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE
FACTS, WITH CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS, AND
WITH AN ABIDING RESPECT FOR PRECEDENT.

        I URGE A VOTE OF CONFIRMATION.
                                                462

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Dean. Professor Levin?
  Mr. LEVIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commit-
tee. It is a privilege to appear before you. I have submitted a pre-
pared statement which may be included in the record. I will make
resolve
  The CHAIRMAN. It will be, in its entirety.
  Mr. LEVIN. Thank you. I will make these comments very brief.
  I came to know and to admire Judge Kennedy some 10 years ago.
From 1977 to 1987, I had the great privilege of serving as Director
of the Federal Judicial Center, and it was in that connection that I
came to know Judge Kennedy.
  Let me begin with more recent events. In March of this year,
Judge Kennedy was elected by the Judicial Conference of the
United States to be a member of the Board of the Center. By stat-
ute, only two judges of the United States Courts of Appeal serve on
the Board at any one time, and Judge Kennedy was one.
  By design, it is a very small Board. Including the Chief Justice
who presides, there are only eight members. There is great diversi-
ty among the members, but by tradition, they have all been of
truly superior quality, and Judge Kennedy was elected/selected in
that tradition.
  Shortly after his election to the Board, I visited him for an ex-
tended visit in his Sacramento chambers, and I recall then being
struck by and reporting back to my colleagues about his probing
questions and brilliant insights concerning both the Center and
broader questions of judicial administration.
  He has been most conscientious in the discharge of his duties. I
had the opportunity to observe him in connection with the selec-
tion of a new Director of the Center. That is Judge John C. God-
bold of Alabama, a former chief judge of the eleventh circuit and
the fifth circuit.
  Judge Kennedy demonstrated a very high standard of his notion
of his personal obligation to probe, to assure himself, to verify, and
so on. That is just one example.
  His reputation had preceded him. Over 10 years, I have observed
that he enjoys the esteem of his colleagues, and in one sense, it is
almost remarkable that it is all across the spectrum of judicial
thought. And it is also true in the academic community as well.
  Sometimes the law favors the hearsay of reputation evidence
even over that of one person's knowledge and opinion. In this case,
I suggest to you that, based both on reputation and personal expe-
rience and knowledge, I believe this nominee will make a truly
great Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
  Thank you.

                     My name is A. Leo Levin. I serve as Leon Meltzer
              Professor of Law at the University of Pennsylvania. I
              first joined the Penn Law School faculty in 1949 and I
              have taught at the University of Pennsylvania since that
              time except for relatively brief periods at other academic
              institutions and rather more extended law-related
              government service.

        My most recent government assignnment was as Director
of the Federal Judicial Center, a position I assumed in
1977 and held through July, 1987. It was in that capacity
that I came to know Judge Kennedy, probably about ten
years ago. Over the years, I have come to know him well
and, of no lesser significance, I have come to know the
high regard in which he is held by his colleagues in the
federal judicial system. I say of no lesser significance
but mindful that in some situations the law has preferred
the hearsay of reputation evidence to one individual's
opinion,- I should say of greater significance. Based on
that knowledge and reputation, I believe that Judge
Kennedy will prove himself to be an Associate Justice of
the highest quality. He has the intellect, the
integrity, the judicious temperament, and the experience
to warrant that assessment.

         In the spring of 1987 Judge Kennedy was elected to
the Board of the Federal Judicial Center by the Judicial
Conference of the United States. By statute, only two
judges of the United States Courts of Appeal serve on this
Board.
                                 465

                                        -3-

Of course his selection in itself testifies to his
reputation for there has been a long tradition of superior
quality among those chosen, even as there has been a
tradition of great diversity in background, philosophy and
style. In his service on the Board, Judge Kennedy was
most impressive. We visited for some hours in Sacramento
and we talked frequently thereafter. He was perceptive,
judicious and most conscientious, not only at meetings,
but in the preparation for his participation in important
decisions. He was, for example, involved in the selection
of the current Director of the Center and discharged his
function as a member of the Board in superior fashion.

         Judge Kennedy has been involved in the work of the
Committee on the Pacific Territories of the Judicial
Conference of the United States and we were in contact
in that connection. Again, he performed in stellar
fashion, exhibiting good judgment and wisdom.

         Attending Circuit Conferences of the Ninth
Circuit over an extended period, as was my obligation, I
became aware of the high regard in which Judge Kennedy is
held by his colleagues, including those who do not
necessarily share his judicial philosophy.
                                466

                                        -4-

         I recall with pleasure one occasion when I was
honored by being assigned to Judge Kennedy's table
at a special festivity during the course of a Ninth
Circuit Conference. At that time my wife and I had
the pleasure of coming to know Mary Kennedy better
as well.

         It is not irrelevant that a colleague in the
academic world, whose work as a professional in the
Ninth Circuit brought him in close and frequent contact
with Judge Kennedy, spoke of him then and thereafter in
terms of highest regard.

         Indeed, I can testify that whether I am talking to
a federal judge, to colleagues who can hardly be
characterized as conservative in outlook, to colleagues
who have taken the trouble to study Judge Kennedy's
opinions, or to students, the reaction to the nomination
has been most affirmative. Indeed, it ranges from
"pleased and satisfied", to "enthusiastic and delighted."

         I have had the distinct pleasure of conversation
with Judge Kennedy while he was wearing his academic
hat, to my great benefit. Again, he demonstrated himself
to be most impressive: thoughtful, insightful, and wise.

        Judge Kennedy's career brings to mind comments of the
late Albert Schweitzer who told a group of young people:

            I don't know what your destiny will be, but
            one thing I know: the only ones among you
            who will be really happy are those who have
            sought and found how to serve.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Professor. Professor Perdue?
   Ms. PERDUE. Mr. Chairman, members of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, my name is Wendy Collins Perdue. I am an associate
professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center.
   From the fall of 1978 to the fall of 1979, I served as a law clerk to
Judge Kennedy, and my testimony here today is based largely on
that experience.
   A law clerk has a unique opportunity to observe a judge in
action, and as a result of my clerking experience, I have the high-
est regard for Judge Kennedy's abilities as a judge and his fitness
to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. I believe he possesses all of
the attributes that would make him an outstanding Justice.
   He always prepared carefully and thoroughly. He examined
precedent and legal authorities in a disciplined and intellectually
honest way. He respected binding authority, but not without close
scrutiny of whether the holdings were truly on point.
   Contrary to comments that have been made today, I never knew
him to reach a conclusion first and then seek out or construe au-
thority to justify that preconceived result.
   He actively sought out the views of his clerks. He encouraged us
to speak honestly. When there was disagreement, he sincerely
sought to understand the source of that disagreement, was never
doctrinaire, always open-minded in his approach to cases.
   I believe Judge Kennedy profoundly appreciated the role of a
judge. He understood that cases are not mere intellectual exercises,
that they involve real people, and that they have real effects.
  At the same time, he viewed his role as a limited one of deciding
the controversy before him. If a case posed a difficult question of
judgement, he never shied away from making that judgement; how-
ever, he never used his opinions as a vehicle for expounding doc-
trine beyond that which was called for by a particular case.
   Two cases come to mind as illustrations of the Judge's approach.
The first is James v. Ball. The issue in that case was the constitu-
tionality of an Arizona statute providing that voting in elections
for directors of an agricultural and power district was limited to
landowners, with voting apportioned according to acreage.
   The voting scheme was challenged as a violation of the Equal
Protection Clause of the 14th amendment, and Judge Kennedy
upheld that challenge, finding the voting scheme unconstitutional.
   The opinion includes not only a careful examination of prior
precedent; it also includes a thorough and careful examination of
how the water district at issue operated, and that district's impact
on the lives of millions of people.
   The case was a close one, and Judge Kennedy was ultimately re-
versed, but by a sharply divided Supreme Court, with the four dis-
senters explicitly endorsing Judge Kennedy's opinion. Regardless of
one's views of the merits of that case, it is, I believe, a good illus-
tration of Judge Kennedy's careful but pragmatic approach.
   The second case is U.S. v. Penn. The case is instructive because it
demonstrates that although Judge Kennedy is quite accurately, I
believe, portrayed as a restrained and moderate jurist, he is pas-
sionate in his pursuit of justice.
   In this case, a police officer present at a residence pursuant to
search warrant, offered the defendant's five-year-old son a five-
                                         469

dollar bribe if the son would show the police where his mother had
hidden a cache of drugs. The child showed the police where the
drugs were hidden, and as a result, the child's mother was indicted.

  The ninth circuit sitting en bane held that the evidence obtained
through the use of the child should not be suppressed; Judge Ken-
nedy dissented.

  Observing that the parent-child union occupies a fundamental
place in our culture--and those were his words--he concluded as
follows:

  "I know for a certainty that none of my brothers sitting in this
case would neglect for an instant their duty to protect essential lib-
erties. I regret only that we the dissenters have been unable to con-
vince them that the case before us presents a question of this gravi-
ty.

  "I view the police practice here as both pernicious in itself and
dangerous as precedent. Indifference to personal liberty is but the
precursor of a state's hostility to it. That is why the judgement is
entered ove*- my emphatic dissent."

  Let me ccncli: J r a more personal note. I came to my clerkship
with Judge Kennedv s c e^^hat jaded after 3 years in law school
dissecting and crLtiqumg judicial opinions. I left that clerkship with
a much less < ynical view.

  In working with Judge Kennedy, I observed a man of integrity
who struggled with some truly difficult cases and attempted to
reach just resolutions consistent with precedent and our system of
government.

  He is, I believe, well qualified in every respect to sit on the
United States Supreme Court.

                      TESTIMONY OF
              WENDY COLLINS PERDUE
BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
             ON THE CONFIRMATION OF
           JUDGE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY
  TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
                                    471

        Mr. Chairman, Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, my
name is Wendy Collins Perdue. I am an Associate Professor of Law
at the Georgetown University Law Center. From the Fall of 1978
to the fall of 1979, I served as a law clerk to Judge Kennedy.
My testimony here today is based largely on that experience.

        A law clerk has a unique opportunity to observe a judge in
action. As a result of my clerking experience, I have the
highest regard for Judge Kennedy's abilities as a judge and his
fitness to serve on the United States Supreme Court. I believe
he possesses all of the attributes that would make him an
outstanding Justice.

        Judge Kennedy was always careful and thorough in his
preparation. He examined precedent and legal authorities in a
disciplined and intellectually honest way. As a court of appeals
judge, he respected binding authority but not without close
scrutiny of whether the holdings were truely on point. I never
knew him to reach a conclusion first then seek out or construe
authority simply to justify that preconceived result. I believe
Judge Kennedy viewed the very process of writing an opinion as an
on-going search for the right result and rationale. He actively
sought out the views of his clerks and encouraged us to speak
honestly. When there was a disagreement, he sincerely sought to
understand the source of that disagreement. He was never
doctrinaire and always open minded in his approach to cases.

         I beleive Judge Kennedy profoundly appreciated the role of a
judge. He understood that cases are not mere intellectual
                                     472

excercises. They involve real people and they have real effects.
At the same time, he viewed his role as a limited one of deciding
the controversy before him. If a case posed a difficult question
of judgment, he never shyed away from making that judgment.
However, he never used his opinions as a vehicle for expounding
doctrine beyond that which was called for by the particular case.

        Two cases come to mind as illustrations of the judge's
approach. The first is James v. Ball.1 The issue in that case
was the constitutionality of an Arizona statute providing that
voting in elections for directors of an agricultural improvement
and power district was limited to land owners, with votes
apportioned according to acreage. The voting scheme was
challenged as a violation of the equal protection clause of the
14th amendment and Judge Kennedy upheld that challenge, finding
the voting scheme unconstitutional. Judge Kennedy's opinion not
only includes a careful examination of prior precedent, it also
includes a thorough and careful examination of how the water
district at issue operated and that district's impact on the
lives of millions of people. The case was a close one; Judge
Kennedy was ultimately reversed, but by a sharply divided Supreme
Court, with the four dissenters explicitly endorsing Judge
Kennedy's opinion. Regardless of one's views of the merits of
that case, it is, I believe, a good illustration of Judge
Kennedy's careful, but pragmatic approach.

        The second case is United States v. Penn.2 The case is

         1 613 F.2d 180 (9t Cir. 1979), rev'd. 451 U.S. 355 (1981).
         2 647 F.2d 876 (9th Cir. 1980)(en bane).
                                    473

instructive because it demonstrates that although Judge Kennedy
is, quite accurately I believe, portrayed as a restrained and
moderate jurist, he is passionate in the pursuit of justice. In
this case, a police officer, present at a residence pusuant to a
search warrant, offered the defendant's five year old son a $5
bribe if the son would show the police where his mother had
hidden a cache of drugs. The child showed the police where the
drugs were hidden and as a result the child's mother was
indicted. The Ninth Circuit, sitting en bane, held that the
evidence obtained through this use of the child should not be
suppressed. Judge Kennedy dissented. Observing that the
parent-child union occupies a fundamental place in our culture,
he concluded his opinion as follows: "I know for a certainty
that none of my brothers sitting in this case would neglect for
an instant their duty to protect essential liberties; I regret
only that we the dissenters have been unable to convince them
that the case before us presents a question of this gravity....I
view the police practice here as both pernicous in itself and
dangerous as precedent. Indifference to personal liberty is but
the precursor of the state's hostitly to it. That is why the
judgment is entered over my emphatic dissent."3

         Let me conclude on a more personal note. I came to my
clerkship with Judge Kennedy somewhat jaded after three years in
law school dissecting and critiquing judicial opinions. I left
that clerkship with a much less cynical view. In working with

         3 Id., at 889.
                                     474

Judge Kennedy, I observed a man of integrity, who struggled with
some truely difficult cases and attempted to reach just
resolutions consistent with precedent and our system of
government. He is, I believe, well qualified in every respect to
sit on the United States Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Thank you, Dean.
  Ms. PRAGER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  In these brief comments, I want to make clear that while I am
the dean of the UCLA Law School, I am not here in my capacity as
dean, nor as a representative of UCLA or the University of Califor-
nia.
  As some of you know, I was a member of the informal advisory
committee that Senator Biden formed this summer to advise him
on the President's nomination.
  That experience caused me to think deeply about the role of the
Senate in the confirmation process, and about the qualities that I
believe we should value most highly in a Justice of the Supreme
Court.
  I am here today urging the Senate to consent to this nomination,
because I believe that Anthony Kennedy will approach each issue
that comes before him freshly and fairly.
  I see him as a person who will listen, who has the capacity to be
compassionate, and who recognizes that his decisions affect people,
not pieces of paper, or theories, or principles.
  While Judge Kennedy has demonstrated himself to be cautious
about extending the law, I believe that his openness and his sense
of the special role of the Supreme Court with respect to such things
as individual rights, including privacy, and of the values protected
by the first amendment, will lead him to serious, deep reflection,
and at times to fresh conclusions.
  In his warm and anti-hierarchical way, Judge and Professor Ken-
nedy has set high standards for those around him, by communicat-
ing his own love of his work and the study of the law.
  While I have known his reputation in Sacramento for many
years, having myself been raised there and having worked for the
California legislature, I first came to know Kennedy personally
through his effort to attract outstanding law clerks to his chambers
immediately after his appointment to the ninth circuit in 1975.
Kennedy proved himself to be broadly interested in finding the
best possible people. He clearly was not applying political tests to
individual candidates in making his choices. He sought intellectual
balance in the aggregate in his clerks. And he freely hired women
and men.

  I want to make clear that I would not be here today if I felt that
Tony Kennedy would become a Justice unsympathetic to the need
to continue to address racial and gender based discrimination in
this society. I believe that Kennedy will strive to be sensitive to dis-
crimination in these, and, I hope, other areas as well.

   I do want to take a moment to speak to the private clubs issue.
Certainly I wish that Kennedy's reflections with respect to private
clubs had evolved more rapidly and with an appreciation that this
form of discrimination is indeed invidious. Nevertheless, I see in
Anthony Kennedy's actions a significant understanding of the issue
and its societal importance.

   The unfortunate reality is that a number of powerful men in this
society, men from the full spectrum of political viewpoints, have
chosen not to put themselves on the line on this issue, and have
continued their membership in these discriminatory institutions
                                                  476

which pride themselves on excluding whole classes of people.
Knowing Sacramento as I do, I place a great deal of positive weight
on Kennedy's 1980 decision to leave the Sutter Club.

  Because Anthony Kennedy is both open to discussion and open
minded, I am sure that the concerns expressed during these hear-
ings will be taken in by him and reflected on over a long period of
years.

  To be able to consent to the nomination of a person who is genu-
inely open, who loves the study of law but also has a real world
sense of the impact of the law on individual people, and who is
deeply concerned about fairness, suggests that the Senate and this
committee has exercised the Senate's constitutional role in a posi-
tive, highly significant way.

  In part, because I started my career working for the then minori-
ty whip of this body, about 23 years ago, I particularly appreciate
this opportunity to appear before you, and to urge you to consent
to the President's nomination of Anthony Kennedy.

                                  December 16, 1987

Senator Biden and Members of the Committee, as I begin these
brief comments I want to make clear that while I am the Dean of
the UCLA School of Law, I am not here in my capacity as Dean nor
as a representative of UCLA or the University of California.

As some of you know, I was a member of the informal advisory
committee formed by the Chair of this Committee this past summer
to advise him on the President's nomination. That experience
caused me to think deeply about both the Senate's role in the
confirmation process and the qualities that I believe we should

I want to make clear that I would not be here today if I felt

continue to address racial and gender-based discrimination in
this society. I believe that Kennedy will strive to be sensitive
to discrimination. Certainly, I wish that his reflections with

I very much appreciate this opportunity to appear before you to

  The CHAIRMAN. Thanks. Dean, who was that?
  Ms. PRAGER. Thomas Kuckel.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU all have known Judge Kennedy for some-
where between 8 and I guess 30 years.
  Can any of you shed any light on how Judge Kennedy felt about
the major decisions of the time as they came down, whether it was
in the early 1970s, in the Roe case, or in any other case.
  Can any of you shed any light on how he thought or spoke of or
reacted to any of those cases?
  Mr. SCHABER. I am sitting here trying to think of that, Senator.
Because those cases, of course, were discussed with his students.
  And I think that he always played the role of both sides of the
issue. And I do not recall particular conversations in which he ex-
pressed his approval or disapproval.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Perdue, you clerked for the Judge. You hear
some fairly straightforward and tough testimony about Judge Ken-
nedy as it relates to gender discrimination.
  Tell us what you--you made a concluding comment, not much
more than a sentence about it. Tell me, if you will, your experience
with Judge Kennedy how did he feel about the insensitivity shown
by many to women?

  And did he demonstrate any insensitivity or discrimination
against women in either his decisions or his utterances or his ac-
tions toward you or anyone else?

  Ms. PERDUE. During the period that I clerked for him, as far as I
can recollect, there were not any cases pending before him involv-
ing gender discrimination.

  And so it did not come up as an issue before him.
  With respect to the private clubs issue, it was something I was
completely unaware of. It was not enough a part of his life that it
was apparent to a clerk. And I was frankly surprised.
  My experiences, I can only respond to the question as to how did
he act. How did he conduct himself? My coclerk was a male. We
were treated as colleagues.

  That in itself, incidentally, I found somewhat surprising, given at
that point my youth and inexperience, that a judge of the court of
appeals would treat his clerks with the level of respect that he did,
and accord our ideas with the level of respect that he did.

  But there was never any indication that I saw that he viewed--
that he had gender bias. He simply treated us as equals. He sought
out our views. He distributed the work equally.

  And it simply did not seem to be a part of his life to treat people
differently.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Prager, is it your testimony then that you do
not believe that Judge Kennedy would jeopardize the progress that
has been made in reviewing gender discrimination under the equal
protection clause? Or that he might--do you have doubts about
how he would treat gender discrimination cases under the equal
protection clause?

  Ms. PRAGER. I have some concern that runs beyond those cases,
and that comes out of the voting rights case as well, that Judge
Kennedy thus far, I think, places a lot of emphasis on the motives
that relate to the discrimination.
                                         480

   And I think in that sense he is not at this point as appreciative
as I might like him to be about the subtleties of discrimination in
this culture, whether it relates to women or minorities or gays.

   But I do think that he is a person who has a deep respect for the
advancement of the law thus far in these areas, and I do not think
we are going to see any backtracking on where we are.

  Now that is a very subjective impression on my part.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, that is what I asked you. I understand
that. And I realize that none of us know what another person is
going to do.
  Ms. PRAGER. And this is where I think I come back in my own
thinking about this to his qualities of studiousness and deep inter-
est in the law and genuine, I think, openness.
  This is a person who I think is going to keep thinking oyer time,
and reevaluating. And what I came down to in these last 7 months
is that that was the quality that I was looking for the most.

  Mr. SCHABER. Senator Biden?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes, Dean.
  Mr. SCHABER. Might I just add that on December the 3rd of 1987,
the Sacramento Bee, certainly a liberal newspaper, stated in an
editorial concerning this exact matter the fact that Kennedy's ac-
tions in the matter of clubs, and his articulate explanation of the
performance by him, reflect, "in our opinion, not dogged chauvin-
ism, but a conscientious attempt to become sensitive to an issue
that has recently overtaken a great many people of his age and
background.

  "On that score, Kennedy is precisely the kind of person the coun-
try needs if things are really going to change, both in the commu-
nity and in the court. "

  I personally feel that is the case. I think his sensitivity has obvi-
ously increased in the time when, as a matter of fact, it is increas-
ing quite appropriately in the minds and the hearts of many of us.

  The CHAIRMAN. Would it be fair to say that Judge Kennedy was
considered part of the establishment in Sacramento?

  Mr. SCHABER. I suppose if the establishment consists of
  The CHAIRMAN. The most important people in the community;
the ones with the most money and power.
  Ms. PRAGER. That is an easy yes, right, Gordon?
  Mr. SCHABER. A, I would say that the answer is, A, the money,
no, and the power, no. Coming from a long and distinguished
family and having a mother who was known as the Sacramentoan
of the year and who was engaged in every kind of social and other
good that one could think of, to that extent he was well known; but
not the power structure.

  The CHAIRMAN. Senator?
  Senator HEFLIN. He was a Republican, wasn't he?
  Mr. SCHABER. Yes, sir. But that is a difference between some of
us.
  Senator HEFLIN. I appreciate each of you being here. I appreciate
your testimony. It is nice to see my old friend Professor Levin. I
think he has a record of having appeared before the Judiciary
Committee more than any individual. We have seen him many,
many times. We appreciate it.
                                         481

  Judge Schaber, you mentioned the matter pertaining to the di-
vorce case and the contingent fee. As I tried to make it abundantly
clear, there is no rule or anything there that was a violation. And I
do not mean to imply anything.

  But it is, and perhaps maybe not coming from a community
property State, but it does raise some issue, I think, in a person's
mind, that community property State, that cases are taken on a
contingent fee basis.

  And tell us, if you would, since you said you have handled that,
if you would like to respond to that particular aspect of it.

  Mr. SCHABER. Even at that time it was an unusual activity. How-
ever, the case itself, as I understand it, was the case of another
lawyer.

  And as I mentioned, Judge Kennedy became a skilled trial prac-
titioner. The other lawyer associated Judge Kennedy in order that
Judge Kennedy would do the major trial work.

  Therefore, as I understand it, the fee arrangements that normal-
ly had been made originally with the original engaging lawyer, and
then with the firm in which Judge Kennedy was, of course, a part-
ner.

  At that time, as you said this morning, there was no rule even
suggested--American Bar rule of professional responsibility that
applied; and there was none in California.

  The case involved a situation in which, as I recall, there was a
very, very rich man who claimed that his wife had not one cent
coming as a result of a divorce by virtue of various pieces of con-
duct which allegedly created all of the property to be separate.

  And I assume that the original lawyer at that time--it was not
uncommon but not necessarily done in every case--took this kind
of a settlement fee.

  The case went on for many years, as your records will show. It
was very successfully done. And the woman involved obtained a
very fair settlement. And fair settlement, far beyond the contin-
gent fee.

  That is not to justify it. We do not--none of us approve of that
any more. It is not done any more. But to set the circumstances,
that is about the way the case developed.

  Senator HEFLIN. In other words, he was not the contracting
lawyer.

   Mr. SCHABER. NO.

  Senator HEFLIN. The contract had been entered into before he
became associated with it? Well that is good.

  Mr. SCHABER. He became a part of the contract, of course.
  Senator HEFLIN. I am glad you clarified that, that is good.
  Professor Levin, you dealt with him. And in some of the readings
about Judge Kennedy, he was highly praised for instituting in the
ninth circuit a staff attorney system that worked quite well there.
  There are so many questions that we would have liked to have
asked, but time is precious to us, again, due to the fact that we are
trying to finish this before we leave for the Christmas holidays.
And the other thing is, time on the floor.
  Would you comment largely on that? Because I am, as you know,
interested in the administration of justice. And I think in the
                                         482

scheme of things, the members of the Supreme Court play a vital
role in trying to improve the administration of justice.

   I gather you are familiar with that?
  Mr. LEVIN. Thank you, Senator, for that opportunity. And you
understate it tremendously when you say you are interested in the
administration of justice. I think it is well known that you are one
of the major contributors in this half century in the State area.
  I am familiar with that particular project. I happen to have
known and know fairly well the first staff attorney. And he worked
directly under Judge Kennedy, and had only the highest praise for
Judge Kennedy's abilities, interest, careful supervision.
  He is clearly one who is not only concerned with judicial admin-
istration, effective delivery of justice, but is creative about it, and
has a pragmatic touch as well.
  So you have got both the intellectual side and the pragmatic
side.
  And I will say that project has worked very well. It in some vari-
ations has been exported to other circuits. And I think that is one
thing of which Judge Kennedy can be very proud.
  I will say that there are other areas involving judicial adminis-
tration. The pacemaker case is one in which Judge Kennedy has
written. That involved the power of magistrates.
  And it showed a tremendous sensitivity, not so much in the hold-
ing--it was an en bane--but in the notion--it was a problem of the
authority of a magistrate to preside over a civil trial by consent of
the parties.
  And one of the things--we read the opinion recently, and such a
marvelous sensitivity--he said, here there is consent. We are not
prepared to decide the case where the consent is a result of undue
delay in the system.
  We do not need to reach that. But raising that is a problem.
  I thought it showed very nice sensitivity in that area as well.
  Senator HEFLIN. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  I appreciate your testimony. I apologize, we were doing a little
committee business there. And as I said, particularly those of you
who came from California, and those of you who walked up the
street from Georgetown, and those who came--would you do me a
favor, Professor Levin. You are at the University of Pennsylvania
Law School. My son is at the undergraduate school. His exams
start on Thursday. Would you check on him when you go back to
school.
  Mr. LEVIN. We in the faculty, Mr. Chairman, are happy when
the students are not checking on us. But I am sure he is doing very
well.
  Mr. SCHABER. Senator, before you dismiss this panel, may I, on
behalf of the La Raza Law Students Association, offer for the
record this letter of resolution on their part, which they asked me
to bring.
  The CHAIRMAN. Surely.
  Mr. SCHABER. It is, in effect, stating that they having had the
firsthand knowledge indicate that because of his integrity and sen-
sitivity to the minorities on the campus and in his class, "we, at a
regularly scheduled meeting, unanimously voted to recommend to
                                         483

you, the committee, Judge Kennedy for the United States Supreme
Court."

  The CHAIRMAN. IS that a standing organization on the campus?

   Mr. SCHABER. Yes, it is.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. It will be entered into the
record.

  Mr. SCHABER. Thank you.

      Dear Senator Biden:

              Subject: Anthony Kennedy, Supreme Court Justice Nominee

      The La Raza Law Students Association is an Hispanic organization that is
     dedicated to social and related Hispanic issues. Very rarely do we, as
     aspiring law students, take valuable time from our studies to take what are
      many times viewed as political positions. However, the importance of the
      issue dictates that we express ourselves as an Hispanic organization
     regarding the merits of recommending Judge Anthony Kennedy to the U. S.
      Supreme Court.

      We, as his students and future lawyers and leaders of our various communi-
      ties, have first-hand knowledge of Judge Kennedy himself and his conduct on
      our campus. Because of his integrity and sensitivity to the minorities on
      campus and in class, we, at a regularly-scheduled meeting of our organiza-
      tion, unanimously voted to recommend Judge Kennedy to the United States
      Supreme Court.

      We hope that you weigh our collective first-hand experiences in our
      relationships against those (if any) in opposition, who many times do not
      represent the best interests of Hispanics in the community.

      Thank you for your diligent work in the confirmation process and for the
      consideration you give our recommendation.

      Very sincerely yours,

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you all very much. And, Dean Prager,
thank you for having been of assistance to me and this committee
for sometime. Thank you all.

  Mr. PRAGER. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. The next panel is composed of five distinguished
witnesses. The first is Mr. Michael Martinez, who is the national
president of the Hispanic Bar Association. Second is Ms. Audrey
Feinberg. Ms. Feinberg is a consultant for The Nation Institute,
which has submitted a lengthy report, and a good report, analyzing
Judge Kennedy's record. And third is Ms. Hernandez, who is presi-
dent and general counsel of the Mexican-American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund. Fourth is Mr. Henry Scott Wallace, who is
the legislative director of the National Association of Criminal De-
fense Lawyers. And I believe we have added a fifth.
  Our fifth panelist, if she is here, is Ms. Kristina Kiehl, the chair-
person of Voters for Choice. She is not here. Maybe I am mistaken
on that.
  Well, why don't you all stand to be sworn?
  Do you swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?
  [The panel responded in the affirmative.]
  The CHAIRMAN. Why don't we begin with you first, Mr. Martinez.
And, welcome. Good to see you again and delighted you are here.

TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL MARTINEZ, NATIONAL PRESIDENT,
  HISPANIC NATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION; AUDREY FEINBERG,
  CONSULTANT, THE NATION INSTITUTE; ANTONIA HERNANDEZ,
  PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL, MEXICAN-AMERICAN
  LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND; HENRY SCOTT

  CHAIR, VOTERS FOR CHOICE

  Mr. MARTINEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am happy to be here
today.

  I am president of the National Hispanic Bar Association, and in
the 15-year history of our association's existence this is the first
time we have presented oral testimony on a U.S. Supreme Court
nominee.

  Our purpose in being represented at the confirmation hearings of
Judge Kennedy are twofold. We wish to discuss our evaluation of
his qualifications to sit on the highest court of the land, and we
wish to constructively discuss Judge Kennedy's legal opinions
which we believe shed light on his philosophy and understanding of
the Hispanic community. We have not and do not consider whether
we agree or disagree with a particular opinion of Judge Kennedy's
or with his judicial philosophy. We simply evaluate as our brethren
in the ABA do. We are a bar association. And we evaluate based on
qualification and not, hopefully, subjective criteria.

  Our judiciary committee, as well as our board of governors, has
worked diligently to review Judge Kennedy's opinions. The board
evaluated (1) his analytical skills, (2) his ability to communicate his
ideas in an understandable fashion, (3) his sensitivity to diverse
communities in our country, and (4) his judicial philosophy.

  Based upon our review of his decisions and writings we have
come to the following conclusions and observations. In general,
there is no doubt that Judge Kennedy has the intellectual capacity
to be a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. His analytical skills are docu-
mented throughout his distinguished career. He has the ability to
communicate in a clear and concise manner. He also understands
the laws which have come before him. It is clear that experience
and hard work have made Judge Kennedy a credit to our legal pro-
fession.

  A review of his opinions also sheds light on his personal judicial
philosophy and view of our social institutions. These opinions re-
flect a person that in some instances gives deference to institutions
over individuals. A man who believes that individuals should bring
their own actions rather than allow non-injured third parties to
vindicate the rights of others.

  Since our interest and concerns are much broader than civil
rights, we do not seek to label Judge Kennedy as pro or con civil
rights or minority or Hispanic interests. Instead, we seek to evalu-
ate him on neutral criteria which gives us an indication of the
overall quality of a Supreme Court Justice. However, cases involv-
ing civil rights or brought by or on behalf of minorities are of par-
ticular interest to our association, and in this case they disclose
Judge Kennedy's lack of a clear understanding of some of the prob-
lems faced by us in the Hispanic community.
                                                  487

  For instance, in the TOPIC v. Circle Realty case, decided in 1976,
Judge Kennedy held that only direct victims of discriminatory
housing practices had a cause of action. His reasoning in this case
is plausible, but only if one viewed the 1968 Fair Housing Act in a
vacuum. As this panel knows, that decision was overruled by the
U.S. Supreme Court because, in fact, the Fair Housing Act was not
intended to be interpreted in a vacuum.

  In Aranda v. Van Sickle, decided in 1979, Judge Kennedy again
turned to a very narrow interpretation of the law. Although ac-
knowledging impediments to Hispanics voting in municipal elec-
tions, he ultimately ruled in favor of the municipality, while at the
same time leaving the door open in the event of some future viola-
tions of law.

  In Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, decided in
1979, Judge Kennedy concurred in a decision terminating jurisdic-
tion of the court over a school system previously ordered to correct
racial segregation practices. Once again Judge Kennedy based his
opinion upon a narrow interpretation of the law and gave defer-
ence to the school administration's good faith efforts. As in
Aranda, the judge left the door open for future action if the alleged
discriminatory practices were not remedied. This is not a practical
solution because it is costly, time consuming, and in the case of
many Hispanics it is simply not available to them to return to the
courthouse.

  The above cases make a statement about Judge Kennedy. He be-
lieves in our system of government and perhaps gives undue defer-
ence to institutions. Hispanics more often than not also give defer-
ence to our institutions; however, Hispanics do not have the mone-
tary or educational attainment to be able to singlehandedly vindi-
cate their rights or even to often recognize when their rights have
been violated. Sometimes Hispanics must look to public interest or-
ganizations for assistance in vindicating their rights, as occurred in
the TOPIC case.

   Sometimes discrimination is not overt, as in the Aranda case.
Sometimes discrimination is subtle, but can and must be remedied.
Simply leaving the door open for a return visit to the court as
Judge Kennedy has done in his opinions is not a very practical so-
lution for the pressing needs, the immediate pressing needs of the
Hispanic community.

   Although we only have time to discuss a few cases, they are in-
structive in that they demonstrate that Judge Kennedy is cogni-
zant of the discrimination faced by many in our society. Many of
the problems faced by Hispanics cannot be solved by blind and un-
questioning faith in the system. Judge Kennedy should understand
that those that are most affected by systemic failures are the least
able to vindicate their rights.

   Based on the standards previously enunciated, we know Judge
Kennedy is qualified to be a Supreme Court Justice. His analytical
skills, his ability to communicate, and his judicial philosophy speak
highly of his professionalism and legal abilities. Our association un-
derstands that no nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court comes to
this Senate Judiciary Committee with a clean slate. However, we
urge him to become more familiar with our Hispanic community.
We have every confidence that Judge Kennedy will serve with dis-
                                      488
tinction as our U.S. Supreme Court Justice, and our association is
prepared to assist him whenever possible.

  I wish to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and the other members of
the Senate Judiciary Committee for the opportunity to express the
views of our association on such an important nomination, and I
look forward to appearing before you in the very near future to
comment on the nomination of a Hispanic for a Justice of the U.S.
Supreme Court.

  Thank you.

               Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I am Michael Martinez,
President of the Hispanic Bar Association. In the 15 year
history of the Hispanic National Bar Association (HNBA) this
is the first time we have presented oral testimony on a U.S.
Supreme Court nominee. The Hispanic Bar greatly appreciates
this opportunity to testify, and we are cognizant of the
duty to express our frank concerns.

               The goals of the HNBA include fostering respect for
the law, advancing the development of Hispanic attorneys and
supporting changes within our system of justice which better
the lives of Hispanics and the United States in general. To
accomplish these goals the Hispanic National Bar Association
works closely with the American Bar Association through its
representative delegate to the ABA House of Delegates. The
HNBA also works closely with all segments of the legal
profession to encourage and support understanding of the
problems faced by our members and the Hispanic community in
general in pursuing equal justice under the law. Hispanics,
as you know, are underrepresented in the halls of Congress
as well as in the courts. This status is not acceptable to
the HNBA membership, to our clients, or to our Hispanic
constituency.

               Our purpose in being represented at the confirmation
hearings of Judge Kennedy are twofold. We wish to discuss
our evaluation of his qualifications to sit on the highest
court of the land and we wish to constructively discuss Judgc
Kennedy's legal opinions which we believe shed light on his
                                    491

philosophy and understanding of the Hispanic community. We
have not and do not consider whether we agree or disagree
with a particular opinion of Judge Kennedy or with his
judicial philosophy. We simply evaluate, as our brethren in
the ABA do, based upon qualification and not subjective
criteria. Our Judiciary Committee and our Board of Governors
has worked diligently to review Judge Kennedy's opinions.
The Board evaluated his (1) analytical skills, (2) ability to
communicate his ideas in an understandable fashion,
(3) sensitivity to diverse communities, and (4) judicial
philosophy. Based upon our review of his voluminous
decisions and writings we have come to the following
conclusions and observations.

              In general, there is no doubt that Judge Kennedy has
the intellectual capacity to be a Supreme Court Justice. His
analytical skills are documented throughout his distinguished
career. He has the ability to communicate in a clear and
concise manner. He also understands the laws which have come
before him. It is clear that experience and hard work have
made Judge Kennedy a credit to our profession.

              A review of his opinions also sheds light on his
personal judicial philosophy and view of our social
institutions. These opinions reflect a person that in some
instances gives deference to institutions over individuals, a
man who believes that individuals should bring their own

actions rather than allow non-injured third parties to
vindicate the rights of others.

             Since the HNBA's interests and concerns are much
broader than civil rights, we do not seek to label Judge
Kennedy as "pro" or "con" civil rights or minority interests.
We seek to evaluate him on neutral criteria which gives us an
indication of the quality of U.S. Supreme Court Justice he
will be. However, cases involving civil rights violations or
brought by, or on behalf of, minorities are of particular
interest to the HNBA and in this case disclose Judge
Kennedy's lack of clear understanding of some problems faced
by the Hispanic community.

             For instance, in the Topic v. Circle Realty case,
decided in 1976, Judge Kennedy held that only direct victims
of discriminatory housing practices had a cause of action.
His reasoning in Topic is plausible only if one views the
1968 Fair Housing Act in a vacuum. As this panel knows,
however, that decision by Judge Kennedy was overruled by the
U.S. Supreme Court because, in fact, the Fair Housing Act was
not intended to be interpreted in a vacuum.

              In Aranda v. Van Sickle, decided in 1979, Judge
Kennedy again turned to a narrow interpretation of the law.
Although acknowledging impediments to Hispanics' voting in
municipal elections, he ultimately ruled in favor of the
municipality, while at the same time only leaving the door
slightly open in the event of some violations of law.

             Although we only have time to discuss a few cases,
they are instructive in that they demonstrate that Judge
Kennedy is cognizant of the discrimination faced by many in
our society. Many of the problems faced by Hispanics cannot
be solved by blind and unquestioning faith in the system.
Judge Kennedy should understand that those that are most
affected by systematic failures are the least able to
vindicate their rights.

             Based on the standards previously enunciated, we know
Judge Kennedy is "Qualified" to be a Supreme Court Justice.
His analytical skills, his ability to communicate and his
judicial philosophy speak highly of his professionalism and
legal abilities. HNBA understands that no nominee for the
U.S. Supreme Court comes to the U.S. Senate Judiciary with a
clean slate. However, we urge him to become more familiar
with our Hispanic community. We have every confidence that
Judge Kennedy will serve with distinction as our United
States Supreme Court Justice, and the HNBA is prepared to
assist him whenever possible.

             We wish to thank the Chairman of the United States
Senate Judiciary Committee and all the members of the
Committee for the opportunity to express our views on such an
important nomination. We look forward to appearing before
you in the near future to comment on the nomination of a
Hispanic for Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States.

  The CHAIRMAN. I am looking forward to that day, also.
  Let me suggest, as I understand there is a scheduling problem
for two members of the panel. I am advised this is important
enough that they would stay and miss their planes, and they have
indicated they are willing to do that. But I would like, if the rest of
the panel would agree, to go Ms. Hernandez next, because I under-
stand both of you have a 6 o'clock airplane--is that correct? And I
see no reason, if you all don't mind, why we shouldn't go to you
next. Then what I might do is ask you questions first, also, to give
you an opportunity because I would not count on the traffic here,
your making the plane, if we wait till the end of the panel.

   But, please. And I thank the rest of the panel for their indul-
gence.

   Ms. HERNANDEZ. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Antonia
Hernandez, and I am the president and general counsel of the
Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund. I thank you and the mem-
bers of the committee for giving me the opportunity to testify on
behalf of MALDEF on the nomination of Judge Anthony Kennedy
to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States.

  I am here to express concerns, and our concerns are real and
they are indeed serious. They stem from such facts as Judge Ken-
nedy's membership in private clubs that had not admitted into
membership Hispanics, other minorities and women; and they are
based on the fact that although he has employed 35 law clerks,
Judge Kennedy has never found himself able to employ an Hispan-
ic or a black.

  My grave concerns, however, are primarily based on several of
Judge Kennedy's judicial decisions on civil and constitutional
rights in which he denied access to the courts to minorities, in
which he denied the right to a trial to minorities, and in which he
ruled against minorities by disregarding settled rules governing the
scope of appellate review.

   I have submitted an extensive written record. Today, in my oral
statement I will address, primarily, two matters: first, the histori-
cal importance of the Supreme Court to vindicating the rights of
Hispanics; and, secondly, Judge Kennedy's involvement in several
judicial opinions, particularly in the Aranda v. Van Sickle decision
that MALDEF litigated.

   The history of discrimination against Hispanics in this country,
particularly in the Southwest and particularly from the mid-19th
century to date, has been not unlike that suffered by blacks. We
Hispanics have been subjected to segregation in schools, in restau-
rants, and in hotels. We have been denied employment and often
treated badly when employed. We have been denied the opportuni-
ty to serve on juries, and we have been denied the most fundamen-
tal of rights, the right to vote.

   Our fight to restore our basic civil rights has not been an easy
one; and, in fact, it has required MALDEF and other attorneys to
file and litigate hundreds of lawsuits, and a number of our lawsuits
have ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court. A prime example is the
voting rights case of White v. Regester, where a unanimous Su-
preme Court struck down Texas' imposition of a multi-member leg-
                                         496

islative district in Bexar County, a heavily Hispanic county where
San Antonio is located.

   Based on such facts and the reality that only five Hispanics in
nearly 100 years had ever been elected to the Texas legislative
body from Bexar County, the Supreme Court upheld our claim that
the multi-member district diluted the vote of Hispanics in violation
of the 14th amendment, and the Court thus affirmed the redrawing
of the single-member districts. And, as you all know, as a conse-
quence of that, we have a dynamic young Hispanic mayor, Henry
Cisneros, and the majority of the city council is minority--five His-
panics, one black. And I have other examples of the consequences
of our litigation in that area.

  The CHAIRMAN. He may be your first Hispanic President.
  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Probably so, and I look forward to that day.
  In Doe v. Plyler we challenged Texas' denial of a public school
education to undocumented Hispanic children. These children were
Texas residents, most of whom would eventually become legal resi-
dents, but who, without an education would become a permanent
underclass. The Supreme Court in this case agreed that Texas'
policy was unconstitutionally discriminatory in violation of the
14th amendment. But the Court reached this decision through a
bare 5-4 majority, with Justice Powell joining the majority. With
Justice Powell no longer on the Supreme Court and with the future
of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance, we are indeed con-
cerned about his possible replacement. I am particularly concerned
about the fairness of the person nominated to succeed Justice
Powell, and it is for that reason that we consider this particular
vacancy of serious importance.

  In several cases Judge Kennedy's opinions reflect not only a devi-
ation from precedent, but also unfairness, and even a serious insen-
sitivity to the rights of minorities. The point of my grave concern
about these adverse opinions is not just that he ruled against civil
rights plaintiffs in cases that I firmly believe could have been and
should have been ruled upon differently, but rather my serious
concern arises primarily from the manner in which he reached his
results adverse to civil rights.

  Aranda v. Van Sickle is a case in point. Aranda is a vote dilution
case similar to the Supreme Court case of White v. Regester, and I
might say almost identical. But Judge Kennedy reached a result
different from that reached by the unanimous Supreme Court.

  The Hispanic plaintiffs in Aranda challenged the at-large elec-
tion used by the city of San Fernando, California. As of the early
1970's, the population of San Fernando had grown to become
almost 50 percent Hispanics. Twenty-nine percent were registered
voters, and yet only three Hispanics had ever been elected at large
since the city had incorporated in 1911 to the five-member city
council.

  The plaintiffs also alleged that there was a history of discrimina-
tion against Hispanics, and that the political process was not equal-
ly open to Hispanics. For example, more than half of the polling
places had been ordinarily located in homes of Anglos outside of
the barrio community and, as you know, it is extremely difficult
for minority members to go to a different hostile neighborhood to
cast a vote.
                                         497

  Despite these allegations the district court summarily dismissed
the case, thereby denying the plaintiffs their day in court to prove
their case at trial. The ninth circuit affirmed the summary dismis-
sal in a majority opinion which set forth few of the facts, which
contained little legal analysis, and which primarily adopted the dis-
trict court findings. And I must emphasize that what was of par-
ticular interest in this case is that Judge Kennedy filed a concur-
ring opinion in which he filled in the facts and provided the prece-
dential analysis missing from the majority opinion.

  This concurring opinion is remarkable in at least two respects.
First, Judge Kennedy never discussed the Supreme Court's strin-
gent legal principle disfavoring summary dismissals. Judge Kenne-
dy accordingly circumvented established Supreme Court precedent
possibly so as to reach the results he desired. Secondly, Judge Ken-
nedy itemized the plaintiffs' many factual allegations and then con-
cluded that such plaintiffs could never win, and I quote:

  "Assuming that plaintiffs' factual allegations are true, when
taken together, they would not permit a reasonable person to infer
that the at-large system for electing the mayor and city council
members is maintained because of an invidious intent."

  Since the fact patterns underlying most at-large elections in Cali-
fornia and in other States within the ninth circuit were no more
egregious than the facts alleged by the Hispanic plaintiffs in this
case, Judge Kennedy's basic conclusion effectively ended constitu-
tional challenges to at large elections within the ninth circuit. And
so, to us, it was not so much the reversal but the logic and the
processes used. And as a consequence of that, you have seen from
many of his decisions the preclusion of challenges to at-large elec-
tion systems in the State of California and in the ninth circuit.

                              STATEMENT OP AHTONIA HBRHAHDEZ

        Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the Judiciary
Committee:

           I am pleased to have the opportunity today to present
testimony on behalf of the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund ("MALDEF") concerning the nomination of Judge
Anthony Kennedy to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

        My name is Antonia Hernandez. I am President and General
Counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund ("MALDEF"). I am here before you today because I have
grave concerns about how Judge Kennedy -- if he were confirmed by
the Senate to become an Associate Justice -- would view the
claims of discriminated-against Hispanics in the important civil
and constitutional rights cases which come before and are decided
by the United States Supreme Court.

        My concerns are real, and they are indeed serious. They
stem from such facts as Judge Kennedy's membership in private
clubs that had not admitted into membership Hispanics, other
minorities, and women. And they are based on the fact that
although he has employed thirty-five law clerks, Judge Kennedy
has never found himself able to employ an Hispanic or a black law
clerk. Furthermore, the sum total of Judge Kennedy's minority
employment consists of five women and one Asian law clerk.
                                     501

         My grave concerns, however, are primarily based on several
of Judge Kennedy's judicial opinions on civil and constitutional
rights:in which he denied access to the courts to minorities. In
which he denied the right to a trial to minorities, and in which
he ruled against minorities by disregarding settled rules
governing the scope of appellate review.

         In this Statement, I address hereafter primarily two
matters: (1) the historical importance of the Supreme Court to
vindicating the rights of Hispanics; and (2) Judge Kennedy's
several judicial opinions rejecting the rights of Hispanics and
of other minorities.

    I- THE HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE SDPREMK COURT TO HISPANICS
         The history of discrimination against Hispanics in this

country, particularly in the Southwest and especially from the
mid-Nineteenth Century to date, has been not unlike that suffered
by blacks. We Hispanics have been subjected to segregation in
schools, in restaurants, and in hotels. We have been denied
employment, and when employed, we have been intimidated and
harassed, denied promotions, training and other opportunities.
We have been denied the opportunity to serve on juries. And we
have even been denied the most fundamental of rights: the right
to vote.

         But in 1954, Hispanics, blacks and other minorities in our
country, were finally given hope by the United States Supreme
Court. In fact, two weeks prior to the Supreme Court's unanimous
                                     502

ruling in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483
(1954) (holding school segregation unconstitutional), the Supreme
Court applied the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment to
Mexican Americans in Hernandez v. Texas. 347 U.S. 475 (1954),
unanimously holding that the exclusion of Mexican Americans from
juries in Texas violated the Fourteenth Amendment's equal
protection clause. In subsequent years, it again was the Supreme
Court -- and thereafter also Congress -- that continued to
recognize some of our basic civil rights.

         This fight to establish our basic civil rights has not been
an easy one. It in fact has required MALDEF attorneys to file
and to litigate hundreds of lawsuits. And a number of our
lawsuits have ended up in the United States Supreme Court.

         A prime example of this is the voting rights case of Whijte
v. Reqester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973). In this case, a unanimous
Supreme Court struck down Texas' imposition of a multimember
legislative district in Bexar County, a heavily Hispanic county
where San Antonio is located. Based on such facts as the reality
that only five Hispanics in nearly 100 years had ever been
elected to the Texas Legislature from Bexar County, the Supreme
Court upheld our claim that the challenged multimember district
scheme diluted the votes of Hispanics in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court thus affirmed the remedial
redrawing of single member districts.

         Apart from the Supreme Court's decision in White and its
earlier decision in Hernandez, few of our victories have been the
                                     503

result of unanimous decisions by the Supreme Court. Instead --
and increasingly in the past decade -- we have faced a divided
Supreme Court, a Court which in fact has often been very closely
divided on issues of special importance to Hispanics.

         For example, in Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), we
challenged Texas' denial of a public school education to
undocumented Hispanic children. These children were Texas
residents most of whom would eventually become legal residents,
but who, without an education, would become a permanent
underclass. The Supreme Court in this case agreed that Texas'
policy was unconstitutionally discriminatory in violation of the
Fourteenth Amendment. But the Court reached this decision
through a bare 5-4 majority, with Justice Powell joining that
majority.

         With Justice Powell no longer on the Supreme Court, and with
the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance, I am of
course concerned about his possible replacement, and I am
particularly concerned about the capacity for fairness and
compassion of the person nominated to succeed Justice Powell.

  II. JUDGE KENNEDY'S SEVERAL JUDICIAL OPINIONS ADVERSE TO THE
           RIGHTS OF HISPANICS

         In his twelve years on the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit (which encompasses nine states, including
the states of California, Arizona, and Nevada), Judge Anthony
Kennedy has authored nearly 500 judicial opinions. Roughly a
dozen of his opinions, narrowly speaking, have had a particular

                                                         4
                                      504

impact on the rights of Hispanics and of other minorities.
         In reviewing these opinions, my staff and I have determine*

that Judge Kennedy, whether ruling for or against civil rights
litigants, has in many instances carefully followed and applied
settled law or judicial precedent. (Several of these opinions,
in which he ruled in favor of civil rights litigants, are
summarized and analyzed in Appendix B to this Statement.) In
these instances at least. Judge Kennedy has demonstrated not only
his adherence to precedent but his fairness as well.

         In several other instances, however, Judge Kennedy's
opinions reflect not only a deviation from precedent but also
unfairness and even a serious insensitivity to the rights of
minorities. (Several of these opinions, all adverse to the civil
rights plaintiffs, are summarized and analyzed in Appendix A to
this Statement.)

        The point of my grave concern about these adverse opinions
is not just that he ruled against civil rights plaintiffs in
cases that I firmly believe could have been and should have been
ruled upon differently. Rather, my serious concern arises
primarily from the manner in which he reached his results adverse
to civil rights.

         Three of Judge Kennedy's opinions deserve, in my view,
particularly close scrutiny.

          A. Hpusing_Dlscrlalnatlon, and Access to the Courts
         TOPIC v. Circle Realty, 532 F.2d 1273 (9th Cir. 1976)
                                     505

(Kennedy, Joined by Chambers and Trask), cert, denied, 429 U.S.
859 (1977), is a housing discrimination case.

        The plaintiffs, a fair housing organization and three
individual homeowners, alleged that they were being denied the
opportunity to live in integrated neighborhoods because of the
racial steering practices of various real estate brokers. They
sued the brokers directly in federal court under the federal Fair
Housing Act. The defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit on the
grounds that the plaintiffs allegedly had not been sufficiently
injured so as to be able to sue in court. The District Court
disagreed and refused to dismiss the lawsuit.

         On appeal, Judge Kennedy reversed the District Court and
directed that the case be dismissed.

         To reach this result, Judge Kennedy had to distinguish the
Supreme Court's decision in Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co., 409 U.S. 205 (1372), in which the Supreme Court
recognized the injury-in-fact "standing" of apartment tenants to
challenge a landlord's similar steering under the Fair Housing
Act.

         Judge Kennedy's narrow views were squarely rejected by tne
Supreme Court three year*; later in Gladstone Realtors v.
Be11wood, 441 U.S. 91 (1979), in a 7-2 opinion by Justice Powell.
In the course of that opinion. Justice Powell pointed out that
his allowance of access to the courts was supported by nine
federal court decisions. Id. at 108. "The notable exception is
the Ninth Circuit in TOPIC v. Circle Realty." Id. Justice
                                     506

Powell continued: "[T]he Court of Appeals in this case correctly
declined to follow TOPIC." Id. at 109.

          B  Voting Discrimination. The Right to a Trial, and
                  Appellate Review

         Aranda v. Van Sickle, 600 F.2d 1267 (9th Cir. 1979) (Barnes
with Voorhees, and Kennedy concurring), aff'g 455 F. Supp. 625
( C D . Cal. 1976), is a vote dilution case similar to the Supreme
Court case of White v. Reqester. 412 U.S. 755 (1973). But Judge
Kennedy reached a result different from that reached by the
unanimous Supreme Court.

         The Hispanic plaintiffs in Aranda challenged the at-large
elections used by the city of San Fernando, California. As of
the early 1970s, the population of San Fernando had grown to
become 50* Hispanic; 29* of the registered voters were Hispanic;
and yet since the city's incorporation in 1911 only three
Hispanics had ever been elected at large to the five-member City
Council. The plaintiffs also alleged that there was a history of
harassment and discrimination against Hispanics, and that the
political process was not equally open to Hispanics. For
example, more than half of the polling places had been ordinarily
located in the homes of Anglos while pollings places had seldom
been located in Hispanic homes.

         Despite these allegations, the District Court summarily
dismissed the case, thereby effectively denying the plaintiffs
the opportunity to present their case at trial.

         The Ninth Circuit affirmed the summary dismissal in a
                                                         7
                     507

majority opinion which set forth few of the facts, contained

little legal analysis, and which primarily adopted the District

Court's opinion.

      Judge Kennedy filed a concurring opinion in which he filled

in the facts and provided the precedential analysis missing from

the majority opinion. His concurring opinion Is remarkable in at

least two respects.

      First, Judge Kennedy never discussed the Supreme Court's

stringent legal principles disfavoring summary dismissals. Judge

Kennedy accordingly circumvented established Supreme Court

precedent, possibly so as to reach the result he desired.

      Second, Judge Kennedy itemized the plaintiffs' many factual

allegations, and then concluded that such plaintiffs could never

win:

      Assuming that plaintiffs' factual allegations are

      true, when taken together, they would not permit a

      reasonable person to infer that the at-large system for

      electing the mayor and city council members is

      maintained because of an invidious intent.            ,

Aranda, 600 F.2d at 1277. Since the fact patterns underlying

most at-large elections in California and in the other states

within the Ninth Circuit were no more egregious than the facts

alleged by the Hispanic plaintiffs in this case, Judge Kennedy's

conclusion effectively ended constitutional challenges to at-

large elections within the Ninth Circuit.
                                     508

          C. School Segregation, and Appellate Review
         Spangler v. Pasadena Board' of Education, 611 F.2d 1239 (9th
Cir. 1979) (Goodwin, with Anderson concurring, and with Kennedy
concurring), is a school desegregation case.
         At issue in this case was the Board of Education's request
that the District Court relinquish its continuing jurisdiction on
the grounds that the Board for many years had substantially
complied with the court-ordered desegregation plan, and that the
Board had passed a resolution promising not to engage in
Intentional discrimination in the future. This request was
opposed by the plaintiffs and by the Justice Department because
the Board in fact had been out of compliance on thirteen
occasions, and primarily because recently elected Board members
had expressed their intent to revoke the desegregation plan and
thereby to resegregate the schools. The District Court denied
the Board's request and retained continuing jurisdiction.
         On the Board's appeal, the Ninth Circuit, in a short
majority opinion, reversed and directed the termination of
jurisdiction.
         Judge Kennedy filed a lengthy concurring opinion setting
forth the facts as he perceived them to be, and providing a legal
analysis for the results reached. In doing so, he went far
beyond the majority opinion both procedurally and as a matter of
law in at least two respects.
         First, Judge Kennedy substituted his version of the facts
for those found by the finder of fact, the District Court. For
                                     509

example, although the District Court found substantial
noncompliance particularly after 1976, Judge Kennedy argued that
"there has been no showing of noncompliance in any degree since
that date." Spangler, 611 F.2d at 1243 (footnote omitted noting
thirteen instances of noncompliance). Additionally, on the
resegregation issue. Judge Kennedy acted as the trier of fact in
finding that "the evidence does not support the conclusion that
the school board harbors an intent to establish, or return to, a
dual system." Id. at 1244. The problem with these conclusions
is that Judge Kennedy never cited, and indeed circumvented, the
Supreme Court's stringent principles which delegate fact finding
to the District Courts.

         Second, at somewhat of a loss to cite controlling law in
support of his legal conclusion on the termination of
jurisdiction. Judge Kennedy quoted from the Supreme Court's
decision in Sj>ang_ler several years earlier:

                  At oral argument the Solicitor General discussed the
                  Government's belief that if, as [the Board defendants]
                  have represented, they have complied with the District
                  Court's order during the intervening two years [from
                  1974 to 1976], they will probably be entitled to a
                  lifting of the District Court's order in its entirety.
                  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-31.
Spangler, 611 F.2d at 1243 (brackets by Judge Kennedy), quoting
from Pasadena Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 441
(1976). The problem with Judge Kennedy's reliance on this

                                                        10
                                     510

quotation is that it was not adopted as law then by the Supreme
Court, and it is not now the law. Instead, it was no more than
an argument by Solicitor General Robert H. Boric.

III. COWCLOSIOW
         I no doubt need not stress to this Committee that Hispanics,

and other minorities too, are deeply concerned about the
prevalence of discrimination in the sale and rental of the very
housing we need for our families; about our right not just to
vote, but to a vote that counts; and about segregation and
resegregation of our children in our country's public schools.
In order to fight ongoing discrimination and injustice, we
Hispanics and other minorities need access to the courts, as well
as to our "day in court" to prove discrimination and injustice.
And we need Supreme Court Justices that believe in and apply the
noble inscription on the Supreme Court building's facade: EQUAL
JUSTICE UNDER LAW.

        The foregoing judicial opinions rendered by Judge Kennedy,
and in particular the way in which he reached his results, have
quite naturally caused me to conclude that Judge Kennedy -- if he
becomes Associate Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court -- may not
be fair in adjudicating the rights of Hispanics and of other
minorities. Alas, this possible unfairness could become
particularly prevalent in cases not subject to compelling
judicial precedent.

        Many of you have read and analyzed the foregoing opinions,

                                                       11
                                     511

among others. I am not yet convinced whether Judge Kennedy would
be fair in adjudicating the rights of Hispanics and other
minorities. I urge the Committee to seek further clarification
and assurance--on the record--concerning his views on civil
rights and on the rights of Hispanics.

                                                APPEHPIX A

         Ih a number of his judicial opinions, on issues of
particular importance to the civil rights and constitutional
rights of Hispanics, Judge Kennedy has denied access to the
courts, denied the right to a trial, and has disregarded settled
judicial precedent on the scope and nature of appellate review.
Four such opinions are summarized and analyzed hereafter: one
each in the areas of housing discrimination; vote dilution and
the right to vote; school segregation,- and employment
discrimination.

1. TO?IC_y, Circle Realty. 532 F.2d 1273 (9th C.1r. 1976)
       (Kennedy, joined by Chambers and Trask), cert, denied> 4 2 9
       O.S. 859 (1977).
         Thi3 housing discrimination casa was filed under the Fair

Housing Act. Judge Kennedy denied Injury-In-fact standing to the
individual and organizational plaintiffs. His anti-civil rights
view was squarely rejected three years later in Gladstone
Realtors_v. Bellwood. 441 D.S. 91 {1979}, a 7-2 decision with the
ajorJty opinion written by Justice Powell-

         In TOPIC), a fair housing orgai<iz.ition i.nd T,Veo individual
homeowners alleged that they were being denied the opportunity to
live in integrated neighborhoods because of the racial steering
practices of various real estate brokers. They sued the brokers
directly in federal court under { 812 of the Fair Housing Act.

                                                       14
                                     514

The District Court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss on
grounds of standing. Judge Kennedy reversed and directed that
the case be dismissed.

         To reach this result. Judge Kennedy had to distinguish the
Supreme Court's decision in Trafflcante v. Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co., 409 U.S. 205 (1972), in which the Court recognized
the injury-in-fact standing of apartment complex tenants to
challenge a landlord's similar steering under { 810 of the Fair
Housing Act. He sought to distinguish Trafflcante in two ways.

        First, Judge Kennedy reached out to find that the injury
allegedly suffered by the homeowners in TOPIC was probably much
less direct than that suffered by the tenants in Trafficante.
Having thus distinguished Trafficante in this manner, Judge
Kennedy then declined to base his decision on this premise.

         Second, Judge Kennedy instead limited Trafficante to it's
holding under the less-used { 810 of the Fair Housing Act, and
held that { 812 relied on in TOPIC did not authorize lawsuits by
residents who had not themselves been directly discriminated
against.

         Both of Judge Kennedy's narrow views were squarely rejected
by the conservative Burger Court three years later in Gladstone
Realtors v. Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91 (1979), in a 7-2 opinion by
Justice Powell. In the course of that opinion. Justice Powell
pointed out that "[ra]ost federal courts that have considered the
issue agree that {{ 810 and 812 provide parallel remedies to
precisely the same prospective plaintiffs." .Id. at 108, citing

                                                       15

nine fpderal court decisions. "The notable exception is the
Ninth Circuit in TOPIC v. Circle Realty." I_d. Justice Powell
continued:

2. Aranda v. Van Sickle, 600 F.2d 1267 (9th Clr. 1979) (Barnes
       with Voorhees, and Kennedy concurring), aff'g 455 F. Supp.
       625 ( C D . Cal. 1976).
         This vote dilution case challenged at-large elections under

the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. In his separate
concurring opinion which is longer than the Majority opinion.
Judge Kennedy provided a judicial roadmap which could have been
used to preclude all future challenges to at-large elections in
those states within the Hinth Circuit. If this was Judge
Kennedy's Intent, it became moot In 1982 when Congress amended
( 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

         The Hispanic plaintiffs in Aranda challenged the at-large
elections used by the city of San Fernando since its
incorporation in 1911. As of the early 1970s, the population of
San Fernando had grown to become 50* Hispanic; 29* of the
registered voters were Hispanic; and yet only three Hispanics had
ever been elected at large to the five-member City Council.

                                                        16
                                     516

         In addition to the foregoing, plaintiffs alleged that there
was a history of discrimination against Hispanics, and that the
political process was not equally open to Hispanics in that, for
example, few Hispanics had ever been appointed to the City's,
eighteen commissions: few Hispanics had been permitted to serve
as election officials: volunteer Hispanic poll watchers were
routinely harassed; more than half of the polling places were
ordinarily located in the homes of Anglos while pollings places
had seldom been located in Hispanic homes; racial appeals were
made by Anglos in election campaigns; and all ballots and
election materials were available only in English.

         Despite these allegations, the District Court denied
plaintiffs a trial, and granted the City's motion for summary
judgment on the ground that even if plaintiffs could prove their
allegations as true, this would not add up to the intentional
discrimination necessary to establish liability.

        The Ninth Circuit affirmed the summary judgment dismissal in
a majority opinion which set forth few of the facts, which
contained little legal anaJysis, and which primarily adopted the
District Court's opinion.

        Judge Kennedy filed a concurring opinion in which he filled
in the facts and provided the precedential analysis missing from
the majority opinion. His concurring opinion Is remarkable in at
least two respects.

        First, although this case was decided not after trial when
all the facts could have been fully developed but instead on

                                                       17
                                    517

summary judgment. Judge Kennedy never discussed the stringent
legal principles applicable to summary judgment motions. E.g.,
the moving party has the burden of proving that there are no
material facts in dispute, Adickes y. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S.
144, 157 (1970); and "all inferences to be drawn from the
underlying facts contained in the [movant's] materials must be
viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the
motion," United States v. Diebold, 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962)
(brackets added). Judge Kennedy accordingly circumvented
established Supreme Court precedent apparently so as to reach the
result he desired.

         Second, Judge Kennedy itemized plaintiffs' many factual
allegations, and then concluded plaintiffs could never win:

                           Assuming that plaintiffs' factual allegations
                  arc true, when taken together, they would not
                  permit a reasonable person to infer that the at-
                  large system for electing the mayor and city
                  council members is maintained because of an
                  invidious intent.
Aranda, 600 F.2d at 1277. Since the fact patterns underlying
most at-large elections in California and in the other states
within the Ninth Circuit were no more egregious than the facts
alleged by the plaintiffs in this case. Judge Kennedy's
conclusion effectively ended constitutional challenges to at-
large elections within the Ninth Circuit. And he precluded such
challenges despite the existence of similar fact patterns in

                                                        18
518

successful cases such as the Supreme Court case of White v.

Reqester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973).
        Judge Kennedy's decision In Aranda did not, however, kill

litigation challenges to at-large elections. In 1982, Congress

amended { 2 of the Voting Rights Act to clarify its intent that
electoral practices which have a discriminatory effect are
illegal. This 1982 amendment in turn was further clarified by a

narrowly divided Supreme Court in Thornburq v. Glnqles,      U.S.

, 106 S.Ct. 2752, 92 L.Ed.2d 25 (1976).

3- Spangler v. Pasadena Board of Education. 611 F.2d 1239 (9th
       Clr. 1979) (Goodwin, with Anderson concurring, and with
       Kennedy concurring).
         This school desegregation case involved the question of

whether the District Court's supervisory jurisdiction should be
continued or terminated. Although Judge Kennedy agreed with the
Majority that jurisdiction should be terminated and the District
Court decision thereby should be reversed. Judge Kennedy filed a
concurring opinion (more than three times longer than the
majority opinion) in which he disregarded settled judicial
principles on fact finding, and in which he reached out to decide
an Issue which has become critical today In school desegregation
litigation. This concurring opinion in Spangler Is similar in
many respects to his reachlng-out concurring opinion in Aranda.

         In this decade-old school desegregation case, the Board of
Education filed a motion requesting the District Court to
relinquish its continuing jurisdiction on the grounds that the

                                                       19
                                     519

Board for many years had substantially complied with the court-
approved des<?aregation plan, and that the Board had passed a
resolution promising not to engage in intentional discrimination
in the future. This motion was opposed by the plaintiffs and by
the Justice Department because the Board in fact had been out of
compliance on thirteen occasions, and primarily because recently
elected Board members had expressed their intent to revoke the
desegregation plan and thereby to resegregate the schools. The
District Court retained continuing jurisdiction.

         On the Board's appeal, the Ninth Circuit panel reversed and
directed the termination of jurisdiction. In a short majority
opinion, Jurige Goodwin found that the Board had substantially
complied with the desegregation plan and that it was time for
jurisdiction to be relinquished. Judge Anderson agreed in a one-
sentence concurrence.

         Judge Kennedy filed a lengthy concurring opinion setting
forth the facts as he perceived them to be, and providing a legal
analysis for the result reached. In doing so, he went far beyond
the majority opinion both procedurally and as a matter of law.

         First, Judge Kennedy substituted his version of the facts
for those found by the finder of fact, the District Court. For
example, although the District Court found substantial
noncompliance particularly after 1976, Judge Kennedy argued that
"there has been no showing of noncompliance in any degree since
that date." Spangler, 611 F.2d at 1243 (footnote omitted noting
thirteen instances of noncompliance). Additionally, on the

                                                        20
                                   520

resegregatlon Issue, Judge Kennedy acted as the trier of fact In
finding that "the evidence does not support the conclusion that
the school board harbors an intent to establish, or return to, a
dual system." Id. at 1244. Irrelevant to Judge Kennedy were the
political campaign statements of the newly elected Board members,
the actual deliberations of the Board, and the credibility of the
Board members as witnesses. Relevant Instead to Judge Kennedy
was his conclusion that a "policy of favoring [a return to]
neighborhood schools is not synonymous with an intent to violate
the constitution." Jtd. a t 1245. Moreover, the Board's
"resolution is further evidence that the Board is not likely to
engage in new acts of intentional discrimination." JId. at 1245-
46. Apart from Judge Kennedy's apparent willingness to overlook
the facts in the face of a mere promise not to discriminate,
compare Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483
(1954) (Kansas a year earlier had repealed the law which had
permitted segregation in Topeka), Judge Kennedy's manner of
appellate review is totally at odds with settled jurisprudence --
 nowhere cited in his opinion -- governing the application of
the clearly erroneous standard under Rule 52(a) of the Fed. R.
Civ. P. According to that settled jurisprudence: "In applying
the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a district
court sitting without a jury, appellate courts must constantly
have in mind that their function is not to decide factual issues
de novo." Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltlne Research, Inc., 395
U.S. 100, 123 (1969); see also United States v. United States

                                                       21
                                    521

Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395 (1948). The reasons for this
established principle were recently explained by Justice White
for the unanimous Court in Anderson v. Bessemer City. 470 U.S.
564, 574-75 (1985):

                           The rationale for deference to the original
                  finder of fact is not limited to the superiority
                  of the trial judge's position to make
                  determinations of credibility. The trial judge's
                  major role is the determination of fact, and with
                  experience In fulfilling that role comes
                  expertise. Duplication of the trial judge's
                  efforts in the court of appeals would very likely
                  contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact
                  determination at a huge cost in diversion of
                  judicial resources. In addition, the parties to a
                  case on appeal have already been forced to
                  concentrate their energies and resources on
                  persuading the trial judge that their account of
                  the facts is the correct one; requiring them to
                  persuade three more judges at the appellate level
                  is requiring too much.
As Justice White further explained in Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575:

                           When findings are based on determinations
                  regarding the credibility of witnesses. Rule 52(a)
                  demands even greater deference to the trial
                  court's findings; for only the trial judge can be

                                                        22
                                     522

                  aware of the variations In demeanor and tone of
                  voice that bear so heavily on the listener's
                  understanding of and belief in what is said.
None of these basic principles, however, appear to have had any
effect upon Judge Kennedy in Spangler.
         Second, at somewhat of a loss to cite controlling law in
support of his legal conclusion pertaining to an absence of
intentional discrimination. Judge Kennedy relied on the
"incremental segregative effect" theory advanced by Justice
Rehnquist in Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman. 433 U.S. 406,
420 (1977). See Spanqler. 611 F.2d at 1242. The problem with
this reliance, as is pointed out later in Spangler, 611 F.2d at
1247-48, is that the Supreme Court abandoned this incremental
segregative effect theory in Dayton Board of Education v.
Brinkman. 443 U.S. 526 (1979) ("Dayton II") ; and in Columbus
Board of Education v. Penlck, 443 U.S. 449 (1979).
        Finally, and again at a loss to cite controlling law
supporting his legal conclusion on the termination of
jurisdiction, Judge Kennedy quoted from the Supreme Court's
decision in Spangler several years earlier:
                 At oral argument the Solicitor General discussed
                  the Government's belief that if, as petitioners
                 have represented, they have complied with the
                 District Court's order during the intervening two
                 years [from 1974 to 1976], they will probably be

                                                               23
                                      523

                 entitled to a lifting of the District Court's order in
                  its entirety. Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-31.
Spanqler, 611 F.2d at 1243 (brackets by Judge Kennedy), quoting
from Pasadena Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 441
(1976)> The obvious problem with Judge Kennedy's reliance on
this quotation is that it was not adopted as law then by the
Supreme Court, and it is not now the law. Instead, it was no
more than an argument by Solicitor General Robert H. Bork.
         The overall importance of Judge Kennedy's views in Spangler
on resegregation and oh termination of jurisdiction is that these
matters had not, and have not yet, been resolved by the Supreme
Court, although resegregation has in fact become a reality. .See,
e.g. _D_owe 1J^ y. Board of_ Educat ion of Oklahoma_ City,. 795 F.2d 1516

1976), cerj_. denied, 55 U.S.L.W. 3316 (U.S. Nov. 3, 1986).

4. AFSCME^v^WashingJton, 770 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir. 1985) (Kennedy,
       with Wright and MacBride), rey'g 578 F. Supp, 846 (W.D. Wash.
       1983).
         This simple and yet couplex wage discrimination case

presented a cutting-edge Issue in employment discrimination law:
whether an employer has engaged in illegal gender discrimination
in violation of Title VII by setting lower wages for job
classifications held predominantly by women. Although the purely
legal answer to this question should have been a mainstream
"yes," this issue nevertheless was and still is considered on the

                                                       24
                                     524

cutting edge simply because an affirmative legal answer could
open the way to making vast numbers of employers guilty of
Illegal discrimination. Regardless of this potential effect, the
District Court in this case reviewed extensive documentary and
testimonial evidence, and ruled that the State of Washington's
system 'of wage compensation constituted illegal employment

      r

discrimination uader Title VII. Judge Kennedy, in total
disregard of the evidentiary record in the case and based instead
on a theory not proven in the case, reversed. Further, appellate
review became moot when Washington agreed to settle the case for
nearly one hundred million dollars in wage adjustments, back pay,
and front pay.

         The union and the individual plaintiffs In this case alleged
gender discrimination not or. the grounds of some undefined
"comparable worth" theory, but instead on the grounds that the
Stace of i"Jashingx:cn had determined and imposed a disparate wags
scale based upcr. gender (just as other employers had done based
upon race and/or national origin). To establish their claims,
the plaintiffs presented evidence -- and proved to the
satisfaction of the District Court -- that predominantly male
jobs were paid significantly more than predominantly female jobs
of equal skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions;
that there was a statistically significant and quite precise
inverse correlation between gender and salary {1.e., that the
monthly salary decreased by roughly $4.51 for every 1% increase
in the female population of the classification); that the State's

                                                       25
                                     525

own studies which established these disparities and the inverse
correlation effectively eliminated nondiscriminatory factors
which might account for the wage differentials; and that the wage
differential's were part of a system based upon gender-segregated
job classifications, gender-segregated advertising, subjective
classification decisions, and admitted wage discrimination.
Based upon these findings, among others, the District Court held
that the State of Washington had violated Title VII both under a
disparate impact theory and under a disparate treatment theory.

         Judge Kennedy reversed both grounds of liability. In doing
so, he committed at least three legal errors1..

         First, Judge Kennedy held that disparate impact liability
could apply only to a single allegedly neutral practice and not
to an aggregate of subjective practices. This narrow reading of
Title VII disparate impact law was contrary to the precedent then
existing in the Ninth Circuit, see, e_._g_._, Pete_rs_ y. Lieuallen,
746 F.2d 1390 (9th Cir. 1984); Wang _v_. Hoffman, 694 F.2d 1146
 (9th Cir. 1982); and is contrary to current precedent in the
Ninth Circuit, Atonio y. Wards Cove Packing Co., 810 F.2d 147 7
(9th Cir. 1987) (en bane).

         Second, Judge Kennedy held that the evidence presented did
not establish disparate treatment liability since illicit motive
had not been established. In making this determination, however,
Judge Kennedy declined to defer to, or even to discuss, the
clearly erroneous standard of appellate review (which is
discussed at 19-22 supra in the context of his similar reversal

                                                        26
                                    526

in Spanqler), a stringent standard of review applicable not only
to underlying findings of fact but also to an ultimate finding of
intentional discrimination. Pullman-Standard v. Swlnt, 456 U.S.
273, 287-89 (1982). Rather than applying the clearly erroneous
standard, Judge Kennedy instead simply recharacterized the facts
in a manner suitable to him.

         Finally, although the State of Washington's own studies
rebutted its alleged reliance on prevailing market rates, and
although the District Court's opinion nowhere even uses the word
"market," Judge Kennedy frequently invoked a free market defense
in rebuttal to either disparate Impact liability or disparate
treatment liability. As to the former, for example. Judge
Kennedy held that:

                  A compensation system that is responsive to supply and
                  demand and other market forces ... does not constitute
                 a single practice that suffices to support a claim
                  under disparate impact theory.
AFSCME, 770 F.2d at 1406 (ellipsis added). As to disparate
treatment liability, Judge Kennedy commented:
                  Neither law nor logic deems the free market system a
                 suspect enterprise.
JW. at 1407. Judge Kennedy concluded his opinion with similar
market-based sentiments:
                 The State of Washington's initial reliance on a free
                  market system in which employees in male-dominated jobs
                 are compensated at a higher rate than employees in

                                                       27
                                     527

                 dissimilar female-dominated jobs is not in and of
                  itself a violation of Title VII.... [T]he law does no
                 permit the federal courts to interfere in the market
                 based system for the compensation of Washington's
                 employees.
Id. at 1408 (ellipsis and brackets added). Judge Kennedy, in
other words, set up his own market-based straw man, and then
buried him.
         In summary, although the Supreme Co\irt opened the door to
wage discrimination challenges in Washington y. Gunther, 452 U.S.
161 (1981), Judge Kennedy sought to foreclose such challenges in
his AFSCME opinion. His opinion, however, did not end the AFSCMI!
litigation adversely to the plaintiffs. With plaintiffs-
appellees' petition for rehearing en bane pending before the
Ninth Circuit, the State of Washington agreed to settle the case
for $97.2 million in wage adjustments, back pay, and front pay.

         In a number of his judicial opinions affecting the rights cf
Hispanics, Judge Kennedy has followed settled law or judicial
precedent in ruling sometimes for and sometimes against civil
rights plaintiffs. Three such opinions, in which he ruled in
favor of civil rights litigants, are summarized and analyzed
hereaf ter. i,

1- Flores v. Pierce, 617 F.2d 1386 (9th Cir. 1980) (Kennedy,
       joined by Pregerson and Bonsai).
         Two Hispanic restaurant owners, whose receipt of a liquor

license was delayed, filed this damage action challenging as
discriminatory the opposition mounted by various local government
officials. Judge Kennedy affirmed the jury findings of
Intentional discrimination. Although supporters of Judge Kennedy
have cited this opinion as Illustrative of his sensitivity to
civil rights. It would have been virtually impossible and hence
outrageous for Judge Kennedy to have overruled the jury findings
in this case.

         Plaintiffs Barbaro and Alma Flores, owners of a nearby
restaurant with a predominately Hispanic clientele, planned to
open a restaurant in Calistoga, California, and accordingly
applied for a liquor license with the State Department of
Alcoholic Bcvorage Control ("ABC"). Their application was
opposed by the Calistoga police chief, the mayor, and members of

                                                       30
                                   530

the city council. Given the governmental opposition, ABC
initially denied the license. Following an appeal, ABC nine
months later awarded the license.

         Plaintiffs sued the local officials for damages under 42
U.S.C. { 1983. At their jury trial, plaintiffs showed, inter
alia, that the local officials engaged in racial stereotyping in
their opposition papers, that the local officials had not
objected to liquor licenses sought by Anglo applicants during the
same time period, that the local officials had departed from
their ordinary practices in opposing the license, and that the
Flores were of good moral character as found by ABC. On this
evidence, the jury found that the defendant local officials had
intentionally discriminated against the plaintiffs in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment. And the jury awarded $48,500 in
compensatory damages to cover for lost profits, for attorneys
fees incurred before ABC, and for emotional distress.

        On appeal, defendants argued that the jury verdict was
wrong. The applicable standard of appellate review, however, all
but doomed the appeal. Under the legal standard applicable then,
as now, the Ninth Circuit was required to view the evidence in
the light most favorable to the prevailing parties and to draw
all inferences in the prevailing parties1 favor. Fountlla v.
Carter, 571 F.2d 487, 490 (9th Cir. 1978); and the Ninth Circuit
could reverse the jury verdict only if the evidence allowed only
a contrary conclusion, Kay v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 548 F.2d 1370,
1372 (9th Cir. 1977) .

         In his opinion for the Ninth Circuit, Judge Kennedy properly
cited the controlling standards of appellate review, and he thus
affirmed the jury verdict because the "evidence here was more
than sufficient to support a finding that the [defendants] acted
with the purpose and intent of discriminating on the basis of
race or national origin." Flores, 617 F.2d at 1390 (brackets

2. James_v. Ball. 613 F.2d 180 (9th Cir. 1979) (Kennedy, Joined
       by Choy, dissent by Hall), rey'd. 451 U.S. 355 (1981).
         The issue in this case was whether voting in a special-

purpose district could be limited to landowners or instead was
subject to the one-person on-vote principle. The District Court
held that the voting could be limited to landowners. Judge
Kennedy, in a good opinion from a civil rights perspective,
applied the one-person one-vote principle and reversed. In turn,
Judge Kennedy was reversed by the Supreme Court on a 5-4 vote.

         This lawsuit was a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to the
constitutionality of several Arizona statutes which limited to
landowners voting rights in elections for directors of the Salt
River District, with votes essentially apportioned to owned
acreage. The lawsuit was brought by persons precluded from the
franchise, i.e., renters, and persons who owned less than one
acre of land.

         At the time this case was brought, the controlling law
generally favored application of the one-person one-vote
principle Initially articulated in Reynqlds_y. _S_4ms , 377 U.S. 533

(1964). Not only had the one-person one-vote principle been
widely applied, but it had been specifically applied to strike
down laws which limited voting to landowners, i.e.. Phoenix v.
Kolodziejski, 399 U.S. 204 (1970); Ciprlano v. Houma, 395 U.S.
701 (1969). In one instance, however, the Supreme Court had
allowed voting to be limited tc landowners so long as the
jurisdiction had a "special limited purpose" which in turn had a
significantly disproportionate effect on landowners as a group,
Salyer Land Co. v. Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District, 410
U.S. 719 (1973) .

         The Arizona defendants in James argued that Salver permitted
the challenged limitation on voting. Judge Kennedy disagreed.
Salyer, he pointed out, involved a water district which consisted
entirely of agricultural land farmed by four corporations which
bore all the expenses of the district. The Salt River District
in James was entirely different. First, as to its water
operations, the District encompassed not just agricultural lands
but also eight municipalities including major portions of
Phoenix. Second, the District was Arizona's second largest
electric utility servicing nearly a quarter of a million persons.
And finally, the activities of the District did not
disproportionately affect landowners. Based on these
differences, Judge Kennedy distinguished Salyer, applied the one-
person one-vote principle, and held the challenged statutes
unconstitutional. He concluded:

                                                               33

The rationale for departing from the one-person one-

vote standard is ... that under certain conditions, of

most narrow dimension, there may exist a state created

entity, limited to operations with little effect on the

general electorate and a substantially disproportionate

effect on the interests of a discrete group permitted

to vote. If, on the other hand, the operations of a

state entity affect a diverse group of citizens, the

franchise cannot be restricted to exclude those who

have an interest in the election.  I

       F.2d il80 (9th Cir. 1979) (Wright, Joined by Hall, with
       Kennedy concurring).

         The Ninth Circuit in this case held that undocumented
workers were "employees" within the meaning of, and hence
protected by, the National Labor Relations Act. Judge Kennedy
filed a two-sentence concurring opinion. As to the issue on the
merits, the Supreme Court in another case subsequently agreed
with the Ninth Circuit.

         Several undocumented workers filed charges with the NLRB
claiming that they had been denied overtime wages. They
thereafter were laid off, and they were later denied
reinstatement. The NLRB found In favor of the workers, and
issued a cease and desist order. The NLRB then sought judicial
enforcement of its order.

         The employer argued before the Ninth Circuit that
undocumented workers were not "employees" within the meaning of
{ 2(3) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. { 152(3). The Ninth Circuit
rejected this defense. Judge Wright, in his majority opinion,
pointed out that the inclusion of undocumented workers was
consistent with the statutory structure of the NLRA, consistent
with NLRB interpretations of the law, and consistent with the
only other court of appeals' ruling on this issue.

         Judge Kennedy filed a nonanalytical and sensitive concurring
opinion, Apollo Tire Co., 604 F.2d at 1184, which stated in its
entirety:

                  I concur. If the NLRA were inapplicable to workers who
                  are illegal aliens, we would leave helpless the very
                  persons who most need protection from exploitative
                  employer practices such as occurred in this case.
        As to the legal issue resolved on the merits, the Supreme
Court in another case eventually agreed with the Ninth Circuit.

  Senator KENNEDY. Mr. Chairman, I regret I wasn't here when
Ms. Hernandez was sworn in. I would express a warm word of wel-
come to her and to our panelists. Antonia Hernandez worked as a
staff member of the Judiciary Committee for a long period of time,
and during that period of time performed very good service for our
committee, just generally, and personally, on the whole range of
issues involving equal rights. Those rights are an important issue
we face here.

  I was just, as someone who has pursued this issue, wondering if
you would be kind enough to just tell us what was happening in
that community at this time. We heard the allegations. Judge Ken-
nedy heard that whole series of allegations, in terms of where the
ballot boxes were located, the harassment of Hispanic Americans
in terms of poll watching--the whole range of allegations, and he
had indicated that even if they accepted those it wouldn't justify
changing the kind of elections that would be held.

  What was really happening in that community at that time? Do
you firmly believe that if those allegations were reviewed, even
submitted to a jury, that there would have been a finding that the
elections in that community were sufficiently tainted as to justify
or warrant a new election?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Well, basically, this was in the early seventies,
and there was a great deal of effort to try to apply the Voting
Rights Act to Hispanics. And we were doing this in Texas and in
California. And when I speak of we, I mean MALDEF did.

  And there was a great deal of activity within our community
trying to activate and educate the Hispanic community to partici-
pate in the political process. So that there was a great deal of effort
to get the community to really go out and try to participate, know-
ing that there's a great deal of poverty, lack of education, et cetera.

  What is interesting in this particular case is that the facts as
they were happening in San Fernando Valley were similar to what
was happening in Texas and in other places in the Southwest. In-
terestingly enough, in Texas, because of the severe overt discrimi-
nation of the last 100 years, the courts were finding in our favor.

  In California, because you didn't have the lynchings, or at least
the overt lynchings and the overt actual segregation and discrimi-
nation--in California it is much more subtle--the same facts that
we were presenting were being rejected as not being sufficient.

  Some of the allegations in this particular case included state-
ments by the Mayor about outside agitators coming in, you know,
to change our government, our city government.

  Second, we had statements a week before the election by the city
clerk alleging fraud and irregularities. Moreover, there was the
whole issue of employment discrimination. And also placing of the
polling places in predominantly Anglo areas.

  The combination of factors is overwhelming. When you have un-
employment, poverty, and lack of education, our trying to get mi-
norities and particularly Hispanics to participate in the political
process by giving them hope that they will make a difference is ex-
tremely difficult. To give you an example, in every case where we
have litigated and have won, and gone from an at large to a single
member district, there has been a marked difference.
                                         536

  In the Hispanic community, if you show our community that
there is hope, that they can make a difference, it happens. And let
me give you an example. In San Antonio, as I have already cited,
the fact is that in 1976, 37 percent were participating in the polling
and voting. By 1985, it had increased to 43 percent. And, in fact, in
the last Presidential election, there are statistics that show that
Hispanics participated at a higher level than the majority of the
population.

  Senator KENNEDY. Let me ask you this.
  The Judge indicated that the case really asked for a citywide
result, that they wanted basically to overturn the whole election
system, and I think you make a strong case that if they examined
the facts, and they went to a jury, the facts were there that it may
very well have been proved. And I think you make a strong case
that it would have been proved sufficiently powerful to overturn
the whole kind of election system.
  Let me go back a step. He'd indicate that he might have been
prepared to make some kinds of adjustment in terms of polling
places and have partial kinds of response to some of these charges
that were made in the petition. But since the plea was for an over-
all elimination of the at-large election, or vacating of the election,
he didn't have that opportunity to be able to make those kinds of
findings.
  What is your response to that?
  Ms. HERNANDEZ. I beg to differ with Judge Kennedy, and let me
tell you why. Two reasons.
  As you all know, once the case is dismissed, it's res judicata.
There have been some statements about the fact that we could
have gone back. We couldn't have.
  Second, in voting rights cases as in desegregation cases, there are
two stages. You first go to the stage of establishing liability, and
after you establish liability at a trial, then you go into the second
stage, which is the remedy stage.
  By dismissing the case on a summary motion, he precluded us
from even going to court and establishing liability.
  Now, as we all know, once you get to court and establish liabil-
ity, what one pleads as a remedy might not be what one gets. And
it is at the remedy stage, as you know, that the Judges have the
discretion to give less than what one would ask for.
  So to say he dismissed the entire case because we only wanted
the remedy from going to at large to single member districts just
doesn't hold.
  Furthermore, as I stated, and what makes this case to us ex-
tremely important, is that he went out of his way to fill in the
blanks where the majority had not done it. And, quite frankly, I
must say that with friends like Judge Kennedy, he would have
done us a lot more of a favor if he had just concurred and left it at
that.
  But by setting out all the facts, as he did in this case, what he
basically said is if this is all you have, it isn't good enough in the
ninth circuit, and you're out.
  And so that's the particular significance. And also for us, and I
highlight
   Senator KENNEDY. Why do you think he did that?
                                                   537

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Really, I don't know, and I don't understand.
And I know that yesterday some comments were made by Judge
Kennedy about the fact that he was trying to sort of set out some-
thing so that we--and it's MALDEF, because we litigated the
case--could come back again. But, as I've already stated the issue
was res judicata.

  But I think this shows his lack of understanding, and to me that
is even more distressing. He comes from California. He has lived
among us all of his life. If I was here testifying about someone from
the Midwest or even the Northeast, to say that they are not famil-
iar with Hispanics, with the history of our discrimination, I could
understand that I have to educate someone. But we're dealing with
someone that comes from the Southwest, who has lived among us,
and should be much more sensitive to the subtleties of the discrimi-
nation and to the subtleties of exclusion when they're in a political
process.

  And that's where I have the greatest of concern as to what's
going to happen. And I have come to you to express that concern.
And I guess the question, before you ask me, is what do I want?

  Senator KENNEDY. You're a heck of a litigator and educator.
[Laughter.]

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. And what I want is to go back and to ask Judge
Kennedy to give further assurance and clarification as to how he
views Hispanics. My concern is that he might not feel that we de-
serve the same type of protection as the black community and
other protected minorities that are protected on civil rights.

  I want that assurance. I want to see what he states on the
record. I'm also concerned on the issue of women, the AFSCME
issue. I'm concerned on the Spangler issue, I'm concerned with the
TOPIC issue, and basically the common threat that one sees in
those cases is the threat that he kicks people out of court, that he
doesn't give them that opportunity. And even when they do win,
even when they do satisfy the stringent requirements of a federal
district court judge, that he overturns those decisions.

  He is a man of intellect, no question about it; a man of devotion,
but he's also a man of the establishment and, unfortunately, we
have not been part of that establishment.

  And what I want is an expansive of consideration of that percep-
tion of what America is.

  Thank you.
  Senator KENNEDY. Thank you very much. Your testimony's very
powerful.
  The CHAIRMAN. I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania. The
reason we're doing this is because both the witnesses have to catch
an airplane and then we'll go to the rest of the panel, if you have
any questions for us.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Hernandez is her name.
  Senator SPECTER. MS. Hernandez, I came in late on your testimo-
ny because I have a conflicting assignment with the Intelligence
Committee which is having a session right now, but I wanted to
return and ask a few questions.
  The subjects which you raised have been discussed at length with
Judge Kennedy. In my final round yesterday, I discussed with him
                                          538

the Aranda case and the Spangler case and the AFSCME case
versus Washington State in terms of the continuity that, in each
case, the Judge either overruled fact findings below, or did not
permit the fact finding process to go forward.

   In the course of the questioning of Judge Kennedy, he cited as-
surances of his sensitivity to the underlying fact situations and the
people involved. At this juncture, I'm interested to know, by the
way that you have testified, why you don't take a position for or
against him? Why not?

   Ms. HERNANDEZ. In studying his record, and we have studied his
record extensively, we know that there have been some other cases
which one could construe favorably for minorities. And that has
weighed heavily in our situation.

   What I want at this juncture is not just an assurance, but for
him to verbalize or to state in writing his philosophy, rather than
just saying I assure you. I want him to say he believes in certain
things, and this is why he believes. Further than that, I would ven-
ture to say, as I indicated before, that at this juncture, based on
our reading of the record, that if we were to get that and to see the
analysis made, justifying his belief, that we would not have the
grounds to oppose him.

  We do not take opposing a Justice to the Supreme Court very
lightly. And in fact, we did not participate or oppose O'Connor,
Scalia or Rehnquist.

  And so we're not here saying that because he decided one wrong
case or one case where MALDEF was involved, that that's suffi-
cient enough. But I don't think that there is enough there. I've lis-
tened and I've read very carefully what he said. And there are as-
surances, but I want those assurances further delineated in writ-
ing.

   Senator SPECTER. Well, I think that's a very sensitive and under-
standable position.

   When I questioned Judge Kennedy about Aranda and the other
cases, I put in the record cases which he had decided favorably to
the Mexican-American community and other civil rights cases, and
we can find that question for Judge Kennedy for the record and we
can supply you with a copy of the answer, and you can communi-
cate further with the committee. I'm sure that can be worked out,
can't it, Mr. Chairman?

   The CHAIRMAN. Yes, we will.,^
   Ms. HERNANDEZ. Let me make one point, Mr. Specter on that
point.
   On the cases where he has ruled favorably, the Flores case and
the others, they have been individual cases or dealing with an indi-
vidual's rights, and there had been a trial and a finding. And it has
been--let me put it to you this way. The law has been so well set-
tled that for him to have overturned the cases would have been
really unusual. And I am not trying to minimize his participation
in those cases.
   But they have been individual cases. All of the cases where I
raised the concerns, and they have been raised before, deal with
constitutional issues covering a group of people, dealing with issues
that are much more difficult and where
   Senator SPECTER. More systemic in dealing with.
                                         539

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. More systemic in dealing with the problem.
And that is the common thread to both the systemic issues and to
the individual issues that he has decided.

  Senator SPECTER. MS. Hernandez, there was one aspect of the
case which I would like your comment about.

  I had questioned Judge Kennedy on the aspect of the case that
summary judgment is to be limited under the law of the ninth cir-
cuit to situations where there are clear-cut factual record and were
not to be applied where intention or motivation was an issue.

  Then I noted in the opinion of the district court there was a ref-
erence to denial of discovery, which I found particularly trouble-
some, where the district court judge said that the plaintiffs had
asked for a vast arid extensive discovery burden and had not made
sufficient assurances that the results would be other than cumula-
tive. And based on my own experience in the federal court, it
seemed surprising to me that summary judgment would be issued
in a context where discovery was not completed because that dis-
covery could provide a factual basis to warrant additional relief.

  Are you personally familiar with specifics of the discovery re-
quest and whether it was reasonably calculated to provide the criti-
cal facts which might have defeated the summary judgment
motion?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. Oh, definitely. In fact, we have gone back to the
Archives to get the entire file. And to be fully prepared, I have
spoken extensively to the attorney who litigated the case for
MALDEF.

  And what is interesting in this case is that it is highly unusual,
as you know, when parties in federal court ask for discovery, it is
denied, and then a summary judgment is granted. In fact, the feel-
ing of our lawyers was that we had such a strong case on appeal
because if you have read the findings that the district

  Senator SPECTER. DO you know what the discovery would likely
have shown specifically to defeat the motion for summary judg-
ment?

  Ms. HERNANDEZ. It would have shown the polarized voting, par-
ticularly, throughout the years, which is very important. We were
seeking to show, not so much intent but the pattern of employment
practices within this city government, the non-responsiveness of
the city government to Hispanic concerns, essential elements that
go to proving of the pattern of discrimination.

  Interestingly enough, if you read the findings of the district
court, some of those findings were particularly outrageous, saying
that the low voting participation of Hispanics was due to apathy;
that if they really wanted to participate in the process, all they had
to do was vote.

  And so when we took the case up on appeal, we were certain
that it was such a strong appeal, that the motion for summary
judgment was not going to be upheld.

  Senator SPECTER. I have one final question, if I may.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU can have all the time you want. They both
have an airplane at six. It's up to you and them to decide.
   Ms. HERNANDEZ. Well, at this point in time, you might as well
ask the other questions. It's at Dulles, and there's no way that I'm
going to make Dulles.
                                          540

   Senator SPECTER. Yours also at Dulles, sir?
   Mr. MARTINEZ. NO, that's fine. Whatever time it takes.
   Senator SPECTER. Well, I'll ask a short question and you can
decide on the length of the answer. [Laughter.]
   Is it true that the case was litigated in a context of all or nothing
as was asserted here yesterday, that counsel only wanted at large
district representation, and would not have settled for more limited
equitable relief to cover the polling places or the failure to employ
minorities at the various Commissions?
   The CHAIRMAN. MS. Hernandez, you can refer him to the record.
You answered that extensively, and I feel like I've snookered the
rest of the committee here, the rest of the panel. I had no idea that
it was at Dulles or, quite frankly, I would have never let you go
first because I think I've done a disservice to the remainder of the
panel.
   That's in the record, Arlen. She's answered that extensively.
   Ms. HERNANDEZ. Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. MS. Kiehl, would you stand to be sworn since
you were the only one not sworn?
   Do you swear that the testimony you will give is the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?

   Ms. KIEHL. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW I apologize to the rest of the committee, and
I can assure you, Ms. Hernandez, (a) if I need a lawyer, I'm going
to you; (b) if you need a job, please come to me.

   Ms. HERNANDEZ. The last time I worked for the Senate, I lost my
job when the Democrats lost control of the Senate. I don't think I
can deal with that instability any more. [Laughter.]

  Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I'll try my best to see to it that it's stable,
and I won't say any more.
  Let me thank you for your testimony. Good luck in making the
race for Dulles.
  Mr. Martinez, you're welcome to stay, if you'd like, but I under-
stand
  Mr. MARTINEZ. If I can just make a comment, I think I can
answer some of the
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, you can't make a comment unless you have
a plane to catch for real.
  Mr. MARTINEZ. Well, I do, but it's at National, not Dulles.
  The CHAIRMAN. GO ahead and make your comment then.
   Mr. MARTINEZ. Thank you. Thank you.
  We had planned on being on the first panel, as you know, but we
weren't quite as controversial as people wanted, so we're here
to
  The CHAIRMAN. NO, that's not the reason you were not on. If
you're going to keep that up, I'll see to it you miss your plane at
Dulles and move to the next person. Okay?
   Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. Specter, I think the answer to your questions
that in the cases that we've discussed, there was an attack on the
institution itself, a societally accepted institution, that most of us
are brought up to accept as being correct or acting in our interest
99 percent of the time, an educational institution or a governmen
tal institution.
                                         541

  When the attack was upon one of those municipal elections, how
the municipality was going to govern itself, or how was an educa-
tional institution going to govern itself, or placement of schools, or
children attending schools, Judge Kennedy seemed to be much
more stringent in his standard.

  When there was a ministerial function to be performed that was
being attacked, such as in the Flores case or in the Apollo Tire
case, where individuals were just seeking a remedy for themselves,
or they wanted a liquor license from the municipality, or they filed
complaints with the NLRB, it was much easier for them to find his
behalf, sort of taking the little guy's side. There was no direct
attack on the institution.

  We think he is very qualified and will make a fine Supreme
Court Justice.

  We also think, though, that we are all products of our back-
ground. And we defer many, many times to things that we can see
and understand, because we participate in them. And they have
been good to us. And they have been good to our families. And we
traditionally belong to that club. And we have gone to that school.
And we give it deference.

  And I think what we have been talking about here today is
maybe giving deference, undue deference, to the institutions, with-
out being fully cognizant or appraised of individuals who have not
been part of the system, who cannot only do ministerial attacks on
the system, but oftentimes need other people to assist them in solv-
ing their problems, such as in the TOPIC case that was mentioned,
when third parties were needed to help them vindicate their rights.

  There was no direct relief sought by the individuals discriminat-
ed against. In fact, they probably did not even know they were
being discriminated against. That is why there was segregation
that worked so well.

  And in the case of Pasadena School Board, where the attack was
on the direct authority of the school district, what would it have
hurt to have allowed federal jurisdiction to have continued on the
school board, over the school board administration?

  If they were not doing anything wrong, it would not have imped-
ed them except to file an annual report.

  No, I think that the subject that we are talking about here is
greater than Judge Kennedy; it is greater than we are dealing with
in this room. It is acculturation.

  What we are talking about is how we think from the time we are
born. But in this case--in this case--it is so much more important.

  Because as a law professor, not having availed himself of the dif-
ferent cultures, as Ms. Hernandez pointed out, in our society, espe-
cially in California, which by the year 2000 the Census Bureau tells
us will be at least 52 percent minority, most of those being Mexi-
can-Americans, it seems incongruent to us that a person could live
there that long, espouse a philosophy of equality, and yet have a
history where there is little association with the diverse cultures.

  And we say not that about Judge Kennedy the judge but about
Judge Kennedy the law professor.

  So what we ask here today is not that he be unqualified, or that
we be against him. I think she eloquently stated the point that we
ask merely that he be more cognizant; that he take these things
                                              542

into account; that he treat people's rights, whether they be against
or for a ministerial function denial, the same as--those are treated
the same as when they are seeking to vindicate their rights against
an institution that he may be feeling comfortable with.

   Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much.
   Mr. MARTINEZ. Thank you.
   The CHAIRMAN. DO you have any reason to believe that this proc-
ess we are going through now will impact positively on that pros-
pect?
   Mr. MARTINEZ. I do. I think questions that you bring out, certain-
ly as I have been hearing today, are of immense assistance to ev-
eryone.
   One, they are brought out in frank discussion. I think that is a
commitment we all have, to frankly discuss this.
   Secondly, I think what happens is, it causes people to think. The
transition we are going through here today is one from follower to
leader.
   I do not think anyone has mentioned that. We are going from a
judge who is reviewing cases on appeal who says, hey, if I'm wrong,
come back; or someone will tell me I am wrong.
   So often in his cases he says, maybe the polling places, there was
something wrong with that. Or maybe if the school district has not
remedied the segregation, come back.
  An impractical solution, from our viewpoint, because it takes
money and time when you are dealing with people who are so dev-
astated by that they cannot afford to come back.

  But more than that they are saying, someone may correct me.
But now--now--he is the one setting the precedent. He is the one
^rho must provide the leadership.

  He is the one that will tell us what you intended when you
passed a certain law. And it is with the most recent laws that
affect civil rights that he has had the most problems: the 1968 Fair
Housing Act; the Voting Rights Act; the 42 U.S.C. 1983, the recent
interpretations.

  Those are the ones he has problems on. Why? Because those are
the ones that get to the very heart of our establishments, and
whether they act correctly, whether they always provide the equal-
ity that we say we stand for.

   I think these hearings bring these questions not only into focus,
but a man like Mr. Kennedy who I feel I know from reading so
many of his opinions now and doing analysis, and discussing him
with so many of my colleagues across the country is a man who
will take this to heart; is a man who will search his own soul and
say, maybe that is something I can do better at.

   And we in the Hispanic bar association intend to assist him with
that, as we do with all judiciary. What we intend to do is invite
him to our national convention in Albuquerque next September so
that he can affiliate with over 500 Hispanic attorneys in one place.
And we can educate him and he can educate us.

   The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Martinez, notwithstanding the fact that you
came last, I think it is good that you are toward the end. Because
quite frankly I think you may have, in the last 3 days, had the
most significant insight into this whole process.
                                                    543

  I think what you have just explained and articulated is the most
significant thing that has been said in 3 days.

  T for one believe you are correct. I have grave doubts about
Judge Kennedy; grave doubts. And quite frankly if I was certain
that he was going to rule on the Bench in the Supreme Court ex-
actly how he has been for the last 52 years of his life, I do not see
how I could vote for him, to tell you the truth; it would be awfully
tough.

  But I know from my own experience of standing for office, I
know that all of us up here, what the educational process is.

  Most of us, all of us, are a product of our background and our
culture. As a matter of fact, you and I had a discussion. I asked for
your help.

  I come from an area where I think I am as attuned as any white
American can be to the problems of black Americans, because it is
where I come from; it is what I am part of.

  But I did not grow up in an area or a community where there
were large Hispanic, or even small Hispanic, populations. I mean it
was just nonexistent.

  And exposure and education are important. It wasn't until 3
years ago that I realized the extent to which Hispanic Americans
have been simply the victims of prejudice in the most extreme way;
as extreme as any black American in this country have been, par-
ticularly in the Southwest, but also in other parts of the country.

  And how many civil rights leaders there are, and great heroes
there have been.

  And so this has had an impact on me, and I think I started out
way ahead of the game. And I suspect that same process of going
through this will have the same impact on Judge Kennedy. At
least that is my fervent hope.

  And I thank you for waiting. And I still think you have time to
catch your plane. You have half an hour, and it only takes about
14 minutes with luck; 18 minutes without luck; half hour if you are
in trouble. So you better go.

  Mr. MARTINEZ. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very, very much.
  Now, the rest of the panel and those who are waiting to testify, I
thank you very, very much for your indulgence.
  But this is in fact, as you can tell by the questions and the inter-
est, this is really the first real opportunity we have had to speak to
the concerns of a group of a significantly large majority in America
who we have not had an opportunity to--we have not had much
chance to question, nor have representatives of the community
spoken beforehand.
  Having said that, now let us--I forget now even the order we
were going in. Who would be next, based on the way I called it?
  Ms. Feinberg, you will be next. Then I guess it was Mr. Wallace
we called next. And then, Kristina, you will be next.
  And then we will ask questions of all three.
  Ms. Feinberg, thank you.
  Ms. FEINBERG. Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my
name is Audrey Feinberg. I am a New York City attorney, and I
am appearing on behalf of the Nation Institute, a private founda-
tion dedicated to protecting civil liberties and civil rights.
                                                   544

   Since 1984, the Supreme Court Watch project of the Institute has
studied the records of nominees in order to foster a more informed
debate about appointments to the high court.

  Based on our study, Judge Kennedy's record fails to demonstrate
a powerful commitment to key constitutional freedoms.

  The Nation Institute believes that there should be no presump-
tion of confirmation for any person named to the Supreme Court.
A nominee should have to demonstrate that he or she is qualified
for the job. In particular, there should be no presumption now, not
only because of the vague record of this nominee, but also because
of the unmistakable motivation behind this President's pattern of
nominations, and because of the fact that the Justice who replaces
Lewis Powell will change the direction of the court.

  We have studied Judge Kennedy's record in eight areas including
criminal law, privacy, freedom of expression and discrimination in
employment, education, housing and voting.

  It is on issues such as these that a just and free society measures
itself. In the law they are our collective conscience. How a judge
embraces these core values says much about their view of the Con-
stitution. Is it a robust, full bodied interpretation, in the grand tra-
dition of the Court's finest Justices? Or is it a more rigid view, tol-
erating not even the moderate, balanced approach of Justice
Powell?

  Will Judge Kennedy be the conscience of this court?
  Based on our study, Judge Kennedy's record is undistinguished
at best. I will mention a few of his more troubling opinions.
  In one 1982 case, Judge Kennedy joined a dissent suggesting that
an airline may impose strict weight requirements on female flight
attendants, based on passengers' perceived preferences for slender
women. Does Judge Kennedy still believe this today? If the case ac-
tually had gone his way, it would mean that customers' gender
biases would trump equal protection of the laws. Fortunately, the
majority of Judge Kennedy's court rejected his strained view. The
case I refer to is Gerdom v. Continental Airlines.

  In the area of freedom of speech, Judge Kennedy joined an opin-
ion, since vacated by the Supreme Court, upholding the firing of a
homosexual from his federal job. The employee had been active in
the Seattle Gay Alliance, displayed homosexual advertisements in
his automobile window, and publicly indicated his homosexuality.
Judge Kennedy failed to recognize the employee's first amendment
rights. This case is Singer v. U.S. Civil Service Commission.

  Members of this committee tried to elicit statements from the
nominee that he was sensitive to constitutional values. Many
times, however, his answers were simply unresponsive.

  For example, Mr. Chairman, I heard you ask whether it would be
constitutional for Congress to require affirmative action as a
remedy for intentional employment discrimination. While Judge
Kennedy indicated support for voluntary programs, he refused to
answer your question. Does he truly doubt Congress' authority to
fashion remedies to expunge discrimination from the work place?

  After listening to what this nominee has said, or more impor-
tantly, what he did not say, we are still uncertain whether he
would forcefully protect constitutional values.
                                      545
  For this reason, we believe that the Senate needs to probe more
deeply into Judge Kennedy's views.
  A year and a half ago I testified before this committee at the
confirmation hearings of Judge Antonin Scalia. At that time, the
Senate approved the nominee, despite his refusal to answer many
questions.
  This past fall the committee did itself proud by a rigorous exami-
nation of Justice Robert Bork. Judge Kennedy should similarly be
made to explain. Better to know what he is about before his ascen-
sion to the High Court than after.
  Until such time as his views are smoked out, and the questions
raised by his record are laid to rest, we cannot endorse Judge Ken-
nedy's nomination.
  Thank you.

                            FOR ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

              MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE:

                I am Audrey Feinberg, an attorney practicing in New
York City, and I am testifying here as a consultant to the
Supreme Court Watch project of The Nation Institute. Since
1984, Supreme Court Watch has monitored the record of poten-
tial and actual nominees to the Supreme Court, providing
information to the press, public interest groups, and the
Senate to foster a more informed debate concerning Supreme
Court appointments. The Nation Institute is a non-profit
private foundation that sponsors research, conferences and
other projects on civil rights, civil liberties, and public
policy issues.

                 Together with a team of attorneys, I have studied
Judge Kennedy's views for the Nation Institute. We have read
and analyzed his judicial opinions as well as his important
public statements in eight areas: (1) employment discrimi-
nation; (2) discrimination in education, housing, voting
rights and criminal law; (3) the right to privacy; (4) crimi-
nal procedure; (5) capital punishment; (6) freedom of speech,
freedom of the press, and the Freedom of Information Act; (7)
freedom of religion; and (8) prisoners' rights.

                 The results of this study have been released in the
attached Nation Institute report. I ask that this report be
included in the record as the Nation Institute's written
                                     548

testimony. The Introduction to the Report summarizes its
conclusions, and lists several questions concerning Judge
Kennedy's record.

                 The Nation Institute urges the Committee to examine
the Introduction, as well as the entire report and to investi-
gate the questions raised within it before voting on the
confirmation of Judge Kennedy. The choice of the person to
fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court is no less important
now than it was when Judge Bork was nominated. If confirmed,
Judge Kennedy is likely to serve on the Supreme Court well
into the 21st century. With this in mind, the Senate has a
responsibility to continue to exercise its advice and consent
powers, and to ensure that it has carefully evaluated his
record.
                                         549

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Mr. Wallace.
  Mr. WALLACE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has con-
ducted a thorough review of all of Judge Kennedy's opinions in
criminal cases, some 120 in number.
  We have surveyed all of our members who practice in the ninth
circuit for input on his professional qualifications.
  The result is a 50-page report which was furnished to the com-
mittee last week, and which is summarized in my written state-
ment.
  Since our report takes a position of no opposition to Judge Ken-
nedy's nomination, we would not ordinarily feel a need to testify.
The report should speak for itself.
  But this committee will be hearing later from a panel of eight
law enforcement witnesses characterizing Judge Kennedy's record
on criminal law issues from a law enforcement perspective.
  Our concern is that this would leave the committee with only
half the picture. Under this Nation's adversarial system of crimi-
nal justice, the search for truth--that is, the pursuit of the whole
picture--requires an equal opportunity for responsible input from
both sides.
  We believe this is just as true in the halls of Congress as it is in
the courtroom. We feel it would be irresponsible of us not to speak
up now to share our perspective with the committee to ensure the
fullest possible record for the Senate's deliberations.
  This is not to say that we come out 180 degrees opposite from the
law enforcement community. The main difference is probably that
we have analyzed his record from a very critical point of view
rather than from a friendly one.
  But our final conclusions are probably similar. We have a high
respect for Judge Kennedy, for his grasp of criminal issues, his in-
stinct for fairness, and his integrity and professionalism.
  We see him as a mainstream conservative. He approaches cases
with a general presumption that the Government is correct, but ap-
pears to entertain all arguments fairly and with an open mind.
  He respects precedent, and is careful to make his opinions no
broader than they need to be to address the case before him.
  We do, however, have some serious concerns. We do not accept
his pragmatic theory of both the exclusionary theory and the Mi-
randa decision.
  The exclusionary rule is not a mere tool for deterring police mis-
conduct. The Supreme Court, in creating the rule in 1961, said that
the rule is an essential part of both the fourth and the 14th amend-
ments.
  And this is not just a matter of the Warren Court pushing the
law, as Judge Kennedy said yesterday, to its verge. Way back in
1914, in the Weeks case, the Supreme Court held, nine to nothing,
that if evidence seized in violation of the fourth amendment can be
used against an accused, quote, his right to be secure against un-
reasonable searches and seizures is of no value, and might as well
be stricken from the Constitution, end quote.
   We are impressed that Judge Kennedy respects this right, and
the exclusionary rule itself. But we would hope that he could grow
to be less concerned with the rule's pragmatic function, upon
                                              550

which he premises his support for the good faith exception, and
more sensitive to its constitutional essence, the absolute right of in-
dividuals to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.

  Nothing in the fourth amendment, or in any constitutional provi-
sion, either expressly or in spirit, purports to allow violations of
the Constitution if only they are done with good intentions.

  On the Miranda warnings, which are fundamentally grounded in
the fifth and sixth amendments, we would add our hope that before
Judge Kennedy goes about finding them unworkable, and tinkering
with them, he would bear in mind their function of giving sub-
stance to constitutional protections for society's underclasses.

  Attorney General Meese and Ivan Boesky do not need the warn-
ings when they come under criminal investigation. They already
know their rights.

  But the warnings are absolutely irreplaceable for the uneducated
and unsophisticated individuals suspected of crime.

  We are also concerned about Judge Kennedy's occasional willing-
ness to discount as harmless error some serious procedural lapses
by the government against unsympathetic defendants. I refer the
committee to the governmental misconduct cases discussed in our
report.

  We are also concerned about a possible insensitivity to the sixth
amendment right to counsel, in the Gouveia case, cited in our
report, where he took the position that an individual's constitution-
al right to counsel does not exist until indictment, even where a
prisoner was already being punished for a crime he had not yet
been convicted of, or even charged with.

  Finally, we share the concerns about his record on sex discrimi-
nation that were voiced earlier this afternoon, because of what it
may say about his overall sensitivity to individual rights.

  In the final analysis, however, these are matters of disagree-
ment, not disqualification.

  The National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers has only
opposed one federal judicial nominee in its entire 29 history:
Robert Bork. And our concerns about Judge Kennedy's sensitivity
to individual rights, his openmindedness, or the possibility of him
having an ideological agenda, are infinitesimal compared to those
surrounding the Bork nomination.

  Thank you.

                                                 REGARDING
                       THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE ANTHONY KENNEDY
              TO BE ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT

                                          DECEMBER 17, 1987

        Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Committee, I
am honored to testify today on behalf of the National Association
of Criminal Defense Lawyers regarding the nomination of Ninth
Circuit Judge Anthony Kennedy to be an Associate Justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court.

        NACDL is the only national bar association devoted solely to
maintaining a fair balance between the power of the state and
the rights of individuals in criminal cases, and to the
independence and expertise of the criminal defense bar.

         Immediately after President Reagan announced his intention
to nominate Judge Kennedy, we canvassed our members who practice
in the Ninth Circuit, for information about the nominee and his
qualifications. At the same time, a committee of NACDL experts
in major substantive areas of criminal law began an in-depth
review of some 120 opinions Judge Kennedy has written or joined
                                     552

in involving criminal justice issues. I am here today to present
our findings to the Committee.

                                                   SUMMARY
         In the area of criminal law, Judge Kennedy may be
characterized as a moderate conservative. He approaches cases
with a general presumption that the government is correct, but
appears to entertain all arguments fairly and with an open mind.
         Perhaps the most striking difference between him and the
Administration's first nominee for this vacancy, Judge Robert
Bork, is the apparent lack of any broad ideological bias or
agenda. Although he has displayed an occasional eagerness to
discount as "harmless error" some serious procedural lapses by
the government against unsympathetic defendants, he appears
generally able to treat procedural issues on their own merits, to
analyze and decide them separately from issues of guilt or
innocence, with appreciation for their importance in assuring a
fair trial and safeguarding vital individual rights. During his
tenure on the Ninth Circuit, he has reversed 30 percent of the
criminal convictions he has reviewed, compared with a national
average of 12 percent.
        The strongest common thread among Judge Kennedy's opinions
and among comments from attorneys who have argued before him is
that he seeks the narrowest possible resolution of the issues,
confining his rulings to the facts of the case and relying
heavily upon precedent. He is, in other words, a sincere and
credible proponent of "judicial restraint," in stark contrast to
                                     553

the unrestrained, politically driven activism of Judge Bork. The
caution and restraint with which he crafts his rulings may
account for the fact that, in 90 percent of his opinions, there
is no dissent, a higher rate of unanimity than for most of his
colleagues.

        His opinions display a commendable breadth of understanding
of some fairly sophisticated criminal law issues. They are
generally thorough, well-researched, and accurate and fair in
their descriptions of controlling law and precedent.

        On a personal level, criminal defense attorneys--both those
who have argued before him in the Ninth Circuit and those who
have studied under him at the McGeorge School of Law--give him
very high marks for honesty, integrity, professionalism,
cordiality, and fairness.

        Viewed in the context of Justice Powell's record on criminal
law issues, there is no clear indication that Judge Kennedy will
shift the "balance" of the Court, either to the right or to the
left. Areas of similarity include a general "tough but fair"
approach to criminal cases, as well as substantive positions on
major issues such as the death penalty and the exclusionary rule.

                                             SPECIFIC AREAS
        Fourth Amendment: There has been much attention given to
Judge Kennedy's views on the issue of a "good faith" exception to
the exclusionary rule. I must point out that, contrary to common
public perception, Judge Kennedy did not create, or even endorse,
the good faith exception in his dissent in U.S. v. Leon, no. 82-

                                                    3
                                      554

1093 (January 19, 1983) (per curjam, unpublished).
         In that case, the government did indeed ask the Ninth

Circuit to recognize an exception to the exclusionary rule where
the police relied in good faith upon a warrant later determined
to be invalid. The court declined this invitation, and Judge
Kennedy wrote a very brief dissent--where he did not find it
necessary to discuss any notion of an exception to the
exclusionary rule, because he found the search warrant valid.
Explaining his disagreement with the majority on the question of
whether the warrant was supported by adequate probable cause, he
indicated that he would have given more weight than did the
majority to the conclusion of experienced narcotics officers that
certain patterns of behavior which might be viewed as innocuous
were in fact drug related, stating that "whatever the merits of
the exclusionary rule, its rigidities become unacceptably
compounded when the courts presume innocent conduct when the
only common sense explanation for it is on-going criminal
activity." In reversing the Ninth Circuit (468 U.S. 897), the
Supreme Court adopted the government's position, not Judge
Kennedy's

        He did, however, address the good faith issue in another
case. In U.S. v. Harvey, he suggested that, since the purpose of
the exclusionary rule is to deter improper police conduct, the
"rule is torn from its pragmatic mooring [if it is invoked where
the police officer] acted not only in good faith but also with
probable cause under exigent circumstances." 711 F.2d 144 (1983)
(Kennedy dissenting from a denial of a rehearing en bane). He

                                                    k
                                      555

has reiterated this "pragmatic" view of the exclusionary rule in
his testimony at these hearings on Monday, adding, at the same
time, that the current system "works much better than most people
give it credit for."

         Overall, he has supported suppression in 7 of 26 opinions
where the issue was squarely reached, including a few
particularly vigorous opinions in cases where he perceived an
extreme police violation of the security and privacy interests
protected by the Fourth Amendment.

        Most notable is his dissent in U.S. v. Penn. 647 F.2d 876
(1980), where he said it was "pernicious" and "dangerous as
precedent" for the police to have offered the defendant's 5-year-
old son $5 to tell them where in the back yard his mother buried
some heroin, stating that "indifference to personal liberty is
but the precursor ot the state's hostility to it."

         In another case, he ordered the suppression of heroin
discovered through a warrantless rectal search, even though there
was more than adequate probable cause to believe that the
defendant was carrying heroin in his rectum as he came across the
U.S. border. Kennedy criticized the search as unnecessarily
intrusive, and expressed a desire to protect the privacy rights
of innocent persons against such searches. U.S. v. Cameron. 538
F. 2d 254 (1976).

        Generally, he appears to appreciate the value of the
exclusionary rule in enforcing the Fourth Amendment--as long as
it remains "workable"--and to support the Leon good faith
exception (like Justice Powell). He may, however, be amenable to
                                     556

some further trimming of the areas where the exclusionary rule is
applicable.

         Governmental misconduct: In general, where questions of
prosecutorial or police misconduct are raised, Judge Kennedy
tends to come down on the government's side in all but the most
egregious cases.

         For example, in one bank robbery case, Judge Kennedy held
that the government's use of an informer to supply the getaway
car, to supply money for the disguises, and buy drinks at
meetings with the defendants did not rise to the level of
entrapment. U.S. v. Dearmore. 672 F.2d 738 (1982).

         And in a case charging defendants with possession of
dynamite, he wrote that it was harmless error for the government
to destroy the dynamite because there was no safe place to store
it, as long there was some reliable secondary evidence to prove
that the material destroyed actually was dynamite. U.S. v. Loud
Hawk. 628 F.2d 1139 (1979) (Kennedy concurring). Despite the
serious risks of abuse by government agents seeking to cover up
bungled handling of evidence, Judge Kennedy expressed confidence
that the courts would be able to weed out the occasional case of
government bad faith.

        On the other hand, he wrote a strong opinion condemning
police excesses in McKenzie v. Lamb. 738 F.2d 1005 (1984). In
that case, police officers recruited entertainer Wayne Newton to
help them catch two men suspected of selling stolen turquoise
jewelry. Even though the set-up failed to confirm their
                                   557

suspicions, the undercover officers staged a dramatic, brutal
arrest, during which they were asked for identification, and one
officer respond by pressing the barrel of his gun between the
suspect's eyes and saying, "that's about all [the identification]
you need." The men turned out to be completely innocent. Judge
Kennedy approved their civil rights action against the police,
calling the police conduct "outrageous and unjustifiable."

         And in a drug case, he joined in a dissent by Judge
Hufstedler lashing out at the government's payment of a $3 50
"reward" for a "successful investigation" by an informant, a
Mexican day laborer whose annual income was $4 00, citing "the
risk of trapping not merely an unwary criminal but sometimes an
unwary innocent as well." U.S. v. Hart. 546 F.2d 798 (1976).

         Death penalty: As Judge Kennedy noted on Monday, he has
never committed himself on the constitutionality of the death
penalty. He has, however, written four opinions in death penalty
cases, coming down on the defendant's side in two of them, on
solid procedural grounds, evidencing a tendency to err on the
side of granting relief in close cases.

         Even assuming that his silence on the death penalty itself
may be taken as approval of it, he would be no different from
Justice Powell, who dissented from the Supreme Court's 1972 anti-
death penalty ruling in Furman v. Georgia. 4 08 U.S. 238, and who
sided with the Court majority in approving the new post-Furman
crop of death penalty statutes in 197 6.
                                     558

         Right to counsel: Judge Kennedy's record here is mixed. In
one case involving an IRS summons to an attorney for fee
information to be used against the attorney's client, he proved
himself sensitive to important right-to-counsel issues by
endorsing the theory that fee information should be protected by
the attorney-client privilege where disclosure would implicate
the client in the very criminal activity for which the advice was
sought--a theory criticized by some conservative courts and
commentators. U.S. v. Hodge and Zweig. 548 F.2d 1347 (1977).

         But joining in a dissent in a prisoner rights case, he
endorsed the position that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel
should never attach before indictment, even where the prisoner
was being punished beyond the administratively-allowable maximum
for a new crime he was suspected of committing while in prison.
U.S. v. Gouveia, 704 F.2d 1116 (1983). The dissent said the
denial of counsel would cause no harm because "suspects are amply
protected by the 'ethical responsibility' of the prosecutor and
due process standards."

         This notion is fundamentally at odds with the Sixth
Amendment right to counsel and the functioning of the adversary
system of criminal justice. It is ludicrous to suggest that a
suspect, completely and indefinitely cut off from counsel,
family, friends, and even other prisoners, can expect to have his
rights "amply" represented by his sworn adversary. If the
Framers had expected that the prosecutor could fairly serve as
the guardian of the rights of the accused, they would have seen
no need for the Sixth Amendment.
                                    559

        However, Judge Kennedy's joinder in this opinion may, viewed
charitably, be attributable to judicial restraint on a novel
legal question. In addition, the offending language, although
showing an extraordinary lack of sensitivity to the right to
counsel, was mere obiter dictum, not directly authored by him.

        Confrontation clause: Of all the constitutional rights
affecting criminal cases, this is the one that Judge Kennedy has
been the most sensitive to, particularly where the trial judge
has restricted the defendant's right of cross-examination.

        However, in a very recent case, he ruled that the trial
judge had properly disallowed certain cross-examination, because
the defendant had already had an opportunity for "substantial"
other cross-examination. Bright v. Shimoda, 819 F.2d 227 (1987).
The dissenting judge vigorously criticized this attitude that the
defendant had suffered no harm because he had already received
"most" of the cross-examination he was entitled to, accusing
Kennedy of "sacrificing individuals' rights in the name of
judicial efficiency, or, to put it less politely, judicial
expediency."

        Miranda warnings: In the cases Judge Kennedy has decided
involving Miranda warnings, he has taken a balanced approach, and
has expressed no obvious hostility to the requirement for the
warnings, indicating acceptance of them in one case by stating
that they have become "central for law enforcement in every
jurisdiction." U.S. v. Scharf. 608 F.2d 323 (1979). At these
                                     560

hearings, however, he has said that the Miranda warnings are,
like the exclusionary rule, "pragmatic" rules, which "if they are
not working, should be changed."

         State-of-mind standards: Judge Kennedy has shown himself to
be a stickler for accurate jury instructions as to the level of
intent required by statute. Twice he has reversed convictions
where "willful blindness" instructions were given to the jury
under statutes containing the stricter "knowingly" standard.
U.S. v. Jewell. 532 F.2d 697 (1976); U.S. v. Pacific Hide and
Fur. 768 F.2d 1096 (1985). One reassuring aspect of these two
cases is that his rulings were not affected by any "white
collar/blue collar" distinctions--i.e., by the fact that the
defendant in one case was a drug dealer (Jewell), and in the
other, a landfill operator charged under the Toxic Substances
Control Act (Pacific Hide).

         He condemned other, similarly flawed intent instructions,
and reversed convictions, in U.S. v. Jones. 681 F.2d 610 (1982),
and U.S. v. Erskine. 588 F.2d 721 (1978).

                                           NACDL'S POSITION
         In terms of experience, temperament and integrity, Judge
Kennedy appears to be well qualified.
         In terms the substance of his judicial rulings on criminal
issues during his twelve years of service on the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, his views overall--although
unabashedly conservative--appear to be well within the

                                                      10
                                     561

"mainstream" of American jurisprudential thought.
        Because of serious substantive misgivings, however, NACDL is

unable to lend its affirmative support to the nomination. In the
Fourth Amendment area, for example, NACDL has long condemned the
notion of a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. The
Constitution unequivocally protects the right of the people to be
free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and requires
warrants supported by probable cause; it suggests nothing about
exceptions for well-intentioned constitutional violations by
judicial or law enforcement officers. NACDL believes that the
courts should be less concerned with the exclusionary rule's
"pragmatic moorings," and more concerned with its constitutional
essence.

        We similarly challenge his "pragmatic" approach to the
Miranda ruling. To our urgent plea that its constitutional
compulsion not be forgotten, we would add a note that the Miranda
warnings are of greatest value to society's underclasses. When
an Edwin Meese or an Ivan Boesky comes under investigation, he
does not benefit from the warnings; he already knows his rights.
The true value of the warnings is to give substance to
constitutional protections for the uneducated and unsophisticated
individual, and no other device can do this so well.

        Another fundamental concern of NACDL's is Judge Kennedy's
apparent presumption that law enforcement officers as a class are
generally more wise, more credible, and more trustworthy than
anyone else, particularly persons accused of crime. This
mindset is reflected in opinions such as Leon. Gouveia, various

                                                      11
                                     562

prosecutorial misconduct decisions, and Darbin v. Noursef 664
F.2d 1109 (1981)--where he said he would be "gratified" rather
than "shocked" to hear a prospective juror announce that law
enforcement officers are generally more trustworthy and honest
than prisoners. We do not think it appropriate for a judge to
find bias so gratifying; it is the job of the judge, the
magistrate, and the jury to maintain scrupulous impartiality, to
cut through all preconceptions and stereotypes, to consider only
the evidence formally presented.

         Moreover, NACDL is deeply concerned about the possibility of
a broader insensitivity to individual rights, as suggested by
Judge Kennedy's approach to issues of gender discrimination.
This problem is evidenced both in his opinions--such as AFSCME v.
Washington. 770 F.2d 1401 (1987) (rejecting comparative worth
approach to sex discrimination in employment cases under Title
VII), and U.S. v. Gerdom v. Continental Airlines. 692 F.2d 602
(1982) (allowing "weight discrimination" against female airline
flight attendants)--and in his long history of membership in
private clubs which discriminate against women and minorities.

         Nevertheless, in its entire 28-year history, NACDL has
opposed only one federal court nomination--that of Robert Bork--
and the doubts about Judge Kennedy's commitment to individual
liberties are infinitessimal compared to those surrounding the
Bork nomination.

         For all these reasons, NACDL cannot support, but does not
oppose, the nomination of Judge Kennedy to the Supreme Court.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Ms. Kiehl.
  Ms. KIEHL. Thank you. My name is Kristina Kiehl. And despite
my appearance on this panel, I am not a lawyer.
  I represent Voters for Choice.
  The hearings on the nomination of Robert Bork were a referen-
dum in part on the right to privacy. They generated an unprece-
dented national discussion of the constitutional boundaries between
government power and the private domain of the individual.
   In refusing to confirm the nomination of Robert Bork, the Senate
was confirming the sense of the American people that freedom
from government intrusion in private reproductive decisions is a
fundamental human right.
   Since the 1973 Supreme Court decision on abortion in Roe v.
Wade, the public is committed to keeping abortion safe and legal.
According to polling data analysis, in 1975, 75 percent of the Amer-
ican public supported legal abortion.
  More than 10 years later, the percentages are virtually identical,
with 76 percent favoring legal abortion.
  This is an informed judgment. A majority, 55 percent, know
someone who has had an abortion. And 82 percent of Americans
say they are not likely to change their minds on this issue.
  Thus, there is an important counterpoint to the legal discussion
of the right to privacy, and that is the unwavering determination
of a majority of Americans that deciding whether or not to bear a
child is a private decision.
  Let Judge Kennedy be reminded that it is not only a matter of
law, but a matter of deeply held personal belief that in certain pri-
vate decisions government has no place.
  If confirmed, Judge Kennedy will be accountable to the Constitu-
tion and to the laws. And this hearing will be the last time in his
judicial career that Judge Kennedy will be accountable directly to
the people and to their elected representatives.
  We hope these confirmation hearings will leave Judge Kennedy
with a sensitivity to people's lives, an understanding that the right
to a private choice about abortion is not a right, if some women can
make that decision only with government permission.
   In the end, liberty is not in the Constitution, it is not in the laws.
Liberty is in the lives of the people, or it is nowhere.
  The Court must look not only to the letter of the Constitution,
and not only to the letter of the law. The Court must look to the
lives of the people to see where liberty is alive.
  Judge Kennedy must look at the lives of women. Today, most
women can choose whether or not to bear a child, and can make
that choice without government interference. We call that the
right of privacy.
  But women dependent on medicaid, women in prison, women in
the Peace Corps, and native American women cannot make that
choice. A conscious government policy makes that choice impossi-
ble for them. You will look in vein for the right of privacy in their
lives.
  The Constitution and the courts have said women have the right
to decide, without government compulsion, whether to bear a child,
but if that woman is dependent on medicaid the Government is not
neutral. The Government has thrown its decisive financial clout on

     90-878 o - 89 - 19
                                      564
one side of her so-called privacy decision. Look at her life and you
will not see the right to privacy, for the Constitution and the
courts have failed her.

  Before Roe v. Wade there were two classes of women: those with
the money and the know-how to buy a safe, legal abortion, and
those who had to risk potentially deadly back-alley abortions, or
bring an unwanted child into this world.

  Today, medicaid policy divides American women into two classes:
those who can afford an abortion and those who cannot. Where is
the right of privacy when that right can only be bought for a price?

  We believe that Judge Kennedy does not intend to overturn Roe
v. Wade, but if we allow that right to be nibbled away at the edges,
then we will have created many classes of women who, in actual-
ity, have different rights depending on where they live, who they
know, and how much money they have.

  That is the situation we had before Roe v. Wade, when abortions
were available to women in some States, and to all women who had
the money to travel to a place where safe and legal abortions could
be obtained.

  We are heartened to hear Judge Kennedy affirm the constitu-
tional principle of privacy. We cannot oppose Judge Kennedy be-
cause we believe that he is committed to upholding a Constitution
that Judge Bork was determined to rewrite.

  But we cannot endorse him because we are not confident he is
willing to look beyond the theory of the law to assure that liberty,
and the right of privacy exists in the lives of all American women.

  For my daughters' sakes, I hope Judge Kennedy will prove his
conviction that liberty must be protected, not just in the law, but
in our lives. Thank you.

INTRODUCTION

       ince the 1973 Supreme Court decision on
       abortion in Roe a Wade, the public has re-
mained committed to keeping abortion safe and
legal. In 1975, 75% of the American public sup-
ported legal abortion. More than ten years later, the
percentages are virtually identical, with 76% favor-
ing legal abortions (21 % always; 55 % under certain
circumstances). The following report provides an
overview and analysis of recent major opinion polls
on abortion and other reproductive health issues.

     This report is based on a comprehensive com-
pilation (full copies available upon request) of opin-
ion data on abortion and birth control from the
following polls: Gallup, Harris, National Opinion
Research Center, ABC/ Washington Post, CBS/New
York Times, and NBC News. Representative ques-
tions and results were chosen for this report.

     The polling data indicate:

 A majority of Americans know someone who
has had an abortion (55%) and believe that abor-
tion will remain legal (74%).

 The public understands that undesirable results
could occur if abortion were made illegal. People
think the following would happen: Many women
would break the law and get illegal abortions
(88%); many women would be physically harmed
by illegal abortions (87%); welfare costs would rise
to pay for unwanted poor children (70%).

 Americans are vehemently opposed to terrorist
acts against women's health care centers. Seventy-
seven percent believe that such attacks amount to
campaigns of terrorism.

 Americans want to see sex education included in
high school instructional programs (75%) and favor
links between public schools and family planning
clinics so that teenagers can learn about contracep-
tives and obtain them (67%).

INFORMATION
AND SALIENCE

T he American public consistently has proved
       its support for safe and legal abortion This is
an informed judgment, and 82% of Americans say
they are not likely to change their minds on this
issue. People recognize the need for family plan-
ning- they use birth control (70%), and they know
people like them who have had abortions (55%).
Thus, despite the graphic and extreme terms that
have been used to challenge access to reproductive
health care, Americans are clearly committed to
preserving a full range of reproductive options.

TRENDS OVER

P ublic sentiment on abortion is essentially pro-
       choice. The vast majority of Americans (88%)
believe that abortion should be legal (54 % always,
34 % sometimes), and the degree of pro-choice sen-
timent depends on the circumstances. Very strong
pro-choice advocates constitute between 21 and
54 % of the electorate, while people totally opposed
to legalized abortion comprise between 10 and
22%.

     At the same time, however, people express am-
bivalence about abortion and are often reluctant to
enter the decision on behalf of others. Most Ameri-
cans are uncomfortable taking an absolutist stand
on abortion; they believe abortion is a private deci-
sion which depends on the individual situation.
Because people can become uncomfortable when
asked to enter the debate, they sometimes qualify
their responses if forced to evaluate specific
circumstances.

     Americans unhesitatingly support choice in the
cases of rape, incest, danger to the health of the
mother or birth defects. When the circumstances
reflect what people perceive as "sex without
responsibility", people are less comfortable giving
carte blanche. Despite this discomfort, the public
recognizes the need for abortion as a last resort.
They want this choice treated in a responsible man-
ner, and pro-choice sentiments are highest when
the decision is left to a woman and her doctor
(74%).

LEGALITY AND
MORALITY

Most Americans (74%) believe that abortion
          will remain legal in the United States.
They recognize, however, that under the second
term of the Reagan Administration, government ac-
tion will make it harder for women to get abortions
(56%).

     Efforts to restrict access to reproductive choice
have been couched in terms of moral debate.
However, Americans have refused to accept the
abortion debate in the black and white terms of
moral or immoral. When given the opportunity to
say that abortion is immoral, only 37% of Ameri-
cans were willing to do so; 58% indicated either
that abortion is moral or not a question of morality.
While people may be uncomfortable with abortion,
most (66%) think it is the best course in a bad
situation.

     Moreover, polling data also show that people
recognize the consequences of making abortion il-
legal. High percentages of the public predict the
following negative effects if abortion were made il-
legal: Many women would break the law by getting
illegal abortions (88%); many women would be
physically harmed by illegal abortion (87%);
welfare costs would rise to pay for unwanted poor
children (70%). People's ambivalence about abor-
tion is partly due to their desire to have people
practice better birth control (62%) However, few
people (27%) believe that making abortion illegal
would improve the moral tone of the country.

A mericans believe that their religious leaders
         have a right to their own beliefs regarding
abortion, but Americans do not approve of bringing
politics into the pulpit. Sixty-seven percent of the
public think it is inappropriate for religious leaders
to urge them to vote for or against a political can-
didate because of the candidate's stand on abortion.

T he public is outraged by recent bombings of
       women's health care centers. Most think
these attacks amount to a campaign of terrorism
(77%) and believe there is no justification for these
bombings. Americans believe such bombings are
criminal acts (85%) and stress that it is not the
American way to resort to violence when there is
disagreement over national policy (81%).

OPTIONS

People want options in addition to abortion.
       They are very concerned about teenage
pregnancy (84%), and parents express a great deal
of anxiety about having little control over their
children's sexual activity (64%). Many people favor
increased discussion of sexual topics as a way to
decreasing the number of teenage pregnancies
(62%), and they want to see sex education included
in high school instructional programs (75%). The
majority of people favor links between public
schools and family planning clinics so that
teenagers can learn about contraceptives and obtain
them (67%) Thus, Americans advocate a full range
of options, including sex education, effective birth
control, and legal abortion, as solutions to teen
pregnancy and other sexuality-related problems.

ABORTION

Finally, when people are given the opportu-
       nity to vote on this issue, they clearly
demonstrate support for safe and legal abortion for
all women. In twenty out of twenty-one state and
local ballot measure contests since 1978, voters
have reaffirmed support for a woman's right to
choose. The only anti-abortion ballot measure to
win, in Colorado, did so by less than one percent of
the vote. Most of these ballot measures, seventy-
five percent, would have outlawed state funding for
abortions.

CONCLUSION

T he American public has demonstrated its
        strong and consistent support for legal
abortion. Repeated efforts to sway the public
against abortion through extreme and graphic
means have been unable to diminish this stable
support for legal abortion. Despite all the debate,
the public remains committed in its opinions and
its votes to keeping abortion safe and legal.

     The public recognizes the need for family plan-
ning: people use birth control and know others like
them who have had abortions. In addition, the vast
majority of Americans support access to sex educa-
tion, effective birth control, and legal abortion as
solutions to teen pregnancy and related problems.
Americans are clearly committed to preserving a
full range of reproductive options.

  The CHAIRMAN. MS. Kiehl, you have just proven that you need
not be a lawyer to be eloquent in speaking about the law.

  Ms. KIEHL. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Alabama.
  Senator HEFLIN. MS. Feinberg, would you give me a little more
information on The Nation Institute. I am not familiar with it alto-
gether. Would you give us some information on your membership,
and various details about the organization.
  Ms. FEINBERG. Well, The Nation Institute is funded solely from
private contributions from foundations and individuals who wish to
support civil liberties and civil rights.
  It is primarily a research and educational organization. It spon-
sors research and conferences in the civil rights and civil liberties
areas. Some of its recent projects include "Justice Watch," a news-
letter that looks over Justice Department policies.
  Recently there was a conference held for journalists on "The
Journal of Critical Opinion." In addition The Nation Institute has
the Supreme Court Watch Project which has studied, in a scholarly
way, by lawyers, the records of Supreme Court nominees.
  So, overall, its policy is to promote education and to inform the
public on important issues of civil liberties.
  Senator HEFLIN. And what is its membership, primarily? I mean
where, in what locations?
  Ms. FEINBERG. It is not a membership organization in the sense
that we solicit members as opposed to funding. There is a board of
directors of The Nation Institute. There is also an advisory board of
the Supreme Court Watch Project, and the money that is collected
is used to sponsor research.
  And there is also a network of volunteers, such as myself, that
volunteer our time to help out with these research projects.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, does the funding come from primarily
foundations? Where does the funding come from?
  Ms. FEINBERG. I know that it is from foundations and from indi-
viduals, but it is all private money.
  Senator HEFLIN. I believe that is all.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator Specter.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very
much for your testimony. I would be interested to know if you
would care to say how you would vote, if you had to on Judge Bork,
if you had to say yes or no. Ms. Kiehl, what do you say?
  Ms. KIEHL. Judge Bork? I assume you mean Judge Kennedy. You
know how I feel about Judge Bork.
  Senator SPECTER. I did mean Judge Kennedy.
  Ms. KIEHL. Honestly, as I said I am not a lawyer. The Bork hear-
ings were a real education for me, and it was really clear to me
how I felt on that, for the first time we came out on that, for the
first time ever.
  Are you going to make me say in front of the public how I would
vote if I were in your shoes
  Senator SPECTER, YOU do not have to say. I just ask you if you
care to answer?
  Ms. KIEHL. I think
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU can say you do not care to answer.

            90-878 0 - 8 9 - 2 0
                                         596

   Ms. KIEHL. I think that I am holding out hope that in fact Judge
Kennedy is open to hear about the lives of women, and I trust you
to make a really wise decision on that, as you have done in the
past.

  Senator SPECTER. MS. Feinberg, would you care to
  Senator HEFLIN. YOU can say you are undecided, to Senator Spec-
ter and myself.
  Ms. KIEHL. That way I would get a lot of public attention as well.
  Senator SPECTER. Would you care to say? Yes or no?
  Ms. FEINBERG. All I can say, really, is that we could not endorse
him at this time because of a number of his troubling decisions,
and it would be my hope that the Senate through written ques-
tions, or other means, would try to probe him on the parts of his
record that have not been gone into yet, and I would like to with-
hold final judgment on him until we have those answers from him.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Wallace, yes or no? Would you care to say?
  Mr. WALLACE. With an explanation. The National Association of
Criminal Defense Lawyers has tried studiously not to take a posi-
tion either for or against the nomination, but, speaking for myself,
I think that I have enough faith in his genuine belief in individual
rights, and his ability to grow over the next couple of decades on
the bench, that I would basically be optimistic that he can be a
good Supreme Court Justice, and if I had a vote I would probably
vote for him.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Wallace, you have said that you have some
reservations about Judge Kennedy on the Miranda decision, and
you raise a question, or you make a comment that "Some people
need Miranda warnings more than others."

  Would you say that Miranda warnings ought not to be given to
people who know their rights, like attorneys general, or sophisticat-
ed defendants, or lawyers?

  Mr. WALLACE. I certainly do not want to be seen as proposing a
needs test for constitutional rights.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, how about it? If a person knows their
rights, how about the author of the little card with the five warn-
ings?

  Mr. WALLACE. Well, that is the point of the waiver process, to de-
termine whether a person knows his rights and can knowingly
waive them. But the primary value of the warnings is of course to
inform those who do not already know their rights.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I think it is important to note that the
Miranda warnings have to be given to everyone, whether the
person is learned in the law, a chief of police, a district attorney, a
Supreme Court Justice. Everyone has to get the Miranda warnings,
regardless of station in life.

  I have just one question on a case, Mr. Wallace, and that is a
case that I had referred to earlier, and it is the case of Burr v. Sul-
livan, a criminal case involving Judge Kennedy's upholding a dis-
trict court reversal of a conviction on the ground that there was
insufficient cross-examination of defense witnesses at trial.

  Where the clue comes early on in Judge Kennedy's opinion,
where he says that there was no physical evidence linking the de-
fendant to the arson. And what he is really saying here in a very
                                         597

hypertechnical sense, that he reverses the conviction where there
had been cross-examination.

  One was on a motion to strike, and the other was in a closing
speech, and went really far beyond the concern or solicitude that
judges characteristically give to defendants' rights.

  I discussed the case with him in a private session and asked him
why he went so far, and that case seems to me to be a pretty sound
indicator of a very sensitive concern for rights of a defendant, and I
wonder if you agree with that?

   Mr. WALLACE. Yes, I do. You have identified what I think, and
what our report concludes is his strongest area in constitutional
issues affecting criminal defendants, and that is the confrontation
clause.

   His cases respecting the confrontation clause are very sensitive,
sensitive to the right of cross-examination, and to giving real sub-
stance to it, and this is an excellent example of a case where he
went further than he had to and expressed more indignation than
he had to, and picked the record apart more than was actually
called for.

   Senator SI'ECTJA. <>rhaps too much? Cannot have too much?
   Mr. WALLACE. I do not 'lvrk any level of attention to detail, and
to every aspect of an individual's rights can be too much.
   Senator SPUJTER. HOW about protection for the State?
  Mr. WALLACE. I believe that the State's interests ought to be
weighed equally on the scales of justice.
   Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Wallace. Thank
you, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you all. I think that I announced at the
outset of this hearing, the hearing record will remain open until
we reconvene. There will be additional questions submitted by me,
personally, and by the committee on behalf of Members of the
Senate, from Senator Levin, and others, who have indicated they
want to ask questions of the judge.

  The full record of those questions and answers will be published.
  You have all made a very fine contribution, we appreciate your
candor, and quite frankly, the scholarship you brought to this proc-
ess, and the eloquence.
   Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.
   Ms. KIEHL. Thank you.
   Ms. FEINBERG. Thank you.
   Mr. WALLACE. Thank you.

                                   JUDGE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY

         My name is Robert B. Mckay. At New York University School
of Law I teach constitutional law and professional
responsibility. I am a former Dean of that school and former
President of the. Association of the Bar of the City of New York;
but I speak for myself alone, and for no institution.

         My acquaintance with Judge Kenned" is not extensile, but has
left me with an extemely favorable impression of his intellectual
capacity, his integrity and his congenial personality. Our
mutual interest arises out of shared admiration for one
document and one institution. The institution we both admire is
the McGeorge School of Law in SacarraentO/ California, where Judge
Kennedy has taught constitutional law for many years.

         The document in which we share an interest is the
Constitution of the United States. His respect for that
venerable instrument, as its meaning evolves over time, shiner;
through his opinions, his speeches, and through the admiration of
successive generations of his students who enthusiastically
endorse his nomination. I know well how difficult it is to
persuade students of any view which they believe conflicts with
their own opinions.

         Undoubtedly, Judge Kennedy's views and mine are likely to
diverge on some constitutional questions -- perhaps even more
than would be the case with some hvpothetical 'candidate never to
be nominated in the real world. I find nothing novel in
differences on constitutional issues. Alas, I find no one on the
present Supreme Court, and no previous incumbent who got it right
all the time, at least when compared with my own views of what is
right and what is wrong. The important point is that Judge
Kennedy's views, now extensively on the record, demonstrate two
things that I consider imporant: First, the views he has
expressed are in the mainstream. Whether a little to the right
or a bit to the left is less significant than the manifest
indication of an interest to stay with the main current. Second,
his written product demonstrates a respect for precedent. Like
any intellectually capable member of the Court, he may from time
to time seek further movement in the law; but there is no
evidence of a desire for abrupt departures from carefully
developed doctrines of the law.

         I will close, perhaps frivolously, by quoting the letter I
sent to Judge Kennedy when the President announced his
nomination. This is the whole text:

        Dear Tony:
                 Finally, the President has got it riqht.
                 Congratulations and best wishes!
                                            Sincerely,
                                            Bob McKav

   Professor BATOR. Mr. Chairman, I have known Judge Kennedy
since he was a student at the Harvard Law School, and was a stu-
dent in my class in administrative law. But that is not his only
qualification for being on the Supreme Court.

   I have followed his career since then with attention and admira-
tion. I will be very brief because it seems to me that the song that
is being sung at these hearings is very clear. Judge Kennedy is one
of the most admired and admirable judges on the federal bench.

   The CHAIRMAN. Excuse me. Would you all please clear the hear-
ing room, and would the officer ask them to carry the conversation
out the door, please. Thank you. I am sorry.

   Professor BATOR. He is admired, and an admirable judge, and he
is admired and is admirable for his qualities of care, fairness,
thoughtfulness, openmindedness, and devotion to the rule of law.

  He clearly is one of the outstanding jurists of the country. He
does not have an explicit dogmatic constitutional philosophy, it
seems to me, but underneath his opinions there appears a very
firm philosophy of devotion to justice, devotion to law, of modesty
and restraint in exercising the power, the immense power of the
judge, and the courage and the willingness to speak out on behalf
of the law and the Constitution, where that is required.

  He has made an enormous impression, in his quiet way, on the
law of the country. He is eminently qualified to be a Justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court.

  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Professor, you are one of the eminent professors
in the country. In light of the hour, I yield to my colleague from
Pennsylvania.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Profes-
sor Bator, thank you for joining us, but I think I will waive any
questions at this time, too.
  The CHAIRMAN. Professor, you are welcome to catch your plane.
  Professor BATOR. Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. We appreciate your testimony and I am going to
literally give you a copy of those questions on the way out the door,
if I could. Thank you.
  I thank the rest of the panel for being so gracious. Now if we
could hear testimony in the order in which you were called. Mr.
Plant, if you would be first.
   Mr. PLANT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the com-
mittee. I am an attorney-at-law engaged in private practice in Sac-
ramento, California. I am a past president of the State Bar of Cali-
fornia and of our Sacramento County Bar Association. I am appear-
ing before you to vigorously and enthusiastically support the nomi-
nation of Judge Kennedy from the perspective of a practicing
lawyer in his hometown, who has for almost 25 years known Judge
Kennedy as a lawyer and then as a judge, both personally and by
his local reputation.
   As a practicing lawyer, he was known for absolute integrity, for
hard work, for superior intelligence sensibly applied to his client's
problems, for accommodation and fairness in his dealings, for high
quality work and excellent results.
   I can personally attest to those qualities having dealt with him,
and I particularly recall an instance where we were in some hard
                                                   603

negotiations regarding mineral rights, representing clients with ad-
verse interests. They were difficult negotiations but were amicably
and mutually settled to the satisfaction of our clients, due in no
small part to his contribution to that process.

   Although that was many years ago and was early in his career,
those same qualities, which to my mind are essential for a fine
judge, have marked his service as a judge.

   Now there are other witnesses who have appeared before you
who are better able than I to comment on his legal decisions, but I
am here from the standpoint of personal knowledge and local repu-
tation to tell you that Judge Kennedy possesses in full measure the
necessary traits for the high position to which he has been nomi-
nated.

   He is extremely industrious. He is very intelligent. He is scholar-
ly, as shown not only by his legal opinions but his long service as a
professor at law school. He is very objective. He is, as many wit-
nesses have already told you, open-minded, and collegial in his op-
erations, not doctrinaire, not inflexible. He is firm but sensitive
and compassionate.

   Also I must tell you that based on 38 years of practice and much
of it in the courts I believe that the qualities of a judge, of a fine
judge are the qualities of a fine person, and Judge Kennedy has
those qualities. Bad news travels very fast in Sacramento, and I
have never heard anything either by rumor or personal knowledge
which in any way would shed doubt on him as a man of the highest
integrity and probity.

   I urge this committee to make a favorable recommendation on
the confirmation of Judge Kennedy.

                                   STATEMENT OF FORREST A. PLANT
                  Mr. Chairman and distinguished members of the Committee:
                  I am an attorney at law engaged m private practice
in Sacramento, California. I am a past President of The State
Bar of California and of our Sacramento County Bar Association
and have also been a Regent of the American College of Trial
Lawyers. It has been my privilege to serve as a member of the
Judicial Council of California, a constitutional state agency,
and am presently acting as Vice-Chairperson of the California
Law Revision Commission.
                  I appear before you to vigorously and enthusiastically
support the nomination of Judge Kennedy from the perspective
of a practicing lawyer in his home town, who has for almost
twenty-five years known Judge Kennedy as a lawyer and then as
a judge, both personally and by local reputation.
                 As a practicing lawyer, he was known for absolute
integrity, for hard work, for superior intelligence sensibly
applied, for accommodation and fairness in his dealings, for
high quality work and for excellent results. I can personally
attest to his possession of those qualities from an instance
when he and I were representing clients with adverse interests
in attempting to reach an agreement regarding mineral rights.
 They were difficult negotiations, but a mutually satisfactory
compromise was ultimately and amicably reached, due m no small
                                      605

part to his participation in the process. Although that was
many years ago and it was early in his legal career, those same
qualities, which are to my mind essential for excellence in
judicial performance, have marked his service as a judge.

                  There are other witnesses, as well as the judge himself,
who are better able than I to comment on his decisions while
on the Court of Appeals. I am in an excellent position, however,
based on local reputation and my personal knowledge, to say
to you that Judge Kennedy possesses in full measure the necessary
traits for the high position to which he has been nominated.
He is extremely industrious; he is very intelligent; he is scholar-
ly, as evidenced not only by his opinions but by his years of
teaching at the law school level; he is objective; he is open-minded
and collegial, not doctrinaire or inflexible; he is firm, but
sensitive and compassionate.

                 Based upon my 38 years of practice, with considerable
emphasis on litigation, it is my observation that most excellent
judges also possess superior human qualities. Judge Kennedy
is such a person. Bad news travels fast in Sacramento, and
I'm not personally aware, nor have I ever heard even so much
as a rumor, of any circumstance that would shed doubt on him
as a person of the highest moral character and probity.

                 I urge this committee to make a favorable recommendation
on the confirmation of Judge Kennedy. All the people of the
nation would be well served by him.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Ms. KUHL. And I failed to mention you are a former Deputy So-
licitor General in your introduction.
  Ms. KUHL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a privilege to be on a
panel with such distinguished members of the California Bar, and I
am pleased and honored to have the opportunity of being here to
testify in support of the nomination of Judge Anthony Kennedy to
be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
  I clerked for Judge Kennedy in the years 1977 and 1978, which
was his third year on the bench, and I am now a partner in the Los
Angeles firm of Munger, Tolles and Olson. As you have mentioned,
Mr. Chairman, in the recent past I did serve with the Department
of Justice and had an opportunity to concentrate in appellate and
Supreme Court litigation in the Civil Division and also in the Solic-
itor General's Office.
  The CHAIRMAN. What years was that?
  Ms. KUHL. The Solicitor General's Office was in 1985 and 1986. I
began with the Justice Department in 1981, I believe.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Ms. KUHL. I would like to address two aspects of Judge Kenne-
dy's qualifications for the bench. First, his general approach to de-
ciding cases; and, second, the personal qualities he brings to his
work. And, if this begins to sound a little bit repetitive with regard
to what other witnesses are saying, I hope that it is convincing you
that you are getting a true picture of the man both as judge and as
a person.
  In terms of Judge Kennedy's approach to deciding cases, judging
is, of course, more an art than a science, and so it is not always
easy to describe a judge's approach to case decision. But I would
like to point to several characteristics of Judge Kennedy's decision-
making: his practicality, his collegiality, his courage and restraint.
I know the committee's time is short, so I will just touch briefly on
each of these.
  Judge Kennedy's approach to the law is above all practical, and
by that I mean that he is concerned about how a legal principle
will work in practice. He, as you know, has been a trial lawyer and
a general practitioner, and he understands how lawyers approach
their representation of clients, he understands the discovery proc-
ess and its potentials for abuse, he understands how a case is actu-
ally tried to a judge or to a jury, and he understands the types of
matters that are best decided at the trial level.
  Judge Kennedy understands also that appellate judges, through
their decisions, act essentially as supervisors of a very complex
legal system. He therefore thinks carefully about how each rule of
decision that he sets forth in an opinion will affect the interplay of
that legal system.
  Judge Kennedy also places great importance on collegiality. I
have heard him observe that collegial decision-making is in fact
different from individual decision-making. He strives to have good
relationships on the ninth circuit with judges with whom he tends
to disagree as well as with judges with whom he tends to agree.
   He also has great respect for what is called the Law of the Cir-
cuit. That is, he decides cases consistently with cases previously de-
cided by the ninth circuit. If he disagrees with circuit precedent, he
                                                  607

may seek to have the issue reviewed by the ninth circuit en bane,
but he does not simply ignore prior precedent or seek to distinguish
it on some spurious basis.

  Judge Kennedy also has demonstrated courage in his decision-
making, and that quality is important especially for Justices of the
Supreme Court, who are faced more often than most judges with
cases in which the branches of our government are pitted against
each other. An example of Judge Kennedy's courage in striking
down an action that cannot be squared with the Constitution is his
decision in Chadha v. Immigration and Naturalization Service. In
addition, he has been just as vigilant in halting or reversing execu-
tive branch actions when he has found them contrary to law.

  While Judge Kennedy shows courage in striking down improper
actions of the political branches, he also shows restraint in exercis-
ing this judicial power. His own personal views of right and wrong
do not govern his decisions. He always tries to follow the letter and
intent of the statute or Constitution, letting justice be defined by
the written law rather than by the feelings or beliefs, however sin-
cere, of himself and his fellow judges.

  I especially remember one case where Judge Kennedy articulat-
ed personal distress about the particular consequences to the indi-
vidual plaintiff of a district court's decision. Nonetheless, Judge
Kennedy upheld the district court because he believed that that
result was in fact required by an honest application of the relevant
statute and of the existing circuit precedent.

  Turning then briefly to the personal qualities that Judge Kenne-
dy brings to the bench, he is a man of compassion, as I have just
noted, in his personal approach to trying to understand what is
happening to a plaintiff in a case. He is a man of great humility;
he is not someone who is influenced by the statements of others, by
deference to him, by people coming up to him and indicating he is
someone important. And I think humility is very important when a
person goes on the Supreme Court, which is a very isolated and
formal existence.

  Judge Kennedy has many other fine qualities. I know the com-
mittee's time is short. Suffice it to say that if Judge Kennedy is
confirmed the current Supreme Court Justices will be very lucky
indeed to have so genial a colleague and the country will be well
served by a jurist of proven integrity and ability.

  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And my thanks to the committee.

                                OF JUDGE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY
                       BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

                                           December 17, 1987
         I am pleased and honored to have the privilege of appearing
before this Committee in support of the nomination of Judge
Anthony M. Kennedy to be Associate Justice of the United States
Supreme Court. I was Judge Kennedy's law c]erk during his third
year on the bench, in 1977 and 1978. I am now a partner in the
Los Angeles law firm of Munger, Tolles and Olson. In the recent
past T served in the United States Department of Justice for five
years, where I had an opportunity to concentrate in appellate and
Supreme Court litiqation as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in
the Civil Division and as Deputy Solicitor General.

         I will address two aspects of Judge Kennedy's qualifications
for the High Court: first, his general approach to deciding
cases, and second, the personal qualities he brings to his work.

         The business of judging, of deciding cases, is complex.
Though some would wish for a system in which results are fully
predictable, and decisionmaking a matter of automatic application
of well-defired syllogisms, our legal system is not- so. Judging
is more art than science. Thus, it is not easv to explain or
analyze how a judge decides cases. But T will try to describe
several characteristicr. of Judge Kennedy's decisionmakina:
practicality, collegiality, courage, and restraint.
                                     609

                                                      - 2-

        Judge Kennedy's approach to the law is, above all,
practical. By that I mean that he is concerned with how a leqal
principle wil] work in practice. Judge Kennedy was a trial
lawyer and a general practitioner. He understands how lawyers
approach their representation of clients, the discovery process
and its potential for abuse, how a case is actually tried to a
judqe or jury, and what types of matters are best determined at
the trial level. Judge Kennedy understands that appellate
judges, through their decisions, are supervisors of a conplex
legal system. He thinks carefully about how each rule of
decision set forth in an opinion will affect the interplay of
that system.

         Judge Kennedy also places great importance on collegiality.
I have heard him observe that collegial decisionmaking is
different from decisionmaking by an individual judge. He strives
to maintain good relationships, based on mutual respect, with
other Ninth Circuit judges with whom he tends to disagree, as
well as with those with whom he usually agrees. I think he has
generally been successful in this effort. Judge Kennedy also
believes that there should be one, consistent body of precedent
within a circuit. Thus, he has qreat respect for the "law of the
circuit;" that is, he decides cases consistently with the cases
previously decided in the Ninth Circuit. If he disagrees with
circuit precedent he may seek to have the issue reviewed by the
Ninth Circuit e_n bane, but he does not simply ignore prior
precedent or purport to distincuish it on a spurious basis.
                                     610

                                                                        " 3 --

        Judge Kennedy has demonstrated ccmrage in his
decisionmaking. That quality is important for all judges, but is
especially vital for Justices of the Supreme Court who are faced
more often with cases in which the Branches of our Government are
pitted against each other. A Justice of the Supreme Court must
have the courage to confront the Political Branches if they
should act in contravention of our Constitution. Judge Kennedy
has faced and met that challenge. His decision in Chadha v.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, (which was upheld by the
Supreme Court), analyzed carefully, and then declared
unconstitutional, the legislative veto device that had been used
by Congress for decades in dozens of statutes. He has been as
vigilant ir halting or reversing Executive Branch actions when he
has found them contrary to law.

         But while Judge Kennedy has shown courage in striking down
improper actions of the Political Branches, he has shown
restraint in exercising this judicial power. His own personal
views of what is right and wrong do not govern his decisions. He
strives always to follow the letter and intent of statute or
Constitution, letting justice be defined by written law rather
than the feelings or beliefs, however sincere, of himself and his
fellow judges. I remember especially one case where Judge
Kennedy articulated great distress about the personal
consequences to the individual plaintiff of the district court's
decision. Nonetheless, Judge Kennedv upheld the district court
because he believed that that result was required by an honest
                                     611

                                                      _ 4-

application of the relevant statute and existing Circuit
precedent.

         This brings me to the personal qualities Judge Kennedy would
bring to his work on the Supreme Court. Judge Kennedy gave you
some idea of what kind of person and what kind of judge he is
when, in response to this Committee's questionnaire, he described
the key qualities cf a judge as "compassion, warmth, sensitivity,
and unyielding insistence on justice." T have already mentioned
Judge Kennedy's expression of sorrow and compassion for the
consequences of a particular statutory requirement to a
plaintiff. While he did not often articulate to his clerks his
personal feelings about cases, I believe his compassion and
sensitivity show through in his decisions.

         I would be remiss if I did not mention Judge Kennedy's
humility. Lawyers comment among themselves that men and women
often tend to change and to become aloof after they take the
bench. Judge Kennedy, however, has avoided th?t phenomenon. I
can recall his discomfort when lawers or others in Sacramento's
legal community would come up to him anr* areet him in an
obsequious manner, recognizing his status as one of Sacranonto's
highest ranking federal officials. Humilitv, it seems to me, is
an extremely valuable trait for one who i? to spend the rest of
his career in the very formal and isolated environment of the
 Supreme Court.

                                                     - 5-

        Finally, Judge Kennedy is unselfish. Whenever I speak to
someone who has met Judge Kennedy, I hear stories of his kindness
to others, of his doing small human acts as pimple as holding the
door for another judge's law clerk. When I clerked for Judge
Kennedy, any of his law clerks who could not be with family on a
holiday could be sure of an invitation to the Kennedys' own
family celebration. Perhaps this character trait is what makes
collegiality so important to him.

         Judge Kennedy has many other fine qu?lities, but I know the
Committee's time is short. Suffice it to say that if Judqe
Kennedy is confirmed, the current Supreme Court Justices will be
lucky indeed to have so genial a colleague, and the country will
be well served by a jurist of proven integrity and ability.

         Thank you egain for this opportunity to be here tcday. T
would be happy to answer any questions the Committee may ha^?.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Mr. Cartwright, welcome. Good to see you again.
  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very happy to
be here and pleased to have the opportunity to speak on behalf of
Judge Kennedy. I know the hour is late and I have been told that I
should be very brief, so I will summarize the remarks that I had
otherwise planned to make, and also will ask to have my written
paper or statement submitted into the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. The entire statement will be placed in the
record.
  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Thank you. Just a couple of brief words about
myself, so you will know where I am coming from. I am what is
known as a plaintiffs trial lawyer. This means that I specialize in
the handling of cases where individuals in our society have been
injured or harmed, whether by government, or insurance compa-
nies, manufacturers, or even private individuals. This harm can be
by way of personal injury, property damage, violation of their civil
rights, and oftentimes their economic rights as in business or com-
mercial cases.

  I had the privilege of being the president some years ago of the
Association of Trial Lawyers of America, commonly called ATLA,
and also the California Trial Lawyers Association, among other or-
ganizations.

  I have known Judge Kennedy for many years. I know his reputa-
tion in California. I have read a number of his decisions and quite
a few of his speeches. I can tell you without any qualifications
whatsoever that in California, where I come from, Judge Kennedy
is highly respected by all members of the bench and bar, without
exception, and without regard to their political persuasion. Paren-
thetically, in that regard, I am a Democrat. He is respected as a
man of superior intellect and the utmost integrity.

  Now just a few words about the qualifications of Judge Kennedy
that I am particularly interested in, and that is in whether or not
he is a judge who is interested in protecting, promoting and pre-
serving the rights of innocent people, who are harmed or injured in
our society, in obtaining redress.

  Judge Kennedy has given a number of speeches, primarily with
reference to the criminal field, and a constant theme that you see
running through his talks is the forgotten man, or the forgotten
person, and that is the victim of wrongdoing in our society. I know
from conversations with him that he is equally concerned about
the innocent victim of wrongdoing in our civil justice system, as
well as in the criminal justice system, and that if he becomes a
member of the Supreme Court that he will endeavor to the very
best of his ability to protect the rights of all innocent victims
whether in the criminal field or the civil justice field.

  I know that he has a very abiding belief in our tort system,
which is our civil justice system to rectify wrongs. He believes, as
do I, that it serves a very useful purpose, that it has a prophylactic
and therapeutic effect in not only providing compensation to the
person who has been injured, but also in helping to prevent inju-
ries in the future and preventing the same kind of wrong from oc-
curring in other cases.
                                         614

  Finally, I do not believe, as some people feared with reference to
Judge Bork, that Judge Kennedy is going to turn back the clock on
all of the wonderful safety progress, people progress, the civil
rights progress, and so forth, that we have made in this country in
the last 50 years. I don't think that at all.

  In my judgment, from my knowledge of Judge Kennedy and my
experience with him, I believe that he is a person who has a feeling
for people, that likes people. I feel he is sensitive. I think he is com-
passionate, and I think he is going to be a judge who will watch out
for the rights of all of our citizens in this country, and that he will
make a fine Supreme Court Justice. And I urge this committee to
affirm him. Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Mr. Cartwright.

                             By ROBERT E. CARTWRIGHT, ESQ.
                                   San Francisco, California

         This statement is filed in support of Judge Anthony
Kennedy's nomination to the United States Supreme Court.
I am senior partner in the San Francisco law firm of Cartwright,
Slobodin, Bokelman, Borowsky, Wartnick, Moore & Harris,
Inc. located at 101 California Street, 26th Floor, San
Francisco, California 94111. My practice and that of my
firm of some 23 attorneys is limited to the processing
and trial of civil cases only arising out of wrongful acts
or omissions of the government, manufacturers, insurance
companies, businesses and/or private individuals thereby
causing injury, harm or damage. The injury, harm or damage
may be personal injury, wrongful death, violation of civil
rights and what are commonly called business or commercial
torts to persons or companies involved in business.

         Our practice is overwhelmingly confined to the representation
of plaintiffs, i.e. the victims of said wrongful acts and
omissions as distinguished from representing the defendants
and/or the wrongdoers. Our focus thus is on obtaining
redress under the civil justice system for the victims
of wrongful acts and/or omissions and our concern with
the election and/or appointment of judges is in obtaining
                                     616

judges who have the courage, the heart and the desire to
protect the rights of innocent victims of civil wrongs
in our society when justice and equity indicates and mandates
that there should be a remedy for the wrong committed,
no matter whether same is by government, manufacturers,
insurance companies or other large vested interests and/or
individual tortfeasors.

         I have practiced in this particular specialty for
over 35 years with my offices during this time located
in San Francisco, California. During those years among
other honors, I have served as the President of The Association
of Trial Lawyers of America (ATLA - 1974-1975), the California
Trial Lawyers Association (CTLA - 1967-1968) and the San
Francisco Trial Lawyers Association (SFTLA - 1964-1965).
In 1985 I had the privilege of serving as President of
Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. This is a public interest
law firm which I helped found and which has its headquarters
in Washington, D.C. It has as members or partners therein
approximately 500 of the most dedicated and capable plaintiff
trial lawyers in America. This firm has been financed
by our members and is devoted to handling causes in the
civil justice field which have not historically been handled
or redressed by either the public sector or the private
sector.

         I have co-authored two books on products liability,
                                      617

have written many articles and have lectured on trial practice
and procedure as well as substantive aspects thereof in
most of the states, including Alaska and Hawaii. With
reference to appellate cases, I have had a number of personal
cases where I handled the appeal. Additionally in my capacity
as a member of the California Trial Lawyers Association
Amicus Curiae Committe for approximately 20 years and as
chairman for 12 years, I have participated in over 100
landmark California appellate court decisions during the
last 25 years, most of which were at the Supreme Court
level. I accordingly have had extensive experience at
the appellate level in the presenting of briefs and the
arguing of cases, albeit almost always on the side of the
plaintiff or victim. Attached hereto is my curriculum
vitae which sets forth in much greater detail my background,
experience and orientation.

         I have known Judge Kennedy for approximately 20 years
and am familiar with his reputation in California as a
distinguished scholar, lawyer and jurist. To my knowledge,
Judge Kennedy is uniformly held in the highest regard in
California by all members of the bench and bar. This is
without regard to their political persuasion and/or whether
they are plaintiff or defense lawyers.

         Judge Kennedy is considered to be a man with impeccable
credentials. He did his undergraduate work at Stanford
                                     618

and then went to Harvard Law School. He was a Phi Beta
Kappa in his undergraduate work at Stanford and is considered
to be a jurist with superb intellectual abilities.

         He has the distinction of having worked in a large
corporate type law firm and from there he took over his
father's general practice when his father died and thereafter
handled all kinds of cases, first as a sole practitioner
and then later in partnership for private individuals and
small businesses. He did this until he was appointed as
a judge of the United States Appeals Court in 1975. Since
his appointment to the bench in 1975, he has authored over
400 extremely well written and reasoned decisions and has
participated in over 1300 opinions. I have personally
read a number of his decisions and while I don't agree
with the holding in every one of them, I find that his
legal writing skills and analytical abilities are excellent.
He writes clearly, concisely and persuasively in setting
forth his point of view. He has a reputation of being
willing to listen to the attorneys who argue before him
and of being courteous and fair in his treatment of said
attorneys.

         With reference to his knowledge of constitutional
issues, it is significant in my opinion that Judge Kennedy
for approximately the last 20 years has taught constitutional
law in Sacramento at the McGeorge School of Law. His reputation
                                      619

as a teacher is excellent. It is my understanding that
he has been well received and extremely well liked by his
colleagues at McGeorge and by the students who he has taught.
He certainly understands not only our constitution but
the decisions which have been rendered through the years
interpreting the constitution.

         This leads us to the issues which I would like to
address and which are of vital concern to the ordinary
citizen in this country and particularly to those who either
have been or will become innocent victims of injury, damage
and/or harm, either to their persons, their personal relations
and/or in their business pursuits. Will Judge Kennedy
turn back the clock as many feared would be the case with
Judge Bork with reference to the tremendous advancements
and improvements that we have seen in recent years in the
fields of civil rights, personal rights, products liability,
medical malpractice and in the field of business or commercial
torts? Does he believe in our civil justice system and
in the right of individuals who have been wronged or harmed
to obtain redress? Does he believe in our tort system
and the right to vehicles and/or procedures to protect
and enforce the rights of our people?

         The answer to all of the above questions, in my opinion,
is that Judge Kennedy will not turn back the clock and
that he will be a vigorous and forceful enforcer of the
                                     620

rights of our citizens to obtain redress and justice under
our civil justice system. I have talked personally with
Judge Kennedy about a number of these issues. I have read
a number of his decisions. I have either read verbatim
or summaries of a number of his speeches that he has given
with reference to his views and I have personal knowledge
of his reputation. Judge Kennedy has told me personally
that he does believe in our tort system, that he understands
the wonderful therapeutic and prophylactic effect that
it has in preventing and/or deterring wrongful acts or
omissions, thereby saving injuries, lives and economic
damage to others in the future as well as compensating
those who have already been harmed. Judge Kennedy personally
after taking over his father's practice had the privilege
and opportunity of representing ordinary citizens in our
society and he understands the necessity of protecting
the rights of those who have been innocently harmed or
injured-

         He has spoken on the fact that the forgotten person
oftentimes, particularly in criminal cases is the victim,
and he has be*n vigilant in his opinions in endeavoring
to strike a proper balance between protecting the rights
of the victims and yet observing proper procedural constitutional
safeguards for the accused. While he hasn't participated
in as many tort cases as he has criminal, it is self evident
                                     621

to me, however, that this same philosophy of zealously
protecting the rights of victims against government, insurance
companies and others has been and will continue to be adhered
to and observed by Judge Kennedy in the cases that come
before him.

         There are a number of such civil cases which I could
cite, but just to illustrate, I will mention three. The
first is Ramirez v. United States of America, (1977) 567
F.R.2d 854 et seq. in which he held in an extremely well
written and reasoned opinion that an action may be brought
under the Federal Tort Claims Act to recover for the alleged
negligence of a government physician in failing to warn
a patient of the risk of a particular operation - i.e.
the failure to obtain a proper informed consent. Judge
Kennedy and his court held that this failure to obtain
a proper informed consent did not fall within one of the
exceptions to the Federal Tort Claims Act. It does not
allow recovery where there has been a misrepresentation
or deceit by a government employee. In the case of Morrill
v. United States, (1987) 821 F.R.2d 1426 et seq. Judge
Kennedy held that a go-go dancer at a government facility
who was assaulted by a Navy enlisted man and raped was
not precluded from recovery against the United States Government
under the Federal Tort Claims Act because of another exception
contained in the Federal Tort Claims Act, namely, that
                                      622

there can be no recovery for assault and battery by a government
employee. Judge Kennedv and his court held that.'^.KP government
could he held liable for its independent negligence in failing to
properly supervise and control the government facility, the
premises and the people in question.

          In Kalland v. North American Van Lines, (1983) 716 F.R.2d
570 et seq., the issue involved apportionment of liability
between two defendants. The issue involved a rather esoteric
issue, namely, the intertwining of the defendants' causal
connection with the accident as distinguished from their
percentage share of negligence under comparative negligence
principles. Judge Kennedy in a very clear and extremely well
written opinion points out that the apportionment between the two
defendants is to be made on the basis of their relative
percentage of negligence where the injury caused is indivisible
and it cannot be said which defendant caused the injury in
question.

          I believe that it is clear from reading Judge Kennedy's
decisions and from talking to him ard from reading his speeches
that he understands that neither the constitution and/or the
common law should be like a straight jacket and/or a stagnant
pond and that both must keep pace with the times, needs and
requirements of society. In a recent speech in Hawaii for
                                     623

example, he suggested that "Besides the constitution itself, the
courts and government must also heed an unwritten constitution
that consists of our ethical culture, our shared beliefs, our
common vision. . . . " He said this unwritten code is an
additional brake, an additional restraint on government powers.
While he didn't specify exactly how this may work, it isn't too
difficult to conclude from his remarks themselves that Judge
Kennedy would find in accordance with and approve those
fundamental concepts that all right thinking people believe in,
such as the right of privacy, the right to vote and the right to
travel from state to state, even though they aren't specifically
set forth in the constitution. Perhaps even more importantly
from the standpoint of the civil justice system and the right of
innocent victims such as those I represent to recover, I would
perceive this to nean that Judge Kennedy understands that there
are certain fundamental principals upon which this country was
founded and which still exist as taught to us in our churches, in
our schools and in our homes, namely, our "shared beliefs," such
as principles of good faith, fair dealing, business morality,
honesty and integrity and that if these are violated by anyone
including the government, insurance companies, manufacturers
                                      624

or other tortfeasors that there must be a remedy to allow
recovery for the violation and breach of these "shared
beliefs."

         In short, I believe that we will be in good hands
with Judge Kennedy and I urge his confirmation. I am confident
that he will go down in history as one of our truly great
Supreme Court justices and that he will make us proud.

  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Colley, it is a distinct pleasure to have you
here and, quite frankly, somewhat reassuring. You have been, if I
am not mistaken, president of a national bar. You have been a
man deeply involved in civil rights issues all your life, and I am
anxious to hear what you have to say about this gentleman.

  Mr. COLLEY. Thank you very much, Senator Biden. It is a pleas-
ure for me to be here also, and I can assure you that I would not be
here if I didn't have reasonable cause to believe that Judge Kenne-
dy will be an outstanding member of the Supreme Court of the
United States.

  I want to tell you that I am one of these people who have known
him for a long, long time. I even go further than that; I knew his
father. He practiced law in Sacramento. When I came to Sacra-
mento there was some question, believe it or not, whether I should
be admitted to the local bar association, even though I had passed
the State bar examination.

  The CHAIRMAN. What year was that?
  Mr. COLLEY. This was in 1949. And it was Archibald Mull, a local
lawyer, and Mr. Kennedy's father who at once took steps to see
that there were no barriers placed before me, and in fact they en-
couraged me to apply for membership in the American Bar Asso-
ciation, and of course I was accepted. You will have to remember
that at the time I am talking about black members were not wel-
come to the Los Angeles Bar Association. But in Sacramento, my
welcome was complete and total from the beginning, largely
through the work of two people. That was Archibald Mull and Mr.
Anthony Kennedy Sr. Well, it is not senior because their middle
initials are different. But anyway, I want to make that point very
clear.

  And, if Judge Kennedy went astray on racial issues, it happened
to him long after he left home. Now, I heard that he went to Stan-
ford. That might have had some influence on him adversely. I hope
not.

  The CHAIRMAN. Where did you go to school?
  Mr. COLLEY. Well, first I went to Tuskegee, in Alabama.
  The CHAIRMAN. Don't brag, just get to the end.
  Mr. COLLEY. I went to Yale, but I went there because Stanford
didn't welcome black people then, Columbia had a quota, and Har-
vard was too far from Harlem. So I went to Yale.
  The CHAIRMAN. And if I am not mistaken, you graduated with
distinction from Yale.
  Mr. COLLEY. Well, yes. That is because--I want you to know that
I am not from the Establishment. Everybody has been asking about
the Establishment.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU are sure sounding like it, though.
  Mr. COLLEY. NO, I am not a part of the Establishment. I was born
in rural Alabama, and I represent something I think is special in
America; and that is, you can come from anywhere and go any-
where if you really try. And I came from rural Alabama where I
was unfit for picking cotton from the very outset. My mother recog-
nized this and she encouraged me to read books, and, of course,
that was very important in my life. I ended up as an officer in the
Army, for instance. You will never know how much trouble it gave
me to lead a black company in the Solomon Islands and in the
                                                   626

Philippine Islands and in New Guinea, and people have asked me
"Why are all the people in your company black?" And I also recog-
nized racial segregation and the evils of it. I determined at that
time that something had to be done about this, and so I made the
bold move of deciding to go to law school.

  Now, my very good friend Joe Rauh was here today and I saw
him on the television screen. Joe and I served on a national board
for more than a dozen years together, and I can't remember a time
we differed. So when he testified this morning, I could only say,
"Lord, forgive him for he knows not what he does." I know Judge
Kennedy better than he does. He is drawing inferences from some
writings. I am offering direct testimony of my own observations
and my own beliefs.

  I have a prepared statement, which I offer in evidence--I am not
going to analyze again the cases of Judge Kennedy that I have ana-
lyzed in my paper. I will answer questions about them if anybody
wants to ask me.

  Judge Kennedy and I performed a service in Sacramento for
many years. We are both adjunct professors at the local law school.
He teaches constitutional law and I teach jurisprudence or philoso-
phy. We often have the same students. There is a great inter-
change between our students. Only the better students want our
courses anyway, because the other people are concerned about evi-
dence and contracts and what they call bread and butter courses. I
can tell you that from his students you get the best reports you get
from anyone, and there is just no doubt about it whatsoever.

  Now, I know Judge Kennedy has made mistakes in some of his
decisions. I don't agree with all of them, and I say that in my pre-
pared texts. But who is it among us who has never made a mis-
take? I don't know any such person as that.

  With reference to his membership in private clubs, I can tell you
that whenever he wanted to talk with me he would call me for
lunch, but he never asked me to go to the Sutter Club, which is one
of the clubs that has been mentioned, because he knew my views
about that club. My views go back for many, many years, when
they didn't tear it down in redevelopment. They tore down every
other private institution but left the Sutter Club because of the
power it represented. There is just no doubt about it.

  But long before he was a candidate for the job he is now about to
take he did, in fact, resign from the Sutter Club because of its dis-
crimination against women. That seems to me a great plus because
we have to realize that this business of not joining clubs which dis-
criminate is a part of a new enlightenment. This hasn't always
been the view in America. And, if we took from the Senate every
member who had ever joined one of these clubs, I doubt whether
you would get a quorum. And I know that is a distinguished body
and I respect it tremendously.

  So I don't think we need to take the past and transport it into
the present and say that everybody now who did not have the
views 10 years ago that we have now is some sort of bad person.
That is bad reasoning.

  I would submit my case and tell you, just by closing, that Judge
Kennedy embraces Brown v. School Board. He has said so many
times. He has never said anything to the contrary. And so far as
                                                  627

black people in America are concerned, that decision is our Magna
Carta, and he who embraces it embraces us. I want to return a
symbolic embrace of Judge Kennedy and ask you to do the same.

  Thank you.

            Testimony of NATHANIEL S. COLLEY, SR., Senior Partner, Colley, Lindsey, and
Coiley, Attorneys at Law, 1810 "S" Street, Sacramento, California 95814s In Support
of The Nomination of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy To The United States Supreme Court
Given Before The Judiciary Committee of Tht United States Senate on December _ .
1987.
Mr. Chair-nan, a m Members cf The Committee.

            M y P u r p o s e t o d a y i s t o e.pres'> i. / urr^L.a"' ~fii_d t'ld'n j.j'j':i m U H I T O 'u.c.y
M. Kenneay for confirmation as a merbe- of m e United '-.totjs Supreme Court. ; dm
here because I know Judge Kenneay we1!. He is a r'ian of gr^di -nteqriTy whj has
a sincere devotion to the rule of law, While I realize m a t I am not here seeking
confirmation of myself, it seems appropriate that you know who I din so t'iat you
can better evaluate the worth of my remarks.

             I was born in rural Alabama, but it became evident quite early that rny talents
were not in picking cotton. Only my mother believed me when I insisted that all
farm labor made me sick. Her love was so great and her belief in me so strong that
when others said I was a lazy faker her reply was tnat so far as she was concerned
if I said it i-rade ~:s sick, it nade me s:ck- The truth of the matter is that ,t
did make me sic!-'. I was allergic to almost every blade of grass, wila flower bloom
or domestic crop which grew in Alabama. My eyes itched and fl'jid flowed from my
nostrils. That was real sickness in an era before anti-histamines were put in general
use. In addifon to the impediment imposed by my allergies, I was too skinny and
clumsy to e/cell in any endeavor which required phy^icH agility.

             I shall bp forever grateful for the fact that my mother believed in the Bible
which teaches that everyone has 3 taler.c. She knew 1hat mine was not ^n physical
activity, ("or that reason sue convinced n>; that my talent is in my mind, and I
should read books and do something ir 1'+9 winch does not depend upon super *or physical
performance. This led to the idea of going to college, even tnounn ne member of
                                      629

my imnediate family had been so bold as to dream to reach such a high goal.
         I attended Tuskegee University on a five-year work scholarship and graduated

with highest honors. Later I was a Captain in a racially segregated U.S. Army unit.
That was a disturbing experience because I questioned the propriety of risking my
life for democracy abroad even though for my people it did not exist at home.

         An ever present brooding over the unequal condition of Black people in almost
every facit of American life literally dictated my career choice. As a lawyer 1
thought I could be in a better position to seek social change within the framework
of constitutional limitations. The federal government had the G.I. Bill of Rights
in place for those of us who sought further education. In those days Stanford did
not welcome Blacks, Columbia had a quota system, Harvard was too far from Harlem,
so I went to Yale.

         Since January 11, 1949S I have continuously practiced law in Sacramento,
California. One of the greatest joys of my life is having our son and one of our
daughters as my law partners.

          It was my pleasure to know Judge Kennedy's father. He and the late attorney
Archibald M. Mull, Jr., made it a point to see that I was well received as a member
of the Sacramento County Bar Association even though it had never had a Black appli-
cant or member, and the Los Angeles Bar Association had no Black members. They
also encouraged me to apply for membership in the American Bar Association. They
accepted me. That was in the year 1949, and I can assure you that these were bold
moves at that time.

        Suffice'it to'say, however, I am not here out of gratitude for the friendship
of Judge Kennedy's late father. That friendship, however, is relevant because it
shows the type of home in which Judge Kennedy was reared. If Judge Kennedy has
gone astray on racial issues, and I know of no evidence that he has, it must have
happened after he left home.

                                                    -2-
                                     630

         fou are aware of the fact that at least one civil rights group has announced
its objections to the confirmation of Judge Kennedy on the ground that he lacks
sensitivity to the problems of ethnic minorities. They have offered three of his
opinions as evidence in support of their position. I have carefully read and
analyzed each of those opinions. In none of them did I find one scintilla of
evidence that Judge Kennedy is insensitive to the struggle of ethnic minorities
to achieve full participation in every aspect of American life, Lach of the cases
cited was decided on narrow procedural grounds. It might be helpful to briefly
discuss each of the ones to which reference has been made.

          ' 12EIC vs. Circje Rea]_ty, 532 F.2d 1273 (1976).
               This case involved a claim by a local citizens organization that real

estate brokers in two small Los Angeles County cities were steering Black home
buyers to Black neighborhoods, and White home buyers to White neighborhoods. Judge
Kennedy held that since the citizen's group was attempting to assert the rights
of others it did not have standing to sue. He also hold that the action was brought
under Title 42 Section 3612 of the Fair Housing Law, and that section permits suits
only by those who themselves have been direct objects of housing discrimination.
Another section of the law, Section 3610, Judge Kennedy said, confers standing upon
community groups such as TOPIC, but exhaustion of administrative remedies is a
predicate to suit in federal court under the latter section.

         In my judgment Judge Kennedy erred in the TOPIC case by giving too narrow
an interpretation of the statute involved. It is written in the books, however,
that "To err is human, to forgive is devine". I say let those who have never made
an honest error cast the first stone. Further, a case may be made for the claim
that the administrative remedy found in Title 42 Section 3610 is far less expensive
and more expedient than direct court action. If that is not true Congress engaged
in futile action in passing the fair housing law because court remedies have been

                                                        -3-
                                      631

available for over a century. Congress obviously felt that the court remedy was
inadequate to deal with the pervasive racial discrimination in housing in this country
Judge Kennedy has never said that either remedy should be abolished. All he held
was that those who are not direct victims themselves should be restricted to a dif-
ferent procedure. Those who see an insensitivity to the rights of minorities in
that decision have strained at a gnat and swallowed an entirely unrelated camel.

          2. Spangler vs. Pasadena City Board of Education, 5b2 F.2d 1326 (1977).
               ,n this case, seven years after a decision which found de jure racial

segregation to exist in the Pasadena, California public schools, a group of Black
parents who were not parties in the original suit requested the court to enjoin
certain school board practices. The parents did not file a formal motion to intervene
in the case. Judge Kennedy held that since the parents did not file a motion to
intervene they were not parties to the action and could not attack the alleged
unlawful discriminatory practices. He expressly held that if on remand the parents
filed a motion to intervene the U.S. District Court should hold a hearing and decide
the question of the need for the parents to intervene.

          Judge Kennedy expressed no opinion as to the merits of the claims made by
the parents. He simply held that they should move to intervene if they wished to
participate in the litigation. It is certainly not an expression of racial bias
for a Court to require that those before it be either intervenors by motion or
parties by joinder. It is difficult to see how else the court can supervise its
affairs and enforce its decrees.

          3. Aranda vs. Van Sickle, 600 F.2d 1267 (1979).
               This case was brought by Mexican-Americans to invalidate an at-large

system used by San Fernando, California for the election of members to the City
Council. Judge Kennedy affirmed summary judgment against the plaintiffs on the
ground that they had failed to raise a genuine issue of fact indicating that they
had been denied access to the political process, or that the at-large election
scheme constituted a purposeful device for racial discrimination.

                                                       -4-

         It is my view that in that case both the circumstantial and direct evidence
produced by the plaintiffs should have precluded the granting of summary disposition
of the case, and that Judge Kennedy should have voted to reverse the judgment. This
view, however, does not lead me to an irrational conclusion that the decision tends
to prove that Judge Kennedy is a racist. He belived in good faith that the U.S.
Supreme Court precedents did not justify a different result.

         In addition to the objection to the foregoing opinions rendered by Judqo
Kennedy some of my friends urgp his rejection because of his past membership in
organizations and clubs which do not have women or ethnic minorities as members.
Membership in such clubs in this day and age in America is suspect, but we all too
often forget that the present attitude has not always prevailed. If you expelled
every member of the Senate who has held such a membership I hazard the guess that,
you could not get a quorum.

         Let us remember that in the past we have all sinned. This society has always
been highly polorized along the lines of race. Many Black organizations had no
White members and did not desire to have any. Most White organizations had no Black
members and fought to keep it that way. There were exclusively male clubs and female
clubs.

         Recently, however, a new age of enlightenment is being born, but lifting
the veil of ignorance and prejudice from the eyes of a people is a slow and painful
task. Some who truly desire to see racism banished from our society use the shock
effect of immediate resignation from such clubs, others remain within and use their
influence in an effort to persuade these groups to enter the new age of enlighten-
ment. The vast majority of poeple will take no action at all.

         I fail to see how Judge Kennedy's past club affiliations disqualify him from
membership on the U.S. Supreme Court. He has done the honorable thing with respect
to each of them. He fought for internal change and when

                                                        -5-
                                      633

he realized that he would not succeed he resigned. It is simply not true that he
made no objection to discriminatory club policies until a giant sugar plum danced
before his eyes. His objections are long standing and his resignations commenced
in 1980. Let me ask you a rhetorical question. How many White males in your
acquaintance objected to discriminatory clubs prior to 1980 and sought to change
them as Judge Kennedy did? I am not unmindful of the chorus of voices castigating
Judge Kennedy for waiting so long before he resigned from some of these clubs. To
those people I reply with a statement attributed to Justice Frankfurter.

                   "All too often, wisdom never comes. For this reason,
                no one should reject it merely because it's late".
          I urge you to evaluate Judge Kennedy on his whole record, and when this is
done there is no doubt in my mind that you will reach the conclusion that he deserves
this promotion to the major leagues. Turning him down because some of us assert
that he made an incorrect decision on an isolated-case here and there would be like
banishing Willie Mays to the minor leagues because he once dropped a fly ball, or
benching Mickie Mantle because he struck out now and then. Perhaps a more recent
analogy could be offered by saying Judge Kennedy's rejection would be like cutting
Jerry Rice because he tends to drop three out of every 400 passes, or like firing
Montana because last week he failed to complete the 24th consecutive pass he threw.
          Very little comment has been made concerning the case of Flores vs. Pierce,
1617 F.2d 1386 (1980) in which Judge Kennedy wrote the opinion affirming a judgment
against certain public officials in Calistoga, California who objected to a Mexican-
American entreprenuer securing a wine and beer license in that city. Judge Kennedy
held that the disparate impact the action had upon Mexican-Americans was some evi-
dence of the requisite intent to discriminate. He also expressly adhered to the
rule announced in the case of Columbus Bd. of Education vs. Penick, 433 U.S. 449,
at P. 464 where it was held that:

                                                             -6-
                                     634

                   "Adherence to a particular policy or practice with full
                knowledge of the predictable effects of such adherence upon
                racial imbalance in a school system is one factor among many
                others which may be considered by a court in determining
                whether an inference of segregative intent should be drawn".
         These cases lead me to believe that Judge Kennedy has a full grasp of the
inherently elusive nature of segregative intent, and views the total picture so
as to enable him to flush out racism wherever it raises its ugly head.
         My relationship with Judge Kennedy has, w'th one exception, been very good.
Both of us are frustrated law professors at heart, so we teach one course per week
at the University of The Pacific, McGeorge Law School in Sacramento. He taught
constitutional law, and I teach jurisprudence. Since both subjects embrace consti-
tutional theory, our lectures at times overlap. It is a well known fact that at
the end of some of his lectures his students stand, applaud and cheer. I confess
my jealousy. All I get at the end of my lectures is an occasional sigh of rel ief
that it is over. It is sincerely hoped that when Judge Kennedy moves to Washington,
D.C., the students will feel inclined to cheer me once in a while.
         One of my friends in the civil rights movement questioned the wisdom of my
appearance here. He said that not enough is known about Judge Kennedy's views on
civil rights issues. My reply was that I know enough about Judge Kennedy as a fair
and honest person, and as a brilliant scholar and judge to enable me to come before
you with confidence that to evade this opportunity would constitute an act of
partisan cowardice for which I would be ashamed for the balance of my life. If
I ever harbored any doubts about Judge Kennedy, which I have not, they would have
been erased by the response he gave to another judge at a judges conference where
Brown vs. The School Board was discussed. This is what Judge Kennedy said of Brown
vs. The School Board:

                                                          -7-
                                     635

                   "I do not skirt around it. I embrace it. All of us
                reject the narrow originalist construction that you are
                advancing and attributing to us. Plessy vs. Ferguson
                was wrong when it was decided. Justice Harlan dissented
                at the time and he was correct. The only thing wrong
                with Brown is that it wasn't decided 80 years earlier".
         Most Black people in America view the decision in Bravn as our Magna Carta.
It was to us a second and perhaps a more meaningful Emancipation Proclamation. It
forced America to commence the long and painful process of reconciling its practices
with its high sounding theories. Without Brown, America would be considered not
much more than a giant joke when it attempts to lecture the rest of the world about
protection of human rights.
         I close with a heart-felt willingness to return Judge Kennedy's embrace of
Brown with a fond symbolic embrace of him. I urge this Committee to do likewise.

                                                Thank you.

  The CHAIRMAN. Last but not least is Ms. Kepley.
  Ms. KEPLEY. Thank you, Senator Biden. I am here on behalf of
Beverly LaHaye, president of Concerned Women for America. She
was scheduled to testify tomorrow, but was called out of the coun-
try and could not make it back today for the testimony.
  And so with your permission, I will read her testimony for you,
for the record.
  The CHAIRMAN. Good.
  Ms. KEPLEY. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, the
women I represent are concerned about a wide range of issues and
problems. Concerned Women for America has become the vehicle
through which 500,000 women nationwide voice their opinions and
seek solutions to the problems which affect the future of American
men, women, and families.
  CWA admires the legal approach Judge Kennedy has taken
when faced with these issues, and we appreciate the opportunity to
speak in favor of his nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Our first area of concern today is crime. Criminals frequently
victimize women, the poor, and the elderly. Unfortunately, in
many cities across this great land, females and senior citizens often
live in fear, afraid to even venture outside of their homes alone be-
cause of crime in the streets. And unfortunately, our modern-day
society is one in which criminals often go free while the innocent
victim is put on trial.
  But fortunately for all Americans, there are judges like Anthony
Kennedy, who are committed to curtailing crime in our country as
well as insuring constitutional safeguards for the accused.
  Judge Kennedy is one of the legal minds who have been able to
strike the delicate balance between protecting the rights of the
victim and the rights of the accused. He has supported police who
make searches in good faith, but he has also voted to exclude ille-
gally gathered evidence in criminal trials.
  He has supported State imposition of capital punishment on
murderers, and long before it became popular to take a strong
stance against substance abuse, Judge Kennedy recognized the
threat of illegal drugs to our country, and ruled in favor of interna-
tional efforts to curtail drug traffickers.
  These and other decisions indicate that Judge Kennedy strives to
protect both the constitutional rights and the lives and property of
America's citizens. His balanced approach is something that Amer-
icans of all ages, both sexes, and any race can enthusiastically sup-
port.
  Our second area of concerns is the protection of the freedom of
speech and of the press. Concerned Women for America under-
stands that healthy political change comes when debate "is open
and secure, free from government censorship. When the courts
vigilantly guard these precious first amendment rights, all Ameri-
cans can freely advocate and work for social change.
  Judge Kennedy has shown an outstanding commitment to pro-
tecting our free speech. He has struck down pre-broadcast censor-
ship. He has ordered sealed court documents to be opened to the
public and pressed for review. His judicial record boldly demon-
strates his strong support for the sterling freedoms of the press
room that are a vital component of any democracy.
                                                   640

   The third area of concern which I wish to address today falls in
the economic arena. Our free-enterprise system and open-market
concepts have made America thrive unlike any other nation on the
face of the Earth. These principals offer every American the oppor
tunity to better their lives, to provide for their families, and to
strive to become financially secure.

  Our nation's businesses and companies, both large and small,
have flourished because they have been free to operate according to
the dictates of an open marketplace. It is vital to our nation's
future that these basic, timeless concepts remain firmly intact.

  Judge Kennedy's decision in the Washington comparable worth
case has protected these irreplaceable and valuable forces. His deci-
sion has allowed the economy of the State of Washington to contin-
ue to operate under the natural laws of supply and demand, free
from unnatural and destructive dictates which would have been en-
dangered the fibers of the economic foundation of this country.

  The absurd economic theory known as comparable worth, reject-
ed by Judge Kennedy and Concerned Women for America, mandat-
ed that greatly varying jobs should be quantified and compared,
and wages set and regulated by a court, not the marketplace.

  Judge Kennedy's refusal to conform to the interests of the pres-
sure groups posing this theory is an excellent example of his deeply
held belief that judges should not make laws, but rather should in-
terpret laws made by the people through their elected officials.

  If he had accepted the comparable-worth argument, his decision
would have placed enough power in the hands of the courts to
affect the entire economic structure of the State of Washington,
crippling the marketplace forces of supply and demand, union con-
tracts, and competition, just to name a few.

  Concerned Women for America strongly supports equal pay for
equal work, and we strongly oppose the concept of comparable
worth. Arbitrary, subjective evaluations of disparate jobs would be
detrimental to the people of any economy.

  Judge Kennedy ruled, quote, "Neither law nor logic deems the
free-market system a suspect enterprise. We find nothing in the
language of title VII or its legislative history to indicate Congress
intended to abrogate fundamental principles," unquote.

  In summary, Judge Kennedy's decisions reflect a deep respect for
the values which will continue to make the United States of Amer-
ica unique and sovereign--safer neighborhoods, the protection of
individual rights, the preservation of our freedom of speech and of
the press, and our ability to strive for the American dream, free
from undue government intervention.

  Concerned Women for America urges the Senate to confirm
Judge Anthony Kennedy, a judge for the future of America, to the
U.S. Supreme Court.

  Thank you very much.

on the face of the earth. These principles offer every American

         The absurd economic theory known as comparable worth
rejected by Judge Kennedy, and CWA, mandated that greatly varying
jobs should be quantified and compared, and wages set and
regulated, by a court, not the marketplace. Judge Kennedy's
refusal to conform to the interests of the pressure groups posing
this theory is an excellent example of his deeply held belief
that judges should not make laws, but rather, should interpret
laws made by the people through their elected officials. If he
had accepted the comparable worth argument, his decision would
have placed enough power in the hands of the courts to affect the
entire economic structure of the state of Washington, crippling
the marketplace forces of supply and demand, union contracts, and

competition, just to name a few.
         Concerned Women for America strongly supports equal pay for

equal work, and we strongly oppose the concept of "comparable
worth". Arbitrary, subjective evaluations of disparate jobs
would be detrimental to the people of any economy. Judge Kennedy
ruled, "Neither law nor logic deems the free market system a
suspect enterprise... We find nothing in the language of Title
VII or its legislative history to indicate Congress intended to
abrogate fundamental economic principles..."

         In summary, Judge Kennedy's decisions reflect a deep respect
for the values which will continue to make the United states of
America unique and sovereign - safer neighborhoods, the
protection of individual righcs, the preservation of our freedom
of speech and of the press, and our ability to strive for the
American dream free from undue government intervention.

         Concerned Women for America urges the Senate to confirm
Judge Anthony Kennedy, a judge for the future of America, to the
United States Supreme Court.

   The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. I am going to limit my 5
minutes, quite frankly, to Mr. Colley, not because the others aren't
important, but because, quite frankly, I know of your deep commit-
ment. And not that others aren't committed, but I know personally
of your deep commitment to the issues that quite frankly trouble
me most about Judge Kennedy.

  And that is why. It is out of no disrespect to the rest of the mem-
bers.

  I listened to you make a speech once when you were aware of my
presence, I suspect, and once when you were not, about civil rights
and civil liberties. And so if you mean what you say, and I know
your background and record indicate you do, it is some of conse-
quence to me that you would be supporting Judge Kennedy.

  Most civil-rights organizations, and I believe you were--weren't
you at one time on the Board of NAACP?

  Mr. COLLEY. For as long as time goes back, almost, for over 20
years. And I still am.

  The CHAIRMAN. Most civil-rights groups have either abstained
from taking a position, not because they are reluctant to take a po-
sition, but because they are uncertain, as I read it, or some few
have come out against--not the NAACP--but have come out
against the Judge.

  Some of his decisions are hard for me to reconcile with some of
the rhetoric which he uses in his speeches--not that there are that
many speeches, but in his speeches about the spacious phrases.

  And it is clear from everything we have found in our investiga-
tion, your testimony, and his that he has fully, fervently, and com-
pletely embrace Brown and all that it stands for, Brown v. the
Board.

  But it is less clear to me that he is, for lack of a better word,
sensitive to some of the more sophisticated means by which dis-
crimination is undertaken, not only against blacks, but against
browns, against women, against minorities.

  Just use the remainder of my time, the next 3 or 4 minutes, to
tell me about, if you can, what he is like in Sacramento, and
whether or not--as Joe Rauh said, ask somebody who knows him
where he was at the time of some of the monumental decisions,
where his thinking was.

  I am not suggesting you are with him all the time, but talk to me
a little bit about why you have sense of confidence about him.

  Mr. COLLEY. My sense of confidence does not arise from what he
said when the Court made certain decisions. My sense of confidence
arises because I know him very well. I know him to be a very fair
man, a man who wishes the best for America and all of its groups,
no matter what color, creed or otherwise.

  I would say to you that Judge Kennedy has never done or said
anything that I know of which would indicate that he harbors any
kind of racial or ethnic bias.

  The CHAIRMAN. If I can interrupt you, I don't think anybody has
ever indicated that. The concern that--let me speak of my concern.

  The concern that I have is that, like many prominent, honorable,
decent, and intelligent members of, for lack of a better word, the
establishment in various communities are never reluctant to
remedy an injustice toward an individual, but many times, either
                                         647

out of lack of wanting to take on the establishment or lack of ap-
preciation for the depth of the problem, seem reluctant to deal
with systemic problems.

  Mr. COLLEY. All right. I think that is a fair statement, said what
you described just now was the average American white male. The
world was yours, and you were apathetic. The world was yours, and
you didn't want to shoot anybody; you didn't want to lynch any-
body. But you weren't concerned about all the subtleties we are
concerned about now.

  We have to give Judge Kennedy credit for, as early as 1980, be-
ginning to reminisce about these clubs, for instance, which dis-
criminate, and trying to change them, actually affirmatively trying
to change them.

  And in some instances where he thought change would not come,
his only remedy was to withdraw. And I am not talking about 1987
withdrawals; I am talking about as early as 1980.

  I also know from personal experience that he was uncomfortable
in any situation where he thought discrimination might exist, but
he was as not as sensitive earlier on as he should have been.

  But as I said before, if you apply that as a test, not many of us
escape.

  The CHAIRMAN. Let me ask you, since my time is up, one con-
cluding question. You know Judge Kennedy; you have known him
for some time. Is he the kind of man that, after having gone
through this process, in your opinion, will at least spend some time
contemplating what was said about him?

  Will he have listened to what I thought was just quite frankly a
very, very articulate testimony by Ms. Hernandez? Is that the kind
of the thing he listens to?

  Mr. COLLEY. I would tell you that Judge Kennedy is a grown
man, but he is a growing man. And I have no doubt that as he pro-
ceeds through life, he now knows how important it is to be more
sensitive to the issues that now worry you.

  I would predict that as he grows, your satisfaction with him will
grow also.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, as you pointed out, or someone pointed out,
earlier, I have no right to insist that a Supreme Court nominee
agree with everything, or even a majority of the positions I would
take, specific positions.

  But it seems to me that we all have a right to insist that certain
basic principles which we feel deeply about will be reflected. And

T

  Mr. COLLEY. I know the time is gone, but could I just speak brief-
ly about a couple of cases that he has dealt with, and which he has
criticized for?

  One is the Spangler case in Pasadena. All he did in that case was
rule that the people who were making the motion to have the
school board abolish the fundamental school were not parties to
the action. And he said to them, "You will have to make a motion
to intervene in order to get the court to do something, and you
have not made a motion to intervene. You have not made a motion
to be joined as plaintiffs, so you are strangers, really."

   I don't see how a court can operate its business if it listens to
people who refuse to intervene and refuse to be joined as parties,
                                         648

yet dictate the outcomes of litigation. So I don't think there is any-
thing unusual about that, and I am well aware of the situation in
Pasadena.

   Now, with reference to TOPIC v. Circle Realty, that was a nar-
rowly decided case. I don't guess there is anything wrong in telling
you that I talked with Judge Kennedy about that case, because he
knew of my concerns about discrimination in housing.

   His explanation to me was that he certainly harbored no animos-
ity toward anybody, but he honestly thought that the section of the
law which that case was brought under did not allow parties who
were not discriminated against--community groups such as this--
to bring an action directly in court.

  He felt that the law required them to go through the administra-
tive process, and he felt that the administrative process was really
in many ways far superior to the long, drawn-out court actions.

  So there was nothing in that case which expressed any view of
race and housing so far as minorities are concerned.

  The CHAIRMAN. I thank you, and I thank my colleagues for al-
lowing me to go over a little bit of my time. The Senator from
South Carolina.

  Senator THURMOND. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. First,
I want to express my appreciation to the witnesses who came here
today to testify in behalf of Judge Kennedy.

  Now, as I understand, Mr. Cartwright, you know Judge Kennedy
personally.

   Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Yes.

  Senator THURMOND. HOW long have you known him?
  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Oh, 15 or 20 years.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Colley, how long have you known him?
  Mr. COLLEY. About the same time.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Plant, how long have you known him?
  Mr. PLANT. About 25 years.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, MS. Kuhl, do you know him personal-

ly?
  Ms. KUHL. I do, Senator Thurmond. I have known him about 10

years. I was
  Senator THURMOND. Are you from Sacramento?
  Ms. KUHL. I was his law clerk in 1977.
  Senator THURMOND. A law clerk. Ms. Kepley, do you know him?
  Ms. KEPLEY. I have not had the privilege of knowing
  Senator THURMOND. I can't hear you.
  Ms. KEPLEY. I have not had the privilege of meeting Judge Ken-

nedy as of yet.
  Senator THURMOND. SO four of you have known him personally,

and you know him through reputation, do you, Ms. Kepley?

   Ms. KEPLEY. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. YOU have studied his cases and his records,
speeches, and so forth?

   Ms. KEPLEY. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. NOW, from your personal knowledge of
Judge Kennedy, and the knowledge Ms. Kepley has obtained from
studying his record, speeches, decisions, and so forth, I want to ask
you this question.
                                         649

  The American Bar has said that they consider three qualities in
determining whether a judge to the Supreme Court is qualified--
integrity, judicial temperament, and professional competence.

  I want to ask you a simple question, and I wish you to answer
yes or no. I don't think you need to go explaining because it ex-
plains itself. Do you feel that Judge Kennedy--and I will start with
you right on this end--do you feel he is qualified by those qualities
to be a member of the Supreme Courts of the United States.

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I do, Mr. Thurmond.
  Mr. COLLEY. I believe he is exceptionally well qualified by that
standard and additional standards as well.
  Mr. PLANT. I resoundingly feel that he is extremely well quali-
fied.
  Ms. KUHL. Judge Kennedy is extremely well qualified by the
ABA's criteria or any other criteria.
  Ms. KEPLEY. Absolutely. Yes, sir.
  Senator THURMOND. I want to ask you this question. Do you
know of any reason why he should not be confirmed by this com-
mittee and the Senate? Is there anything of a particular nature
that is not covered by those three qualities that the ABA consid-
ers? Do you know of any reason whatsoever why he should not be
confirmed? Is there anything in his personal life or anything in his
career history, or any other reason? Do you know of any reason
why he should not be confirmed?

  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I don't know of anything.
  Mr. COLLEY. Not at all. I have never heard anybody in Sacramen-
to utter a bad word about him.
  Mr. PLANT. And I previously testified to the same effect.
  Ms. KUHL. I know of no reason he should not be confirmed, Sena-
tor Thurmond.
  Ms. KEPLEY. I know of no reason why he should not be con-
firmed.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, Mr. Colley, I want to say that Con-
gressman Matsui testified here, and he told us to listen especially
to your testimony. He said you knew him so well, and I guess he
wanted to explain certain portions of his testimony and to be sub-
stantiated by your positions.
  Mr. COLLEY. When an unknown comes before you, somebody has
to go ahead and warn you that somebody is coming, and describe
that person.
  When you come to the President of the United States, they just
say, "Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.'' If
a country lawyer from Sacramento conies, you need a big press re
lease, a Congressman to tell how great you are, and aU the rest.
  Senator THURMOND. Well, I want to commend you. tvo. I know
you have had to overcome a lot of obstacles to get wbere you ar^
today, and I just want to commend you for whai you have tk'.-it.
what you have ac -'iix-pushed.
  Mr. COLLEY. Thank VOL.
  Senator THURMOND. NOW, MF, Kepley, I believ* you. represent Qi..
organization, Concerned Women for America.

   Ms. KEPLEY. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. That is tiie same organization, I believe, of
which Ms. Beverly LaRa^ye is the president0
                                             650

   Ms. KEPLEY. Yes, sir, that is correct.
   Senator THURMOND. She has testified here in the hearing for
Judge Bork.

   Ms. KEPLEY. Yes, sir.

  Senator THURMOND. She made a very fine impression. One of the
finest witnesses that we have had come before us.

  Ms. KEPLEY. Thank you for your very kind words.
  Senator THURMOND. And from her testimony, I gained good re-
spect for that organization. I just want to tell you that.
  Ms. KEPLEY. Thank you very much.
  Senator THURMOND. Again, I want to thank you all for coming,
taking your time, and testifying. I think you have taken the right
side. I agree with you.
  Thank you very much.
  The CHAIRMAN. Before you dismiss them all, Senator, the Sena-
tor from Ohio.
  Senator METZENBAUM. MS. Kepley, I don't want to question you
about the substance of your testimony, nor about your position, but
I've sat through a number of hearings in which I've heard about
Concerned Women for America.

  There are eleven million people in Ohio, and I've looked around
for Concerned Women for America in Ohio, and can't find any, and
I know that you always talk about the organization being a cata-
lyst through which over 500,000 women nationwide voice their
opinions, and seek solutions to the problems which affect the
future of American men, women and families.

  Now, I think Ms. LaHaye says you don't have 500,000 members,
but that that number has to do with women who have written in
or something.

  Tell me exactly where you get that 500,000 figure.
  Ms. KEPLEY. I will be happy to clarify that for you, sir, and fur-
thermore, we do have membership in Ohio, and I'm sure that
  The CHAIRMAN. They'll come and visit you shortly.
  Ms. KEPLEY [continuing]. We'll have some people come and visit
you very shortly, that's right.
  Senator METZENBAUM. That's fine. I haven't heard from them
yet. I'll be glad to hear from them.
  Ms. KEPLEY. We would be happy to do that, Senator Metz-
enbaum.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I'll be glad to do that. How many mem-
bers do you have in the country?
  Ms. KEPLEY. We have over half a million members.
  Senator METZENBAUM. And how do you become a member? Do
you pay dues?
  Ms. KEPLEY. I would be happy to clarify that for you. Our mem-
bership is composed of people who have either supported us active-
ly on the grassroots level, or they have supported us financially, or
both.
   Quite frankly, Senator, we have members who are senior citizens
who are on Social Security, and they cannot afford to donate finan-
cially, and so we give them complimentary memberships.
   So we have those who are both active on the grassroots level, or
those who financially support us, or both.
                                         651

  Senator METZENBAUM. Yes, but that doesn't answer my question.
How many dues paying members do you have?

  Ms. KEPLEY. I think I just explained our membership.
  Senator METZENBAUM. YOU explained it, but you didn't tell me
how many dues paying members you have.
  Ms. KEPLEY. We do not have a dues paying membership. We
have those who financially support us through donations, and we
have those who are active on our grassroots level, and have sup-
ported us actively in that realm, or both.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Well, since you're a group that consistent-
ly comes before Congress on right-wing issues, tell me what kind of
contributions do you get? Do you get large contributions from some
people who support your philosophy?
  I'm trying to get to the bottom of your claim. When somebody
comes to the Congress and says, we represent or speak for 500,000
people, which I've heard Ms. LaHaye say before, I want to know
what that means.
  And I think you have a budget of $4,000,000, and a staff of 22
people. Now where does the money come from if you don't have
dues?
  Ms. KEPLEY. Well, I think I explained that. Perhaps I can clarify
it a little bit better. I am not privy to the financial records in our
organization.
  However, we do have those individuals who are supportive of our
organization who financially support us, and donate funds. We do
not have dues.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Then are your financial records open? Are
they public, or is it just a private group?
  In other words, does one person give you $4,000,000? Do two
people? Do ten people? And do you just claim that you're speaking
for 500,000 people?
  That's what really concerns me, because that's such an over-
whelming number, as compared to almost any other group that
comes before the Congress. I really think we're entitled to know
what it means to say that your group is speaking for 500,000
people?
  Ms. KEPLEY. Well, Senator, we don't have one person or two
people who are donating $4,000,000 to us every year. However, we
would, of course, welcome that donation, but, as I said before, we
have individuals who financially donate to our organization, and
we have those who are active on the grassroots level, or both.
  And I would be happy to have our controller contact you regard-
ing this issue.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Would you have him do that? I'd like to
see your financial reports, because I think it is a matter of concern
to us.
  Ms. KEPLEY. I cannot promise to you that--I do not know the
status of our financial reports, as far as if you would be privy to
them, but I would be happy to have our financial officer contact
you with any other further questions that you might have.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Well, I wanted to say that each time that
Concerned Women for America come before us, I am going to press
this question, because I'm overwhelmed by the 500,000 figure, and
frankly, I question whether you really are, indeed, speaking for
                                                    652

that many people, and I think we are entitled to have some further
evidence or documentation.

   When the AFL/CIO comes, we ask them how many members;
when NOW comes, when the NAACP comes, when any one of a
host of other organizations comes, whether it's the NAM or the US
Chamber, we get some idea of actual membership.

  In this case, I don't know whether it's a figment of the imagina-
tion of people who have written in at one time or another, or
whether there really is some substance to the claim.

  And so I would appreciate your passing on to the powers that be
in your organization that this Senator, at least, would like to know
before the next appearance, and hopefully through your comptrol-
ler, what the basic facts are with respect to this organization.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. I don't think that the point
is at all irrelevant. As a matter of fact, earlier today we had one
witness stand before us and tell us that he was speaking for 22 mil-
lion Americans, and I'm not being facetious when I say this.

  It was a gay and lesbian rights organization that claims to speak
for 22 million. They may very well, but that particular organiza-
tion does not have 22 million people who in fact are members.

  I asked how they arrived at that number, and it was pointed out
to me that statistics indicate that ten percent of the population is
gay or lesbian, and therefore they spoke for them.

  I think it's presumptuous for that organization to speak for
anyone that is not their member, and it would obviously be pre-
sumptuous of this organization to claim to speak for 500,000 people;
but I'm sure they will give us the facts at one point.

  Senator METZENBAUM. May I just make one observation to Mr.
Colley, please? It will be very brief.

  The CHAIRMAN. Oh, sure.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I just want to say, Mr. Colley, that you
must be a good lawyer, and must be a very able person, because
you've got a wonderful sense of humor, as to how you happened to
choose the college that you attended.
  I very much enjoyed reading in your statement, "In those days
Stanford did not welcome blacks, Columbia had a quota system,
Harvard was too far from Harlem, so I went to Yale."
  Your decision to go to Yale is a big compliment to that college.
  The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Colley, if we had time I would love you to
tell the nation that's watching, because I think it's both humorous
and also almost pathetic, the story you tell about when you headed
the Racing Commission, and a very distinguished woman asked you
what capacity you
  As a matter of fact, I'll ask you, unless you think it's inappropri-
ate.
  Mr. COLLEY. Well, I have no objection. I tell everywhere I go, if
anybody will listen.
  And the purpose of it is, to illustrate how presumptions are
against you when you are in a minority
  The CHAIRMAN. That's the reason I'd like you to tell it.
  Mr. COLLEY. I was chairman of the California Horse Racing
Board, and was invited to Washington to address, in the Capitol
Hilton Hotel, the American Horse Council, made up of all the
                                                    653

horse people. You know, the Vanderbilts, the Whitneys and every-
body.

  I was the only black person in the room, not only the only one on
the platform, but the only one in the room.

  The CHAIRMAN. And you were president of this organization?
  Mr. COLLEY. No, I was chairman of the California Horse Racing
Board, and I was the keynote speaker.
  The CHAIRMAN. Oh, California
  Mr. COLLEY. And this lady sitting next to me kept looking at me
uncomfortably. And she kept looking, and I thought she was really
flirting with me, but I overestimated myself.
  And finally she blurted out to me, "For whom do you groom?"
  She presumed that I must be a groom who cleaned the stalls, and
I told her that sometimes for my wife a little bit, and sometimes
for myself--I have a horse or two.
  And then when I was introduced to speak, and I spoke on the
issues before the convention, and 1 looked back, she'd fled. I never
saw her again, because that seat stayed empty when I got back to
it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, thank you for relating that story.
  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, I just want to suggest to the
able Senator from Ohio he might want to look into the NOW orga-
nization, since you were looking at these organizations.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I don't have any problem about doing
that. As a matter of fact, I think they do give us some facts and
figures as to how many members they have.
  I think that when people come before us and say, we speak for so
many people, that we have a right to ask them to give us some
back-up, whether it's NOW or whether it's Concerned Women for
America, or whether it's the XYZ group.
  Senator THURMOND. I just wanted to be sure you didn't single out
this particular organization.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I really wasn't. But I've heard this 500,000
figure so many times before that I've become a little bit sensitive
about it, and just thought that perhaps the message could be taken
back that one of the members of the Senate would like to know the
back-up facts.
  The CHAIRMAN. Senator, before you speak, how many people do
you represent?
  Senator SPECTER. I represent 12 million Pennsylvanians.
  The CHAIRMAN. All right. Well, you're entitled to speak then.
  Senator SPECTER. MS. Kuhl, there has been considerable concern
expressed about Judge Kennedy's sensitivity to women.
  You were a law clerk for Judge Kennedy. Can you be explicit
and tell us what evidence you have, from your personal observa-
tions, if any, about Judge Kennedy's sensitivity to women's rights
and women's issues?
  Ms. KUHL. I was Judge Kennedy's first female law clerk. That
was in only his third year on the bench.
  One of the things that has always been quite wonderful about
clerking for Judge Kennedy, and I think remains so, is something
that Wendy Collins Perdue mentioned, and that is that a law clerk
for Judge Kennedy is treated like a colleague.
                                                    654

   Certainly the Judge does his own work, and writes his own opin-
ions, but he enjoys very much discussing his work with his law
clerks.

  This was immediately true for me, just as it was true for my
male co-clerk, and for any of the other male clerks who have
worked with Judge Kennedy.

  I never found Judge Kennedy to make any distinction on account
of sex, and moreover, I have valued Judge Kennedy's colleagueship,
if I may presume to say so, so much that I have, throughout my
career at various points, sought his advice and counsel, which I
value greatly, about my own career.

  He has been very helpful to me in giving of his time, and I feel
very close to his family, as does my husband; and in all respects
Judge Kennedy has been a great

  Senator SPECTER. But you think he's sensitive to women's issues,
based on your experience with him?

  Ms. KUHL. Certainly based on his treatment of me, I know of no
reason to think that he would not be sensitive to women's issues,
and certainly can assure you that he treats women the same as he
treats men.

  Senator SPECTER. Mr. Colley, I, too, was very much interested in
your reasons for choosing your law school. When you commented
about Stanford not welcoming blacks, and Columbia having a quota
system, and Harvard was too far from Harlem.

  But my experience suggests that there were some good reasons,
otherwise, for your going to the Yale Law School.

  I enjoyed reading your statement. I noted your allergies; I recall
having some myself, but I very much appreciated your comment
about, you can come from anywhere and go anywhere if you really
try.

  I started off in Kansas and got to the Yale Law School, and I
think that those words of yours are very important, aside from the
context of Judge Kennedy's confirmation proceedings.

  The CHAIRMAN. He eventually ended up in Philadelphia.
  Mr. COLLEY. He has a presumption that he has a superb educa-
tion.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, there are a lot of good things to recom-
mend the Yale Law School besides the process of elimination.
  Mr. COLLEY. Had I had any doubts about Yale I never would
have made that kind of remark, but its reputation is such that we
can joke a little about it.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, I'm sure of that.
  Mr. Colley, the question that I have for you turns on your eval-
uation--and you've already testified about it--as to Judge Kenne-
dy's sensitivity to civil rights.
  I have read your statement, and it is all the more credible when
you take Aranda and say that he made a mistake there, and you
thought that it should have been decided differently, not on motion
for summary judgement.
  You make reference to Flores v. Pierce, which I had commented
on, which is favorable on civil rights.
  I would refer back to the Pasadena School Board case, and the
case that you have cited is the 1977 decision by the ninth circuit,
and I had questioned Judge Kennedy earlier about a 1979 decision
                                         65a

of the circuit on the same case, because it was in the circuit on a
number of occasions--even got to the Supreme Court of the United
States.

  And the concern that I had about his decision in the Pasadena
School Board case turned on his overruling, or disregarding, the
findings of fact of the district court, and I had read him one finding
in the memorandum opinion of the court, and I would like you to
comment about that.

  And it is this: The trial judge said, "A majority of the defendants
have acted with unyielding zeal and overt antipathy to the desegre-
gated concept of the Pasadena plan. Promising return to neighbor-
hood schools with the recognition that it cannot be accomplished
without resegregation of Pasadena schools is bad faith, not only to
the principles of constitutional duty, but also to their own constitu-
ency."

  And knowing the Pasadena case as you do, and knowing Judge
Kennedy as you do, and being the lawyer that you are, in terms of
fact finding, and the district judge, and the appellate scope of
review, I'd be interested in your observations on this issue

  Mr. COLLEY. I think that decision, overruling the findings of the
trial judge, was an incorrect decision. I think that the decision did
not show sufficient sensitivity to the real problems, and I think
what really happened there, the court just was tired of that Pasa-
dena case, because it had been in the courts so long.

  And all of the pupils who were there when the case was filed had
long since graduated, and they simply felt it was time to turn it
back over to the school board.

  But since the school board had not carried out the mandate, and
since the problem still existed, the district court should have kept
jurisdiction and they should have compelled compliance.

  Senator SPECTER. Well, I appreciate that answer. That kind of
direct disagreement, I think, underscores your credibility generally,
and I appreciate your comment.

  Thank you very much.
   The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Alabama.
   Senator HEFLIN. Mr. Colley, I think the members of this panel
ought to know that since you went to Yale to law school, where did
you go to undergraduate school?
   Mr. COLLEY. Well, I stated in the beginning, I went to Tuskegee
on a 5-year work plan because I didn't have any money to go there
in 4 years, so I worked my way through.
   I made up for it when I went to Yale, because I graduated in 2
years instead of 3, because I was so smart. It took 5 years because I
was so poor, and I made it up later on in 2 years because I was so
smart.
   Senator HELFIN. Well, we are delighted to see this group here,
and the hour is getting late, but we appreciate your testimony of
each and every one of you.
   Senator METZENBAUM. Mr. Chairman?
   The CHAIRMAN. Right. The Senator from Ohio.

  Senator METZENBAUM. A group that's called Concerned Women
for America. It doesn't come about just because I wanted to raise
the question of numbers.

  It comes about because of the whole thrust of Ms. LaHaye, who
is the leader of the group. Some of you recollect that Jack Kemp
recently had to disassociate himself from a Reverend LaHaye, who
is Mrs. LaHaye's husband, because he had been an evangelical--as
a matter of fact, Jack Kemp appointed as national "chairman of
his campaign a well-known evangelical couple who have criticized
Jews and Catholicism, and insisted that only Christians should
hold elective office."

  "Brilliant Jewish minds have all too frequently been devoted to
philosophies that have proved harmful to mankind," Reverend Tim
LaHaye, a fundamentalist minister, wrote in a 1985 book, The
Coming Peace in the Middle East.

  Reverend LaHaye said in another book, "Catholicism is a false
religion," adding, "you may be inclined to think me anti-Catholic,
but that isn't exactly true. I am anti-false religion, Rome is more
dangerous than no religion, because she substitutes religion for
truth."

  At a conservative convention this year, according to a partial
transcript of his remarks provided to the Globe, LaHaye said,
"When we say Judeo-Christian, we don't mean the Jews really
helped us build this country."

  His wife, Beverly LaHaye, who is president of Concerned Women
for America, a conservative group, wrote in a 1985 article in USA
Today, that politicians who do not use the Bible to guide their
public and private lives do not belong in office.

  Another point in the article reads, "And in a 1985 newsletter in
which he expressed hope for more conservative appointees to the
Supreme Court, LaHaye called for a national prayer campaign 'for
the removal (by any means God sees fit) of at least three of the Su-
preme Court members while Ronald Reagan is president.' "

  "His wife, in the newspaper article, reinforced her husband's
belief in the need for evangelical Christians in government."

  Mr. Chairman, I ask that the entire article be included in the
record.

  The CHAIRMAN. Without objection, it will be entered in the
record.

  Ms. KEPLEY. Mr. Chairman, will I have an opportunity to re-
spond to that?

  The CHAIRMAN. Sure. You can respond now, if you would like.
  Ms. KEPLEY. Senator Metzenbaum, I welcome the opportunity to
respond to that and clarify it, that article, for you.
  I do not represent Dr. LaHaye. I do not represent his theological
basis. I am here representing Concerned Women for America. It is
my understanding that the quotes that you read were taken out of
context.
  However, I would like to take this opportunity to state very
clearly that Concerned Women for America has a very broad con-
stituency, composed of women with professional backgrounds,
homemakers, college students, grandmothers. Those women repre-
sent a wide variety of religions and faiths. I think that should
speak for itself.
  We are not anti-Catholic, we are not anti-Semitic. We welcome
all religions and all faiths to our organization. Quite frankly, I'm
sitting here before this honorable body supporting a Roman Catho-
lic for one of the most powerful seats in the United States.
  Senator METZENBAUM. I think your statement is very appropri-
ate, Miss Kepley. As a matter of fact, it would have been much
more appropriate had Mrs. LaHaye been here. But since you were
speaking for the organization, I thought some of these concerns
that I have should be brought out.
  Ms. KEPLEY. Well, I appreciate your concern very much, and I
appreciate the opportunity to address those concerns. And she did
authorize me to speak on her behalf on this matter.
  Senator METZENBAUM. Thank you.
  Ms. KEPLEY. Thank you, sir.
  The CHAIRMAN. Anything further?
  Mr. COLLEY. Could I say simply that I had nothing to do with the
arrangement of this panel, and I wouldn't want anybody to draw
any adverse conclusion from the fact that we're all here together.
  The CHAIRMAN. I am sure none of the other panel members are
offended.
  Mr. PLANT. Mr. Chairman, could I take about 15 seconds
  The CHAIRMAN. Sure. You've been so gracious that we've hardly
asked you any questions.
  Mr. PLANT. Well, I just want to comment on what I believe to be
a very significant fact here. Nathaniel Colley and I have fought
each other hard in the courts for many, many years. We have both
known Judge Kennedy for over 20 years, 25 years. We have, I
think it's fair to say, different views on many social and political
issues, Nathaniel and I, and we both came here from Sacramento
to tell you that we think that he would make the Supreme--a
superb Supreme Court Justice.
  The CHAIRMAN. Did you come together?
  Mr. PLANT. NO. [Laughter.]
  Mr. COLLEY. He didn't tell you that when we fought each other, I
usually won. [Laughter.]
   Mr. PLANT. That's not the way I remember it.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you have all been very gracious. I think
one of the important things about these hearings is to see to it that
not only do we get the facts and we deal with serious matters, that

      90-878 0 - 8 9 - 2 2
                                                    660

people understand that people who disagree also can disagree
agreeably, so we are delighted to have you all here.

  We sincerely realize and understand that it is an imposition, and
you wouldn't be here if you didn't feel strongly about it, all of you.
Thank you for your testimony.

  With the grace of God and the good will of neighbors, we will not
be asking you to testify or anyone will be on the Supreme Court
nominee for a while. I hope we can get to the business of the com-
mittee a little bit.

  With that, I would like to thank the panel and say "good night",
and introduce our last and not the least important--maybe the
most important panel--and these folks are always gracious enough
to go last. They, in fact, do represent probably more people than
about anybody who speaks before us.

  Our next panel consists of three witnesses, who are not strangers
to this committee. Johnny Hughes is the legislative director of the
National Troopers Coalition, which represents approximately
45,000 State Troopers and Highway Patrol Officers. Jerald Vaughn
is the executive director of the International Association of Chiefs
of Police, a professional organization of more than 14,500 top law
enforcement executives. And Dewey Stokes is the national presi-
dent of the Fraternal Order of Police, the largest member organiza-
tion of professional law enforcement in the United States, with
more than 200,000 members.

  We welcome you all back. You are no strangers to this commit-
tee, any one of you. In the interest of your time, so that you have
more time, there is no need for you to explain to us who you repre-
sent, how many people you represent, how many important people
are in the organization. And I'm not being facetious when I say
that because we know your organizations so well, you've been such
an asset to this committee and to the country.

  Senator METZENBAUM. Did Dewey Stokes tell you he's from
Ohio?

  The CHAIRMAN. Dewey and you go through that routine every
time Dewey's here. Now we'll go through the Alabama part.
Johnny, you're from Alabama?

  Mr. HUGHES. NO, sir, Maryland.
  The CHAIRMAN. Maryland. At any rate, all kidding aside, wel-
come to you all. Really, fellows, I thank you. During the Bork testi-
mony you went last, and it was at about this hour of the night
when you went, and here you are again. But we're here also be-
cause we're anxious to hear what you have to say.
  So why don't we start with you, Trooper Hughes, and then we'll
work our way across the table.
  Excuse me. Would you all stand to be sworn, please? Do you
swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?

   Mr. HUGHES. I do, sir.

   Mr. VAUGHN. I do.

   Mr. STOKES. I do, sir.

  The CHAIRMAN. Trooper?

TESTIMONY OF A PANEL CONSISTING OF JOHNNY L. HUGHES, DI-
  RECTOR, LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL AFFAIRS, NA-
  TIONAL TROOPERS COALITION; JERALD R. VAUGHN, EXECU-
  TIVE DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHIEFS OF
  POLICE; AND DEWEY R. STOKES, NATIONAL PRESIDENT, FRA-
  TERNAL ORDER OF POLICE

  Mr. HUGHES. Mr. Chairman, honorable members of this distin-
guished committee, I wish to thank the committee for once again
giving my organization the opportunity to speak on the proposed
nomination of Supreme Court Justice, an office to which only the
most qualified should be appointed. I note in this regard that the
nominee has been rated "well qualified" by the American Bar As-
sociation.

  The National Trooper's Coalition, having reviewed the positions
taken by Judge Kennedy in numerous cases involving issues of
criminal law, believes him to be eminently qualified and urges his
speedy confirmation to this most important position. Judge Kenne-
dy, who haj lerpthy experience within our judicial system, having
served for 12 yt^rs 3 a member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit, has amassed a record of participating in some
1,400 decisions, authoring over 400 of these.

  It is in th area of criminal law that we believe Judge Kennedy
would prove to be an outstanding jurist. He has shown throughout
his 12 years on the Federal bench a keen understanding of the
challenges facing police officers in their struggle against society's
criminal element. Police officers risk their lives and, unfortunately,
too often give them in this battle that can at times be made frus-
trating by rulings that protect the criminal over the rights of socie-
ty as a whole.

  Judge Kennedy, recognizing the difficulties facing officers and
appreciating the costs paid by all citizens of this country if relevant
evidence is excluded and the guilty are allowed to go unpunished,
has been in the forefront of those members of the judiciary taking
a second look at the exclusionary rule.

  Writing in a dissent in United States v. Leon, Judge Kennedy be-
lieved that the rigidities of the exclusionary rule had been
stretched beyond reason under the facts of that case, a position
later adopted in that case by the Supreme Court when it recog-
nized a good faith exception to the rule.

  In United States v. Harvey, he argued, again in dissent, that the
results of blood alcohol test had been properly admitted in a man-
slaughter case. Judge Kennedy, arguing that the officer had acted
in good faith and with probable cause in taking the blood sample,
would not have excluded the results of the test simply because the
defendant had not been arrested prior to the taking of the sample.
He again warned against such illogical application of the exclusion-
ary rule, writing:

  If the exclusionary rule becomes an end in itself, and the courts do not apply it in
a sensible and predictable way, then one approach is to reexamine it altogether. We
do not have that authority, but we do have the commission and the obligation to
confine the rule to the purposes for which it was announced.

  The exclusionary rule seems to have acquired such independent force that it oper-
ates without reference to any improper conduct by the police.
                                             662

  In other areas of criminal law, we believe that Judge Kennedy
has distinguished himself with his positions taken. He has upheld
the conviction of drug smugglers where evidence was gathered by
the use of helicopter overflights of the defendant's property. In an-
other matter, he upheld the death penalty for an inmate who mur-
dered a fellow inmate while serving a life term without parole for
previous rapes and murders of two teenagers. He has, we believe,
struck a proper balance between protecting the rights of society to
enforce its laws and upholding the constitutional rights of an ac-
cused at the same time.

  The National Trooper's Coalition urges the Senate Judiciary
Committee membership to endorse this nomination, and we hope
for the earliest possible confirmation by the U.S. Senate.

  Thank you once again for giving us the opportunity to express
our views.

          LIEUTENANT HUGHES, A TWENTY YEAR VETERAN OF THE MARYLAND
STATE POLICE, IS DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL
AFFAIRS FOR THE NATIONAL TROOPERS COALITION. THE NATIONAL
TROOPERS COALITION IS COMPOSED OF STATE POLICE AND HIGHWAY PATROL
AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND HAS A MEMBERSHIP OF
APPROXIMATELY 45,000 TROOPERS.

          MR. CHAIRMAN, HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THIS DISTINGUISHED
COMMITTEE.

          I AM JOHNNY L. HUGHES, TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF, AND AS
DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL AFFAIRS FOR, THE
NATIONAL TROOPERS COALITION. OUR ORGANIZATION, COMPOSED OF
APPROXIMATELY 45,000 MEMBERS, REPRESENTS TROOPERS FROM STATE
POLICE AND HIGHWAY PATROL AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.
WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT WE SPEAK TO THE SAME CONCERNS AS DO
MANY MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS FOR A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL
JUDICIARY AND ONE THAT PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF SCCIETY TO
EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE ITS CRIMINAL LAWS.

          I WISH TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ONCE AGAIN GIVING MY
ORGANIZATION THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THE PROPOSED NOMINATION

OF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE, AN OFFICE TO WHICH ONLY THE MOST
QUALIFIED SHOULD BE APPOINTED. I NOTE IN THIS REGARD THAT THE
NOMINEE HAS BEEN RATED "WELL QUALIFIED" BY THE AMERICAN BAR
ASSOCIATION.

          THE NATIONAL TROOPER'S COALITION, HAVING REVIEWED THE
POSITIONS TAKEN BY JUDGE KENNEDY IN NUMEROUS CASES INVOLVING
ISSUES OF CRIMINAL LAW, BELIEVES HIM TO BE EMINENTLY QUALIFIED
AND URGES HIS SPEEDY CONFIRMATION TO THIS MOST IMPORTANT
POSITION. JUDGE KENNEDY, WHO HAS LENGTHY EXPERIENCE WITHIN OUR
JUDICIAL SYSTEM, HAVING SERVED FOR 12 YEARS AS A MEMBER OF THE
UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT, HAS AMASSEH
A RECORD OF PARTICIPATING IN SOME 1,400 DECISIONS, AUTHORING OVER
400 OF THESE.

          IT IS IN THE AREA OK CRIMINAL. LAW THAT WE BELIEVE JUDGE
KENNEDY WOULD PROVE TO BE AN OUTSTANDING JURIST. HE HAS SHOWN
THROUGHOUT HIS 12 YEARS ON THE FEDERAL BENCH A KEEN UNDERSTAND\NG
OF THE CHALLENGES FACING POLICE OFFICERS IN THEIR STRUGGLE
AGAINST SOCIETY'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT. POLICE OFFICERS RISK THEIR
LIVES, AND UNFORTUNATELY TOO OFTEN GIVE THWM, IN THIS BAFTLE THAT
CAN AT TIMES BE MADE FRUSTRATING BY RULINGS THAT PROTECT THE
CRIMINAL OVER THE RIGHTS OF SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.

          JUDGE KENNED*, RECOGNIZING THE DIFFICULTIES FACING OFFICERS
AND APPRECIATING THE COSTS PAID BY ALL CITIZENS OF THIS COUNTRY
IF RELEVANT EVIDENCE IS EXCLUDED AND THE GUILTY ARE ALLOWED TO GO
UNPUNISHED, HAS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF THOSE MEMBERS OF THE
JUDICIARY TAKING A SECOND LOOK AT THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE.

          WRITING IN A DISSENT IN UNITED STATES v. LEON, JUDGE
KENNEDY BELIEVED THAT THE RIGIDITIES OF THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE
HAD BEEN STRETCHED BEYOND REASON UNDER THE FACTS OF THAT CASE, A
POSITION LATER ADOPTED IN THAT CASE BY THE SUPREME COURT WHEN IT
RECOGNIZED A GOOD FAITH EXCEPTION TO THE RULE. IN UNITED STATES
v. HARVEY, HE ARGUED, AGAIN IN DISSENT, THAT THE RESULTS Or A
BLOOD ALCOHOL TEST HAD BEEN PROPERLY ADMITTED IN A MANSLAUGHTER
CASE. JUDGE KENNEDY, ARGUING THAT THE OFFICER HAD ACTED IN GOOD
FAITH AND WITH PROBABLE CAUSE IN TAKING THE BLOOD SAMPLE, WOULD
NOT HAVE EXCLUDED THE RESULTS OF THE TEST SIMPLY BECAUSE THE
DEFENDANT HAD NOT BEEN ARRESTED PRIOR TO THE TAKING OF THE
SAMPLE. HE AGAIN WARNED AGAINST SUCH ILLOGICAL APPLICATION OF
THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE, WRITING:

                   "IF THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE BECOMES AN END
                  IN ITSELF, AND THE COURTS DO NOT APPLY
                  IT IN A SENSIBLE AND PREDICTABLE WAY, THEN
                  ONE APPROACH IS TO REEXAMINE IT ALTOGETHER.
                  WE DO NOT HAVE THAT AUTHORITY, BUT WE DO
                  HAVE THE COMMISSION, AND THE OBLIGATION,
                  TO CONFINE THE RULE TO THE PURPOSES FOR
                  WHICH IT WAS ANNOUNCED.
                  THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE SEEMS TO HAVE ACQUIRED
                  SUCH INDEPENDENT FORCE THAT IT OPERATES
                  WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ANY IMPROPER CONDUCT
                  BY THE POLICE."

          IN OTHER AREAS OF CRIMINAL LAW WE BELIEVE THAT JUDGE
KENNEDY HAS DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF WITH HIS POSITIONS TAKEN. HE
HAS UPHELD THE CONVICTION OF DRUG SMUGGLERS WHERE EVIDENCE WAS
GATHERED BY THE USE OF HELICOPTER OVERFLIGHTS OF THE DEFENDANT1S
PROPERTY. IN ANOTHER MATTER, HE UPHELD THE DEATH PENALTY FOR AN
                                    667

                                                  - 5-

INMATE WHO MURDERED A FELLOW INMATE WHILE SERVING A LIFE TERM
WITHOUT PAROLE FOR PREVIOUS RAPES AND MURDERS OF TWO TEENAGERS.
HE HAS, WE BELIEVE, STRUCK A PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING
THE RIGHTS OF SOCIETY TO ENFORCE ITS LAWS AND UPHOLDING THE
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF AN ACCUSED.

          THE NATIONAL TROOPER'S COALITION URGES THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE MEMBERSHIP TO ENDORSE THIS NOMINATION AND WE HOPE FOR
THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE CONFIRMATION BY THE UNITED STATES SENATE.

          THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO
EXPRESS OUR VIEWS.
                                                  668

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much.
  Mr. Vaughn.
  Mr. VAUGHN. Thank you very much, Senator, for the opportunity
to be here and testify on this matter that is of utmost importance
to the police in this country, since clearly the majority of cases re-
viewed by the Supreme Court deal with criminal issues.
  We're living in a very difficult period in this country, and the
predictions with respect to crime and what will happen in this
country if it continues to escalate at its current rate are--quite
frankly--frightening, as we have analyzed this issue. We are here
prepared to strongly support the nomination of Judge Kennedy for
the Supreme Court.
  We think his credentials speak for themselves. I came here au-
thorized by our executive committee, which is the governing body
of the association, which consists of 52 of the top law enforcement
officials in the United States, to offer our unqualified support and
endorsement of this nomination.
  We have reviewed Judge Kennedy's record extensively and we're
satisfied that he will fairly and evenly adjudicate criminal matters
coming before him, and he will fairly and consistently interpret the
law and that he will, as much as humanly possible, balance the
rights of victims, the rights of the accused, and the rights of the
citizens of our great nation to live a crime-free life.
  We support Judge Kennedy's nomination for a number of rea-
sons. First, Judge Kennedy's philosophy of judicial restraint, as
clearly demonstrated in the more than 400 opinions he has au-
thored on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
  Second, Judge Kennedy's decisions reflect due regard for the role
of States in our federal system. Third, Judge Kennedy has fairly
interpreted the exclusionary rule. He has argued that whatever the
merits of the exclusionary rule, its rigidities become compounded
unacceptably when courts presume innocent conduct, when the
only common sense explanation for it is ongoing criminal activity.
This speaks directly to one of law enforcement's greatest concerns
with the exclusionary rule; that is, when common sense is left out
of the interpretive process.
  Fourth, Judge Kennedy has also supported the use of the death
penalty, which we endorse as an appropriate measure of punish-
ment for certain criminal acts.
  Fifth, Judge Kennedy has upheld maximum sentences against
drug dealers, and has upheld the constitutional validity of the ac-
tions of foreign governments cooperating with the United States in
antidrug ventures. Perhaps one of the most difficult issues for law
enforcement officers is to understand the unjustified and unrealis-
tic suspicion of some judges towards all law enforcement officials. I
can't tell you the toll this takes on our morale. Judge Kennedy
does not share this view of law enforcement. As a matter of fact, he
stated in the Darvon v. Norse case:

  Were a juror to announce that most law enforcement officers by reason of their
profession and their oath are trustworthy and honest, but that similar respect
cannot be accorded prisoners, I should be gratified, not shocked. Those principles
are consistent with the responsible citizenship and are not a ground to challenge the
juror for cause.
                                      669
  Judge Kennedy is an experienced and impartial jurist. His 12
years of service on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,
together with his experience in private practice, make him an out-
standing nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court.
  The American Bar Association gave him their highest rating.
The International Association of Chiefs of Police supports his nomi-
nation without qualification, and we do urge you to confirm him as
an Associate Justice to the highest court in our land.
  Again,. I deal with police chiefs every day. There is a growing
concern, particularly given the fact that we've experienced the
highest rate of crime in two decades, a 12 percent increase in vio-
lent crime. Our nation can ill-afford a Supreme Court Justice that
cannot apply common sense and balance the rights of the majority
with the rights of the accused and give us the opportunity to live a
life free of unnecessary crime.
  Thank you very much for the opportunity to make our presenta-
tion.

     The International Association of Chiefs of Police is a professional
organization comprised of over 14,500 top law enforcement executives
from the United States and 68 nations. IACP members lead and manage
several hundred thousand law enforcement officers and civilian
employees in international, federal, state and local governments.
Members in the United States direct the nation's largest city police
departments including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit,
Houston and others, as well as suburban and rural departments
throughout the country.

     Since 1893, the IACP has facilitated the exchange of important
information among police administrators and promoted the highest
possible standards of performance and conduct within the police
profession. This work is carried out by functionally oriented committees
consisting of police practitioners with a high degree of expertise that
provide contemporary information on trends, issues and experiences
in policing for development of cooperative strategies, new and innovative
programs and positions for adoption through resolution by the
association.

     Throughout its existence, the IACP has been devoted to the cause
of crime prevention and the fair and impartial enforcement of laws with
respect for constitutional and fundamental human rights.
Jerald R. Vaughn was appointed Executive Director of the 14,000
member International Association of Chiefs of Police on September
10, 1985. IACP is the world's largest association of police execu-
tives with members in the United States and sixty-seven overseas
nations.

Director Vaughn is a native of Denver, Colorado, and received his
Bachelors of Science Degree in the Administration of Justice from
Metropolitan State College and Masters Degree in Public Adminis-
tration from the University of Northern Colorado.

Director Vaughn began his law enforcement career in February 1968
with the Englewood, Colorado Police Department. He worked assign-
ments in radio car and foot patrol, as a Field Training Officer, a
Traffic Officer in the Traffic Bureau, and served fourteen months
as an undercover agent in a federally funded multi-jurisdictional
drug task force where he received a citation for service above and
beyond the call of duty from the Governor of the State of Colorado.
Director Vaughn was promoted to the rank of Sergeant, where he held
assignments as a Field Supervisor, Tactical Team Leader, Internal
Affairs Supervisor, and as the Administrative Assistant to the Chief
of Police. Director Vaughn was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant
and held assignments in the Patrol and Administration Division, and
was serving as Commander of the Support Service Unit when he was
appointed Chief of Police of the sixty-eight member Garden City,
Kansas Police Department. Director Vaughn was then appointed to
the position of Chief of Police of the 173 member Largo, Florida
Polico Department in May 1983.

KENNEDY SHARES OUR POINT OF VIEW.
          JUDGE KENNEDY'S PHILOSOPHY OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT IS

CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE MORE THAN 400 OPINIONS HE HAS
AUTHORED ON THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH
CIRCUIT. HE HAS REFUSED TO MAKE NEK LAW (IN THE AREA OF
COMPARABLE WORTH; AFSCME . STATE OF WASHINGTON. 1985); HE HAS
VOTED AGAINST EXPANDING FEDERAL POWER BEYOND "...WHERE THE WORDS
OF THE STATUTE LEAD." (SCHREIBER DISTRIBUTING CO. V. SERV-WELL
FURNITURE CO., 1986); HE HAS WRITTEN OPINIONS NOTING THAT
MISTAKES IN STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION MUST BE REMEDIED BY THE
CONGRESS AND NOT THE COURTS (U.S. V. BELL, 1984).

          JUDGE KENNEDY'S DECISIONS REFLECT DUE REGARD FOR THE
ROLE OF STATES IN OUR FEDERAL SYSTEM. HE HAS DECIDED CASES BY
NOTING THAT THE ISSUE AT HAND (IN ONE CASE, WRONGFUL DISCHARGE)
WAS A MATTER OF STATE CONCERN, AND FEDERAL LAWS IN THAT AREA
WERE NOT INTENDED TO SUPERCEDE STATE REGULATION.[ OSTROFE V.
CROCKER (1982)]

          JUDGE KENNEDY HAS ALSO RULED ON THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE,

ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES, IN A DRUG CASE [UNITED STATES V. LEON]
THE JUDGE DISSENTED FROM A DECISION THAT THE EVIDENCE SHOULD BE
THROWN OUT BECAUSE , IN THE MAJORITY'S VIEW, IT WAS BASED ON AN
INVALID SEARCH WARRANT. HE ARGUED THAT THE WARRANT WAS IN FACT
VALID, STATING: "WHATEVER THE MERITS OF THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE,
ITS RIDIGITIES BECOME COMPOUNDED UNACCEPTABLY WHEN COURTS PRESUME
INNOCENT CONDUCT WHEN THE ONLY COMMON SENSE EXPLANATION FOR IT IS
ON-GOING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY." WE WOULD NOTE THAT ON APPEAL, THE
SUPREME COURT, WITHOUT EXAMINING THE VALIDITY OF THE WARRANT,
CREATED A NEW 'GOOD FAITH" EXCEPTION TO THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE.
JUDGE KENNEDY QUITE APTLY REPRESENTED ONE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT
GREATEST CONCERNS WITH THE COURT'S INTERPRETATION OF THE
EXCLUSIONARY RULE, THAT IS, WHEN "COMMON SENSE" IS LEFT OUT OF
THE INTERPRETATIVE PROCESS. WE TOTALLY AGREE WITH HIS POSITION
ON THIS ISSUE.

          JUDGE KENNEDY ALSO HAS SUPPORTED THE USE OF THE DEATH
PENALTY, WHICH WE ENDORSE. IN ONE CASE [NEUSCHAFER V. WHITLEY,

ASSURE THAT ALL LEGAL PROCEDURES HAD BEEN OBSERVED. HOWEVER,
WHEN THE LOWER COURT DETERMINED THAT SUCH WAS THE CASE, THE JUDGE
FIRMLY UPHELD THE IMPOSTION OF THE DEATH PENALTY.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. Mr. Stokes.
  Mr. STOKES. Good evening, Mr. Chairman, and members of the
committee. It's a privilege and an honor to again appear before you
in order to participate in these important proceedings. As the larg-
est member organization of law enforcement professionals in the
United States, we are vitally interested in the pending nomination
of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy to become an Associate Justice of
the U.S. Supreme Court.
  Roughly, as we have said before, one-third of the Supreme
Court's docket consists of criminal matters. We believe that a
review of the nominee's views on criminal justice issues is essen-
tial, and it is our believe that Judge Kennedy has a sophisticated,
yet common sense understanding of, and respect for, our criminal
justice system. We believe that Judge Kennedy's strong academic
background, his year in private practice, and his experience as a
jurist, equips him to confront the many complex criminal justice
issues that so vitally affect the law enforcement on a daily basis.
  We are aware that over the span of his judicial career Judge
Kennedy has confronted cases in which virtually every interest
group known, including law enforcement, has had an interest. It is
significant that Judge Kennedy's decisions have not always sided
with any of these groups, including us, law enforcement.
  Judge Kennedy has decided cases in favor of criminal defend-
ants, and against the Government. He has decided cases in favor of
management and against labor. He has decided cases in favor of
private litigants and against police defendants. Yet, upon review of
these cases, and all his cases, what emerges is a judge who follows
the law. If bad facts compel an unpleasant result, Judge Kennedy
follows the law without regard to the interest groups that may ben-
efit. In the final analysis, we believe that that is just what we need,
a Justice who adheres to the rules of law as opposed to one who
attempts to create rules of law.
  In our statement, which I have submitted for inclusion in the
record, we have made reference to just a few of the hundreds of
cases decided by Judge Kennedy. I will not reiterate those refer-
ences. I do believe that a few points are worth mentioning.
  Judge Kennedy has written, as John said, on the exclusionary
rule, and we believe this to be a common-sense judging premised on
the sophisticated understanding, the purpose of which the exclu-
sionary rule was first developed.
  Judge Kennedy has confined himself to the issues before him.
His decisions adhere to precedent and do not speak to create judge-
made law, whether in favor of or contrary to any particular inter-
est.
  In United States v. Leon, the Ninth Circuit suppressed the neces-
sary evidence on the basis of staleness of document. In his dissent,
Judge Kennedy found that the evidence should not have been sup-
pressed and that there was sufficient probable cause and that
common sense compelled such a conclusion. Later, the U.S. Su-
preme Court also found the evidence should not be suppressed, al-
though its decision announced the so-called "good faith" exception
to the warrant requirements.
  Judge Kennedy's decision in the Barker v. Morris case, the sixth
amendment case, this was another example of judicial common
                                      680

sense; allowing the use of videotape at the preliminary hearing,
testimony of a witness prevented the defendant from benefiting
from successfully avoiding apprehension until after the witness had
died. Because that testimony had been substantiated in specific in-
dicia of the liability, Judge Kennedy held that the confrontation
clause had not been violated.

  Judge Kennedy's decision in the Fifth Amendment case also
demonstrated his scholarly yet common-sense approach to criminal
justice, Judge Kennedy's dissent in Adamson v. Ricketts, which
would have prevented the murderer from going free.

  A majority of the U.S. Supreme Court, including Justice Powell,
agreed with the dissent. Adamson was a contract killer that did not
go free.

  Judge Kennedy's decisions are not pro police, they are pro jus-
tice. He has decided cases as a result of which convictions were
overturned, evidence suppressed, and criminal defendants have
gone free. Yet, when we review the totality of his writings, Judge
Kennedy emerges as a fair-minded, principled, and common-sense
judge, one with the opinion of police, that we share, and he so ade-
quately described, and Jerry covered--when he announced to the
juror--to announce that the most law-enforcement officers, by
reason of their profession and their oath, are trustworthy and
honest--but that similar respect cannot be afforded to prisoners, I
should be gratified, not shocked. Those principles are consistent
with a responsible citizen.

  Based on his common sense, and his practice before the courts,
and his interpretation of his rulings, we, in law enforcement, in the
Fraternal Order of Police, urge you to confirm our new Associate
Justice as soon as possible.

  Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you this evening, Mr.
Chairman.

                         BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
                       ON THE NOMINATION OF ANTHONY M. KENNEDY
                     TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

                 Good afternoon. Mr. Chairman, members of the
Committee, I am Dewey Stokes, National President of the Fraternal
Order of Police. The Fraternal Order of Police is the largest
member organization of professional law enforcement personnel in
the United States. Our organization is comprised of local lodges
belonging to State lodges which, in turn, belong to the Grand
Lodge, of which I am National President. I am also President of
my local lodge (No. 9 ) , Columbus, Ohio. The Fraternal Order of
Police consists of almost 200,000 members including municipal
police officers, state troopers, sheriff's deputies, federal law
enforcement officers, and virtually every other form of law
enforcement officers in the United States.

                  Our organization's purpose, as stated in our
Constitution is:

                  To support and defend the Constitution of the
                  United States; to inculcate loyalty and
                  allegiance to the United States of America;
                  [and] to promote and foster the enforcement
                  of law and order . . .
This is consonant with the preamble to our nation's Consitution
In its reference "to insure domestic tranquility." Our member-
ship consists of devoted men and women of all races, colors and
national origins who share these common goals, and we are very
grateful to be afforded this opportunity to appear before your
distinguished panel to participate in this historic and constitu-
tional process.

Mr. Chairman, I appear before this distinguished

Conunittee>-^pflajT to express the support of the Fraternal Order of

''-1*'    *

Police for the nomination of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy to become

an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. The

Fraternal Order of Police is vitally interested in the appoint-

ment of a jurist with a sophisticated yet common sense under-

standing of and respect for our criminal justice system. We

believe that Judge Kennedy is such an individual and I would like

to take this opportunity to provide the Committee with some of

our bases for our belief.

        As you know, the Supreme Court spends nearly one-third

of its time determining matters of criminal justice. Therefore,

it is essential that a nominee's position on such issues be

reviewed when considering his appointment to the Court. During

his tenure on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Kennedy

has participated in hundreds of criminal law decisions. Such

experience will enable him to add principled reasoning and

insight into cases appearing before the Supreme Court.

        Judge Kennedy is keenly aware of the severe toll that

crime exacts upon its victims. In a recent speech delivered
before the Sixth South Pacific Judicial Conference,1 Judge

Kennedy stressed that a crime victim suffers enormous psycho-

logical trauma and that the criminal justice system is often

insensitive to the victim's needs. Daily, members of the

Fraternal Order of Police work with victims of crime. We firmly

                 3-5, 1987.
                                        - 2-
                                     683

believe that the system is never more insensitive to those

victims than when a criminal goes free because a court has inter-

preted a defendant's constitutional rights in an overly

expansive, hyper-technical way.

                  Judge Kennedy's decisions reflect his compassion toward

victims of crime. He has repeatedly refused to engage in overly

broad interpretations of the rights afforded criminal defendants

by the Constitution. Judge Kennedy interprets the Constitution

narrowly and applies its principles to the precise issues before

him. The result is a reasoned, pragmatic decision that goes no

further than necessary to dispose of the case at hand.

                  Judge Kennedy consistently applies this disciplined

approach to all aspects of the criminal law. For example, Judge

Kennedy is very cautious about allowing a defendant to invoke the

Exclusionary Rule to prevent probative evidence from reaching the

jury. He has written,

                           If the exclusionary rule becomes an end
                  in itself and the courts do not apply it in a
                  sensible and predictable way, then one
                  approach is to reexamine it altogether. We
                  do not have that authority, but we do have
                  the commission and the obligation to confine
                  the rule to the purposes for which it was
                  announced.

                           In this case the exclusionary rule seems
                  to have acquired such independent force that
                  it operates without reference to any improper
                  conduct by the police. The rule is torn from
                  its pragmatic mooring, for a premise of the
                  decision is that the officer acted not only
                  in good faith but also with probable cause
                  under exigent circumstances."2

                  In United States v. Leon. a majority of the court
found that a search warrant was not supported by probable cause
and therefore excluded all evidence discovered in the search.
The majority found the warrant to be invalid because information
contained in the underlying affidavit was stale (over five months
old). In his dissenting opinion, Judge Kennedy reasoned that
although the initial information contained in the affidavit was
five months old, the defendant had been observed in a continuing
course of suspicious conduct which validated that information.
Judge Kennedy found that the original information plus the
continuing conduct, when considered as a whole, constituted
probable cause. He would have allowed evidence discovered in the
search to be admitted in the trial.

                  The purpose of the Exclusionary Rule is to deter
improper police behavior. Tudge Kennedy recognized that there
was no improper police behavior in Leon. The officers relied, in
good faith, on a search warrant that was later held invalid.
Judge Kennedy tfi&ely refused to apply the Exclusionary Rule under
such circumstances. The legal basis for his decision was strict
adherence to controlling precedent, thus leading to the conclu-
sion that probable cause existed. On review, the Supreme Court
also recognized that the Exclusionary Rule should not apply where
the officers had relied on the warrant in good faith. In a

landmark decision, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit
and created a new, "good faith exception" to the Rule.5

                 Judge Kennedy also exhibits principled reasoning and
respect for precedent in determining the scope of Fourth Amend-
ment protection. In United States v. Sherwin . the Court
considered whether the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were
violated when FBI agents took possession of allegedly obscene
materials prior to obtaining a search warrant. In that case, a
trucking terminal received a shipment of 17 cartons, several of
which were damaged. Pursuant to company regulations the terminal
manager inventoried the contents of the damaged cartons. These
contents appeared to be obscene, so the manager notified the
FBI. When the FBI agents arrived, the manager voluntarily gave
them copies of two of the books to take to the United State's
attorney and the books were then used as a basis for obtaining a
search warrant.

                  The defendant claimed his Fourth Amendment rights had
been violated and sought to have the evidence seized excluded at
his trial. The District Court suppressed the evidence. Judge
Kennedy, writing for the majority, reversed the District Court
and held that the defendant's rights were not violated. He
concluded that the manager's inventorying of the cartons did not
constitute a search by a government official (state action). He

                  5The government did not appeal the issue of whether
probable cause existed, so the Court based its decision on the
assumption that probable cause did not exist.

                  6539 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1976).

                                                      - 5-
                                      686

also found that the manager's consensual transfer of the books to
the FBI agents did not constitute a seizure. Because there was no
search and seizure, the Fourth Amendment did not properly apply,
and the evidence was admissible.

                  Such a decision protects the rights granted to a defen-
dant by the Constitution. It does not however, unnecessarily
expand the Constitution to afford protection against searches by
private individuals. Legally sound decisions such as this are
important to law enforcement officials, because they allow
officers to take advantage of evidence discovered and presented
to them by private citizens. Furthermore, such decisions prevent
defendants from abusing the criminal justice system by attempting
to exclude critical evidence obtained in a manner that caused
them no harm other than to be caught in the commission of a
crime.

                  On the issue of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to
confront witnesses, Judge Kennedy again authored a reasonable,
common sense opinion that will greatly aid the prosecution of
criminals. Barker v. Morris7 involved two brutal murders
committed by members of the Hell's Angels motorcycle group.
Months after the crimes had been committed, a member of the group
who had participated in the murders contacted the police. He
described the murders and led police to the site where the bodies
were hidden. This informant was dying of throat cancer and was
expected to live only several weeks. Based on the information he

                                                      - 6-
                                       687

provided, three other members of the group were indicted and the
informant testified against two of the defendants at their
preliminary hearing. The third man was absent from the hearing
because he had not yet been apprehended. Due to the informant's
impending death, his preliminary hearing testimony was video-
taped.

                  The informant died before the third man was apprehended
and brought to trial. Judge Kennedy allowed the use of the prior
videotaped testimony in the third man's trial even though the
defendant had not been present at the preliminary hearing to
cross-examine the informant. Judge Kennedy found that the Sixth
Amendment Confrontation Clause had not been violated because the
videotaped testimony had substantial and specific guarantees of
trustworthiness and reliability. This decision prevented a
brutal murderer from being released just because he was fortunate
enough to have evaded apprehension until the informant died.

                  Judge Kennedy has also authored well-reasoned decisions
in the areas of the Fifth Amendment protection from double
jeopardy8 and the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial in a
civil rights action.9 In addition, Judge Kennedy has been
willing to uphold severe punishment when a defendant's criminal

behavior so warrants. For example, in United States v.
Stewart,10 Judge Kennedy justifiably upheld a life sentence
without bail against a drug dealer. The dealer had shown utter
disregard for the law by expanding his drug sales operation while
out on bail. In Neuschafer v. Whitley.11 Judge Kennedy upheld a
death sentence where it was clearly authorized by statute and all
questions regarding admissibility of evidence had been correctly
resolved by the lower courts.

                  Although Judge Kennedy is tough on criminals, he
strives to do justice. His experience as a private attorney
includes representing defendants in criminal actions, sometimes
acting as a public defender. This background enables Judge
Kennedy to exhibit "compassion, warmth, sensitivity and an
unyielding insistence on justice", which are the attributes he
considers every good judge to possess.

                  Furthermore, because of Judge Kennedy's reasoned
analyses, which includes strict adherence to precedent, his
decisions often result in a finding in favor of the defendant.
Where police officers clearly commit an illegal search, Judge
Kennedy will not allow the resulting evidence to be introduced at
trial even if it means the prosecution cannot obtain a convic-

tion. United States v. Boatwriaht.13 Judge Kennedy is even
willing to author a dissent in favor of a defendant when he
believes the majority is interpreting a mens rea requirement too
broadly. United States v. Jewell.14

                  Judge Kennedy has authorized over 400 decisions. Among
those opinions are decisions that have been adverse to virtually
every interest group of which we are aware. Judge Kennedy's
decisions, however, are predicated upon the law as it is required
to be applied. Therefore, his opinions are not skewed in favor
of any particular interest group. Judge Kennedy has decided
cases in favor of criminal defendants yet we believe that his
decisions are fair. Judge Kennedy has decided cases in favor of
plaintiffs suing police officers,15 yet we believe his decisions
are sound. Over the course of a career as extensive as Judge
Kennedy's, he has undoubtedly been required to decide cases
adversely to almost every interest group (including law enforce-
ment) . We believe, however, that Judge Kennedy's decisions are
notable only in their adherence to the law, controlling precedent
and the Constitution as written.

                  Judge Kennedy's background as an attorney in private
practice, as a professor of Constitutional Law, and as a Judge on
the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, has certainly provided him
with the skills necessary to be an outstanding Supreme Court

Justice. He is well-equipped to handle the numerous and sensi-
tive criminal law issues facing the Supreme Court. His decisions
in the criminal justice area faithfully adhere to precedent,
address only the precise issues facing the court, exhibit a well-
reasoned and common sense analysis of the law and facts, and end
with a just result. Judge Kennedy has consistently and
unceasingly served justice as a public servant. The Fraternal
Order of Police strongly believes he will continue serving in an
exemplary manner as an Associate Justice of the United States
Supreme Court, and we therefore urge that his nomination be

     - . * ^'STATEMENT OF LARRY D. THOMPSON
        BEFORE' UNITED STATES SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
                ON THE NOMINATION OF ANTHONY M. KENNEDY

         Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the Committee, my
name is Larry Thompson. I am a partner in the law firm of King
and Spalding in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1982 to 1986 I was U.S.
Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.

         I would like to begir> by thanking you for the opportunity to
appear today before you. It is a very great honor to testify
before this distinguished Committee on behalf of the nomination
of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy to the United States Supreme Court.

         I would like to concentrate on the area of greatest concern
to me as a former federal prosecutor--law enforcement. For the
vast majority of American people, the courts are by far and away
the most important aspect of our administration of justice.
People care about the courts because legal decisions on criminal
justice issues affect them most. Nothing has a more direct and
profound effect on them, their families, their neighborhoods and
communities than crime and the fear of crime.

         For society as a whole, the stakes are also enormous. The
future of our young people, our cities, and our poor ana disadvartaaed
is quite literally in the balance. Everv vear, billions of
dollars and thousands of lives are lost in what we call the "war
on crime"--but what might perhaps better be called the war that
crime wages on us.
                                     693

         We as a society have come to realize this threat. The
President and the Congress have worked together to strengthen our
criminal law enforcement in such areas as drug abuse, organized'
crime, and white-collar crime. As a former federal prosecutor, I
can tell you that laws such as the Comprehensive Crime Control
Act of 1984 are now playing an important role in this fight.

         While much of law enforcement involves the state court
systems, the role of federal courts is very important. No
matter how good the laws you pass here, they must be enforced in
federal court. And the United States Supreme Court plays the
most important role of all. Approximately a third of its caseload
is crimina]. Its word is essentially final on federal statutes
and on the constj. u*-., -n^l constraints on both state and federal
law enforcemert.

         In recen4 years, some federal court decisions, including
some rendered by the Supreme Court, have in mv view missed the
mark on criminal justice issues and have displayed a lack of
understanding of the realities and difficulties of effective and
fair law enforcement. This lack of understanding can upset the
balance in our criminal justice system between the rights of the
accused and the rights of law abiding citizens.

         For example, a few years ago, in Florida v. Rover, ? majority
of the Supreme Court affirmed a lower court decision which
allowed evidence of drugs found in a drug courier's suitcase to
be suppressed, in my view, on exceedingly technical grounds.
That decision was handed down during my tenure as United States
Attorney, and I had to administer its mandate in the context of
                                      694

increased drug trafficking at Atlanta's Hartsiield Airport, the
nation's largest. In Royer, members of the smuggling detail of
the Dade County police had detained on suspicion of transporting
narcotics a very nervous-looking man with two heavy suitcases at
the Miami airport. Among many other telling details, they had
just observed him buy his ticket to New York under an assumed
name, paying from a large roll of small-denomination bills. They
had asked him to accompany them to a nearby room adjacent to the
main concourse, to get away from the flow of business at the
airport. Once there they had asked him to consent to a search of
the luggage. Without replying, he got out a key to one suitcase
and unlocked it, revealing marijuana. When he had explained that
he couldn't open the other suitcase, he consented to the police
prying it open. All told, 65 pounds of marijuana were found.
The entire episode had lasted about fifteen minutes.

         The majority held that the defendant's questioninq in the
adjacent room converted the encounter into an unlawful detention
and tainted his consent to the search of his luggage. Justice
Rehnquist had this to say about the events:

          "The opinion...betrays a mind-set more useful to those who
         officiate at shuffleboard games, primarily concerned with
         which particular square the disc has landed on, than to
         those who are seeking to administer a system of justice
         whose twin purposes are the conviction of the guilty and the
         vindication of the innocent....Analysed simply in terms of
          its 'reasonableness,' as that term is used in the Fourth
         Amendment, the conduct of the investigating officers toward
                                     695

         Royer would pass muster with virtually all thoughtful,
         civilized persons not overlv steeped in the mysteries of
         this Court's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence....Would it have
         been more 'reasonable' to interrogate [the defendant] about,
         the contents of his suitcases, and to seek his permission to
         open the suitcases when they were retrieved, in the busy
         main concourse of the Miami Airport...? If the room had
         been large and spacious, rather than small, if it had
         possessed three chairs rather than two, would the officers'
         conduct have been made reasonable by these facts? . . . All
         of this in my mind adds up to little more than saying that
         if my aunt were a man, she would be my uncle. The officers
         might have taken different steps thar they did to investigate
         Royer, but the same may be said of virtuallv every investigative
         encounter that has more than one step to it."
Justice Blackmun had this to say about the police officers'
encounter with the drug courier:
         "In my view the police conduct in this case was minimally
         intrusive. . . . The special need for flexibility in
         recovering illicit drug couriers is hardly debatable. . . .
         In light of the extraordinary and well-documented difficulty
         of identifying drug couriers, the minimal intrusion in this
         case, based on particularized suspicion, was eminently
         reasonable."
         As a former federal prosecutor, I admit that I sympathize
with these points of view. The burden placed on effective law
enforcement by seemingly hypertechnical rulings turning on sizes
                                     696

of rooms and shapes of parcels is incalculable. It is not simply
that the obviously guilty individual defendants go free. Equally
serious is the burden placed on future police conduct by the
complete absence of predictability or reasonableness in some
areas of criminal law. It seems that we are sometimes requiring
policemen and other law enforcement officials in the field to
know what judges themselves do not yet know, and indeed cannot
aqree upon.

         I have reviewed several of Judge Kennedy's major criminal
law cases and speeches, and I feel confident as a result that he
understands this perspective, and is deeply committed to a
criminal justice system that is fair to both defendants and
society.

         Judge Kennedy has shown that he understands the macmitude of
the problems we face. In 1984 he stated that "[t]he constitutional
order is under tremendous attack by criminal conspiracies that
operate and profit from sale of illegal drugs....Hundreds of
millions of dollars from illegal drug transactions are surging
through the economy....[These] li]llegal profits can unravel the
social fabric through corruption. Millions of dollars in cash
are now available to bribe law enforcement officers, legislators,
and judges." He urged his audience to help "make our public aware
of the physical dangers of drug use and of the danger to the body
politic from corruption by drug profits. Neither can be tolerated
in a free society."

         Judge Kennedy's decisions clearly show his understanding of
criminal lav/ realities. In Darbin v. Nourse, for example, he
                                  697

made it clear that he does not accept any 'moral equivalence'
between law enforcement officers and criminals:

        "Were a juror to announce that most law officers, by reason
        of their profession and their oath, are trustworthy and
        honest, but that similar respect cannot be accorded to
        prisoners, I should be gratified, rot shocked. Those
        principles are consistent with a responsible citizenship and
        are not a grounds to challenge the juror for cause." Darbin
        v. Nourse, 664 F.2d 1109 (9th Cir. 1981).
        Judge Kennedy again showed this understanding of realitier
in the celebrated case of United States v. Leon. In that case,
the United States Supreme Court created a new "good faith"
exception to the exclusionary rule, where law officers rely in
good faith on a search warrant that later is judged illegal. The
Court decided this case assuming arguendo that the warrant in
Leon was legally defective, because that issue had not been
appealed or argued. Judge Kennedy's dissenting opinion below did
not rest on a good faith exception, because--as the Supreme Court
recognized in its opinion--a lower court judge was not well
placed to create a major new doctrine. Instead, he argued that
the warrant was valid: "The affidavit for the search warrant sets
forth the details of a police investigation conducted with care,
diligence, and good faith....One does not have to read many capes
involving illegal drug traffic before it becomes clear exactly
what was going on at the residences described by the officer's
affidavit....Whatever the merits of the exclusionary rule, its
rigidities become compounded unacceptably when courts presume
                                 698

innocent conduct when the only common sense explanation for it I F
on-going criminal activity."

         I think this opinion epitomizes Judge Kennedy's practicality
and realism. I also think it is impressive that one of the
Supreme Court dissenters in Leon, Justice Stevens, would have
remanded that case to Judge Kennedy's court because he thought
that that court would now agree with Judge Kennedy's "strong
dissent" in licht of intervening Supreme Court precedent. 468
U.S. at 961.

         In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I want simply to say that my
admittedly limited knowledge of Judge Kennedy's record has led me
to conclude that he would be a truly outstanding Justice of the
Supreme Court. I believe that his outlook on criminal law is
fundamentally in tune with the developing consensus on the Court
and in society, and that he will help safeguard and advance our
recent progress in the war on nrime.
                                         699

  The CHAIRMAN. NOW, gentleman, it is always a pleasure to have
your input, sometimes more of a pleasure than others. In this case
you have a record which you could speak to. The last time you all
testified, the judge for whom you testified--which was your right,
and you did it eloquently--had hardly decided any criminal law
cases, had never written about it, hardly spoken to it, knew noth-
ing, had indicated himself he did not take much interest in as an
academic ncr have opportunity to as a judge, speak to any crimi-
nal-law issues.

  But in this case we have a judge who in fact has probably decid-
ed a couple hundred, 130 criminal cases. And I think your testimo-
ny is particularly important because he has made some decisions,
and I am sure the police officers in the community which the deci-
sion affected were very angry, and I think, Dewey, your testimony
is particularly relevant when you point out that he has been bal-
anced. And I think this should be evidence of the fact that you do
not ask for purity, you do not ask for someone who agrees with you
all the time.

  This is a man who you believe, though, on balance, is fair-
minded, and cognizant of the rights of victims as well as the crimi-
nal, and I, having looked at a summary of all of his criminal-law
cases, I tend to agree with you.

  I have only one question, if I can find it here, and that is with
regard to the exclusionary rule. Is it your view that Judge Kenne-
dy believes that there should be no exclusionary rule, or that he
thinks it should be modified?

  Mr. STOKES. Are you asking
  The CHAIRMAN. I will start with you, Dewey, first, and then work
our way down.
  Mr. STOKES. I think in his opinions that he expressed, that the
exclusionary rule should be modified, not necessarily done away
with. I think he understands that the exclusionary rule is a check-
and-balance system. There is none of us pure as driven snow that
does not need a check and balance, and I think that is what the
exclusionary rule really does.

  Mr. VAUGHN. Nothing I have seen indicates to me that Judge
Kennedy would support the abolition of the exclusionary rule, but
rather, a common-sense interpretation, and the good-faith excep-
tion that reasonable people could arrive at based on a review of the
facts.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. Mr. Hughes?
  Mr. HUGHES. I would agree with my two counterparts. I could
not add any more. I alluded to that in my testimony on the exclu-
sionary rule. I just think it is overdone, in some instances.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much. I yield to my colleague
from South Carolina.
  Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  I think we are very fortunate to have the able representatives
from these law-enforcement organizations here. Mr. John Hughes,
executive director of National Troopers Coalition; Mr. Gerald
Vaughn, executive director of International Association of Chiefs of
Police; and Mr. Dewey R. Stokes, national president, Fraternal
Order of Police.
                                             700

  We have had you all testify before when judges were up, and you
have done a fine job. I want to commend you. I want to commend
you for studying the records of these people. There is nothing more
important than protecting the public, and that is what you do.
Law-enforcement people protect the public.

  I just attended a funeral this afternoon of J.P. Strom, a cousin of
mine, who was the chief of the South Carolina Law Enforcement
Division, the top law enforcement in our State, and I know the
good work you all do.

  I am in touch with our State highway patrol, and State officers,
and others, and there is no group of people I have more respect for
than law-enforcement people. Just as our soldiers protect us
against external enemies, you all protect us against the internal
enemy, the criminal, and it would be a terrible situation in which
to live, if it were not for the able, dedicated efforts of the law-en-
forcement officers.

  Now I just wanted to say that there are several who cannot be
here and testify, for one reason or another. The schedule was
changed, and maybe some of them could not come for that reason,
or others could not come for other reasons.

  Mr. Robert R. Fuesel, president of the Federal Criminal Investi-
gators Association. Mr. Cary Bittick, executive director of the Na-
tional Sheriffs Association. Mr. John J. Bellizzi, executive director
of the National Narcotics Enforcement Officers Assoication.

      THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE; MY NAME IS ROBERT FUESEL.
I AM THE NATIONAL PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS ASSOCIATION AND A
MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT COUNCIL.

      THE FCIA IS MADE UP OF AGENTS REPRESENTING MORE THAN 50 FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE ASSOCIATION IS TO
REPRESENT THE VIEWS OF THOSE PROFESSIONALS WHO COMPRISE THE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT
COMMUNITY. WITH THAT IN MIND, WE SUPPORT THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ASSIST US IN
OBTAINING OUR GOAL. THEREFORE, THE FCIA SUPPORTS THE EFFORTS OF THOSE JURISTS WHO BY
THEIR DECISIONS, SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS IN THEIR FIGHT
AGAINST THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT. IT IS WITH THAT PURPOSE IN MIND THAT THE EXECUTIVE
BOARD, ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL MEMBERSHIP OF THE FCIA, WISHES TO PLACE ON THE
RECORD ITS HEARTY AND UNQUALIFIED ENDORSEMENT OF JUDGE ANTHONY KENNEDY TO BE AN
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

       WE SINCERELY FEEL THAT OUR ASSOCIATION'S GOALS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE
ADVANCED SUBSTANTIALLY BY THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE KENNEDY AS AN ASSOCIATE JUSTICE
OF THE SUPREME COURT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:

       1. HIS PERSONAL HONOR AND INTEGRITY, WHICH HE POSSESSES TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE,
AND HAS DEMONSTRATED CONSISTENTLY IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE;

       2. HIS DEDICATION TO VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT, WITHIN CONSTITUTIONAL BOUNDARIES, OF
THE CRIMINAL LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES, AS EVIDENCED BY HIS LONG AND DISTINGUISHED
RECORD OF SERVICE ON THE APPELLATE BENCH; AND

       3. LIKE OTHERS WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, JUDGE KENNEDY HAS
DEMONSTRATED A REAL CONCERN FOR THE PROBLEMS OF LAWLESSNESS AND VIOLENCE IN OUR
SOCIETY, AND A MARKED SENSITIVITY TO THE CONCERNS FACING TODAY'S LAW ENFORCEMENT
PROFESSIONALS.

       WE RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST THAT JUDGE KENNEDY WILL BRING TO THE SUPREME COURT HIS
EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE AND LEGAL EXPERIENCE. HE IS KNOWN TO HAVE BALANCED VIEWS ON
                                      703

CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND A COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF THE LAW. JUDGE KENNEDY'S VIEWS OH
CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES HAVE EARNED HTM A REPUTATION FOR FAIRNESS, OPEN-^HNDEDNESS
AND SCHOLARSHIP AND ARE IN ACCORD WITH THE VIEWS OF OUR GENERAL MEMBERSHIP.

       THIS ENDORSEMENT IS BASED UPON THE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATORS WHO ARE CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENFORCING OUR NATION'S
LAWS. YOU HERE TODAY ALL KNOW THE TYPE OF DEDICATED CRIMINAL INVESTIGATORS OF WHOM
I SPEAK. THEY ARE THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SPEND THEIR ENTIRE WORKING DAYS AND NIGHTS
IN THE STREETS OF OUR GREAT COUNTRY ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WORKING
AGAINST THOSE WHO ARE BENT ON CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES. WE KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU HERE
TODAY SUPPORT THE DAILY ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS OF THESE AGENTS. LEST THERE BE ANY
DOUBT, WE ARE BEFORE YOU NOW TO STATE UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT THOSE AGENTS SUPPORT
FULLY THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE KENNEDY.

         MR. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, WE ARE MAKING THIS ENDORSEMENT
BECAUSE WE SINCERELY BELIEVE, BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE AND JUDGE KENNEDY'S RECORD,
THAT HIS CONFIRMATION TO THE SUPREME COURT WOULD BE OF BENEFIT NOT ONLY TO THE
FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT EFFORT, BUT TO THE ENTIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY OF THE UNITED
STATES. THANK YOU.

Chairman Biden and Members of the Committee:

       Thank you for inviting the National Sheriffs' Association to
address you on the nomination of Judge Kennedy to be an Associate
Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

       Let me provide you with some background information about
myself and about the National Sheriffs' Association, before
outlining the reasons we recommend that you confirm Judge Kennedy
to this important position.

       My name i s L. Cary Bittick. I am the Executive Director of
the National Sheriffs' Association. Prior to this appointment, I
was the Sheriff of Monroe County, Georgia for 22 years.

       I am here today t o represent the National S h e r i f f s '
Association and i t s 35,000 members. Our membership includes the
nations 3,100 sheriffs, their deputies and other criminal justice
practitioners. The National Sheriffs' Association was f i r s t
incorporated in 1940 as a nonprofit organization. He actively
work to increase the professionalism of law enforcement and
corrections o f f i c e r s , to seek new ways to reduce crime, and to
increase crime prevention efforts.
                                     706

       As you know, sheriffs in most parts of the country have a
variety of duties. In most jurisdictions, sheriffs have several
responsibilities in the criminal justice system -- including law
enforcement and the administration of our jails. Because of the
sheriff's role in enforcing the law and administering the jails,
there are many occasions where the sheriff's job is directly
impacted by the actions of the United States Supreme Court. Each
of us in law enforcement can recite examples in our communities,
where criminals have gone free because of technicalities. In our
view, an overriding problem for law enforcement throughout the
United States has been the courts -- on the federal, state and
local level.

       In our view, the courts have repeatedly overstepped their
authority in criminal cases; they have legislated new rights for
criminals and set up impediments in the search for truth. We are
anxious to see this trend reversed. We look forward to a court
system that puts the meaning of "justice" back into the phrase
"criminal justice system."

       Because of the critical role that the court plays in our
criminal justice system, I have requested to speak to you about
Judge Kennedy.
                                              707

       I am pleased to t e l l you that everything I have heard about
Judge Kennedy from our members is positive and the National
Sheriffs' Association urges you to confirm his nomination.

       The National Sheriffs' Association supports Judge Kennedy for
a variety of reasons which I will outline for you:

       1. His educational and professional background eminently
qualify him for this position. For example, Judge Kennedy:

       o graduated from Stanford University in 1958; he was a
            member of Phi Beta Kappa; and he received his law degree,
            cum laude from Harvard University in 1961;

       o he was in private practice as an associate with the firm
            of T h e l e n , M a r r i n , Johnson and B r i d g e s ; a s o l e
            p r a c t i t i o n e r ; and a p a r t n e r with the firm of Evans,
            Jackson, and Kennedy;

       o in 1975, he was appointed to s i t on the United S t a t e s
            Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; a position he
            currently holds;
                                          708

       o he has taught constitutional law part-time at the McGeorge
            School of Law, University of the Pacific, since 1965.

       In our opinion, Judge Kennedy's various p r o f e s s i o n a l
positions and achievements make him superbly well qualified to
serve on the United States Supreme Court. He has been in private
practice, the educational f i e l d , and served in the j u d i c i a l
branch of government. In each position he has served with
distinction.

       2. We believe that Judge Kennedy's judicial philosophy i s
sound and we support his common sense approach in reviewing
criminal cases. Let me cite two examples of what I mean:

       (a) In Adamson v. Ricketts, Judge Kennedy dissented from the
               majority's holding overturning the death penalty for the
               man who confessed to the murder of Arizona Republic
                r e p o r t e r Don B o l l e s . The majority reversed the
                conviction holding that Arizona o f f i c i a l s violated the
                defendants double-jeopardy rights. When the defendant
                violated the terms of his plea-bargain agreement, by
               which he was convicted of second-degree murder, the
                state tried him for first degree murder. In a strongly
                                   709

        worded dissent, Judge Kennedy called the majority's
        holding "artificial" and said that "it gives the
        defendant a windfall . . . in what should have been a
        simple case of the making of a bargain and the failure
        to keep it."

(b) In another case, United States v. Leon, Judge Kennedy
        dissented from the majority's holding, which affirmed
        the suppression of evidence in a drug case and refused
        to r e c o g n i z e a "good faith" exception to the
        exclusionary rule where police officers act in
        reasonable reliance on a search warrant which is later
        found to be invalid. In his dissent, Judge Kennedy
        stated "one does not have to read many cases involving
        illegal drug traffic before it becomes clear exactly
        what was going on at the residences described by the
        officers affidavit. . . whatever the merits of the
        exclusionary rule; its rigidities become compounded
        unacceptably when courts presume innocent conduct when
        the only common-sense explanation for it is on-going
        criminal activity."
                                        710

       In our view, t h i s common-sense approach is a good one that
will help restore a proper balance to our criminal j u s t i c e
system.

3. During Judge Kennedy's tenure on the Ninth Circuit Court

of Appeals he has demonstrated a commitment to see that justice

is carried out. In the cases t h a t he has reviewed he has

supported several concepts important to us as law enforcement

officers: the death penalty and a "good faith" exception to the

exclusionary rule.  '

(a) In Neuschafer v. Whitley, Judge Kennedy upheld the death
        s e n t e n c e of a Nevada prison inmate convicted of
        strangling another inmate while serving a life-without-
        parole term for the rapes and murders of two teenagers.
        He wrote that there was "no valid c o n s t i t u t i o n a l or
        federal objection to the imposition of the capital
        sentence" on the defendant.
        711

(b) In the Un_ited_State_v^_Leon, which I discussed
        previously. Judge Kennedy's dissent from the majority
        opinion later was the basis for a Supreme Court
        reversal. Judge Kennedy's position in the Leon case
        also provides the basis of President Reagan's proposal
        for exclusionary rule reform.

       We concur with Judge Kennedy's reasoning in these cases and
agree with his support of the death penalty and a "good faith"
exception to the exclusionary rule.

Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee:

In conclusion, I would like to quote President Reagan when he

stated, "It's time we reassert that the fundamental principle and

purpose of criminal justice is to find the truth and not to

coddle criminals." We believe that President Reagan's desire to

put some justice back in the justice system would be best served

by the appointment of Judge Kennedy to the United States Supreme

Court.                                   

Again, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you.

                BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
                       CONSIDERING THE NOMINATION OF
                              JUDGE ANTHONY KENNEDY

                     AS JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT
                                   714

        As in my previous appearance before this conmittee, I wish to
express my appreciation for granting me the opportunity to appear
before you today to testify in these important hearings considering
the nomination of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy.

        My name is John J. Bellizzi. Currently I serve'as the Executive
Director of the International Narcotic Enforcement Officers Association
(INEOA) which is an organization composed basically of narcotic enforce-
ment officers from all levels of government and from throughout the
United States and 50 other countries.

        I appear here today on behalf of 10,000 members and thousands of
other drug enforcement officials throughout the United States.

        Recently drug traffickers have suffered some serious setbacks as
a result of an intensified and concentrated effort by law enforcement.

        The impact of the multitude of seizures of drugs, money and other
assets brought about by successful investigations, arrests and prosecutions
has put such a dent in the illegal trafficking operations that by furious
retaliation the traffickers are committing assaults, violence and murder
on our drug agents and other officials responsible for drug enforcement.

        The DEA reports 144 assaults on agents during the past two years
compared with 50 in 1983 and 1984. During 1986, 96 law enforcement
officets were killed in the line of duty, 66 died as a result of gunshot
wounds. Since 12/31/86, three federal agents have been killed during
drug investigations. Seized last year were 400 automatic weapons
including submachine guns. According to John C. Lawn, Administrator
of DEA, the situation is considered a very dangerous trend.

         A recent extradition by the United States from Columbia of the top
Columbian drug dealer, Carlos Lender Rivas, who has been identified as
one of the most dangerous and successful drug traffickers, has magnified
the high risk imposed on our drug law enforcement agents. Fearing
                                 715

                                                        -2-
reprisals from the arrests of Lender, DEA's administrator, John C. Lawn,
has notified all DEA agents in the United States and in the 43 DEA
offices around the world to exercise an advanced state of readiness
for themselves and their families. Lehder is alleged to have threatened
to kill a federal judge each week until he is freed. The "Medallian
Cartel", allegedly headed by Lehder, has pledged to kill five Americans
for every extradition by Columbia.

        Narcotic law enforcement agents have always operated under high risk
conditions, but recent events have created a situation where their lives
are at stake constantly and these men and women deserve to be recognized
for their dedicated service.

         The thousands of drug enforcement agents who risk their lives
each time they set out on a drug investigation are dedicated. Notwith-
standing the imminent risk they face, they are not the least dissuaded
from performance of duty.

         These officers and their family members are very much concerned
that they receive the same equal protection, the same constitutional
rights, the same constitutional protection afforded to any suspect,
defendant or prisoner charged with the commission of the crime.

         I wish to make it clear that by this endorsement we do not seek
to ingratiate ourselves with Judge Kennedy or the court. We seek no
 favor, we seek no special privileges. What we do seek is protection
of the constitutional rights of the accused and we also seek protection
of the constitutional rights of our law-abiding citizens and of our law
enforcement agents.

         I submit that by his record Judge Kennedy has demonstrated that he
 is capable and indeed willing to do just that - ensure equal protection
 to all regardless of race, color, sex, religious or social background.

                                                       -3-
        The matter of Judge Kennedy's nomination and record was reviewed
by the 50 members of the Board of Directors of INEOA representing the
general membership.
        The board has found that Judge Kennedy is an outstanding nominee -
for the Supreme Court. His impressive career spans the better part
of three decades.
        Judge Kennedy received a unanimous "qualified" rating from the
American Bar Association when he was nominated for the court at age
38 by President Ford. In 1975, the Senate unanimously confirmed
Judge Kennedy for U.S. Court of Appeals.
        Judge Kennedy has served with distinctioa en the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals since 1975.
        The American Bar Association on December 8th announced that its
15 member Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Judge Kennedy
"well qualified" which, as you know, is reserved for those who meet the
highest standards of professioaal competence, judicial temperment and
integrity. The person in this category must be among the best available
for appointment to the Supreme Court according to ABA standards.
        He has participated in over 1,200 decisions am the Mints Circuit
Court of Appeals since 1975 and is now among the most senior active
judges on that court. He baa authored over 400 opinions. "In that
time", President: Reagan has Mid, "he's earned a reputation as a
courageous, tough, but fair Jurist."
         Throughout his career en the beach, Judge Kennedy has faithfully
applied the Constitution and the criminal law in a manner that recognized
a balance between society's need to protect innocent victims and the
procedural rights of defendants.
         Judge Kennedy's decisions reflect his belief Chat law enforcement
activities must be reasonable and that the right of a criminal defendant
                                 717

                                                       -4-
under the Constitution to receive a fair trial must be protected
vigorously.

        However, his judicial decisions likewise reflect his firm
committment to vindicating the victims of crime and protecting the
rights of society from vicious criminals.

         In Judge Kennedy's view, mistakes by law enforcement officers
that do not represent willful misconduct and do not affect the fairness
of a defendant's trial are not grounds for releasing criminals to renew
their war on society. In one of the most important criminal law cases
of this decade, the Supreme Court agreed with Judge Kennedy that a
"good-faith exception" to the exclusionary rule should be recognized
in certain circumstances. Judge Kennedy had argued in a dissenting
opinion that evidence in a drug case should not have been suppressed
where the police officers had acted in good faith and had reasonably
relied upon a search warrant, issued by an impartial magistrate, that
was later found to be invalid (U.S. v. Leon, 1983).

         Supreme Court decision will have a vital impact on the success
of the Nation's crusade against illegal drugs. Judge Kennedy has issued
a number of rulings that are likely to be critical in our efforts to
counter illegal drug trafficking.

         Judge Kennedy has upheld tough sentences against drug dealers.
He upheld a life sentence without parole for a drug manufacturer and
dealer. Although the conviction was for a first offense, Judge Kennedy
noted the defendant had expanded bin drug manufacturing operations
while free on bail, directed the operation from his jail cell after
his bail was revoked, and shown no remorse for his crimes. Judge
Kennedy upheld the maximum sentence imposed by the lower court
 (U.S. v. Stewart, 1987).

                                                       -5-

        International cooperation is essential in combatting inter-

national drug cartels, and in U.S. v. Peterson (1987), Judge Kennedy

held that American officials may assume the constitutional validity of

the actions of foreign governments cooperating in anti-drug ventures.

Judge Kennedy affirmed a conviction obtained on the basis of evidence

received from Phillipine narcotics agents with whom American law enforce-

ment officials were acting in a joint anti-drug venture.

        After careful consideration, the 50 member Board of Directors,

representing the general membership of INEOA, unanimously endorsed and

supports the nomination of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy as Justice to the

United States Supreme Court.

        We urge this committee to vote favorably on the nomination of

Judge Kennedy.

  Senator THURMOND. Mr. Fred L. Foreman, president-elect, Na-
tional District Attorneys Association. Mr. Larry Thompson, former
U.S. Attorney of Atlanta, Georgia.

  And Mr. Chairman, I believe you spoke of Mr. Thompson's state-
ment going in the record. If any of those others who are not here,
if you would not object to putting their statements in the
record

  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. I thought I had already indicated that, but
all their testimony will be placed in the record. I understand they
do have testimony they wish to have entered in the record.

  Senator THURMOND. Also, I see Mr. Don Baldwin out there. Mr.
Don Baldwin is the executive director of the National Law Enforce-
ment Council. He has given fine cooperation to our committee. I
have conferred with him a number of times. I have great confi-
dence in him and I appreciate his presence, although he did not
testify here today.

  So I just want you all to know that we deeply appreciate the in-
terest you take in helping his committee in the matter of the
judges. I think probably that ought to be the first consideration in
selecting a judge, is whether or not he really believes in law en-
forcement; whether or not he will, without fail, favor, take steps to
punish the criminal. And so I am very pleased that you are here to
testify.

  Now, from all the evidence that you have heard at the hearing of
Judge Kennedy, and the American Bar Association recommenda-
tion that he does possess integrity, judicial temperament, and pro-
fessional competence, are you confident--I assume from what you
have said that you feel he should be confirmed by this committee
and the Senate.

  Is the correct, Mr. Stokes?
  Mr. STOKES. That is correct, Senator. I see no reason why not.
  Senator THURMOND. IS that correct, Mr. Vaughn?
  Mr. VAUGHN. That is absoutely correct, Senator.
  Senator THURMOND. IS that correct, Mr. Hughes?
  Mr. HUGHES. Yes, sir, Senator Thurmond, and thank you for
your fine comments.
  Senator THURMOND. I think that is all I have to say. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Senator. The Senator from Alabama.
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I would like to concur in what Senator
Thurmond has said about law enforcement, and include Mr. Don
Bowen who is here, who does a great job of representating the vari-
ous elements of the law-enforcement groups that are here, and over
the country, and he represents them well here.
  I, in regards to the criminal-law aspect of it, I was particularly
struck by a speech that Judge Kennedy made on the rights of vic-
tims, that he made in March of this year to the South Pacific Judi-
cial Conference in Auckland, New Zealand, and during my ques-
tioning I questioned him about that.
  He goes into a great number of things that can be done to im-
prove the victims' rights, and it is something that I think all law-
enforcement officers would like to see, and maybe it can be made
available to them, at least in a synopsis form, if not the full text.
                                         721

  So I thank you for your testimony, and we thank you for your
input in all matters that come up before the Judiciary Committee
in which you have an interest.

  The CHAIRMAN. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
  Senator SPECTER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a question or
two. I appreciate the testimony, especially the emphasis on the bal-
ance necessary, and I do believe that Judge Kennedy has ap-
proached it in that manner.
  We have discussed in the course of the past several days cases
where he has found the State, liberalizing the introduction of evi-
dence. The Leon case, which led to the good-faith exception to the
exclusionary rule, and, also cases where he has found against the
State, in the Oregon case, perhaps went a little too far, even, on
defendants' rights.
  He did testify about three specific cases, and I would like to ask
each of you about the cases.
  He testified about the exclusionary rule, Mapp v. Ohio, and he
said he felt it was a rule which ought to be retained.
  Mr. Stokes, do you think that law enforcement has accommodat-
ed to Mapp v. Ohio, the exclusionary rule, in the 26 years it has
been in effect, since handed down in 1961?
  Mr. STOKES. Well, I think in the Miranda, as you covered
  Senator SPECTER. NO, no. I am on Mapp right now.
  Mr. Stokes. Oh, okay, on the exclusionary.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, take Miranda, if you like, and I will give
Mr. Vaughn Mapp.
  Mr. STOKES. In the Miranda case, I think it is safe to say that
everybody knows the content, and knows their rights under Miran-
da. Every police officer has been educated, reeducated. I think it is
even in high-school law, maybe down as low as grade-school law,
now, that each individual, each defendant has those rights. I think
some cases, the criminal element, whether it is the elite, as you
talked about earlier, or down to the street criminal, knows that he,
or she, has to be provided their Miranda rights. The face is, I think
that is how it evolved, was out of a traffic stop, when it was ex-
tended down to the very minute criminal element.
  I think it is over-used, or over-extended. It has been carried a
little bit further than its intial intent, but again, I think as we pro-
fessionalize and educate police officers throughout this country,
which we have been at before Miranda and since Miranda, and
since some of the other exclusionary, and now the other rules,
police officers are functioning in a very professional manner.
  I do not think it needs to be carried any further.
  Senator SEPCTER. Mr. Vaughn, how about the exclusionary rule
in Mapp v. Ohio? Have law-enforcement officials pretty well accom-
modated to it, so that it is appropriate, in your judgment, to retain
it?
  Mr. VAUGHN. Well, I think certainly it has been around long
enough that we are certainly used to it. I think law-enforcement, at
least to my knowledge, and particularly the IACP, would not sup-
port an effort to have the exclusionary rule tossed out completely.
  Our concern lies primarily in two areas. One is that the sanc-
tions imposed for what may have been misconduct really do not
affect the officer who may have engaged in the conduct. The people
                                             722

who are most hurt by it are innocent citizens. In many cases, crimi-
nals continually engage in criminal conduct and then are right
back out on the street.

  We do support meaningful sanctions that would discourage inap-
propriate or illegal police activity, and ensure that constitutional
protections against unreasonable search and seizure be protected.

   So that is our concern, the practical effect of the exclusionary
rule. Secondly, in many cases, the inability or lack of willingness of
the courts to apply common sense, or a good-faith exception when
officers acted reasonably, appropriately, and based on that good
faith. This has had a harmful effect on seciety at large.

  I would like to speak to Miranda, with your permission, for a
moment.

  I do not think the International Association of Chiefs of Police at
least would support throwing Miranda out, either. Our concern,
however, has been--if in fact the intent of Miranda is to ensure
the protection of the rights of the accused--that since the time Mi-
randa was handed down, there have been advances in technology,
and increased levels of training, and minimum standards have
been implemented throughout the States. Perhaps a review of Mi-
randa, in the context of the times in which we live today may be
appropriate, to ensure that given that technology available, and ev-
erything else, maybe the very intent of Miranda in protecting peo-
ple's rights could be better achieved by other means available to us
today.

  But we would not support any effort to throw Miranda out.
  Senator SPECTER. Well, the other question I will not ask because
my time is up. The case that Judge Kennedy referred to, on Gideon
v. Wainwright on right to counsel. But he has testified, in very
forceful terms, about his recognition of the Bill of Rights, and the
expansion, by judicial remedy, of counsel in the Gideon case, and
exclusionary rule, and Mapp, and confessions in Miranda.
  And I think it is a tribute to law-enforcement officials that you
gentlemen are here this evening at this later hour, and that you
testify with such balance and such concern for an appropriate bal-
ance, recognizing defendants' rights and recognizing society's
rights.
  Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
  Mr. HUGHES. Thank you, Senator Specter.
  The CHAIRMAN. YOU look like you want to say something else,
Mr. Vaughn.

   Mr. VAUGHN. I do.

  The CHAIRMAN. I have known you well enough now to know you
would like to. Go ahead. I can tell. I am happy to hear what you
have to say.

  Mr. VAUGHN. I would just like to convey to Senator Thurmond
our condolences, not only as an association, for the loss of one of
the strongest members of IACP, and not only the head of law en-
forcement in your State, but a personnal relative, and I would
convey our condolences to you, and express to your our sense of
loss as wrell.

  The CHAIRMAN. That is very nice of you. Well, gentlemen, thanks
again. Your testimony was welcome and useful, and we appreciate
your coming at this later hour in the day. Thank you.
                                             723

   Mr. HUGHES. Thank you.
  The CHAIRMAN. NOW I say to my colleagues on the panel here, on
the Judiciary Committee, that there are at this moment no more
public witnesses.
   We will not vote on this nomination until shortly after resuming
the Senate session when you all can--you are welcome to stay and
listen to our business, but you are also free to go. Thank you.
   We will vote shortly after we return. We will be back on the
25th, and it would be my intention to schedule an executive com-
mittee meeting shortly after that time, as is appropriate, when we
know we are all going to be here. And we will keep the record open
between now and the time we return, for any additional testimony
that any of our colleagues, or any public witnesses would like to
put in.
  I indicated to Judge Kennedy that I have some questions that I
will submit to him in writing, and any of my coleagues who may
have them also, may have questions. I do not have, at this moment,
any intention of asking Judge Kennedy to come back, but the com-
mittee reserves the right to do that, and I would expect, after
having spoken to the leader, Senator Byrd, that shortly after we
vote, assuming we vote favorably--or unfavorably, because it is
still my intention, regardless, that the full Senate get a chance to
vote on this--that there will be a scheduled vote in the Senate, I
am told, as shortly thereafer as Senate business permits.
  I thank my colleagues for their attendance, and all those wit-
nesses who have appeared, and the Committee stands in recess at
the call of the Chair.
   Senator THURMOND. Could I say a word?
  The CHAIRMAN. Yes. Sure you can, Senator.
   Senator THURMOND. Mr. Chairman, since the testimony is all in
now except some written statements to come in, I just want to
make a statement about the hearing.
   The ABA, American Bar Association Committee screens the
judges, and they have given Judge Kennedy the highest rating they
could give him, "well-qualified." That means that they feel he has
integrity, judicial temperament and professional competence.
   There is no one who has disputed that testimony during these
hearings. None of the witnesses have taken issue with that point. I
think the testimony shows here clearly that Judge Kennedy is a
profound student of the Constitution and that he will construe the
law and the Constitution in the best interests of the public.
   I think also that the evidence shown here is that he is an inde-
pendent thinker and that he answers questions here in an honest
and forthright manner, which is very admirable. I think also that
the testimony showed that Judge Kennedy is open-minded, that he
believes in stare decisis, but that in cases where warranted that he
would feel free to take another course; that he would give careful
consideration to every case that he hears, and that he also shows
compassion.
   I think the testimony showed, too, that he does not in any way
appear to be prejudiced against anyone on account of his race, his
color, his sex or national origin or religion. I think also the evi-
dence is clear that from his practice of law and his service as a pro-

      90-878 0 - 89 - 2k
                                             724

fessor of law and as a judge on the bench that he has gained the
respect and admiration of those with whom he has come in contact.

  The very fact that we had lawyers here from Sacramento, Cali-
fornia, his home city, who testified so clearly in his behalf--Na-
thaniel S. Colley, Jr., who is a partner in Colley, Lindsay and
Colley in Sacramento, a black man, gave strong testimony for him,
and also these other witnesses from Sacramento indicate the admi-
ration and esteem in which they hold Judge Kennedy.

  I think all of the testimony, in general, shows that he is a man of
convictions; he is a man of ability, he is a man of wisdom, and a
man of intelligence. I think he possesses all the good qualities that
we need in a Supreme Court Justice.

  Also, I am convinced too from his testimony and his record
throughout his career that he has great respect for the majesty of
our system of government, which I think is extremely important.
The American Bar did not consider that, but in my opinion that is
a criteria that is very valuable and should be considered.

  So, for all of these reasons I am thoroughly convinced that Judge
Kennedy should be confirmed by this committee and should be con-
firmed by the Senate, and I predict that that will take place.

  Now, Mr. Chairman, in closing, too, I want to take this opportu-
nity to again compliment you during the hearings on Judge Kenne-
dy for your unfailing courtesy, for your usual fairness, and your
evident dedication to seeing that these hearings went off in the
right way, and that has contributed largely to the smoothness with
which these hearings have gone.

  We will look forward to the vote in January, and if you wish to
fix a date now, we can agree on that.

  The CHAIRMAN. I promise the Senator we will vote very shortly
after returning. The Senate schedule is not even permanently set
at this point, to the best of my knowledge, and I can assure the
Senator we will vote before the month is out.

  Senator THURMOND. Your word to me is as good as gold that we
will vote soon after we return. That is a reasonable commitment. I
congratulate you and, again, thank you for all you are doing to
make these hearings go so well.

  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
  Do either of my remaining colleagues have anything they would
like to say?
  Senator HEFLIN. Well, I just look at the Chairman and the rank-
ing member having this love feast right now. [Laughter.]
  I would like to comment about the Chairman. I think he has
moved expeditiously, but reasonably, and has done a fine job and a
very fair job in chairing these hearings.
  The CHAIRMAN. Well, I thank you--an unnecessary comment,
but appreciated.
  Do not feel obliged to say anything, Senator. The hour is getting
late, but the Senator from Pennsylvania.
   Senator SPECTER. With less than 30 seconds, I have stayed
through the concluding proceedings for the purpose of expressing
my congratulations to you, Senator Biden, for the conduct of these
hearings, for starting them so promptly.
  The CHAIRMAN. Thank you.
                                               725

  Senator SPECTER. YOU were under considerable pressure and
counter-pressure. The President announced his intention to submit
the name of Judge Kennedy on November 11th and you started
these hearings very expeditiously, and I think the conduct of the
hearings showed that you were correct; that it was possible to do a
thorough job.

  I believe that these hearings have been a credit to the Judiciary
Committee and a credit to the Senate and a credit to the country. I
think that the approach of getting into the record of judicial philos-
ophy and the thoroughness of the committee is exemplary. Here we
started shortly after 9:00 a.m. and we are concluding a few minutes
before 8:00 p.m., and I think that is a tribute to your operation of
the committee, Mr. Chairman.

  So I did want to stay to express my appreciation and compliment
you on your fine work.

  The CHAIRMAN. Well, you are all very gracious. I appreciate that.
  I would just say for the record that the Senate schedule does
impact significantly on when we can and cannot schedule a hear-
ing. I must tell you, had the nomination come on October 15th in-
stead of November 11th, I probably would not have held the hear-
ings until now anyway.
  1 believe that we are running at the lower end of the time we
need when you are down around 30 days. That is enough time in
most cases, but it is tough to get it done in that time. The more
appropriate time would be somewhere on the order of 50 to 60
days, in my view.
  But with the Senate schedule, the Christmas holiday, and the
Senate being out, as was indicated by others of my colleagues, the
choice was to go now or not go until the end of January. And to be
very blunt about it, we have other important matters, also.
  I have a very important responsibility on the Foreign Relations
Committee on the INF Agreement, and the rest of us have similar
responsibilities. I hope, on reflection, those who opposed us--and
none of my colleagues on the committee opposed my starting at
this time. I asked for a vote and they all agreed to start at this
time, but I hope those who believe we started too early are satisfied
by the thoroughness of the questioning and, I might add, the an-
swers from Judge Kennedy.
  Well, with that, enough talking. We will stand in recess to the
call of the chair.
  [Whereupon, at 7:50 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

The Honorable Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Chairman
United States Senate
Committee on the Judiciary
Washington, D.C. 20510-6275
Dear Senator Biden:

                   Enclosed please find my answers to the written
questions from you and Senators Heflin, DeConcini,
Simon, and Levin, forwarded to me by your letter of
December 18, 1987. Also, I have made the necessary
corrections to the transcript of my testimony before
your Committee, and I am transmitting those corrections
to the appropriate office.

                   Please let me take this opportunity to thank
you and the members of the Committee once again for the
many courtesies you have extended to me.

                       ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR BIDEN

                 1. If you assume that every right oust have a remedy,
difficult questions are raised about what it would mean to
eliminate the exclusionary rule. If the courts were to decide
that the exclusionary rule is not a proper remedy for violations
of an individual's Fourth Amendment rights, the courts would then
arguably have to provide some other remedy. Putting aside the
issue of whether the exclusionary rule should be abolished, do you
believe that there must be some alternative remedy for Fourth
Amendment violations before the exclusionary rule could be
eliminated?

                  My testimony before the Committee was that society has
paid a high price for putting the exclusionary rule in place. The
rule is now an important and workable part of the criminal justice
system. It is the duty of the Court to ensure that it is
administered in a pragmatic and reasonable manner. Transcript of
Hearings, December 15, 1987, Afternoon Session. I also stated
before the Committee my belief that when the exclusionary rule was
created, the courts were concerned that the Fourth Amendment was
not being enforced. Transcript of Hearings, December 15, 1987,
Afternoon Session. I am aware that some have argued that
alternative means for ensuring compliance with the Fourth
Amendment could be substituted in place of the exclusionary rule,
but I know of no precise proposal submitted by either Congress or
the courts to accomplish this.

                  2. Even if alternative remedies to the exclusionary
rule were in place, it is not clear that the rule should
necessarily be abolished. It may be that the rule is desirable
for other reasons as well -- to deter police misconduct, for
example, or to keep the courts from becoming involved in illegal
acts.

                  In his confirmation hearings to be Director of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, William Sessions testified:

                  As a judge, I know that the protections
                  afforded by the exclusionary rule are
                  extremely important to fair play, and the
                  proper carrying out of the law enforcement
                  responsibility. . . . And my own belief is,
                  in the role as director of the FBI, that I
                  would encourage a careful review of [the
                  exclusionary rule], and a careful carving out,
                  if there can be exceptions. But, by and
                  large, I am happy with it and the way it is,
                  because I know that as difficult as it is for
                  law enforcement in the courts, that it
                                    728

                 protects the rights of citizens and that is
                  important.

It may be that you disagree, at least in part, with Judge
Sessions, as you have referred to the "rigidities" of the
exclusionary rule in two of your opinions. If there were an
alternative remedy in place, would it be proper, in your view, to
abolish the exclusionary rule?

                  Judge Sessions' comments seem generally in accord with
the views on the rule that I expressed in answer to your question
1 above, and, in my Committee hearing testimony, particularly in
an exchange with Senator Leahy. Transcript of Hearings, December
15, 1987, Afternoon Session.

                 The exclusionary rule, and the search and seizure
protections it secures, must be interpreted in a reasonable,
sensible manner. Fourth Amendment principles are basic liberties,
but they should not be synonymous with a doctrine of such
abstraction that it cannot be implemented in a practical way.

                  Before the Court could consider any overruling of the
exclusionary rule, it would be required to resolve at least two
questions. First, the Court would evaluate whether any alternate
protections that were offered to replace the exclusionary rule
were in fact effective. Second, the Court would consider whether
the exclusionary rule, nevertheless, has independent
constitutional significance. Respected jurists and commentators
have argued that courts become implicated in the violation of a
basic constitutional liberty when they rely on tainted evidence.
That argument must be carefully considered in any decision
affecting the exclusionary rule.

                  3. You have occasionally been somewhat critical of the
way courts have applied the exclusionary rule. In one case, you
stated that it may be necessary to "reexamine it altogether," if
it "becomes an end in itself." (U.S. v. Harvey.)

                  These comments are relevant to a debate that has been
carried on in the Supreme Court in recent years. Some Justices,
such as Justice Brennan, argue that there are strong moral and
legal justifications for the exclusionary rule outside of any
impact it may have on police behavior. They argue that it is
unconstitutional for the courts to accept evidence that was
illegally obtained, simply because the courts must have "clean
hands," and must not engage in or benefit from illegal conduct.

                  Other Justices, such as Justice White, reject the notion
that the exclusionary rule has a moral force in and of itself.
These Justices argue that the only acceptable rationale for the
exclusionry rule is if it deters the police from engaging in
improper conduct.

                                                       -2-
                                     729

                 Do you believe that there are any acceptable
justifications for the exclusionary rule other than deterring
improper police conduct?

                 If you believe that deterrence is the only acceptable
rationale, have you found, based on your experience in criminal
law cases, that the rule has been successful in influencing police
behavior?

                  I hope that my answers in questions 1 and 2 are
sufficient to respond to this question as well. It bears
repeating that the exclusionary rule should not become an end in
itself in the sense that it becomes unhinged from the real and
substantive Fourth Amendment values that it implements and
protects. If presented in the context of a concrete dispute
before the Court, I will give every consideration to counsels'
arguments on potential purposes and justifications for the rule.
The rule has been successful in influencing police behavior.

                  4. Antonia Hernandez, President and General Counsel of
the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, testified
on Wednesday, December 16, that she had considerable concern about
your commitment to protecting the civil rights of the Hispanic
community. In particular, Ms. Hernandez said:

                  . . . I want . . . to go back and to ask Judge
                  Kennedy to give further assurance and
                  clarification as to how he views Hispanics.
                  My concern is that he might not feel that we
                  deserve the same type of protection as the
                  black community and other protected minorities
                  that are protected from civil rights.

                  I want that assurance. I want to see what he
                  states on the record. I'm also concerned on
                  the issue of women, the AFSCME issue. I'm
                  concerned on the Spanqler issue, I'm concerned
                  with the TOPIC issue, and basically the common
                  threat that one sees in those cases is the
                  threat that he . . . kicks people out of
                  court, that he doesn't give them that
                  opportunity. And even when they do win, even
                  when they do satisfy the stringent
                  requirements of a Federal District Judge, that
                  he overturns those decisions.

                  He is a man of intellect, no question about
                  it; a man of devotion, but he's also a nan of
                  the establishment and, unfortunately, we have
                  not been part of that establishment.

                                                       -3-

                  And what I want is an expans[ive]
                  consideration of that perception of what
                  America is. (Tr. 12/16/87, at 258-59.)

Please identify those aspects of your record that, in your view,
respond to Ms. Hernandez's concerns. In addition, please discuss
whether and how the philosophy and approach that you would bring
to the Supreme Court, should you be confirmed by the Senate, would
be responsive to these concerns.

                  As a Californian, I have understood for many years that
Hispanic people are a vital part of our society and culture, and
that their ethnic or minority status should not be used to
disadvantage them, either by acts of hostility or acts of passive
indifference.

                  Indifference to the civil rights of Hispanics, women,
and other minorities is unacceptable. Hispanic persons are
entitled to civil rights protections, in whatever degree is
necessary to ensure that they have each and every one of the
rights guaranteed to all Americans. In my testimony before the
Committee, I stated that "We simply do not have any real freedom
if we have discrimination based on race, sex, religion or national
origin, and I share that commitment." Transcript of Hearings,
December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session. I also stated in my
testimony that the Equal Protection Clause applies to all persons:
"[t]he amendment by its terms, of course, includes persons, and I
think was very deliberately drafted in that respect." Transcript
of Hearings, December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session. I stated in my
response to the Senate Judiciary Committee Questionnaire that
"[c]ompassion, warmth, sensitivity, and an unyielding insistence
on justice are the attributes of every good judge." Questionnaire
at 54.

                  I have written or joined various opinions ruling in
favor of claims brought by Hispanics, women, and other civil
rights claimants. In Flores v. Pierce, 617 F.2d 1386 (9th Cir.),
cert, denied, 444 U.S. 875 (1980), I upheld a judgment in favor of
Hispanics against municipal officials who had a history of
racially motivated activity against Hispanics. In James v. Ball,
613 F.2d 180 (9th Cir. 1980), rev'd, 451 U.S. 355 (1981), a voting
rights case, I invoked the one-person, one-vote principle to
strike as unconstitutional a state statute that limited voting in
elections for directors of an agriculture and power district to
landowners, even though a large number of the district's users of
water and power were not landowners. In Bates v. Pacific Maritime
Ass'n, 744 F.2d 705 (9th Cir. 1984), I upheld an employer's
obligations under a Title VII consent decree that required four of
each ten new employees be minority group members, by finding that
the consent decree applied to the successor employer that had
acquired the business. In NLRB v. Apollo Tire Co., 604 F.2d 1180
 (9th Cir. 1979) (Kennedy, J., concurring), I concluded that
illegal aliens are employees entitled to protection under the

                                                       -4-
                                     731

National Labor Relations Act, and stated that "if the [Act] were
inapplicable to workers who are illegal aliens, we would leave
helpless the very persons who most need protection from
exploitative employer practices such as occurred in this case."
Id. at 1184. In Lynn v. Western Gillette, Inc., 564 F.2d 1282
(9th Cir. 1977), I wrote an opinion that adopted a broad and
generous interpretation of the time period for claimants to bring
suit in sex discrimination cases.

                  The Flores case extensively reviewed evidence of
discrimination, including subtle code words for discrimination,
such as statements that applications were reviewed for
"desirability" of the applicant, that the town involved was "a
fine little town," and that it was necessary to keep the town on a
"good level." In summarizing the holding of the case, I stated:

                  One of the first cases interpreting the equal
                  protection clause stands for the rule, among
                  others, that the effect of a law may be so
                  harsh or adverse in its weight against a
                  particular race that an intent to discriminate
                  is not only a permissible inference but also a
                  necessary one. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S.
                  356, 6 S. Ct. 1064, 30 L. Ed. 220 (1886). In
                  the instant case, the disparate effect of the
                  action on Mexican-Americans was so compelling
                  that the effect may approach, if it does not
                  reach, the demonstration of an intent to
                  discriminate that was made in Yick Wo v.
                  Hopkins. This might be a case where "a clear
                  pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than
                  race, emerges from the effect of the state
                  action." Arlington Heights, supra, 429 U.S.
                  at 266, 97 S. Ct. at 564. We need not,
                  however, rely on effect alone, for other
                  evidence suggests a motive or intent to
                  discriminate. It was shown that the defendant
                  city officials deviated from previous
                  procedural patterns, that they adopted an ad
                  hoc method of decision making without
                  reference to fixed standards, that their
                  decision was based in part on reports that
                  referred to explicit racial characteristics,
                  and that they used stereotypic references to
                  individuals from which the trier of fact could
                  infer an intent to disguise a racial animus.

                  In addition, from 1967 through 1969, I represented a
group of Hispanic citizens of the Sacramento area. The group
planned to develop a city block in downtown Sacramento as a
cultural center and retail complex with emphasis on fostering
Hispanic culture and providing opportunities for businesses owned

by Hispanic proprietors. We were successful in obtaining from the
Redevelopment Agency of the City of Sacramento development rights
for one square block in the downtown area. We incorporated an
entity called Plaza de las Flores. After submission of a
prospectus, we received a permit from the Commissioner of
Corporations of the State of California for a limited public
offering to raise the necessary capital. Building costs, interest
rates, and other economic factors became unfavorable, and the
cultural center was not developed. I devoted over five hundred
hours of unpaid legal services to this project, and in the course
of it came to know better and understand the aspirations of the
Hispanic community in California.

                   ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR DeCONCINI

                  1. You were quite critical several years ago on the
portion of the Judicial Tenure Act dealing with the discipline of
judges.

                  Now that this provision has been in effect for a few
years, I would like to know if your feelings about it have changed
at all, and whether you feel the independence of the judiciary has
diminished?

                  I am pleased to have the opportunity to comment on my
criticism of the original legislative proposal that led to
enactment of the Judicial Tenure and Disability Act.

                  At the 1978 Ninth Circuit Conference, there was
considerable concern about the bill in its original form. At the
request of the judicial delegation of the Conference, I presented
the opposition case in response to a presentation by Leonard
Janofsky, then President of the American Bar Association, who
spoke in favor of the bill.

                  In its original form, the bill would have established a
national commission, ignoring existing lines of authority within
the circuits. The commission would have had authority to remove a
judge from office without the necessity of impeachment. My
position was that the core of judicial independence would be
subverted by either or both of these provisions. I adhere to that
view.

                  As other judges voiced similar opposition and were
prepared to testify against the bill, I took no part in any later
discussions or hearings on the bill. The two principal features
that I had criticized were eliminated from the enacted measure.

                  The Act in its present form was adopted in 1980. I have
not had extensive contact with it. I did suggest that the Ninth
Circuit should draft rules to implement the Act, and I
participated in that project. Our rules were sent to other
circuits for study and were considered by the Judicial Conference
of the United States in its recommendations for uniform rules. I
have received reports from tine to time from our Chief Judge and
from the Assistant Circuit Executive charged with administering
the Act. We have had two serious cases, one involving a non-
Article III judge and one involving an Article III judge. In both
of these matters, I was either off the Circuit Council on rotation
or recused.

                  Over the last decade, I have observed that federal
judges are becoming more conscious of their responsibility to
explain and clarify judicial procedures to the public and are
becoming more conscious, too, that the perception of fairness, as
                                      734

well as the fact of it, is essential in any judicial system. This
growing sensitivity reflects several factors, including heightened
awareness of the duty of all officials to be accountable to the
public; effective use of the Circuit Conference to exchange views
between the bench and the bar regarding attitude, temperament, and
performance of judges; and the institution, through the Circuit
Conference, of procedures for individual judges to take surveys
and use other techniques for self-evaluation. These matters are
difficult to measure, but I tend to think this change in attitude
would have come about without passage of the Act. Nevertheless,
the provisions of the Act fit well within this framework.

                  My own assessment is that in the Ninth Circuit the
experience under the Act has been good. The Act provides an
avenue for lawyers or litigants to express criticism or
grievances. This has value in itself, both as a safety valve and
as a basis for us to evaluate our performance. In this circuit, a
copy of any complaint goes immediately to the judge concerned.
Many of the complaints are frivolous, but, even so, the existence
of a misunderstanding or dissatisfaction is significant for the
judge involved.

                  2. Do you believe that there are any specific areas of
the Act which require refinement? This is, of course, assuming
that the Act will remain in force. If your answer is yes, what
suggestions would you have for improving this Act?

                  I have not studied the Act at great length and have no
specific suggestions for amendment or refinement. Question 2 is
broad, so please note my failure to suggest amendments should not
be understood as saying the Act is valid in its various potential
applications.

                  3. Judge Kennedy, if your opinion of the Judicial
Tenure Act has not changed in the last seven years, what
alternatives would you offer in replacement of the Act?

                  Pending further study, I would not recommend repeal of
the Act as it exists or an alternative to replace it.

                  4. In your opinion, do you believe the implementation
of the Act has had any positive effect on the judiciary? Has
there been any negative effect on the judiciary since adoption of
the Act?

                                                       -2-
                                    735

                  I drafted my answers to questions 1 and 2 to be
responsive to this question as well. I have noted the positive
effects, though it is difficult to measure how many are directly
attributable to the Act. I see no negative effects, except that
the Act should not be a precedent for interference with judicial
independence in the guise of imposing further disciplinary
procedures.

                  5. Judge Kennedy, I am curious as to how you feel this
legislation would undermine the independence of the judiciary when
it does not take any authority away from the judiciary. The
legislation merely provides a process through which the judiciary
may police itself.

                  You have stated that this legislation will pit judge
against judge. Even if this occurs, how would this amount to an
undermining of judicial independence?

                  Since the Act would promote the integrity and moral
behavior of judges, wouldn't the independence of the judiciary
viz-a-viz the legislative and executive branches actually be
strengthened?

                  As indicated, my opposition to the legislation was in
its original form, and not as it is now on the books.

                  I respectfully submit my 1978 comment that we must be
careful not to pit judge against judge remains valid. A federal
judge is independent not only from other branches of the
government, but also from other judges within the judiciary,
subject to review and correction of his or her judgments in the
ordinary course and to routine administrative control.
Legislation that puts disciplinary power in the hands of judges
can be just as corrosive of judicial independence as legislation
that puts disciplinary powers in the political branches. A
decision in favor of an unpopular cause can make the judge
unpopular with his or her colleagues, as well as with the public.
That judge deserves protection. Judicial independence has an
individual aspect, as well as an institutional one.

                  Finally, the suggestion that a statute enhances
independence because it promotes integrity and moral behavior is
unavailing, especially if offered as a blanket justification for
proposals of the incursive kind I criticized in 1978. In that
context, the argument proves too much. Separation of powers is an
essential element of the constitutional design. The lesson of
history is that structural integrity of the separate branches
preserves the constitutional balance. A breach of the structure
undermines that balance, whatever the motive. Judicial
independence may be lost beyond restoration if it is compromised,
even for the best of motives. It is my hope that Congress will
continue to review the Act we are discussing in this series of

                                                       -3-
                                    736

questions, and that it will give all deference to the proposition
that structural independence of the judiciary is one of the surest
protections of our constitutional freedoms.

                  6. Judge Kennedy, let us assume that your criticisms of
the Judicial Tenure Act are right on target.

                  Do you feel that the impeachment process, the primary
constitutional policing mechanism on the judiciary, can
sufficiently redress all instances of judicial misconduct, given
the time and other practical restraints which are inherent in the
impeachment process?

                  If you respond in the negative, then how do you propose
that we fill this void?

                  Recent events reaffirm that sufficiently serious
misconduct by a federal judge may result in the judge's
impeachment. Although impeachment is a somewhat cumbersome
process, it retains its vitality.

                  In my view, judicial independence is best preserved if
the impeachment process is the sole mechanism to remove federal
judges. The Pramers insisted on judicial independence as a
necessary component of the elaborate and delicately-balanced
constitutional system they devised, and impeachment was the device
that the Framers provided to hold judges accountable for their
misconduct. I urge this as a matter of policy and do not thereby
intend to express an opinion on constitutional interpretation.

                      ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR HEFLIN

                  1. Judge Kennedy, would you please elaborate on your
views of the incorporation doctrine? Do you believe that the
authors of the due process clause intended to apply the Bill of
Rights against the states, as well as the Federal government? Do
you accept the Supreme Court's rulings in this area as settled
law?

                  In 1925, in Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 (1925), the
Supreme Court announced that it would assume that the First
Amendment right of free speech was encompassed within the word
"liberty" of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The Supreme Court has since held that many of the provisions of
the Bill of Rights apply to the states by incorporation through
the Fourteenth Amendment. In so doing, the Court has been careful
to reject the argument, made most notably by the late Justice
Black, that the Bill of Rights is applicable in its entirety to
the states. I have not formed any conclusive views on this point;
and the question whether certain provisions should be applied to
the states (the civil jury trial guarantee of the Seventh
Amendment, for example) may still come before the Court.
Accordingly, while the incorporation doctrine is a central tenet
of constitutional law, its application in discrete instances is
still open to explanation and refinement.

                  2. Judge Kennedy, as you know. Section 2 of Article III
refers to the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme
Court, and has the exceptions and regulations clause contained
therein. Would you set forth your views on whether Congress could
strip the Supreme Court or the lower federal courts of
jurisdiction pertaining to a particular subject matter such as
school prayer?

                  The scope of congressional power under the exceptions
and regulations clause has been a subject of debate since the
inception of the federal judicial system under the Constitution.
While the power conferred in Congress is undoubtedly significant,
its limits must await a case by case determination.

                  As a general matter, it appears to me that there are
serious questions whether Congress is authorized to constrain the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to determine issues of federal
law or constitutional rights. Under the tripartite scheme of
government established by the Constitution, the Supreme Court is
generally regarded as the ultimate arbiter of the meaning of
federal law and rights conferred on individuals by the
Constitution. There would be grave constitutional questions
concerning whether the exceptions and regulations clause gives
                                     738

Congress the power to divest the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to
hear cases involving school prayer if the effect were to strip the
Court of jurisdiction to determine rights under the First
Amendment.

                 This is a distinct question from the power of Congress
to alter the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts. I have
suggested that in order to reduce the heavy caseload of the
federal courts, Congress may wish to consider excluding certain
classes of diversity cases, such as auto accident cases.

                  Please refer also to my answers to Senator Simon's
written questions on this point.

                       ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR SIMON

                  1. I would like your views on one of my favorite
quotations from Justice Harlan. He said, "Liberty is not a series
of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property,
the freedom of speech, press, and religion. It is a rational
continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all
substantial, arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints."
What do you believe should be the Supreme Court's role in
advancing that continuum?

                  As I stated in a response to a question of Senator Biden
on December 14, 1987, there is a zone of liberty, a zone of
protection for the individual. A line is drawn, and the
individual can tell the government that beyond the line it may not
go. The Supreme Court's role is to determine where that line is
drawn and to determine what principles are to be used in defining
the protections contained within the zone of liberty. Transcript
of Hearings, December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session. Those
principles must be based on an objective application of the
Constitution.

                  Incidentally, I too admire Justice Harlan, whose words
you quote.

                  2. Judge Kennedy, I had an exchange with Judge Bork
during the hearings on his nomination that helped crystallize for
me the differences in our philosophy. I don't assume you
necessarily share Judge Bork's views, but I would like your
comments on our discussion.

                  In a speech Bork had stated, "what a court adds to one
person's constitutional rights, it subtracts from the rights of
others." I asked Judge Bork about that statement, and he told me,
"I think it's a matter of plain arithmetic." Now, as I told Judge
Bork, "I have long thought it to be fundamental in our society
that when you expand the liberty of any of us, you expand the
liberty of all of us." Please comment.

                  As a philosophic and legal proposition, I agree with
your statement that ". . . in our society . . . when you expand
the liberty of any of us, you expand the liberty of all of us."
Our constitutional history is replete with examples of cases in
which the Supreme Court has held that the liberty provided in the
Constitution extends to a particular action or right asserted by a
person; and, as a result, all of our freedoms have been enhanced.
                                   740

                  I think there is universal agreement that liberties are
not absolutes which must necessarily supersede all competing
interests. In an appropriate case where the rights of others are
implicated, the authority of the legislature to regulate begins to
come in play. For example, the constitutional right to travel
does not necessarily include the right to trespass on the property
of another, and the right of free speech does not permit a person
in every instance to defame another.

                  3. My father was a Lutheran minister, and I understand
the yearnings that some people have for values. But while I
believe that there are some things government can do well, there
are also things government cannot do well, like promote religion.
I think it is important to respect our constitutional tradition of
separation of church and state. The system that has evolved is
basically very healthy for both government and religion.

                  In 1968 in a publication of the students of the HcGeorge
Law School, you were asked how you would like the law reformed in
your field, constitutional law. Among other things you stated:

                  "And the Court should leave room for some
         expressions of religion in state-operated places. There
         should be a place for some religious experience in
         schools, for a Christmas tree in a public housing
         center."

Is this still your view? Could you elaborate? What principles
would you use in deciding what religious expressions should be
permitted state sponsorship?

                  As I told Senator Heflin in response to a similar
question about that article, the law would be an impoverished
subject if my views had not changed over twenty years. Transcript
of Hearings, December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session. As a circuit
judge, I have not had an opportunity to address Establishment
Clause questions in depth. I have no fixed views on the subject,
and I would not now necessarily endorse all of the views in the
article you quote.

                  As I understand the Establishment Clause, which, among
other protections, prohibits the government from either advancing
or inhibiting religion, it can work at counter purposes with the
Free Exercise Clause. The classic example is government's
determination whether to furnish a chaplain to soldiers stationed
on a military base. If the government does supply a chaplain, it
is in a sense advancing religion; if it does not, one could argue
that it is inhibiting the free exercise of religion. Transcript

                 This is a complicated area of the law, and the decisions
are difficult to reconcile. The Supreme Court has relied on the
historic practices of the people of the United States for guidance
in interpreting the Establishment Clause, and this approach is
helpful, although not necessarily conclusive. I recognize that
the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses are fundamental
precepts of American constitutional law. Transcript of Hearings,
December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session. The framers of the Bill of
Rights, as well as the framers of the main body of the
Constitution, recognized these principles in explicit terms. U.S.
Const, art. VI, cl. 3; U.S. Const, amend. I. I will endeavor to
decide how these constitutional provisions should be implemented
by an objective application of the text and purpose of the Framers
in light of the Supreme Court's precedents.

4. In answer to a question from Senator Thurmond

yesterday, you suggested that one way to reduce the workload of

the federal courts would be for Congress to exclude certain kinds

of cases from federal court jurisdiction. Legislation to remove

various kinds of cases -- school prayer, abortion, busing to

remedy segregated schools  from the Supreme Court and other

federal jurisdiction has been introduced and is pending in the

Subcommittee on the Constitution, which I chair. These bills have

proven to be highly controversial. In what kind of cases do you

think Congress should consider eliminating federal jurisdiction?

What Constitutional problems might that pose?

                 In view of your interpretation, it is most important to
clarify my response.

                  I did not intend to suggest that it is constitutional
for Congress to limit jurisdiction in a class of cases based on
the constitutional or federal issues presented. In fact, I
suggested at one point in my testimony that Congress should not
take that step without serious consideration of the grave
constitutional questions it would present. Transcript of
Hearings, December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session.

                 My answer to Senator Thurmond was in the context of
diversity cases. For some years, those who study the federal
system have been concerned that the heavy workload of the courts
may have an adverse affect on the continued efficiency of the
federal courts in the interpretation and enforcement of federal
law. One solution offered over the years is to eliminate or
curtail diversity jurisdiction. I suggested in my testimony that
rather than increasing the jurisdictional amount in diversity
cases, a proposal that has its own set of problems, Congress could
consider changing diversity jurisdiction to exclude certain
classes of diversity cases, e.g. auto accident cases. Transcript
of Hearings, December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session. I do not
necessarily endorse this without further study; the comment was to
suggest an approach for further consideration by Congress.

                 Please refer also to my answers to Senator Heflin's
written questions on this point.

                  5. Last August, in a panel discussion at the Ninth
Circuit Judicial Conference in Hawaii you addressed what you
called the "unwritten constitution," which you defined as "our
ethical culture, our shared beliefs, our common vision, and in
this country, the unwritten constitution counsels the morality of
restraint."

                  There have been times, however, when the shared beliefs
or common vision of the majority have resulted in the deprivation
of rights of minorities, such as the belief that whites and blacks
should not have access to the same restaurants or seats in a bus
or public schools, or that Japanese-Americans should be removed to
internment camps.

                  When do you believe it is appropriate for courts to
intervene in opposition to widely shared beliefs?

                  Some of the most significant cases in the history of the
Court are those in which the Court protected minorities from laws
enacted by a majority insensitive to their rights and liberties.
Indeed, those are the instances in which rights and liberties are
most endangered. This is the very protection that the judiciary
exists to provide. The highest duty of a judge is to use the full
extent of his or her power where a minority group or even a single
person is being denied the rights and protections of the
Constitution.

                  The unwritten Constitution I refer to consists of
additional commitments to liberty and freedom, not ideas or
sentiments which undercut it. There are about 160 written
Constitutions throughout the world; but in few of those societies
do any real protections for life or liberty exist. Americans, on
the other hand, have a commitment to the rule of law and to the
idea that we are all bound to respect the rights of others. This
underpinning of our Constitution is a great heritage that ensures
our written Constitution is a living reality, not, in Madison's
phrase, a mere "parchment barrier."

                  6. During that same panel discussion, you stated that
"a principled theory of constitutional interpretation necessarily
requires that there must be some demonstrated historical link
between the rule being advanced in the court and the announced
declarations and language of the framers." You have previously
acknowledged that there are some "spacious" terms in the
Constitution, phrases like "liberty," "equal protection," and "due
process."

                                     743

                 How does the doctrine of original intent relate to these
spacious phrases?

                  In an extended series of exchanges with Senator Specter,
I maintained that specific intent of the framers, that is to say
their actual thought process, is not an adequate basis for
interpreting the Constitution. Transcript of Hearings, December
15, 1987, Morning and Afternoon Sessions.

                  The framers chose their words with great care. Those
words have an objective meaning that we should ascertain from the
perspective of history and our constitutional experience. The
words of the Constitution, their objective meaning, and the
official consequence of their enactment as a constitutional rule,
are the principal guides to constitutional interpretation. This
said, please permit me to underscore my earlier statements that I
do not have a unitary or grand design of constitutional
interpretation.

                  7. Judge Kennedy, I have reviewed a number of your
decisions on voting rights matters. When I was an Illinois state
legislator in the 1960's I observed the dramatic changes in many
of our state legislatures brought on by the U.S. Supreme Court's
decisions applying the "one person, one vote" doctrine. I was
pleased to note, therefore, that one of your opinions extended
that principle to a state agriculture district and reversed a
district court which permitted a voting plan limited to
landowners. (James v. Ball, 613 F.2d 180). However, your
decision in Aranda v. Van Sickle, 600 F.2d 1267 (1979), troubles
me. There, you concurred in a decision which threw out a class
action lawsuit alleging voting discrimination against Mexican-
Americans in San Fernando, California. You examined the record of
only three Hispanics elected to the City Council in sixty-five
years, almost no Hispanics appointed to municipal posts, low voter
registration levels, and, for those Hispanics who did go to the
polls or observed the proceedings there, evidence of harassment
and discriminatory placement of voting machines in white homes.
You affirmed the district court's opinion ascribing the lack of
Hispanic participation in politics and municipal jobs to apathy,
low education and high unemployment, not discrimination. I am
disappointed by this. Can you share with me your reasons for not
letting these plaintiffs go to trial? Also, on the issue of
standing generally, in what cases have you ruled in favor of civil
rights plaintiffs?

                  I discussed at length my concurring decision in the case
of Aranda v. Van Sickle, 600 F.2d 1267 (9th Cir. 1979), cert,
denied, 446 U.S. 951 (1980), in response to questions by Senators
Kennedy, Metzenbaum, and Specter. Transcript of Hearings,
December 15, 1987, Morning and Afternoon Sessions. I respectfully
 refer you to those remarks as a detailed answer to your first
                                      744

question. In essence, my separate opinion in that case indicates
that the relief sought exceeded the actual injury alleged. As I
understood the law and precedents then existing, the framework of
the suit established by the plaintiffs justified the grant of
summary judgment against the plaintiffs on the pleadings before
us. Legislative enactments since that decision might change the
result.

                  For me the case was, and remains, a close and troubling
one. The point of the concurrence was to disassociate myself from
the reasoning of the district court and my colleagues. My concern
with the language and reasoning of both the district court and the
majority opinion in the court of appeals prompted me to write the
separate concurrence to underscore that there was evidence of
discrimination that these other judges overlooked. I said:

                  To conclude that the plaintiffs' evidence
                  could not justify striking down the at-large
                  election system does not, in my view,
                  necessarily mean that plaintiffs may not be
                  entitled to some relief. For example,
                  plaintiffs' statistics regarding placement of
                  polling places in private homes, few of which
                  are Spanish-surnamed or located in the barrio,
                  might be sufficient to withstand a summary
                  judgment motion in a lawsuit seeking to have
                  some of the city's polling places located in
                  the Mexican-American community. Similarly,
                  although a minority group does not have a
                  constitutional right to proportional
                  appointments on municipal commissions, the
                  plaintiffs' showing in this case regarding
                  Mexican-American representation of city
                  commissions might, after further examination,
                  justify a remedial requirement of increased
                  consideration and/or appointment of Mexican-
                  Americans to such bodies.

600 F.2d 1279. The concurrence argues that the injuries alleged
by the plaintiffs would be sufficient for a trial on the merits if
appropriate relief had been sought.

                  You further ask, "on the issue of standing generally, in
what cases have [I] ruled in favor of civil rights plaintiffs."
While not a traditional civil rights case, in Chadha v. INS, 634
F.2d 408 (9th Cir. 1980), aff'd, 462 U.S. 919 (1981), I wrote a
majority opinion holding that an alien facing deportation
proceedings had standing to challenge the underlying statutory
scheme. Also, in Graham v. Deukmejian, 713 F.2d 518 (9th Cir.
1983), I joined in a majority opinion recognizing standing for
Jehovah's Witnesses who challenged actions by the State of
California. It was alleged that the state was interfering with
physicians who acceded to the plaintiffs' religious preferences in
performing certain medical operations.

                 8. In Gladstone Realtors v. Be11wood, 441 O.S. 91
(1979)r Justice Powell in a case from a different circuit cited
nine federal circuit decisions which differed from your decision
in TOPIC v. Circle Realty, 532 F.2d 1273 (1976). Justice Powell
pointed out that "[m]ost federal courts that have considered the
issue agree that section 810 and 812 provide parallel remedies to
precisely the same prospective plaintiffs. . . the notable
exception is the Ninth Circuit TOPIC v. Circle Realty." (citation
omitted): Gladstone at 108. Justice Powell concluded, "[T]he
Court of Appeals in this case correctly declined to follow TOPIC. 
Standing under section 812, like that under section 810, is 'as
broad as is permitted by Article III of the Constitution.'" Id.
at 109.

                  I know that Senator Kennedy discussed this case with you
yesterday and I do not wish to belabor it. However, I was left a
little dissatisfied with your answer. I want a Supreme Court
Justice who leads on civil rights and does not arrive at the
correct position years later. At this point, I am confident that
you are a forward-looking individual. However, in this case you
chose to interpret the Fair Housing Act narrowly. Don't you
believe that it is important that civil rights statutes be read to
encompass rights rather than dispense with them without a hearing
on the merits of a claim?

                  It remains a fundamental precept of the judicial process
that jurisdictional and procedural requirements must be satisfied
before courts are empowered to adjudicate disputes, and this
principle is, of course, applicable to civil rights cases.

                  In TOPIC v. Circle Realty, 532 F.2d 1273 (9th Cir.),
cert, denied, 429 U.S. 859 (1976), the first question addressed
was whether, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs could assert a
violation of a statutory right. The Act contained two different
sections with jurisdictional grants. The case turned on a
jurisdictional section that had not yet been interpreted. The
opinion I wrote for a unanimous panel held that the claims under
this section could not be addressed in court without first being
submitted to the agency that Congress had created for enforcement
of the Act. As shown by our experience with voting rights, agency
action is sometimes more effective than court action as a remedy
for system-wide deprivations of rights. The TOPIC opinion
interpreted the statutory provision as requiring plaintiffs to
apply first to the administrative agency for relief. The opinion
did not, therefore, hold that the plaintiffs could not secure
 judicial relief at any point.

                  Three years later the Supreme Court interpreted the
statute differently. Incidentally, Justice Powell found there
were district court decisions on point, not circuit court
opinions. As I told the Committee, I respect the Court's decision

                                                        -7-

without reservation. Transcript of Hearings, December 15, 1987,
Afternoon Session.

                  I am in full agreement that civil rights statutes should
be read in a fair and common sense way to encompass each and every
one of the concerns to which they are addressed. I agree with the
premise implicit in your question that the civil rights statutes
should not be interpreted in a grudging, timorous, or unrealistic
way to defeat congressional intent or to delay remedies necessary
to afford full protection of the law to persons deprived of their
rights.

                  9. One of the most critical factors in my evaluation of
a Supreme Court nominee is that individual's sensitivity to
women's rights. Over my lifetime I have seen much needed progress
made in this area. Much of the progress is due to the willingness
of the Supreme Court Justices to move this country in the right
direction. For example, in 1971 the Court in the landmark
decision of Reed v. Reed held that because women have been the
subject of unreasonable prejudices, laws affecting such groups
must be given very careful scrutiny. Courts in evaluating laws
which treat women differently than men must determine not if there
is a rational basis for this difference, but rather if the
difference is substantially related to an important government
interest. I question whether Judge Bork was sensitive enough to
the need for heightened scrutiny in this area. In reviewing your
record I am pleased to see that you have correctly described the
test that should be applied in sex discrimination cases. However,
I am a concerned about your application of the test. Therefore, I
would like to know what is your view of the appropriate test for
deciding sex discrimination cases under the 14th Amendment, and
can you cite any example of cases in which you have applied it
appropriately?

                  The law in this area is in a state of evolution and
flux, but the Court's general trend is a plausible and a rational
way to implement the Equal Protection Clause. It will require
more cases to ascertain whether or not the heightened scrutiny
standard is sufficient to protect the rights of women. I have not
specifically addressed this question in any case that has come
before me as a circuit judge.

                  10. If we are to eliminate sex discrimination we must
get away from commonly held beliefs about the "proper" role of
women in society. Only when we evaluate people as individuals,
rather than as members of groups, will women achieve equality. I
have noticed in your decisions an apparent willingness to look to
custom and tradition in deciding sex discrimination cases. For
example, in 1982 in Gerdom v. Continental Airlines you disagreed
with the majority's decision that weight requirement for female
flight attendants was discriminatory on its face. Instead you

                                                       -8-
                                     747

supported the argument that customer preferences for attractive
women was reasonable. It concerns me that you would consider
these customer preferences, which smack of prejudice, to be an
appropriate criteria. Could you comment upon the role you feel
custom and tradition should play in reviewing sex discrimination
cases?

                  In Gerdom v. Continental Airlines, 692 F.2d 602 (9th
Cir. 1982), cert, dismissed, 460 U.S. 1074 (1983), I joined in a
dissent from an en bane decision finding the airline liable for
discrimination on the basis of sex because the airline's policy
required flight hostesses to comply with strict weight
requirements as a condition of employment. The majority found
that the plaintiffs had made out a cause of action under the
disparate treatment theory. The dissenters maintained that
liability under the disparate treatment theory should not be
imposed automatically. The dissent noted the failure of the
district court to develop a record regarding the airline's
contention that the regulation affected different classes of women
and that women were not being treated differently from men. The
dissent wanted the facts established to better answer the very
concerns which underlie your questions. The dissenters did not
suggest, and I would not have subscribed to a suggestion, that
custom and tradition could form the basis for legitimate
employment criteria if those criteria were used as a pretext to
discriminate on the basis of sex.

                  11. In one of your decisions, you write that
"indifference to personal liberty is but the precursor of the
state's hostility to it" (U.S. v. Penn, 647 F.2d at 899). I agree
with that statement. It was made in a case where the personal
liberty at stake was the traditional parent-child relationship and
you felt strongly that it should be protected. Serious concerns
have been raised, however, about your decisions concerning liberty
and equality in other areas -- particularly in cases where women
seek to protect their rights to pursue jobs and equal pay beyond
the traditional parent-child relationship. Do you believe that
 indifference to personal liberty is but the precursor of the
state's hostility to it when it comes to equal rights for women?
How do your decisions and opinions show that?

                   I agree that indifference to the rights of women to
obtain employment and to receive equal pay for equal work is
 unacceptable, and, more generally, that active hostility can
 follow indifference in cases involving women's rights, just as
with other liberties.

                   In my testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on
 December 14, 1987, I stated that "We simply do not have any real
 freedom if we have discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or
 national origin, and I share that commitment." Transcript of
                                     748

Hearings, December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session. I also stated in
my testimony that the Equal Protection Clause applies to all
persons: "the amendment by its terms, of course, includes
persons, and I think was very deliberately drafted in that
respect." Transcript of Hearings, December 14, 1987, Afternoon
Session. I stated in my responses to the Senate Judiciary
Committee questionnaire that "[c]ompassion, warmth, sensitivity,
and an unyielding insistence on justice are the attributes of
every good judge." Questionnaire at 54.

                  While I have been involved in only a limited number of
cases concerning the rights of women, I have written or joined
various opinions ruling in favor of claims brought by women. For
instance, in Lynn v. Western Gillette, Inc., 564 F.2d 1282 (9th
Cir. 1977), I wrote an opinion that adopted a broad and generous
interpretation of the time period for claimants to bring suit in
sex discrimination cases. Also, in Morrill v. United States, 821
F.2d 1426 {9th Cir. 1987) (per curiam), I joined an opinion
permitting a rape victim to bring an action for damages against
the federal government under the Federal Tort Claims Act for its
negligent supervision of the rapist, a military enlisted man.

                  12. I believe a Supreme Court Justice must demonstrate
a sensitivity to individual rights and liberties. Indeed what
distinguishes this country from others is our commitment to
individual freedom. The individual rights recognized by the
Supreme Court are extremely important to the progress of our
nation. In choosing a new Supreme Court Justice I am looking for
someone who would not jeopardize the precision gains that have
been made, and who would further the development of these
Constitutional rights. Thus, I was pleased to see that in two of
your Fourth Amendment opinions upholding the exclusion of
evidence, O.S. v. Penn, 647 F.2d 876 and D.S. v. Cameron, 538 F.2d
254 you have relied heavily, and with considerable conviction on
the importance of the privacy interests invaded -- focusing in
Penn on the sanctity of the parent-child relationship and in
Cameron on the intrusiveness of that rectal search.

                  What relationship, if any is there between your
protectiveness of these rights in the context of the Fourth
Amendment and your views regarding a generalized right of privacy
in non-criminal areas?

                  As your question indicates, the Fourth Amendment
protects certain privacy interests of individuals. And, as I have
indicated in my testimony to the Committee, I believe that the
liberty protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments includes
protection for the value that we call privacy. Transcript of
Hearings, December 15, 1987, Morning Session. Both the holdings
and the reasoning of the Fourth Amendment cases you cite can be
instructive in determining the rights of individuals in the civil
context. The Supreme Court's jurisprudence on the right to

                                                      -10-
                                      749

privacy may be still in the early stage of evolution, and I have
no fixed view or overriding theory about the full scope of the
right to privacy. Transcript of Hearings/ December 15, 1987,
Morning Session. I can assure you that I will interpret and apply
the Constitution in accordance with the general judicial approach
that I have described to the Committee, regardless of whether a
given constitutional claim arises under the Fourth, Fifth, or
Fourteenth Amendments.

                  13. I am a member of the Subcommittee on Immigration
and Refugee Affairs and I have found that policy area to be among
the most challenging ones in the Senate. I have examined your
decisions and speeches concerning immigration. If you are
confirmed by the Senate, you will bring to the Supreme Court more
experience in this area than the other Justices did. In the
Apollo Tire case you enforced an NLRB decision granting labor law
protections to undocumented immigrant workers and wrote that doing
otherwise "would leave helpless the very persons who most need
protection from exploitative employer practices." NLRB v. Apollo
Co., Inc., 604 F.2d 1187 (1979). The Supreme Court accepted this
expansive protection five years later in Sure-Tan v. NLRB, 467
U.S. 883 (1984). However, in a 1984 Rotary Club speech you seemed
to question the expansion of asylum claims when you said, "Asylum
formerly was thought of as the right of a sovereign state to
protect the alien, but now is viewed as a personal right of the
alien to protect his or her own life and property." Finally,
before the Barristers Club of Sacramento in 1985 you stated, "If
we do not announce supportable, workable, and doctrinally
consistent principles in the area of immigration law, our court
could be the subject for harsh and legitimate criticism."

                  Please explain for me what doctrinal principles you
would favor and of what type and from what sectors criticism would
result if your approach were not adopted.

                  As I have testified, I have not developed a
comprehensive theory of law or a system of principles to be
applied to every case that I have to decide. Transcript of
Hearings, December 15, 1987, Morning Session. Likewise, I have no
set doctrine to be applied to immigration cases.

                  Immigration cases are difficult. The individual alien
before the court has often done nothing more than what all of our
ancestors did: travelled to this land in search of a better life.
As with any case, a judge must examine with care the facts of the
 case, the text and history of the applicable laws, and any
applicable precedent.

                  The myriad factual permutations of immigration cases
make it difficult to formulate consistent doctrinal rules.
 Consistent rules are required, however, if the courts are to apply
 the law in a fair and evenhanded way. They are also necessary if

                                                      -11-
                                     750

we are to give adequate guidance to the district courts and
agencies. In my remarks to the Barristers Club in 1985, I was
stressing the necessity for the many panels of the Ninth Circuit
to develop cohesive doctrinal rules for immigration matters. If
courts appear to be using unprincipled and inconsistent rules in
any area of law, they will be subject to legitimate criticism from
the various sectors of our society which are interested in their
decisions.

                  The 1984 Rotary Club speech passage you cite was not
intended to suggest that asylum claims should not be recognized or
protected in a generous way. I used the example of the developing
law of asylum as merely one facet of the emerging impact that
human rights principles are having on immigration law.

                  The traditional approach to asylum has been shifted by
recent Congressional enactments. It is apparent that a new
dimension to the right of asylum has been added, one personal to
the persecuted individual. The example was used to show that the
law has changed to recognize political and social persecution to
which we once were somewhat oblivious and to extend protection to
persons who suffer from such persecution. The passage was offered
in an historical context, not a critical one.

                  14. Judge Kennedy, I note in your written response to
the Committee questionnaire that as a judge you have made 35
appointments of clerks to serve in your court. Of those, five
were women and one was a minority, an Asian American. I know that
the law schools in California where you sit probably have the
highest percentage of minority law students in the country. I am
not a lawyer but my wife and daughter are so I know that appellate
court clerkships are usually a prerequisite for Supreme Court
clerkships and often lead new law students to the track of
academic positions and eventually judgeships of their own. I
would like for you to discuss your hiring procedures, where you
look for clerkships candidates, and any particular reason why you
have never had a Hispanic or a Black law school graduate as one of
your clerks?

                  At the outset, to the extent the question expresses a
view that women and members of minority races should be
represented in full strength in all spheres of the legal
profession, I endorse the view without reservation. I am pleased
that my female clerks, no less than my male clerks, have gone on
to distinguish themselves as lawyers in government service,
academia, and private practice. In one recent year, two of my
three law clerks were women. As stated in my answers to questions
at these hearings, arbitrary barriers that prevent women and
racial minorities from achieving their full potential, in the
legal profession or in any other occupation, have no place in
today's society. Transcript of Hearings, December 15, 1987,
Afternoon Session.

                                                      -12-
                                     751

                  I do not look for clerks, or encourage applications,
from any particular area of the country, or from any particular
law school. Two of my clerks have been nationals of a foreign
country. Every year, we receive somewhere between 100 and 200
applications for clerkships, from all over the country, and from a
great number of law schools. My law clerks go through the
applications initially to identify the candidates with superior
academic records and recommendations. We offer interviews either
by me or by a former clerk who lives in the applicant's area of
the country, or both. We impose no ideological test and no
barriers based on race, religion, sex, or ethnic background.

                  It is important to encourage more minority persons to
attend law school, to enter the legal profession, and to begin
their career as clerks. I welcome the opportunity to hire black
and Hispanic clerks, as well as women, and will continue my
attempts to do so while I remain a member of the federal
judiciary.

                  15. Throughout my years of public service, America has
become increasingly aware and concerned about the problems facing
seniors. Issues like health care and mandatory retirement will
become even more important during your years on the bench. I was
certainly pleased to see your sensitivity to rights of the elderly
in Simpson v. Providence Washington Insurance Group. As a
legislator, I know that we in Congress have a tough job ahead to
ensure that seniors are protected. What role do you think the
Judiciary can play in advancing these same interests?

                  Our society as a whole is becoming more sensitive to the
problems of the elderly, and the members of the judiciary should
share in this growing awareness. The increasing number of elderly
persons in our society will present new problems and legal
categories should evolve to address them. I will be vigilant to
enforce congressional statutes for the elderly and to ensure that
the rights and claims of the elderly have full recognition in our
decisional law.

                  16. In your October 1987 speech to the Sacramento
Rotary Club you warn that we "will lose our freedom if we do not
remain committed to the constitutional process, to ensure its
adaption to the various crises of human affairs."

                  If you are confirmed as a member of the Supreme Court,
you will no doubt be asked to address such crises and to protect
our civil liberties. In those cases, it may be necessary for you
 to take an unpopular position and go against public opinion as
well as the government.

                                                      -13-
                                    752

                 As an example we can look to the 1942 decision of the
Court on the internment of Japanese Americans. Although I was
only a boy at that time, I remember that my father was one of the
few people who publicly expressed his opposition to the
internment. Even the Court gave in to the prevailing public
hysteria and failed to protect the rights of these American
citizens.

                  If you are in a situation where your interpretation of
the Constitution demands that you make a very unpopular decision,
is your personal constitution of such a nature that you can make
such a decision and disregard public opinion? Are you willing to
go all the way to preserve our freedom?

                  Some of the proudest moments in the history of the
Supreme Court have occurred when the Court has stood firm against
the tide of public opinion to safeguard the endangered rights of
individuals and minorities. Many of the greatest Justices are
known for their dissents from decisions in which the Court
declined to protect minority or individual rights. These
Justices' examples are an inspiration to the judiciary.

                  If confirmed, my duty as an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court would be to apply the law irrespective of public
opinion. It would be a breach of my oath and of my duties as a
judge to consider the extent to which my ultimate decision would
be popular or unpopular. I am confident that I will follow the
constitution even if doing so is an ultimate test of personal
courage and integrity.

                  17. You have held membership in several private clubs
with discriminatory membership policies. You belonged to the
Olympic Club, which had a "white male only" policy when you
joined, from 1962 until the day you were asked by the Justice
Department to come to Washington to discuss your nomination. You
belonged to the Del Paso Country Club, which has no black and few
women members, from 1963 until just a few weeks ago. And you
belonged to the Sutter Club, which excludes women and has few
minority members, from 1963 until 1980.

                  You said, in answer to Senator Kennedy, that you did not
resign earlier in part because you have become more sensitive over
the years, and that you are still continuing to educate yourself.
I commend you for that, and for your candor in expressing it.

                  However, I am concerned because the matter of membership
in discriminatory private clubs is not just a question of personal
morality when you are a federal judge. The ABA Code of Judicial
Conduct states that it is "inappropriate" for a judge to hold such
membership. I understand that you were a member of the ABA
committee that recommended this.

                                                      -14-
                                    753

                 Why did you not resign when the ABA adopted this policy?
Do you believe intent to harm is required before discrimination is
invidious? If so, why?

                  First, let me correct one statement in the question. I
have been a member of the Advisory Committee on Codes of Conduct,
Judicial Conference of the United States, from 1979 to the
present. But I have not been a member of the ABA Committee that
recommended the provision in the ABA Code of Judicial Conduct to
which the question refers.

                  The commentary to the ABA Code of Judicial Conduct was
amended in 1984 to discuss membership in organizations that
practice invidious discrimination. In part, that amendment stated
that it was "inappropriate for a judge to hold membership in any
organization that practices invidious discrimination on the basis
of race, sex, religion or national origin. . . . Whether an
organization practices invidious discrimination is often a complex
question to which judges should be sensitive."

                  I became a member of the Sutter Club on December 10,
1963, and resigned from membership on about September 31, 1980.
To the best of my knowledge, during the period of my membership
the Sutter Club had members of some racial minority groups, but
not women members. I believe that the Sutter Club precluded women
largely as a matter of practice. While the bylaws did not
explicitly prohibit female membership, one reference to "men"
implied that membership was restricted. I understand that the
bylaws have been amended recently to substitute "person" for
"men." In 1980, after advising the club of my concerns about its
practices, I resigned. I believed that the members there knew me
as a judge, and in view of the club's membership policy/ I
believed it would create an inappropriate appearance for me to
continue to belong to this club. My resignation preceded the ABA
Committee's amendment to the Judicial Code by several years.

                  I became a junior member of the Del Paso Country Club in
1958 and a full member in 1963. I tendered my resignation on
October 22, 1987. To the best of my knowledge, during the period
of my membership the club had some women members and members of
some racial minority groups.

                  I became a member of the Olympic Club in 1962 and
tendered my resignation on October 27, 1987. To the best of my
knowledge, this club had members from some racial minorities, but
no women full members, during the period of my membership.

                  Last summer, after reading an article in the New Yorker
magazine, which talked about the egalitarian history of the
Olympic Club, I wrote a letter to the club that expressed my
concerns about the club's restrictions on female membership and
 the continuing perception of restrictive practices concerning
minority members. I urged the club to make the egalitarian spirit

                                                      -15-
                                     754

a reality. Both orally and in writing, I urged the club to amend
its bylaws to permit women members and to encourage applications
from women and racial minorities. The membership, however, voted
against the board of director's proposal to amend the club's
bylaws to promote those objectives. I was not a voting member and
could not vote.

                  After the vote, I expressed in writing my intention to
resign, and requested a meeting with the board of directors and
the president to encourage the board to continue on its attempted
course of changing membership policy. Because of events
surrounding my nomination, I was unable to meet promptly with the
board, and thereafter tendered my formal resignation. In view of
my own and the board of director's continuing efforts to reform
the Olympic Club from within and our prospects of success in those
efforts, I do not believe that my resignation from this club was
belated.

                  As I understood the language of the ABA amendment,
"invidious discrimination" suggests an exclusion of particular
persons based on sex, race, religion, or national origin that is
intended to impose a stigma on such persons. As far as I am
aware, none of the policies or practices were the result of ill-
will. However, there is no question but that a hurt and an injury
can be done, even if unintentionally.

                  Finally, as your question notes, I have testified before
the Senate Judiciary Committee as to my growing recognition that
discrimination comes from several sources -- sometimes from active
hostility, but sometimes too from insensitivity or indifference.

have tried to continue to educate myself over the years to the
existence of subtle barriers to the advancement of women and
minorities in our society. As I affirmed in answer to Senator
Kennedy, I want to see a society in which women and minorities
have equal opportunities to join a club where they can meet other
persons in their community. Transcript of Hearings, December 14,

                       ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR LEVIN

                 1. Before the President announced his intention to
nominate you, did any member of the White House staff or the
Justice Department ask you any questions relating to, or did you
comment on your views relative to, the following: abortion,
affirmative action, capital punishment, school prayer, independent
counsel, the standing of Congress to bring suit against the
Executive Branch, separation of church and state, and the rights
of defendants in criminal cases? If so, please describe to the
best of your recollection the content of all such questions, and
your comments, including an indication of who was present.

                 As I testified to the Committee on the Judiciary,
Transcript of Hearings, December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session, no
member of the White House staff or the Justice Department asked me
any questions which directly or indirectly solicited my views on
the subjects listed in your inquiry or on any other subject that
might come before the Supreme Court for consideration. Further, I
have not commented on, offered, or volunteered those views to any
member of the White House staff, the Justice Department, or any
other part of the administration.

                  2. Please set forth, in as much detail as you remember,
specifically what you said to Senator Helms about your personal
views, opinions, feelings, etc., relative to abortion.

                  As I testified to the Committee on the Judiciary,
Transcript of Hearings, December 14, 1987, Afternoon Session, I
did not say anything to Senator Helms concerning my personal
views, opinions, or feelings about abortion or any other subject
that might come before the Supreme Court for consideration. In
all my discussions with members of the Senate, including my
meeting with Senator Helms, I have taken the position that my
religion may be of some relevance as to character and temperament,
but that my religious beliefs, or any views on the subject of
abortion, are a private matter that I will not consult in making a
judicial decision. I also told Senator Helms that I obviously was
aware of the depth of feeling that he has on this subject, but
further indicated that as a judge I maintain a fair and open mind
on the issue, so that I can resolve any particular case
consistently with the law and the Constitution. Our pluralistic
society allows us to admire persons with views and opinions based
on a moral code, but such views are not, and should not, be an
indication how a judge will rule when interpreting the law in any
particular case.

                  3. In the Senate Judiciary Committee's questionnaire,
you responded to several questions concerning your membership in
business clubs, social clubs, or fraternal organizations. One of
these questions asked for your opinion as to whether any of the
clubs or organizations you have belonged to practices invidious
discrimination and other forms of discrimination. In the
questionnaire, you defined the term "invidious discrimination" by
explaining that it "suggests that the exclusion of particular
individuals on the basis of their sex, race, religion or national
origin is intended to impose a stigma on such persons." (p. 50,
emphasis added). In a response to Senator Kennedy, you further
explained that "discrimination comes from several sources.
Sometimes it's active hostility, and some sometimes it's just
insensitivity and indifference." (transcript, December 14, 1987,
p. 137).

                 Can you give some real life examples of when
discrimination against women and blacks would not be invidious?
In your opinion, was the discrimination against women and blacks
by the Olympic Club, during your membership, invidious?

                  I undertook in my response to the Judiciary Committee's
Questionnaire, at page 50, to define the phrase "invidious
discrimination'^ because the question to which I was responding
specifically referred to the 1984 amendments to the ABA Code of
Judicial Conduct which use that phrase. However, I did not say or
imply that such legalistic interpretations provide an appropriate
basis for individuals or organizations to justify their conduct.
I believe that discrimination against women, blacks, or other
minorities imposes real injury and is wrong whether it arises from
intentional, active bias or from indifference and insensitivity.
While I believe that the membership practices of the Olympic Club
were not invidious in the sense intended by the ABA Code because
they were not animated by ill-will, I disagreed with those
practices, and when my efforts to change them were unavailing, I
resigned.

                  Please refer also to my answers to Senator Simon's
written questions on this point.

Frank Drozak                        In a number of areas of critical concern to working
                           people, Judge Kennedy's record on the United States Court

                            his record is only somewhat reassuring in other areas.

                                   If our position were based solely on our review of
                           Judge Kennedy's judicial record, we would therefore oppose
                           his confirmation. We come out the other way because of
                           considerations regarding the legitimate roles of the
                           President and the Senate in the selection of Supreme Court
                           Justices, the public perception of the Court and its role
                           in our national life, and the tumultuous history of the
                           President's efforts to fill the current vacancy on the
                           Court. It is out of regard for these considerations that
                           we support confirmation.

         1. At the outset, we wish to reaffirm our conviction that
it is entirely proper for the Senate, as the broadly representa-
tive body that it is, to evaluate and consider the judicial
philosophy of a Supreme Court nominee and to assure itself that
the confirmation of the nominee, taking all relevant factors
into account, will serve the good of the country. A judge's
social, political, and legal values are proper concerns for the
Senate, and the Senate may legitimately demand that its own
social, political and legal values are to a significant degree
reflected in any nomination.

         Chief Justice Rehnquist was correct when, almost 30 years
ago, he wrote: "what could [be] more important to the Senate
than [a nominee's] view on equal protection and due process."!/
Arid, as Professor Charles Black has added,

                   "In a world that knows that man's social
                   philosophy shapes his judicial behavior,
                   that philosophy is a factor in his fitness.
                   If it is a philosophy the Senator thinks
                   will make a judge whose service on the
                   Bench will hurt the country, then the
                   Senator can do right only be treating this
                   judgment of his, unencumbered by deference
                   to the President's, as a satisfactory
                   basis in itself for a negative vote."2/

        The AFL-CIO has repeatedly endorsed the Senate's preroga-
tives and responsibilities in this regard; in the recent
national debate generated by the nomination of Judge Robert H.
Bork, the public also has unambiguously added its endorsement.

        2. We hasten to add that we are not saying that it would
be appropriate for the Senate to refuse to confirm each and
every nominee who does not share, in all particulars, the
social, political and legal beliefs of a majority of the
Senators. Nor would it be responsible for the AFL-CIO (or for
any other group) to urge rejection of a nominee simply because
that nominee is not within the class of individuals who we would
choose had we the right to choose.

        The selection of a Supreme Court Justice is a unique civic
event that engages the two representative branches of government
in the constituting of the third branch. That being so, it is
of the essence that both the President and the Senate seek in
good faith to reach agreement and that neither the President
nor the Senate treat the make-up of the Court as simply one
more incident in their on-going political and institutional
struggles.

        The Supreme Court's standing rests on the extent to which
the public, in all its diversity, broadly accepts the Court's
process of decision as an expression of the ideal embodied in
the concept we signify by the term the "law." Although a
judge's social and political vision will inevitably play some
role in legal analysis, the concept of deciding according to
"law" is, of course, infinitely more complex than deciding
simply according to the judge's individual predilections,
prejudices or social or political philosophy.

        Given the basic values stated in the Constitution, the
Senate must assure itself that those who reach the Court begin
from the understanding that individual rights be broadly
recognized and vigorously protected. But more is necessary to
preserve public trust: the process as a whole must reassure
that the Court is an institution dedicated to reasoned legal
deliberation. This requires that the selection process not
degenerate into one in which a particular political party or
faction simply seeks to prevail over all others as a means of
appointing Justices who will decide according to the prevailing
group's agenda.

         The Supreme Court's status as an institution to be cele-
brated and respected in our public life thus requires that both
the President and the Senate -- each of which are representa-
tives of the public -- treat the appointment process as an
aspect of statecraft, calling for an effort to reach consensus.

         3. We believe that to some degree the nomination of Judge
Kennedy represents an effort by the Administration to take such
a conciliatory approach; albeit an effort taken only after the
highly divisive controversies sparked by its first two nomina-
tions for this vacancy. We believe, too, that the likely costs
to the nation of another divisive confirmation battle over this
nomination outweigh our concerns -- as deeply felt as those
are -- regarding the consequences of the Senate confirmation.
In reaching this conclusion we have given three factors great
weight.
                              760

The Honorable Joseph Biden

        This nomination -- unlike the two prior nominations -- does
not reflect an Administration effort to effectuate a sudden and
major shift in the direction of the Court. We objected to the
nomination of Judge Bork because it was plain on the record that
this Administration, in making that nomination, was intent on
undermining fundamentally just legal developments supported by
the overwhelming majority of the nation. We do not wish to
minimize either the possible influence that Judge Kennedy may
have on the Court or the degree to which we will likely disap-
prove of some of his positions. But, unlike the President's
first nominee, Judge Kennedy does not espouse a substantive
agenda that begins from the proposition that many of the well
accepted developments in such areas as equal protection, due
process, and the guarantee of free speech are fundamentally
illegitimate.

        Judge Kennedy -- again in contrast to Judge Bork -- shows
no sign of being attracted to eccentric and rigid theories of
jurisprudence that would freeze the meaning of the Constitution
by referring only to a simplified view of original intent. It
has long been accepted that judges in interpreting the Consti-
tution should, among other sources, look to our historical
experiences and our broadly held social values. It is this way
that practical meaning and modern application are given to the
Constitution's expansive civil rights and civil liberties
guarantees. Judge Kennedy -- whatever his other limitations --
appears to approach his responsibilities through this grand
tradition of constitutional interpretation.

         Finally, Judge Kennedy's opinions generally decide only
those issues necessary to the resolution of the specific cases
before him; he is not given to using his judicial office to run
the society rather than to decide concrete cases and contro-
versies. It is our hope that this reflects that sense of pro-
portion which is essential to the proper exercise of judicial
power as well as that sense of human fallibility which is
essential to the maintenance of the spirit of tolerant respect
for diversity and for individual liberty.

        For all these reasons we view Judge Kennedy's nomination
as a step away from the partisan extremism reflected in this
Administration's earlier nominations, and a step towards con-
sensus based on a decent respect for a wide range of opinion.

        4. Notwithstanding our ultimate conclusion on the nomina-
tion of Judge Kennedy we would be less than frank -- and less
than faithful to our obligations -- if we did not lay out for
                              761

The Honorable Joseph Biden
January 22, 1987
Page 5

the public record the basis for the misgivings we have voiced.
This is neither the time nor place to recite chapter and verse.
It suffices to say that our reading of the cases indicate that,
whether consciously or not. Judge Kennedy has failed to separate
his own political and social biases from his legal analysis in
certain areas, and that the result has been a substantial number
of seemingly result-oriented decisions. Judge Kennedy's treat-
ment of the rights that workers and their unions have secured
through their social and political struggles is illustrative.

        In our examination of Judge Kennedy's labor law cases, we
found that in virtually every case where significant and unset-
tled issues were presented. Judge Kennedy sided with management.
His decisions in favor of unions and/or workers have been
confined to settled issues that could generate no major contro-
versies. We do not contend that he uniformly supported inde-
fensible positions or that he never supported unions or workers
regardless of the law. But the pattern we found nevertheless
reflects a double standard based on a far more open and forth-
coming attitude toward the interests and concerns of management
than toward those of working people. In effect, he has shown a
strong presumption that, on any open issue, the law favors
management and opposes workers and their unions.

        Our assessment of this aspect of Judge Kennedy's record
does not rest simply on our own subjective assessment of his
positions. For example, a statistical examination of his voting
record (which we are attaching) reflects that over his 12 year
career he has voted to deny enforcement to fully one-third of
all NLRB orders challenged by managements, while he has never
voted to deny enforcement to an NLRB order that was adverse to a
labor union. It is this "inexorable aero," Teamsters v. United
States. 431 U.S. 324, 342 *.23 (1977), rather than any subtlety
of statistical analysis, that creates an unavoidable inference
of decision-making infected by anti-union bias. This conclusion
is further buttressed by the fact that on three separate occa-
sions Judge Kennedy has adopted a legal position adverse to
unions and/or workers regarding a controversial and important
legal question, and the Supreme Court, in unanimous or near-
unanimous decisions, has then rejected that position and ruled
in favor of the union/worker contentions.3/

3/ In Financial Institution Employees v. NLRB. 750 F.2d 757,
758 (9th Cir. 1985), Judge Kennedy argued in a dissent from his
court's denial of e_n bane rehearing that the NLRB properly held

                                                    (footnote continued)

        This pattern is especially disturbing in an area like labor
law, where the issues are generated by congressional enactments.
When interpreting statutes, a judge properly acts only to
effectuate the values of the legislature, and not his own. The
AFL-CIO accepts the primacy of the legislature in making social
policy and does not place its faith in judges who cannot sepa-
rate their own biases -- one way or the other -- from their
analyses of legislative will.

        5. We end as we began: our concerns about Judge Kennedy
do not rise to the level that, given all the relevant factors,
cause us to call for his rejection. With all of his faults,
this nominee is far superior to those who were previously put
forward by this Administration to fill the current Supreme Court
vacancy. When all is said and done there is reason for guarded

(Footnote 3/ continued)

that labor unions could not freely merge with each other without
placing their representation rights in question. On review, the
Supreme Court unanimously rejected this new and controversial
NLRB. See NLRB v. Financial Institution Employees. 106 S.Ct.
1007 (1986).

        In Pacific Northwest Chapter v. NLRB. 609 F.2d 1341 (9th
Cir. 1979), Judge Kennedy joined an opinion deciding that the
NLRB was insufficiently restrictive of union rights in the
construction industry. His pro-management position was first
rejected by the e_n bane Ninth Circuit, 654 F.2d 1301, and then
by a unanimous Supreme Court. See Woelke & Romero Framing.
Inc. v. NLRB. 456 U.S. 646 (1982).

        In Kaiser Engineers v. NLRB. 538 F.2d 1379 (9th Cir. 1976),
Judge Kennedy dissented from an opinion approving of a long-
standing NLRB position that workers could not legally be dis-
charged for acting collectively to obtain workers protection
measures from government. The Supreme Court upheld the NLRB --
and rejected Judge Kennedy's position -- by a 7-2 vote. Eastex
v. MLRB. 437 U.S. 556 (1978).

        While in Financial Institution Employees. Judge Kennedy
argued that the NLRB was entitled to extreme deference in its
legal holdings, in Pacific Northwest and Kaiser Engineers --
where he called for reversal of pro-union NLRB decisions -- he
wholly ignored the issue of deference.

optimism that Judge Kennedy has the qualities of heart and mind
to respond to the responsibilities we place on the Supreme Court
in the same manner as have others who have become Justices: by
showing a heightened sensitivity to the legitimate diversity of
interests that characterize our polity and our law. That being
so, a continuing stalemate between the President and Senate
would be more destructive of the public's confidence in the
system stated in the Constitution for filling Supreme Court
vacancies -- and possibly of confidence in the Court itself --
than it would be productive of a Supreme Court better fitted to

-- This chart includes 12 cases where the court was confronted with both employer and
union challenges to the NLRB decision and order and where the court's decision accepted
some claims made by the employer and some by the union. These "divided" cases are
characterized in the chart according to which side prevailed in the majority of issues, or,
if there was not a clear majority of issues on one side, according to which side prevailed
on the issue of liability (as distinct from remedy). If all cases in which there are such
"divided" results are removed from consideration, there is no change in the relative
results:

                       opinion)

       The only case which might possibly be classified as support for a union challenge to
an NLRB order is one of these "divided" cases, Press Democrat Publishing Co. v. NLRB,
629 F.2d 1320 (9th Cir. 1980). Most of the issues presented were challenges to the NLRB's
order by the employer, all of which were rejected; but on one issue of remedy there was a
union challenge, which the panel remanded back to the NLRB for further explanation.

                         STATEMENT OF THE ALLIANCE FOR JUSTICE'S
                                  JUDICIAL SELECTION PROJECT

         This testimony is submitted on behalf of the Alliance for
Justice and its Judicial Selection Project on the nomination of
Anthony Kennedy to the United States Supreme Court. The Alliance
for Justice is a national association of public interest
organizations which addresses issues of common concern to the
public interest community, such as access to the courts for
those who assert violations of constitutional and federal
rights.

         The Alliance's Judicial Selection Project was organized in
1985 by a group of law professors and civil rights, public
interest and labor organizations. The Project monitors the
appointment and confirmation of candidates for the federal
judiciary and encourages the racially diverse selection of men
and women who are open-minded, fair and committed to equal
justice. The Project believes that maintaining a strong,
independent judiciary is essential to our democratic system.

         The Judiciary Committee hearings on the nomination of Judge
Bork served as an historic demonstration of the Senate's
constitutional role as full partner with the President in the
confirmation of Supreme Court candidates. The Committee's
extensive review of Judge Bork's record and its rigorous
questioning on his views on the Constitution set a standard for
Senate consideration of all future nominees to the Court. In
rejecting the nomination, the Senate showed that it must be
assured that a Supreme Court nominee will respect the role of the
                                      773

courts in protecting individual rights and liberties.
        Accordingly, the Senate must now examine Judge Kennedy's

record and inquire into his understanding of the
Constitution. After a careful review cf Judge Kennedy's
appellate opinions as well as speeches he has made over a period
of several years, the Alliance is troubled by Judge Kennedy's
lack of demonstrated commitment to equal access to the courts and
equal justice.

         Over the last thirty years, courts have gradually reduced
the barriers that have prevented the poor and other
underrepresented individuals from gaining access to the federal
courts. There is widespread recognition of the principle that
where constitutional rights have been or may have been violated,
those who can show specific even if small individual injury will
have their day in court.

         Several decisions by Judge Kennedy indicate that he takes
a narrow and mechanical view of citizens' ability to seek
redress for grievances in the courts. He has demonstrated a
tendency to read the law governing access to the courts in such a
narrow way as to deny underrepresented persons full protection of
the law.

         For instance, in TOPIC v. Circle Realty, 532 F.2d 1273 (9th
Cir. 1976), Judge Kennedy, writing for the court, refused to
uphold a district court's grant of standing to a fair housing
organization which had challenged the racial steering practices
of realtors under the Fair Housing Act. He ruled that the Act
conferred standing only on individuals who are the "primary
                                     774

victims" of discrimination. He wrote:
         "The injuries [the organization's] members may have
         suffered from living in segregated communities were caused
        by no specific single act of the defendants, but by a
         prolonged practice spanning many years. An injunction, if
         granted, would stop the practice of racial steering by the
         defendants, but the desired result of establishing an
         integrated community would not be achieved immediately.... In
         sharp contrast is the denial of access to one seeking to
         rent or purchase housing, where inability to obtain an
         immediate judicial remedy may constitute a serious
         hardship." 532 F.2d at 1276.

         At the time, Judge Kennedy's ruling conflicted with nine
other federal court decisions holding that persons other than
specific victims had standing to challenge discriminatory housing
practices. Indeed, in a 7-2 decision written by Justice Powell
three years later, Gladstone Realtors v. Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91
(1979), the Supreme Court expressly rejected Judge Kennedy's
reasoning.

         In another civil rights lawsuit, Pavlak v. Church, 681 F.2d
617 (1982) , Judge Kennedy wrote for a divided panel that the
statute of limitations for a putative class member was not tolled
between the filing of the complaint and the order refusing to
certify the class. This decision was vacated by the Supreme
Court, 103 S. Ct. 3529 (1983) in light of its decisions in Crown,
Cork and Seal v. Parker, 103 S.Ct. 2392 (1983) and Chardon v.
Soto, 103 S.Ct. 2611 (1983).

         Other examples reveal his hypertechnical interpretation
of statutes of limitations. One particularly disturbing case is
Allen v. Veterans Administration, 749 F.2d 1386 (9th Cir. 1984),
where the plaintiff filed a Federal Tort Claims Act action within
                                     775

the six months permitted by law, but named and served the
Veterans Administration, not the United States, as defendant.
Formal service was made on the U.S. Attorney two months later,
although he had already received the papers from the agency.
Judge Kennedy upheld the district court's dismissal of the
complaint on the grounds of failure to name the United States and
refused leave to amend Under Rule 15 because the U.S. Attorney
was not served before the statute ran out. Judge Kennedy said
that the fact that the action was filed and the V.A. was served
within the allowable time was irrelevant.

         His decision in Allen was troubling since the substitution
of an agency for the United States is common and he relied on a
minor pleading error to dismiss the plaintiff's case. He
also used an unduly technical analysis to dismiss the employment
discrimination case, Kouky v. Department of the Navy, 820 F.2d
300 (9th Cir. 1987). The plaintiff mistakenly named the agency,
not the agency director, as provided by statute. Judge Kennedy
disregarded the fact that the agency director was served six days
 later (after the time expired).

          In a similar vein, Judge Kennedy has interpreted the
 substantive law of race and sex discrimination in a narrow
 fashion. A common theme running through his cases is the
 requirement of proof of discriminatory intent. This has led him
 to reject many important claims of discrimination.

         For instance, in Spangler v. Pasadena Board of Education,
 611 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1979), Judge Kennedy wrote a lengthy
 opinion concurring in the termination of district court
                                    776

jurisdiction of the Pasadena school desegregation plan. The
district court had denied the school board's motion to relinquish
jurisdiction, finding that school board members, who had been
cited thirteen times for noncompliance with the court order, had
criticized the desegregation plan and intended to return to
neighborhood school assignments that existed prior to
implementation of the plan, thus restoring the previously
existing pattern of segregation.

        Judge Kennedy refused to accept the district court
findings and in so doing violated the longstanding rule that
requires deference to the findings of fact by the district court.
Despite the overwhelming weight of evidence, he argued that
substantial noncompliance had not been shown and wrote that "the
evidence does not support the conclusion that the school board
harbors an intent to establish, or return to, a dual system."
^d. at 1244.

          Judge Kennedy's opinion demonstrates a lack of sensitivity
to the continuing battle to ensure equal educational opportunity.
His opinion was followed in the recent Norfolk School case,
Riddick v. School Board of Norfolk, 784 F.2d 521, 537-38 (4th
Cir. 1986), in which the Fourth Circuit allowed the Norfolk
School Board to eliminate busing and resegregate its elementary
schools, resulting in ten formerly desegregated schools becoming
95 percent or more black and six becoming 70 percent or more
white.

         In Aranda v. Van Sickle, 600 F.2d 1267 (9th Cir. 1979),
Judge Kennedy upheld an at-large city council election in an
                                     777

opinion which ignored factual evidence indicating substantial
dilution of minority votes. His opinion could have precluded all
future constitutional challenges to at-large elections in the
Ninth Circuit were it not for an amendment to the Voting Rights
Act in 1982. In Aranda, Hispanic plaintiffs had challenged San
Fernando's at-large elections, in place for over sixty years.
While the population of the city was 50 percent Hispanic, with 29
percent of the registered voters Hispanic, only three Hispanics
had ever been elected to the City Council. The plaintiffs also
presented evidence that Hispanic pollsters were routinely
harassed and that polling places were seldom located in Hispanic
homes. The district court granted summary judgment to the
defendants, thus denying the plaintiffs a trial on the merits.
The Ninth Circuit affirmed, largely adopting the district court's
opinion.

         In a concurring opinion, Judge Kennedy first failed to
address the legal principles applicable to summary judgment
motions, and thus violated the settled rule that in reviewing
motions for summary judgment, all inferences must be viewed in
the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. Judge
Kennedy also required that the plaintiffs prove that
discriminatory intent was the basis for the at-large system. He
then refused to conclude that the facts could support an
inference of discriminatory intent although the Supreme Court
three years later in Rogers v. Lodge, 485 U.S. 613 (1982), held
that facts similar to those alleged in Aranda supported an
inference that discriminatory intent was behind the at-large
                                     778

system.
         In responding to criticism of his Aranda ruling during

testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commitee, Judge Kennedy
stated that he failed to consider facts suggesting relief other
than vacation of the at-large election because the plaintiffs had
asked only for elimination of the election. However, as Antonia
Hernandez noted in her testimony before the Committee, Judge
Kennedy's summary judgment dismissal precluded the plaintiffs
from returning to court to establish liability which could
provide the basis for a remedy within the discretion of the
Court.

         In American Federation of State, County, and Municipal
Employees v. State of Washington, 770 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir. 1985),
Judge Kennedy reversed the district court ruling that 15,000
Washington state employees established a Title VII sex
discrimination claim based on the "comparable worth" theory. The
district court's findings that female state employees were the
victims of pervasive wage discrimination were based on
state-commissioned studies that identified a 20 percent wage
disparity between male-dominated and female-dominated jobs of
equal skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions.

         In a lengthy opinion, Judge Kennedy overruled the careful
and detailed fact-finding by the district court, concluding that
intentional wage discrimination could not be inferred from
Washington's continued use of market wages to establish salary
levels. Judge Kennedy's presumption that the State's
compensation system and its resulting salary inequities reflected
                                      779

"prevailing market rates" was also improper since the trial court
made no finding as to the impact of the free market on the
compensation system. He also summarily rejected liability based
on a disparate impact theory. He ruled that Washington's
compensation system could not be subjected to a disparate impact
analysis since it did not constitute a clearly defined employment
practice. This interpretation was repudiated in Antonio v. Wards
Cover Packing Co., 43 FEP Cases 130 (9th Cir. 1987).

         In addition, Judge Kennedy's record does not reflect
sensitivity to the civil rights of the handicapped. In Mountain
View-Los Altos Union High School District, 709 F.2d 27 (1983),
Judge Kennedy narrowly interpreted the Education for All
Handicapped Children Act. He held that parents who transferred
their disabled child to a private school were not entitled to
receive reimbursement for tuition expenses, even if the parents'
decision was subsequently upheld through the administrative
process and the courts. The Supreme Court, in an opinion by
Justice Rehnquist, unanimously held that the parents were
entitled to reimbursement in School Committee of Town of
Burlington v. Department of Education, 471 U.S. 359 (1985).

         Judge Kennedy's memberships in clubs which have had
either express discriminatory practices or that have few minority
or women members raise additional concerns about his
msensitivity to the interests of minorities and women. The
commentary to the American Bar Association's Judicial Code of
Conduct states "[i]t is inappropriate for a judge to hold
membership in any organization that invidiously discriminates on
                                   780

the basis of race, sex or religion." In his responses to the
Senate Judiciary Committee Questionnaire, he stated that
invidious discrimination exists when the exclusion is "intended
to impose a stigma upon such persons." And, in testimony before
the Judiciary Committee, he explained that he believed that none
of the exclusionary policies were the result of ill will. This
narrow interpretation of "invidious discrimination" suggests that
Judge Kennedy may review discrimination claims in an overly
technical manner.

         While Judge Kennedy's record on civil rights and
discrimination issues is not reassuring, his testimony and
opinions demonstrate that in such areas as the First Amendment
and criminal law he is not guided by a formula or sweeping
judicial philosophy. He does not appear to have an agenda to
reverse landmark Supreme Court cases in these or other areas of
the law. Judge Kennedy also demonstrated a respect for deciding
cases based on a proper understanding of precedent.

         Judge Kennedy told t&e Sen*te Judiciary Committee that
"(o]ver the years, I have tried to become more sensitive to the
existence of subtle barriers to the advancement of wooen and
ainorities. This [is] an issue on which I [am] continuing to
educate myself." The Alliance hopes that Judge Kennedy will
continue to grow more sensitive to the rights of the powerless in
our society and the role the courts must continue to play in
vindicating those rights.

                                        JUDGE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY

       We have prepared a report on the judicial philosophy and
c i v i l l i b e r t i e s record of Anthony M. Kennedy, Judge on the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who has been nominated
for the position of Associate Justice of the United States
Supreme Court. This report reviews Judge Kennedy's 400 authored
opinions while on the bench,-1/ as well as h i s unpublished
speeches and testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in
connection with the nomination.2/ The report focuses on Judge
Kennedy's record in the following c i v i l l i b e r t i e s areas:
privacy, discrimination and i t s remedies, voting r i g h t s , rights
of a l i e n s , separation of powers, freedom of speech, freedom of
r e l i g i o n , criminal law and procedure, access t o the courts and
due process.

      <!/ The report focuses on opinions that Judge Kennedy wrote (whether for
the majority, concurring or in dissent), in order to distill Judge Kennedy's
judicial philosophy from his own words.

      2 / This report does not disoiss written testimony recently submitted to
the Ocmrdttee by Judge Kennedy.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

   Judge Kennedy has been on the bench for a dozen years and

has p a r t i c i p a t e d i n more than 1200 d e c i s i o n s . He d o e s "not have

an over-arching theory, a unitary theory of interpretation. "2/

Nevertheless, in a February 1984 speech, Kennedy observed:

   My own j u d i c i a l philosophy has been described
   by others as conservative, and therefore
   unlikely to accept doctrines which
   substantially expand the role of the courts.
,  None of us l i k e s a simple label t o explain
   our thought, but the description i s probably
   apt as a general rule.4/

He has a l s o stated that "as t o some fundamental constitutional

questions i t i s best not t o i n s i s t on d e f i n i t i v e answers. "-5/

   On the court of appeals, Judge Kennedy's record shows both a

cautious application of precedent and considerable appreciation

for constitutional values. As a matter of s t y l e , h i s opinions

are refined, subtle and narrowly t a i l o r e d t o the f a c t s at hand.

When he j o i n s the majority, Judge Kennedy often adds a few

"remarks" of h i s own in a brief concurrence. He has authored

quite a number of dissenting opinions, and not infrequently

d i s s e n t s from the f u l l court's denial of rehearing en bane.

        Judge Kennedy has written sparingly on key civil liberties
issues such as freedom of speech, church-state relations, and
discrimination and its remedies. In the area of privacy, Judge
Kennedy has never had occasion to address issues affecting
reproductive freedom.

        Certain aspects of the nominee's judicial record are
troubling. In particular, Judge Kennedy's decisions in the area
of discrimination and its remedies raise serious concerns. He
has very frequently rejected claims of discrimination based on
sex or race. He has dismantled a desegregation decree in the
face of resegregation. He has barred civil rights litigants from
the federal courts on narrow and technical grounds. His notion
of invidious discrimination reveals an insensitivity to the
pervasive nature of systemic discrimination.

         In contrast, Judge Kennedy's decisions in the First
Amendment area are positive. His free speech opinions fit
comfortably within current Supreme Court doctrine. Here, as in
other areas of the law, Judge Kennedy is not prone to ideological
digressions. Several opinions are quite strong in their
recognition of core First Amendment values, particularly in the
area of prior restraints.

        Although he has not been receptive to claims of vote
dilution on behalf of minorities, in other contexts Judge Kennedy
has vigorously enforced the principle of one-person, one-vote.
In the criminal law area, Judge Kennedy's decisions show
sensitivity to the needs of law enforcement. They nevertheless

                                                   - iii -
                                    786

reflect a fair application of precedent. Even in the face of
strong evidence of guilt, Kennedy has been willing to reverse
criminal convictions where there is evidence of police misconduct
or where the jury was not properly instructed on the law. On the
other hand, Judge Kennedy has extended the "good faith" exception
to the exclusionary rule and has narrowly construed the Fifth
Amendment's protection against self-incrimination and double
jeopardy.

        Judge Kennedy's unpublished speeches and hearing testimony
also provide insight to his views on civil liberties and the
function of the Supreme Court. Above all, Judge Kennedy places
great trust in the structure of government, which includes
separation of powers and the independence of the states, to
protect individual rights.^/ Indeed, after reviewing Judge
Kennedy's unpublished speeches and hearing testimony, it is fair
to conclude that in considering the various mechanisms for
protecting rights, the nominee has a relatively diminished view
of the importance of the substantive legal limits in the Bill of
Rights, and a relatively enhanced view of the importance of
structural protections, including state sovereignty. How he will
resolve the tension between local government power and the Bill
of Rights in particular instances is therefore cause for concern.

        Within the s t r u c t u r a l allocation of powers, Judge Kennedy
s t r e s s e s the importance of an independent judiciary. "[O]nce the
independence of the judiciary i s undermined," he s t a t e s , " i t can
never be restored."2/ He urges, however, t h a t the federal
judiciary exercise a "morality of r e s t r a i n t " -- informed by the
intent of the Framers -- when reviewing the actions of the
political branches:S/

                  [A] principled theory of constitutional
                 interpretation necessarily requires that
                 there must be some demonstrated h i s t o r i c a l
                 link between the rule being advanced in the
                 court and the announced declarations and
                 language of the framers.

                 I t seems to me t h a t the doctrine of original
                 intent i s responsive t o some of the concerns
                 I have mentioned although I think original
                 intent i s best conceived of as an objective
                 rather than a methodology.2/

Ninth Circuit, Ehoenix, AZ (Aug. 1978), at 25.

Review of Separation of Powers: What is the Sole of the Courts in Constitu-

       2/ jd. at 4-5. See also A. Kennedy, Unpublished Speech, Ios Angeles
Patent Lawyers Assoc., Los Angeles, CA (Feb. 1982), at 8. At his confirmation
hearings, Judge Kennedy was questioned repeatedly about original intent. In
response to these questions, he elaborated somewhat on the sort of intent he
views as relevant to constitutional interpretation:

                    [A]ny theory which is predicated on the intent of the
            framers, [with] reference to what they actually thought about,
            is just not helpful.

                   Then you can go one step further on the progression and
            ask, well, should we decide the problem as if the framers had
            thought about it?

                                                                                              (continued...)

                                     788

        Moreover, he identifies "an unwritten constitution in every

state" that ought to serve as "an additional brake," "an

additional restraint" on judicial power:

                 It's not a source of authority to interpret.
                 And the unwritten constitution consists of
                 our ethical culture, our shared beliefs, our
                 common vision, and in this country/ the
                 unwritten constitution counsels the morality
                 of restraint, and it applies to each branch
                 of the government.

                 And it teaches that any branch of the govern-
                 ment which attempts to exercise its powers to
                 the full, literal extent of the language of
                 the Constitution is both indecorous and
                 destabilizing to the constitutional order.i^/

In Kennedy's view, lack of restraint injures the judiciary

itself. "The issue of judicial independence and its legitimacy

is a necessary part of the equation when one debates the

legitimacy of a source or method of constitutional

       2/ (...continued)

                   But that does not seem to be very helpful either.

                   What I do [think] is that we can follow the intention of
            the framers in a different sense. They did do something.
            They made certain public acts. They wrote. They used
            particular words.

                 And they wanted those words to be followed.

Hearing Testimony, Dec. 14, 1987, at 220; see also Dec. 15, 1987, at 9-10.
According to Kennedy, "original intent, broadly conceived, ... is present in
far more cases than we give it credit for." Hearing Testimony, Dec. 14,
1987, at 224. Thus, in "very many cases," Kennedy finds that "the ideas, the
values, the principles, the rules set forth by the framers, are a guide to the
decision." JS. at 224-25.

interpretation. If we overreach, i t is fair to call our commis-

sions into question."11/

        Judge Kennedy's dual emphasis on structural limits and

judicial r e s t r a i n t affects his view of unenumerated r i g h t s . In a

1986 speech on t h i s subject, Kennedy stated:

                 In discussions of unenumerated rights, there
                 seems to be an undercurrent that judicial
                 power to declare them i s a necessary antidote
                 to the potential excesses of a democratic
                 majority. That formulation tends to d i s t r a c t
                 us from the fact that there are other pro-
                 tections in the American system

                       At the outset, the Framers conceived the
                 Constitution primarily as a system for the
                 structural allocation of powers. . . . [T]he
                 Bill of Rights, including the Ninth Amend-
                 ment, and the amendments after the Civil
                 War, spacious as are some of t h e i r phrases,
                 were not intended to relieve the p o l i t i c a l
                 branches from t h e i r responsibility to deter-
                 mine the a t t r i b u t e s of a j u s t society.1^/

Judicial articulation of unenumerated rights could, in his view,

                 the p o l i t i c a l branches of the government
                  [to] misperceive t h e i r own constitutional
                 role, or neglect to exercise i t . If the
                 judiciary by i t s own i n i t i a t i v e or by s i l e n t
                 complicity with the political branches

rights: the right of travel, the right of privacy, and the right to vote. His
comments on privacy focus primarily on the Supreme Court's decision in Bowers
v. Kardwick. 106 S.Ct. 2841 (1986). He did note that "the results in Pierce
and Meyer, if not their broad statements, are sustainable under the First
Amendment." Unenumerated Rights Speech at 16.

                    constitutional imperatives in the course of
                    the legislative process.-13/

          Kennedy's emphasis on judicial restraint does not, however,

preclude the overruling of precedent. Noting that "stare decisis

is not an automatic mechanism," Kennedy outlined at the hearings

the factors that he would consider in deciding whether to

overrule a particular case:

                    What does the most recent decision ... say?
                    What is its logic? What is its reasoning?
                    What has been its acceptance by the lower
                    courts? Has the rule proven to be workable?
                    Does the rule fit with what the judge deems
                    to be the purpose of the Constitution as we
                    have understood it over the last 200 years?
                    And history is tremendously important in this
                    regard-14/

federalism to protect individual liberty,-IS/ In October 1987,

        !/ Several of the nominee's most recent speeches -- delivered in
October 1987 -- set forth his views on federalism. Judge Kennedy considers
federalism one of the four structural elements of the Constitution, along with
separation of powers, checks and balances, and judicial review. Our system of
dual state and federal sovereignty, Kennedy maintains, was "the unique and
most daring contribution made by the framers to the science of government."

the structural elements in the Constitution, federalism is the only one that
has undergone the transformation, [and] the only one whose future is
problematic and endangered." A. Kennedy, Unpublished Speech, "Federalism:

                 The states, and their subdivisions, with more
                 visible and approachable legislators, and
                 often with an initiative and referendum
                 process, are likely to be more responsive to
                 the citizens than the federal government.i^/

He underscores the importance of protecting state sovereignty

against federal encroachment:A2/
                  [T]he principal protection for the states is
                 that the national government is one of
                 limited powers. ... The principal structural
                 mechanism to enforce the rule that the
                 national government is one of limited
                 authority is judicial review. Federalism
                 concerns underlie most constitutional cases.
                 Suppose, for instance, the issue is whether
                 or not a Miranda warning must be given to a
                 criminal. At bottom lies the issue whether
                 or not the federal courts, as an arm of the
                  federal government, can impose an obligation
                 on the states.iS/

Implicit in this view is a possible diminution of the Supreme
Court's special role as protector of individual liberty.

CIVIL LIBERTIES RECORD
        What follows is a subject-by-subject analysis of decisions

authored by Judge Kennedy during his tenure on the Ninth
Circuit. Where relevant, we have also incorporated portions of
his unpublished speeches and hearing testimony.

         PRIVACY
       At t h e h e a r i n g s , Judge Kennedy s t a t e d t h a t he has no "fixed
view" on "privacy, or abortion."A/ This view i s c o n s i s t e n t with

h i s speeches, however, suggests t h a t Judge Kennedy i s l i k e l y t o
be cautious in his a r t i c u l a t i o n of unenumerated r i g h t s such as
privacy:

            In Beller v. Middendorf. 632 F.2d 788 (1980), cert, denied. 452 U.S.

905 (1981), Kennedy side-stepped the question whether Navy regulations
mandating discharge of anyone engaged in homosexual activities infringed on a
protected right of privacy. Kennedy's opinion concedes "arguendo" that "some
kinds of government regulation of private consensual homosexual behavior may
face substantial constitutional challenge." Id. at 810. Judge Norris, in his
dissent from the court's rejection of the suggestion for rehearing en bane,
criticizes the opinion for failing to resolve the privacy issue. See Miller
v. Rumsfeld. 647 F.2d 80 (1981).

             In Auiero v. CEft Todco. Inc.. 756 F.2d 1374 (1985), Kennedy affirmed
dismissal of a claim that imposition of a mandatory meal payment on elderly
residents of a federally-funded housing project violated a substantive right
of privacy.

                 constitutional dynamics, and i t defies the
                 presidential [sic] method to announce in a
                 categorical way that there can be no
                 unenumerated r i g h t s , but I submit i t i s
                 imprudent as well to say t h a t there are
                 broadly defined categories of unenumerated
                 r i g h t s , and to say so apart from the factual
                 premises of decided cases. This follows from
                 the dictates of judicial r e s t r a i n t . 3 /

        According to Kennedy, judicial r e s t r a i n t does not permit

extensive use of the Ninth Amendment or other constitutional

provisions to protect individual rights not mentioned in the

Constitution; he maintains that creation of such rights i s

primarily the responsibility of the l e g i s l a t u r e . 4 / similarly, he

stated with respect to the Due Process Clause: "One can

conclude that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should

exist in any j u s t society. I t does not follow that each of those

essential rights i s one t h a t we as judges can enforce under the

        3/ Unenumerated Rights Speech, supra, at 4-5. Kennedy made a similar
point in a 1984 speech:

            To recognize the necessity of continued interpretation does
            not give us a license to interpret the document for
            utilitarian ends. The Constitution cannot be thrown about as
            a panacea for every social i l l . . . . The Constitution cannot be
            divorced from its logic and its language, the intention of
            its framers, the precedents of the law, and the shared tradi-
            tions and historic values of our people.

        At t h e hearings, Kennedy reaffirmed t h i s d i s t i n c t i o n

between r i g h t s e s s e n t i a l t o a j u s t society and unenumerated

r i g h t s t h a t judges can enforce.^/ He never s t a t e d t h a t the

Constitution protects a general right to privacy. Rather than

recognizing a r i g h t t o privacy, Kennedy would allow only t h a t the

guarantee of l i b e r t y in the Due Process Clause p r o t e c t s c e r t a i n

values, including a "value" of privacy:2/

                 SENATOR HUMPHREY: Are you saying t h a t these
                 privacy cases would be b e t t e r dealth with
                 under the Liberty Clause?

                 JUDGE KENNEDY: That i s why I have indicated

that he would consider the following factors to determine which activities are
protected by the Constitution:

                    the essentiality of the right to human dignity, the

                                                                                              (continued...)

                                  795

When asked if Griswold v. Connecticut^/ -- which recognized a

married couple's right^ to purchase contraceptives -- was properly

decided, Kennedy would not commit himself to the correctness of

either "its reasoning or its result."10/ when pressed on this

point, Judge Kennedy did agree that the Constitution protects a

marital right to privacy.il/

          Kennedy continued to express doubt as to whether the Ninth

Amendment could be used as a source of unenumerated rights:

                     [T]he Ninth Amendment was in [a] sense a
                    recognition of state sovereignty and a
                    recognition of state independence and a
                    recognition of the role of the states in
                    defining human rights. That is why it is
                    something of an irony to say that the Ninth

         S/ (...continued)
                       injury to the person, the harm to the person, the
                       anguish to the person, the inability of the person
                       to manifest his or her own personality, the in-
                       ability of a person not to obtain his or her own
                       self-fulfillment, the inability of a person not to
                       reach his or her* own potential.

                       On the other hand, the rights of the state are very
                       strong indeed. There is the deference that the
                       court owes to the democratic process, the deference
                       that the court owes to the legislative process, the
                       respect that must be given to the role of the legis-
                       lature, which itself is an interpreter of the Con-
                       stitution, the respect that must be given to the
                       legislature because it knows the values of the
                       people.

                 Amendment can actually be used by a Federal
                 Court to tell the state that it cannot do
                 something. But the incorporation doctrine
                 may lead to that conclusion, and that is the
                 tension. 12/
Judge Kennedy suggested that the Supreme Court has treated the
Ninth Amendment as "something of a reserve clause, to be held in
the event that; the phrase 'liberty' and the other spacious
phrases in the Constitution appear to be inadequate for the
Court's decision."12/ He declined, however, to endorse this
approach. To the contrary, Judge Kennedy stated:
                  [I]c is the ultimate irony that an amendment
                 that was designed to assuage the States is
                 being used by a federal entity to tell the
                 States that they cannot commit certain
                  acts.14/

         DISCRIMINATION AND ITS REMEDIES
         Judge Kennedy's civil rights record is sparse but troubling.
He seems to believe that discrimination, even based on race, is
permissible if the discriminators have no intent to stigmatize.
His narrow definition of invidious discrimination does not
comport with Supreme Court precedent. Nor does it reflect
sensitivity to the pervasive and subtle forms of modern-day
discrimination. Kennedy's requirement of proof of intent has led
him to reject claims of discrimination in several important

cases. Finally, Judge Kennedy's membership in restrictive clubs
raises serious questions as to his basic commitment to equal
justice under law.

          C l u b M*ini>

        The ABA Code of Judicial Conduct states that "[i]t is
inappropriate for a judge to hold membership in any organization
that practices invidiously discriminates on the basis of race,
sex, or religion." During the 1970's and 1980's, Judge Kennedy
belonged to several clubs that limit membership based on race and
gender. He did not resign his membership in the restrictive
Olympic Club until October 27, 1987.1V In defense of his club
membership, Kennedy put forth a troubling construction of
"invidious discrimination." He noted:

                  "Invidious discrimination" suggests that the
                  exclusion of particular individuals on the
                  basis of their sex, race, religion or
                  national origin is intended to impose a
                  stiama on such persons. As far as I am
                  aware, none of these policies or practices
                  were the result of ill-will. I recognize
                  nonetheless that real harm can result from
                  membership exclusion regardless of its
                  purported justification.!/

         At the hearings, Judge Kennedy made clear that he believes
discrimination to be invidious only when the discriminators have
an intent to stigmatize. Although Judge Kennedy acknowledged
that "the injury and the hurt and the personal hurt can be there,

 which the nominee has belonged).

regardless of the motive,"12/ he never conceded that the
discriminatory policies of the all-male clubs to which he
belonged were in fact invidious. Moreover, when asked generally
whether race-based classifications could ever be justified, the
nominee limited his response only to invidious discrimination.!^/
He does not seem to recognize that the fact of exclusion imposes
a stigma that is itself a subject of legitimate concern regard-
less of any "ill-will" toward an excluded group.

         Race and Natural Origin
         Judge Kennedy's concern for state's rights rather than civil
rights may be seen in Spanaler v. Pasadena City Bd. of
Education. 611 F.2d 1239 (1979). There, after a remand from the
Supreme Court, the court of appeals reversed a district court's
denial of the school board's motion to relinquish jurisdiction.
The court relied on the board's present compliance with
integration efforts and its official representations that it
would continue to engage in action in support of integration.
Judge Kennedy concurred, writing separately "to give emphasis to
certain aspects of this case." Id. at 1242. He stated:

                  [W]hen a court ordered remedy has accom-
                  plished its purpose, jurisdiction should ,
                  terminate. The relinquishment of jurisdic-
                  tion in a proper case serves to restore to
                  the state and local agencies the legal
                  responsibility for supervising a school sys-
                  tem that is properly theirs, and this too is

                 a necessary consideration in fixing the
                 duration of the court's remedial supervision.
Ibid.
        According to Kennedy, "compliance with the 'Pasadena Plan1
for nine years is sufficient in this case, given the nature and
degree of the initial violation, to cure the effects of previous
improper assignment policies." Id. at 1244. He stated:
                 The Supreme Court has emphasized that when a
                  large percentage of minority students in a
                 neighborhood school results from housing pat-
                 terns for which school authorities are not
                  responsible, the school board may not be
                  charged with unconstitutional discrimination
                  if a racially neutral assignment method is
                  adopted.
Ibid. In fact, Supreme Court precedent establishes that a
federal remedy may be appropriate if the residential segregation
results from governmental action, even if not the action of the
school authorities. See, e.g.. Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg
Board of Education. 402 U.S. 1, 32 (1971). Moreover, Judge
Kennedy refused to accept the district court's finding that, by
announcing its intention to return to the pre-1970 neighborhood
school pattern, the Board acted with the same segregative intent
as it had in 1970 Judge Kennedy instead assumed, without
factual basis, that "[a] policy favoring neighborhood schools in
not synonymous with an intent to violate the constitution." 611
F.2d at 1245.

         Judge Kennedy's willingness to return power to local
authority, despite evidence of resegregation, is consistent with
the notion of federalism expressed in his unpublished speeches.

Both reflect the nominee's deference to state and local

sovereignty and his distrust of federal encroachment on local

control, particularly when assisted by the courts.

        Judge Kennedy displayed greater receptivity to a claim of

discrimination, however, in Flores v. Pierce, 617 F.2d 1386

(1980), cert, denied sub nom. Autry v. Flores. 449 U.S. 875

(1980), where there was a strong showing of invidious intent.

Two Mexican-Americans sued local officials under 1983, claiming

that issuance of a liquor license had been delayed due to

plaintiffs' race or national origin. A jury found that the

officials violated the Constitution and awarded damages. The

court of appeals, per Kennedy, affirmed. He found the "disparate

effect" of the defendants' action so compelling that it "may

approach, if it does not reach, the demonstration of an intent to

discriminate that was made in Yick Wo v. Hopkins." Id. at 1389.

He also found ample evidence of intent to discriminate:

                  It was shown that the defendant city offi-
                 cials deviated from previous procedural pat-
                  terns, that they adopted an ad hoc method of
                 decision making without reference to fixed
                  standards, that their decision was based in
                 part on reports that referred to explicit
                  racial characteristics, and that they used
                  stereotypic references to individuals from
                 which the trier of fact could infer an intent
                 to disguise a racial animus.

Ibid. In Kennedy's view, the subsequent approval of plaintiffs'

license by state authorities did not eliminate the constitutional

injury:

                  If the rigors of the governmental or admin-
                  istrative process are imposed upon certain
                  persons with an intent to burden, hinder, or

                                                             - 9 -

                 punish them by reason of their race or
                 national origin, then this imposition con-
                 stitutes a denial of equal protection, not-
                 withstanding the right of the affected
                 persons to secure the benefits they seek by
                 pursuing further legal procedures.

        Gender

         In AFSCME v. State of Washington. 770 F.2d 1401 (1985),

Judge Kennedy reversed a lower court's finding that the State

discriminated on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII.

Beginning in 1974, the State of Washington undertook job

evaluation studies to determine whether wage disparities existed

among predominantly male and female job categories. For jobs of

comparable worth, the studies found approximately a 20 percent

disparity, to the disadvantage of employees in jobs held mostly

by women. The State enacted legislation which would implement a

compensation scheme based on comparable worth over a ten-year

period. In this suit, AFSCME sought immediate implementation of

a comparable worth system of compensation and back pay for

workers who had been subject to discrimination.

         Judge Kennedy found "nothing in the language of Title VII or

its legislative history to indicate Congress intended to abrogate

fundamental economic principles such as the laws of supply and

demand ...." Id. at 1407. In addition, he noted:

                  The instant case does not involve an employ-
                  ment practice that yields to disparate impact
                  analysis. ... A compensation system that is
                  responsive to supply and demand and other
                  market forces is not the type of specific,
                  clearly delineated employment policy contem-
                  plated by Dothard and Griggs; such a compen-

                                                    - 10 -

                 sation system, the result of a complex of
                 market forces, does not constitute a single
                 practice that suffices to support a claim
                 under a disparate impact theory.

Id. at 1406. Thus, in Kennedy's view, "job evaluation studies

and comparable worth s t a t i s t i c s alone are insufficient to

establish the requisite inference of discriminatory motive
c r i t i c a l to the disparate treatment theory, "i9-/ Id. at 1407.

        The t r i a l judge, however, had made no direct finding that

the S t a t e ' s compensation scheme reflected "market forces." To

the contrary, the t r i a l judge found "no credible evidence . . .

that would support a finding that the S t a t e ' s practices and

procedures were based on any factor other than sex." 578 F.

Supp. 846, 866 (W.D. WA. 1984) (emphasis added). The record

contains considerable evidence that the State did not follow the

"market" in setting wages. Nor does Kennedy recognize that the

market reflects patterns of discrimination and that reliance on

the market i s therefore not a conclusive response to claims of

discrimination. In any event, if Judge Kennedy believed that the

d i s t r i c t court had not given sufficient weight to a "market

defense," the proper course would have been to remand; instead,

       12/ In addition, he found plaintiffs' independent evidence of discrimi-
nation "insufficient to support an inference of the requisite discriminatory
motive." 770 F.2d at 1407. Judge Kennedy did not explain why the district
court's factual conclusion to the contrary was clearly erroneous, as required
under Pullman-Standard v. Swintf 456 U.S. 273, 287-89 (1982), and Anderson v.
Bessemer City. 470 U.S. 564 (1985). Indeed, under the formulation of
Teamsters v. United States. 431 U.S. 324 (1977), plaintiffs clearly introduced
sufficient evidence for a factual finding of intentional classwide disparate
treatment, i.e., statistical evidence plus individual instances of facially
discriminatory actions. Judge Kennedy, however, overturned that finding.

Judge Kennedy ignored the record evidence and simply assumed the

factual b a s i s of a market defense.2/

         Even more troubling i s Judge Kennedy's refusal t o apply

disparate impact analysis t o the facts of the case. To be sure,

certain courts have limited disparate impact analysis only to

cases t h a t challenge a specific employment c r i t e r i a , such as a

written t e s t or height and weight requirement.21/ But since

Grigqs i t has been c l e a r t h a t an employment t e s t t h a t works a

disparate impact on women or minorities suffices t o support a

claim under disparate impact theory.22/ Judge Kennedy, by

c o n t r a s t , gave disparate impact theory the most r e s t r i c t i v e

i n t e r p r e t a t i o n possible, holding i t can be applied only to "a

s p e c i f i c , c l e a r l y delineated employment p r a c t i c e applied a t a

single point in the job selection process." 770 F.2d at 1406.22/

 differentials which sirrply "reflected a job market in which [the employer]
 could pay women less than men for the same work." Corning Glass Works v.

 situation may be understandable as a matter of economics, but i t s differential
 nevertheless became illegal once Congress enacted into law the principle of
 equal pay for equal work." Ibid.

          In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,

Kennedy defended the decision in AFSCME. He continued to

criticize the imposition of liability for what he viewed solely

as a failure to depart from the market:

                    The State of Washington was subject to a
                    judgment of $800 million ... on the theory
                    that their failing to depart from the market
                    system and from the market forces was an
                    actionable violation.

                    We did not think, however, that there was a
                    shred of evidence to show that the state had
                    deliberately maintained that pay scale dif-

         23/ (...continued)
acceptable performance." Id. at 1165. The district held the city liable,
based on its finding that discrimination affected the evaluative process.
However, Kennedy concluded that the district court incorrectly found the
plaintiff was not present at her tennination hearing, and, despite the
apparent lack of relevance between this finding and the imposition of
liability, ordered a remand because "we do not know what weight the trial
judge gave to this incorrect finding." Id. at 1166. Kennedy also remanded
for further findings on the issue of damages. Id. at 1167. See also White v.
Washington Public Power Supply System. 692 F.2d 1286 (1982) (reversing finding
of discrimination of the basis of race and sex because the district court
improperly shifted the burden of proof on the defendant).

                 In Gerdom v. Oontinental Airlines. 692 F.2d 602 (1982) (en bane),
cert, dismissed. 460 U.S. 1074 (1983), Judge Kennedy joined the dissent, which
took a narrow view of disparate impact and discriminatory treatment analysis
under Title VII. At issue in Gerdom was a policy that required employees who
were "flight hostesses" to comply with strict weight requirements as a
condition of their employment, while not imposing similar restrictions on male
 "directors of passenger service." The majority held that the policy
constituted discriminatory treatment on the basis of sex under Title VII, and
thus did not address whether the policy could also be attacked under disparate
impact analysis. While acknowledging that Gerdom established a prima facie
case of disparate treatment, the dissent nonetheless concluded that the case
should be remanded for further evidence, stating that the majority erred in
 "making a factual comparison between flight hostesses and directors of
passenger service ... on a motion for summary judgment." Id. at 614. The
dissent also held that the policy could not be challenged under disparate
 impact analysis. Id. at 611-12.

                 ference in order to discriminate against
                 women.24/
        Notwithstanding Judge Kennedy's lack of receptivity to
statutory claims of gender discrimination, he suggested at the
hearings that he might be willing to consider raising the
standard of review for constitutional claims. Noting that the
judicial system has not had "the historical experience with
gender discrimination cases that we have had with racial
discrimination," Kennedy stated:
                  [T]he law there really seems to me in a state
                 of evolution at this point, and it is going
                 to take more cases for us to ascertain
                 whether or not the heightened scrutiny
                  standard is sufficient to protect the rights
                 of women, or whether or not the strict
                  standard should be adopted.^5-/
         As an appellate judge, however, Judge Kennedy has not
applied heightened scrutiny to Constitutional claims of gender
discrimination. In United States v. Smith. 574 F.2d 988 (1978),
cert, denied. 439 U.S. 852 (1978), male federal prisoners
challenged their conviction for forcible sodomy upon another male
prisoner under the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act. By
incorporating a state law definition of rape, the Act imposed a
higher sentence than federal law, which applied only to male rape
of a female. Judge Kennedy rejected the claim "that the
difference in the penalties for these offenses constitutes

         Sexual Orientation

        Judge Kennedy has consistently refused to protect gay and

lesbian l i t i g a n t s against discrimination. He consistently

applies a rational basis standard. We do not know whether t h i s

approach will carry over to other unpopular minorities not now

protected by heightened scrutiny.

         Beller v. Middendorf. 632 F.2d 788 (1980), c e r t , denied, 452

U.S. 905 (1981), upheld the c o n s t i t u t i o n a l i t y of a Navy

regulation mandating discharge of anyone engaged in homosexual

substantive due process, rather than equal protection, was the

       2$/ Judge Kennedy's justification for the sentencing differential shows
a lack of sensitivity to the act of male rape of a female, as well as a clear
repugnance for acts which, about coercion, are associated with male
homosexuality:

                   The physical abuses against the victim's anatomy
                    committed in this case were acts distinct in kind
                    from the act of rape as proscribed by federal
                    statute and defined by common law. I t is rational
                    to determine that the harm, both physical and
                   mental, suffered by victims of these two crimes are
                    of a different quality in each instance. These
                   distinctions are reflected in traditions and com-
                   munity attitudes that have prevailed for centuries,
                    and penal laws may properly take account of such
                   differences by assigning a separate generic classi-
                    fication to each offense. . . . The equal protection
                    clause is not offended when Congress punishes one
                    offense by assimilation of a state statute but pro-
                   vides its own definition and punishment for a
                    rationally distinguishable offense.

basis for the p l a i n t i f f s 1 constitutional claim. Ke explained

that "[r]ecent decisions indicated that substantive due process

scrutiny of a government regulation involves a case-by-case

balancing" of the competing i n t e r e s t s , rather than the "formal

question, the opinion conceded "arguendo" that "some kinds of

Judge Kennedy then u n c r i t i c a l l y accepted the government's

asserted interest in military discipline, finding that i t

outweighs "whatever heightened solicitude i s appropriate for

private homosexual conduct." Ibid.

        22/ Kennedy noted, however, "important analytical and rhetorical
 similarities" between the two approaches:

                    [W]hen conduct either by virtue of its inadequate
                    foundation in the continuing traditions of our
                    society or for some other reason, such as lack of
                    connection with interests recognized as private and
                    protected, is subject to governmental regulation,
                    then analysis under the substantive due process
                    clause proceeds in much the same way as under the
                    lowest tier of equal protection scrutiny. . . . At
                    the other extreme, where the government seriously
                    intrudes into matters which lie at the core of
                    interests which deserve due process protection, then
                    the compelling state interest test employed in equal
                    protection cases may be used by the Court to
                    describe the appropriate due process analysis. See.
                    e.g.. Roe v. Wade; Griswold v. Connecticut; Skinner
                    v. Oklahoma . . . .

                    The case before us lies somewhere between these two
                    standards.

         In a long footnote, Judge Kennedy criticized decisions in
other courts requiring proof that a particular plaintiff,
terminated on grounds of homosexuality, is unfit for employment.
According to Kennedy, those courts "misunderstood the meaning of
rationality in the Court's due process cases." Id. at 808, n.20.
Judge Kennedy also suggested that dismissal would have been
proper even under equal protection analysis. "Discharge of the
particular plaintiff before us would be rational, under minimal
scrutiny," Judge Kennedy stated, "not because, their particular
cases present the dangers which justify Navy policy, but instead
because the general policy of discharging all homosexuals is
rational." Ibid.

        Judge Norris dissented from the court's rejection of the
suggestion for rehearing en bane. Miller v. Rumsfeld. 647 F.2d
80 (1981). In his view, the Beller panel "seriously misconstrued
the proper methodology of substantive due process analysis," by
rejecting the fundamental rights approach adopted in Griswold v.
Connecticut in favor of a "balancing" approach. Id. at 80-81.
Contrary to Kennedy's reliance on "recent decisions," the
dissent argues that

                  it is not in any sense accurate to suggest
                  that the recent decisions of the Supreme
                  Court compel or even allow this. The
                 problem with the panel's balancing approach--
                 the reason, I suggest, that the Supreme
                  Court has refrained from adopting it--is
                  that it is inherently standardless.

uncritical acceptance of the government's military necessity

justification, noting that, "[cjonsidered with proper detachment
rather than knee-jerk acquiescence, the military necessity
argument is revealed not to be supported by the record in
Beller." Id. at 87.

        Judge Kennedy also wrote the majority decision in Sullivan
v. INS. 772 F.2d 609 (1985), which involved deportation of a
homosexual alien despite claims that extreme hardship would
result if separated from his life partner of 12 years.
Respondent further claimed that as a highly publicized gay
leader, he faced extreme hardship in his country of origin,
known to be hostile to homosexuals. Judge Kennedy, over a
strong dissent, held that the Board of Immigration Appeals did
not abuse its discretion in construing narrowly the extreme
hardship provision. "Deportation rarely occurs," Judge Kennedy
wrote, "without personal distress and emotional hurt."^/ Id. at

         Nor does Judge Kennedy's record display vigorous enforcement

Handicapped Children Act (EAHCA). Relying on the pendency of the
Act's administrative procedures, Kennedy held that parents could
not unilaterally decide to transfer their handicapped child to a
private school and then seek reimbursement from the school
district. He stated:

                 The statute does confer on district courts
                  the power to give all "appropriate relief"
                  ..., but absent legislative history suggest-
                  ing the contrary, such a phrase is usually
                  construed as a mere grant of jurisdiction to
                  enforce and supplement the administrative
                  procedures for identification, evaluation,
                  and placement of the child, and not of
                  authority to award retrospective damages.

         Two years later, in Burlington School Comm. v.

Massachusetts Dept. of Education. 471 U.S. 359 (1985), the
Supreme Court squarely rejected this construction of EAHCA. In a
unanimous opinion by Justice Rehnquist, the Court held that "by
empowering the court to grant 'appropriate' relief Congress
meant to include retroactive reimbursement to parents as an
available remedy in a proper case." Id. at 370. The Court
rejected the characterization of reimbursement as damages, noting
that "reimbursement merely requires the [school district] to
belatedly pay expenses that it should have paid all along." Id.
at 370-371.

         At the hearings, Judge Kennedy invoked federalism in defense
of his decision: "[W]e were being asked in this case to say that
a local school district, an entity of the state, was required to

                                                            - 19 -
                                   811

pay this sum. We thought a question of Federalism was involved,
in that school districts are strapped for every penny."22/

         Economic Regulation
         Judge Kennedy has likewise rejected equal protection
challenges to economic classifications, even where fundamental
rights are alleged to be at stake. In Fisher v. Reiser. 610 F.2d
629 (1979), the Court of Appeals, per Kennedy, upheld Nevada's
worker's compensation statute which denied cost-of-living
increases to out-of-state beneficiaries. Faced with an alleged
burden on the right-to-travel, Judge Kennedy upheld the
classification, refusing to apply strict scrutiny on behalf of
"one who has migrated from the state which denies the benefit in
question." Id. at 633.
         Tsosie v. Califano, 630 F.2d 1328 (1980), rejected an equal
protection challenge to the denial of child's insurance benefits
under the Social Security Act to a child adopted after the death
of the eligible wage earner. Judge Kennedy found nothing
irrational in the statute's test of dependency, which excluded
from coverage an after-adopted child who had actual dependency
upon the wage earner.
         VOTING RIGHTS
         Judge Kennedy's voting rights record is mixed. Where an
electoral scheme has not implicated race or ethnicity, he has
vigorously enforced the principle of one-person, one-vote. By

        22/ Hearing Testimony, Dec. 14, 1987, at 133.

                                                     - 20 -
                                   812

contrast, his record shows a insensitivity to the role of race
and ethnicity in electoral politics and a misunderstanding of
the concept of vote dilution.

        Judge Kennedy's most troubling opinion in this area is
Aranda v. Van Sickle. 600 F.2d 1267 (1979), cert, denied. 446
U.S. 951 (1980), which involved a constitutional challenge on
behalf of Mexican-Americans to an at-large election scheme in the
City of San Fernando. Judge Kennedy, "[a]fter some hesitation,"
id. at 1275, concurred in the majority's affirmance of summary
judgment against the plaintiffs.20/

         The evidence of discrimination in Aranda was strong, and
certainly sufficient to require a trial on the merits. The City
of San Fernando had used an at-large election scheme since its
incorporation in 1911. By the early 1970's, the population had
become half Mexican-American, yet only three Mexican-Americans
had ever been elected to the City's five-member City Council.
Mexican-Americans were a distinct, geographically insular com-
munity; most of the polling places were located in white homes;
few Mexican-Americans were employed as election officials and
few had been appointed to city boards and commissions; political
campaigns were characterized by racial appeals; all ballots and
election materials were available only in English; and the City
had a history of discrimination against Mexican-Americans.

        32/ Vote dilution cases are almost never disposed of on summary judg-
ment; when they are, they have been regularly reversed on appeal. See, e.g.,
Monroe v. City of WOodville. Mississippi. 819 F.2d 507 (5th Cir. 1987).

        The Supreme Court in White v. Reaester. 412 U.S. 755 (1973),
had relied on effect-type evidence, without proof of intent, to
invalidate at-large elections for state legislators.
Nevertheless, Judge Kennedy required plaintiffs to prove "that
the at-large system for electing the mayor and city council
members is maintained because of an invidious intent." 600 F.2d
at 1277.31/

         At the hearings, Kennedy was questioned extensively about
Aranda. Despite the substantial evidence of discrimination, he
maintained that the result in that case was dictated by the
intrusive nature of the remedy sought by the plaintiffs -- a
district election scheme. Kennedy stated:

                  This is one of the most powerful, one of the
                  sweeping, one of the most far-reaching kinds
                  of remedies that the Federal Court can impose
                  on a local system. And in our view, or in my
                  view, as is expressed in the concurrence,
                  that remedy far exceeded the specific wrongs
                  that had been alleged.32/

         In contrast to Aranda, Judge Kennedy actively protected the
principle of one-person, one-vote in James v. Ball. 613 F.2d 180
 (1979), rev'd, 451 U.S. 355 (1981), which involved the constitu-
tionality of an Arizona statute providing that voting in elec-
tions for directors of a water storage and delivery and power
district could be limited to landowners, with votes apportioned

        31/ in 1982, Congress amended  2 of the Voting Rights Act to mate clear
 that electoral practices that have a discriminatory effect are illegal.

according to acreage owned within the district. Judge Kennedy,

for a divided court, struck down the statute, relying on the fact

that the district did not have "a special limited purpose" and

its activities did "not disproportionately affect landowners."

Id. at 184. The Supreme Court reversed, with Justices White,

Brennan, Marshall and Blackmun dissenting.

        McMichael v. County of Napa. 709 F.2d 1268 (1983), involved

a challenge to a countywide referendum adopting a slow-growth

ordinance applying only to the unincorporated area of Napa

County, California. Residents of unaffected incorporated areas

were allowed to vote in the referendum. Plaintiff, a resident of

the unincorporated area, contended that his vote was thereby

unconstitutionally diluted. The majority affirmed dismissal on

standing grounds. Judge Kennedy concurred, but would have

dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim. He stated:

                 Federal courts will enter orders to invali-
                 date state election results where voters have
                  suffered an unconstitutional deprivation of
                 the opportunity to vote even when it is not
                 clear that the outcome would have been
                 affected, but such relief has been reserved
                  for instances of willful or severe violations
                  of established constitutional norms. The
                 present case is not in that category.

        32/ Judge Kennedy did not acknowledge that under certain circumstances,
the voters of one jurisdiction might lack a sufficient legal interest in the
affairs of another jurisdiction to justify their inclusion in an election.
See, e.g.. Locklear v. North Carolina State Board of Elections. 514 F.2d 1152
 (4th Cir. 1975) (allowing city residents who had an independent school system
to vote in county school board elections dilutes the voting strength county
residents in violation of the equal protection clause).

        RIGHTS OF ALIENS
        Judge Kennedy record on the rights of aliens i s also mixed
and i s not easy t o characterize. 3.4/
        Kennedy has limited the procedural recourse available to
aliens in immigration proceedings. For instance, in Reyes v.
INS, 571 F.2d 505 (1978), Judge Kennedy determined that the Court
of Appeals could not review a decision of the Board of
Immigration Appeals ("BIA") to deny a stay of deportation u n t i l
the BIA decided a pending motion to reopen the proceedings.
Kennedy's decision yielded the anomalous result that Reyes was
deported while his motion to reopen was pending, and was denied
an opportunity to meaningfully appeal that deportation. This
comported with Congress1 intention, wrote Kennedy, to "correct
abuses in the process of judicial review of deportation orders"
and prevent "dilatory t a c t i c [ s ] . " Id. at 507.3.5/
         Similarly, in Gutierrez v. INS. 745 F.2d 548 (1984), Judge
Kennedy also narrowly circumscribed the procedural rights
available to the alien. A prior Ninth Circuit decision held that
when the basis upon which the INS seeks deportation i s identical
to a statutory ground for exclusion for which discretionary

        34/ in a February 1984 speech, Kennedy observed that the rights of
 aliens -- particularly claims for asylum -- raise "great difficulties in
making our Constitution mesh neatly with extensive international commitments."
Rotary Club Speech, supra, at 7-8.

        31/ TWO years later, in Sotelo tfondraqon v. Ilchert. 653 F.2d 1254
 (1980), the Ninth Circuit corrected this anomaly by establishing that an alien
 could challenge the BIA's decision to deny such a stay of deportation through
 a writ of habeas in the district court. This possibility was not discussed in
 Kennedy's earlier decision.

                                                            - 24 -
                                  816

relief would be available, the equal protection clause requires
that discretionary relief be accorded in the deportation context
as well. In dicta, Kennedy implicitly rejected the alien's claim
that the equal protection clause required the availability of
discretionary relief for an alien deportable for entry without
inspection because there "[is] no precise parallel among the
explicit grounds for exclusion." Id. at 550.

        Judge Kennedy has also been willing to impose high burdens
of proof on aliens seeking to enter. Dissenting in Urbano de
Maluluan v. INS. 577 F.2d 589 (1978), for example, he disputed
the majority's view that inconvenience to two citizen children
might constitute "hardship" supporting a motion to reopen
deportation proceedings, and suggest that the majority was
improperly swayed by the "sympathetic fact situation[]." Id. at
596. In Oi Lan Lee v. INS. 573 F.2d 592 (1978), Judge Kennedy
upheld the BIA's decision to weigh inconclusive blood test
evidence against the plaintiff's visa application on behalf of
her alleged son, and to discount what Judge Kennedy termed "the
appellant's self-serving affidavits of herself and her daughter"
in support of the application.

         Further, in Ouintanilla-Ticas v. INS. 783 F.2d 955 (1986),
Judge Kennedy rejected the petition of an alien and his family
for political asylum, relying in part on his own views of the
situation in El Salvador. Quintanilla-Ticas had been threatened
in El Salvador because he wore a military uniform. Since he had
resigned from the military, observed Kennedy, "persecution is

                                                    - 25 -
                                  817

less likely." Id. at 957. Moreover, "[e]ven if petitioners
would face some danger in their home town because of Quintanilla-
Ticas1 former military status, deportation to El Salvador does
not require petitioners to return to the area of the country
where they formerly lived." Id. at 957.

         In one notable instance, however, Kennedy was especially
solicitous of aliens' rights. In NLRB v. Apollo Tire Co.. 604
F.2d 1180 (1979), Kennedy concurred in the majority opinion that
employed aliens are covered by the National Labor Relations Act
 (("NLRA"), since "[i]f the NLRA were inapplicable to workers who
are illegal aliens, we would leave helpless the very persons who
most need protection from exploitative employer practices such as
occurred in this case." Id. at 1184.31/

         SEPARATION OF POWERS
         Judge Kennedy's best known decision involved the balance of
powers among the three branches of government. Several of his
speeches also discuss separation of powers, stressing the
benefits of a flexible, case-by-case approach, especially where
Executive power is at stake.
         For example, in a 1980 speech on the constitutional aspects
of the presidency, Kennedy observed:

                  The constitutional system works best if there
                  remain twilight zones of uncertainty and
                  tension between the component parts of the
                  government. The surest protection of

        25/ The Ninth Circuit was only the second court of appeals to consider
 this issue; the Supreme Court later adopted a view similar to that of Judge
 Kennedy in Sure-Tan. Inc. v. NIRB. 467 U.S. 883 (1984).

                                                     - 26 -
                                    818

                 constitutional rule lies not in definitive
                 announcements of power boundaries but in a
                 mutual respect and deference among all the
                 component parts.22/

Kennedy criticized the Supreme Court's resolution of the

Watergate tapes controversy on this ground. He noted that

                  [b]y acting to expedite the hearing and
                 decision, the Supreme Court pretermitted the
                 debate over disclosure that was going on
                 between the political branches, the execu-
                 tive, and the Congress. ... The integrity of
                 the legislature and its authority to preserve
                  its own place in the constitutional system
                 might have been established more decisively
                  if it had solved its own problem with the
                 Executive, without the unasked for help from
                 the courts. -^/

        Kennedy believes, however, that the Constitution supports

expansive Executive power. He states that "[t]he draftsmen of

the Constitution structured the presidency so that its powers and

functions would be drawn as much by history and tradition as by

specific written provisions."22/ Thus, he has suggested that the

Executive can exercise broad authority in matters involving

foreign affairs and national security:

                  [I]n the field of foreign affairs, the
                  President, while he is not viewed as a
                 monarch, does embody the national will in the
                 way that he does not domestically. ... From
                 this concept, great powers flow to the
                  President in foreign affairs. This is

"[T]he Constitution does not work if any one branch of the government insists
on the exercise of its powers to the extreme." Hearing Testimony, Dec. 15,
1987, at 50; see also Dec. 14, 1987, at 215.

By c o n t r a s t , Kennedy believes t h a t "the i n s t i t u t i o n a l s t r u c t u r e
of the l e g i s l a t u r e i s not p a r t i c u l a r l y well suited t o the

         In Chadha v. INS. 634 F.2d 408 (1981), a f f ' d . 462 U.S. 919
(1983), Judge Kennedy r e l i e d primarily on separation of powers
analysis t o i n v a l i d a t e the l e g i s l a t i v e veto provision of the
Immigration and Nationality Act, which allowed one house t o
disapprove suspension of an order of deportation.42/ According

sphere can commit us to a course of conduct that is all but irrevocable,
despite the authority of Congress to issue corrective instructions in
appropriate cases." Id. at 10.

       41/ Id. at 13-14. Judge Kennedy made similar points in his testimony,
although he moderated his criticism of Congress. For example, Kennedy
stated:

[Ypungstown] tells us, or begins to discuss, the critical
question, whether or not the President is simply the agent of
Congress, bound to do i t s bidding in all instances, or whether
or not there i s a core of power that lies at the center of the
presidential office that the Congress cannot take away.

     As I understand current doctrine, and the Youngstown case,
there is that core of power. Hie extent to which i t can be
exercised in defiance of congressional will is a question of
abiding concern, I know, to the Congress and to judges.

       42/ By contrast, Chief Justice Burger's opinion for the Supreme Court
relied exclusively on the constitutional requirements of presentment and
bicameralism. 462 U.S. 919. Judge Kennedy, in an unusual extrajudicial
discussion of the opinion, contrasted his analysis with the "more sweeping
approach" taken by the Supreme Court. A. Kennedy, Hoover Lecture, Stanford
Law School, Palo Alto, CA (May 17, 1984), at 1 [hereinafter, Hoover Lecturel.

to Judge Kennedy, separation of powers serves two purposes: to
prevent "an unnecessary and therefore dangerous concentration of
power^in one branch," 634 F.2d at 422, and "to promote govern-
mental efficiency." Id. at 424. A violation of separation of
powers occurs when there is

                 an assumption by one branch of powers that
                 are central or essential to the operation of
                  a coordinate branch, provided also that the
                  assumption disrupts the coordinate branch in
                 the performance of its duties and is un-
                 necessary to implement a legitimate policy
                  of the Government.

Ibid.

        Applying this analysis to the one-house veto provision,

Kennedy concluded that it violated separation of powers. If

viewed as a corrective device, Congress was performing "a role

ordinarily a judicial or an internal administrative responsi-

bility." Id. at 430. Because of the possibility of con-

gressional disapproval, nearly all judicial interpretations of

suspension of deportation proceedings "are rendered, in effect,

impermissible advisory opinions." Ibid. Judge Kennedy termed

this interference with the central function of the judiciary

"both disruptive and unnecessary." Ibid. If the purpose of the

                    legislative veto might survive. I had mentioned the

                    draft as superfluous to our holding.

legislative veto is for Congress to share in the administration

of the statute, "such involvement trespasses upon central

functions of the Executive." Id. at 432.42/

        In a speech delivered at Stanford Law School, Kennedy

discussed the implications of the Supreme Court's categorical

invalidation of the legislative veto:

                       The ultimate question then is whether the
                 Chadha decision will be the catalyst for some
                 basic congressional changes. My view of this
                  is not a sanguine one. I am not sure what it
                 will take for Congress to confront its own
                  lack of self-discipline, its own lack of
                 party discipline, its own lack of a princi-
                 pled course of action besides the ethic of
                 ensuring its reelection. Madison distrusted
                 the Congress because it would aggrandize the

violate separation of powers. While acknowledging that

         FIRST

        Judge Kennedy has written few First Amendment decisions

during his twelve years on the federal bench. He has written

only one opinion dealing with the religion clauses. He has

written sparingly on associational questions. And he has

written only a handful of opinions dealing with free speech

issues. His views on the scope of the First Amendment and the

limits of political advocacy are virtually unknown. Nor do we

know his views on church-state relations.

         At the hearings, Kennedy testified:

                 The First Amendment ., applies not just to
                 political speech, although that is clearly
                  one of its purposes, and in that respect it
                  ensures the dialogue that is necessary for

The dissent also noted that one of the dangers of the Magistrates Act,
 recognized by Congress, was that it would "induce economically disadvantaged
 litigants, unable to afford the delay and cost of waiting or adjudication by
 an Article III judge, to consent to trial before a magistrate," thereby
 creating a two-tiered system of justice. Id. at 554.

                 truth, and the First Amendment covers all of
                 these f o r m s . W

On balance, it seems fair to say that Judge Kennedy's record on

the First Amendment is a positive, one. His record is not

entirely unblemished but, on the whole, it demonstrates a

sensitivity to the value of free speech in a constitutional

democracy.

                         Finance

        Judge Kennedy's longest and most significant First Amendment

opinion is California Medical Ass'n v. Federal Election Comm'n.

641 F.2d 619 (1980), aff'd. 453 U.S. 182 (1981). The issue was

whether Congress could constitutionally place a $5,000 limit on a

professional association's contribution to a political action

committee. Judge Kennedy upheld the contribution limit in a

strong endorsement of the Supreme Court's approach in Buckley v.

Valeo.^Z/ Based on Buckley. he ruled that strict judicial

scrutiny was unnecessary because the contribution limit imposed

only a minimal burden on First Amendment rights. Rather, he

        4/ Hearing Testimony, Dec. 14, 1987, at 152-153. But see Singer v.
U.S. Civil Service Commission. 530 F.2d 247 (1976), vacated and remanded. 429
U.S. 1034 (1977), in which Judge Kennedy joined a unanimous decision that
 narrowly construes the scope of protected First Amendment activity. Singer
 was fired from his job as a clerk typist with the EBOC. The Ninth Circuit
 upheld the firing on the ground that Singer "openly and notoriously
 flaunt[ed] his homosexual way of life." The "notorious" activities included
 Singer's attempt to marry his lover, as well as a leadership role, including
 public speaking, on behalf of the Seattle Gay Alliance. The decision's hold-
 ing that "open ... advocacy of homosexual conduct" is not protected speech
 raises serious questions as to whether Judge Kennedy will apply the First
 Amendment to unpopular or dissident views; no specific language, however, can
 be ascribed to Judge Kennedy.

held, the relevant question was whether the contribution limit
promoted "a discernible, important and legitimate policy of the
Congress." Id. at 628. Judge Kennedy found such a policy
"inherent in the structure" of the federal campaign finance laws,
id. at 629, and therefore rejected plaintiffs' First Amendment
challenge. The ACLU took the opposite position in an amicus
brief.

         Employee Speech
        Judge Kennedy's approach to employee free speech rights also
raises a civil liberties concern. In Kotwica v. City of Tucson.
801 F.2d 1182 (1986), he ruled that a municipal employee could be
sanctioned by her employer for deliberately misstating official
policy to the press. The holding itself is not remarkable.
Judge Kennedy's statement of the law, however, is sweeping in its
implications. "The government's interest," he wrote, "is in
direct proportion to the potential for interference with its
ability to function, and in judging the level of interference,
the government had broad discretion." Id. at 1184.
         Lynn v. Sheet Metal Workers' Intern. Ass'nr 804 F.2d 1472
(1986), involved similar issues in a somewhat different context.
The plaintiff in Lvnn was dismissed from his position as union
business manager after he publicly disagreed with the union
leadership on the need for a dues increase. He then sued the
union, claiming that his dismissal violated the labor bill of
rights contained in the Landrum-Griffin Act. The majority
agreed. Judge Kennedy argued in dissent that federal law pro-

                                                    - 33 -

tected only plaintiff's right to union membership, not his right

to union office.
                  [T]he majority errs in holding that union
                  leadership cannot discharge a business
                 manager who actively opposes the leadership
                  on a fundamental issue of union policy.

                 Although this action indirectly penalizes
                  [plaintiff] for his exercise of protected
                  rights, it does so only in his capacity as an
                  officer, not as a member. Absent a serious
                  threat to the continued democratic governance
                  of the union, such a dismissal does not
                 violate the rights of union membership
                  protected by [federal law]....

Id. at 1485.,

         Prior Restraints
         By contract, Judge Kennedy has scrupulously resisted prior
restraints, whether sought by the government or private parties.
For example, in GoJdblum v. NBC. 584 F.2d 904 (1978), petitioner
sought an injunction against an NBC "dccu-drama" detailing abuses
in the securities industry. Petitioner was at the time in jail
for securities fraud. He contended that the film would prejudice
his chances for early parole and inflame future juries against
him in any possible civil actions. The district judge ordered
the film produced sc it could be reviewed for. "inaccuracies."
The network declined production, and the district court ordered
the network's counsel imprisoned for contempt. In his opinion
for the panel, Judge Kennody reversed the district court,
stating:

                  The express and sole purpose of the district
                  court's order to submit the film for viewing

                                                     - 34 -
                                   826

                 by the court was to determine whether or not
                 to issue an injunction suspending its broad-
                 cast. Necessarily, any such injunction
                 would be a sweeping prior restraint of speech
                 and, therefore, presumptively unconstitu-
                 tional .

Id. at 906.

         Similarly, Judge Kennedy has rejected two requests for cease

and desist orders sought by the Federal Trade Commission in

commercial advertising cases. In Standard Oil Co. of California

v. FTCf 577 F.2d 653 (1978), the FTC issued a cease and desist

order that extended to any product promoted by Standard Oil or

its advertising agency based on a finding that advertisements for

gasoline additives had been false and misleading. Judge Kennedy

struck down the order as overbroad:

                  [F]irst Amendment considerations dictate that
                 the Commission exercise restraint in formu-
                  lating remedial orders which may amount to a
                 prior restraint on protected commercial
                  speech. ... At a minimum, administrative
                  agencies may not pursue rigorous enforcement
                  to the extent of discouraging advertising
                 with no concomitant gain in assuring accuracy
                  or truthfulness.

Id. at 662.

         FTC v. Simeon Management Corp.. 532 F.2d 708 (1976),

addressed a related procedural issue. In support of its request

for a preliminary injunction to restrain the advertising campaign

of a diet clinic, the FTC argued that its determination that an

injunction was necessary should be accepted by the court unless

plainly unreasonable. Judge Kennedy disagreed:

                  When potentially protected speech is sub-
                  jected to prior restraint ... procedural
                  safeguards are vitally important. Such

                                                    - 35 -
                                  827

                 safeguards would be inadequate if courts
                 were required ... to enjoin advertising
                 because the FTC claimed it was false, without
                 first making an independent determination of
                 the sufficiency of that claim.
Id. at 713. Judge Kennedy also noted that "forbidding the
advertising altogether because public policy disfavors the
underlying activity would raise serious first amendment ques-
tions." Id. at 717.
        Press Access
         In a somewhat analogous context, Judge Kennedy rejected the
government's effort to shield certain litigation papers from
public scrutiny in CBS v. United States District Court. 765 F.2d
823 (1985). The government had persuaded the district court that
it should not be forced to reveal documents sealed in connection
with a motion to reduce the sentence of one of John DeLorean's
co-defendants. Judge Kennedy disagreed:
                 The government and the trial court ... went
                  so far as to assert that the governments
                  interest would be threatened if even its
                 position of support or opposition to the
                 motion were made known. That idea is as
                  remarkable as it is meritless.
Id. at 826. At the same time, Judge Kennedy "assumed that the
right of access to criminal proceedings could, in appropriate
circumstances, be limited to protect private property interests
as well as the defendant's right to a fair trial." Id. at 825.
The implications of that "assumption" are potentially troubling;
the issue, however, was not directly addressed in the CBS case.

         Libel
        Judge Kennedy has written two libel decisions. One
involves substance, the other procedure. In Koch v. Goldwav. 817
F.2d 507 (1987), the Mayor of Santa Monica was sued for
defamation for making the following comment about a local
political opponent: "There was a well-known Nazi war criminal
named U s e Koch during World War II. Like Hitler, U s e Koch has
never been found. Is this the same U s e Koch? Who knows?"
Judge Kennedy ruled that the statement was protected opinion and
therefore not actionable. He reached this conclusion by
examining both the words and the context in which they were
uttered, placing particular stress on the fact that the speech
occurred in the midst of a political debate:

                 The law of defamation teaches ... that in
                 some instances speech must seek its own
                 refutation without intervention by the
                 courts. ... Base and malignant speech is not
                 necessarily actionable.
Id. at 510.48/
        In Church of Scientology of California v. Adams. 584 F.2d
893 (1976), Judge Kennedy addressed the important question of
whether a l i b e l action can be brought against a newspaper in any
s t a t e where the newspaper i s sold. The case arose after the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch published a s e r i e s of a r t i c l e s on the Church

       4/ Judge Kennedy also rejected the claim that the Mayor's speech
created a cause for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Although
not fully analyzed, this holding i s worth noting since the Supreme Court i s
presently considering whether defamation and intentional infliction of
emotional distress are governed by the same constitutional standards. See
Falweli v. Flynt. 797 F.2d 1270 (4th Cir. 1986), cert, granted. 55 U.S.L.W.

of Scientology of Missouri. The national church, located in
California, then brought suit in California. The only basis for
jurisdiction in California was that 156 copies of the St. Louis
paper had been mailed to subscribers in the state. Judge Kennedy
ruled that this was insufficient to make a newspaper defend a
libel action in a distant forum. While cautioning that juris-
dictional rules did not change merely because a newspaper was
involved, Judge Kennedy wrote:

                  The nature of the press is such that copies
                  of most major newspapers will be located
                  throughout the world, and we do not think it
                  consistent with fairness to subject publish-
                  ers to personal jurisdiction solely because
                  an insignificant number of copies of their
                  newspaper were circulated in the forum
                  state.
Id. at 897.
         Political Speech
         The constitutional protection for political speech and
association has not been a major focus of Judge Kennedy's writ-
ings. It has been a tangential issue, however, in two of his
decisions. United States v. Freeman. 761 F.2d 549 (1985),
involved a criminal prosecution against a self-proclaimed tax
protestor who was convicted of counseling others to evade the
tax laws based, in part, on a series of public workshops he
conducted. Citing the Brandenburg standard,A9-/ Judge Kennedy
reversed the conviction on the ground that "the jury should have
been charged that the expression was protected unless both the

intent of the speaker and the tendency of his words was to
produce or incite an imminent lawless act ...." Id. at 552.^IV

         In United States v. Abel. 707 F.2d 1013 (1983), aff'd. 469
U.S. 45 (1984), the issue was whether a defense witness in a
criminal trial could be impeached by bringing out the fact that
both the witness and the defendant had belonged to a secret
prison organization whose members were allegedly committed to
lying on each other's behalf. The majority ruled that this
associational connection was constitutionally irrelevant without
some showing that the witness shared the association's
objectives. Judge Kennedy dissented, arguing that the majority's
rule was appropriate when group membership was used as a basis
for punishment but not when it was used only for purposes of
impeachment. In Judge Kennedy's words, "[t]he witness who is
impeached by membership in a group sworn to perjury is subject to
no sanction other than that his testimony may be disbelieved."
Id. at 1017. The Supreme Court subsequently accepted Judge
Kennedy's view.

         Religion

 require the overruling of that precedent." Hearing Testimony, Dec. 15, 1987,

payments made to the Church of Scientology, claimed as charitable
deductions by church members. Writing for a unanimous panel,
Kennedy found no violation of the taxpayers' free exercise
r i g h t s . He doubted that they had shown a burden on the right of
free exercise, but, even if there was a burden, Kennedy found
compelling the government's i n t e r e s t in "a neutral and
enforceable taxation system." Id. at 853. Finally, Kennedy
dismissed the Scientologists' establishment clause claim, finding
i t without support in the record. Ibid.

         At the hearings, Kennedy provided only minimal elaboration
of his views on church-state r e l a t i o n s . In response to a general
question about the establishment clause, Kennedy t e s t i f i e d that
" i t i s a fundamental value of the Constitution . . . that the
Government does not impermissibly a s s i s t or aid a l l religions or
any one religion over the other."51/ However, he also made a
point of noting a tension between the establishment clause and
the free exercise clause.52/

        51/ see Hearing Testimony, Dec. 14, 1987, at 208. In a 1968 interview
 with the MoGeorge School of law newspaper, Kennedy was quoted "as saying that
 the Court should leave room for some expressions of religion in State-operated
 places. There should be a place for some religious experience in schools or a
 Christinas tree in a public housing center." Id. at 206. When asked about
 this, Kennedy stated that he did not recall the article or the interview. He
 also suggested that the comments attributed to him no longer reflect his
 views: "I would say that the law would be an impoverished subject if my views
 didn't change over 20 years." Ibid.

          CRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE

        Judge Kennedy has written well over 100 opinions in the

criminal law area. His decisions show great s e n s i t i v i t y t o the

needs of law enforcement. Nevertheless, Judge Kennedy has been

willing to reverse a criminal conviction when faced with

evidence of police misconduct.53/

         Several of Judge Kennedy's unpublished speeches also address

criminal law issues. The nominee has questioned the wisdom of

rules adopted in the criminal area to protect constitutional

r i g h t s . For example, in a 1981 speech, Kennedy noted t h a t "some

of the refinements we have invented for criminal cases are

carried almost to the point of an obsession. Implementing these

rules has not been without i t s severe cost."54/ At the South

Pacific Judicial Conference, Kennedy also c r i t i c i z e d j u d i c i a l

indifference to the r i g h t s of crime victims:

                 The significant criminal law decisions of the
                 Warren Court focused on the r e l a t i o n of the
                  accused to the s t a t e , and the police as an
                  instrument of the s t a t e . L i t t l e or no
                  thought was given to the position of the
                 victims.55/

        53/ Senator Leahy noted, without contradiction, that Kennedy ruled for
the defendant in about a third of the criminal cases he heard, and for the
government in the remaining two-thirds. Hearing Testimony, Dec. 15, 1987, at
 136.

Judge Kennedy stressed the fact that appellate judges "are in an
ideal position either to mandate or, by persuasion, to bring
about important and needed reforms to protect victims and indeed
other witnesses."/ it is unclear what impact, if any, this
solicitude for victims wouid have on Judge Kennedy's decisions in
criminal cases.52/

         Fourth Amendment
         Judge Kennedy's view of the exclusionary rule raises
significant civil liberties concern. Judge Kennedy believes that
the rule exists solely to deter police misconduct. It therefore
has no application to the "good faith and sensible actions" of
the police:

                  It the exclusionary rule becomes an end in
                  itself and the courts do not apply it in a
                  sensible and predictable way, then one
                  approach is to reexamine it altogether. We
                  do net have that authority; but we do have
                  the commission, and the obligation, to con-
                  fine the rule to the purposes for which it
                  was announced.

                  In this case, the exclusionary rule seems to
                  have ncquiraa such independent force chat it
                  operates without reference to any improper
                  conduct by the police.

 of concern for the rights of crime victims. See, e.g., Kearirej Testimony,

 exception on one case involving restitution as a condition of parole, Kennedy
 indicated that victims' rights had not played a role in his criminal law
 decisions. Id. at 171.

United States v. Harvey. 711 F.2d 144 (1983) (dissent from denial
of rehearing en bane).5S/

        Judge Kennedy's best known Fourth Amendment decision is
probably his dissent in United States v. Leon. No. 82-1093 (Jan.
19, 1983) (unpublished), rev'd. 468 U.S. 897 (1984). The Court
of Appeals affirmed the district court's holding that a search
warrant was invalid because based on information that was both
over five-months-old and failed to establish the credibility of
the informant. In dissent, Judge Kennedy argued that the
warrant was valid because the five-month-old information had been
validated by "a continuing course of suspicious conduct." Ibid.
While noting that the police investigation was "conducted with
care, diligence, and good faith," id. at 5, Judge Kennedy's
dissent was not based on the "good faith" of the police
officers.-5-9-/ The Supreme Court reversed, and established a "good
faith" exception to the exclusionary rule.

 Conservative Weekly, November 21, 1987, p. 7 (claiming that Kennedy's dissent
 in Leon was "so persuasive" that it was adopted by the Supreme Court).

               At the hearings, Kennedy acknowledged this: "I get somewhat ...
more credit for the Leon case than I deserve, because I did not find that
 there had been an illegal search in that case." Hearing Testimony, Dec. 14,
 1987, at 204.

        Judge Kennedy has already extended the "good faith"

exception beyond the rule established in Leon. In United States

v. Peterson. 812 F.2d 486, 491-92 (1987), for example, a case

involving a j o i n t venture between United States and Philippine

narcotics authorities, Judge Kennedy applied the "good faith"
exception to "reliance on foreign law enforcement officers1

representations that there has been compliance with t h e i r own

law." Id. at 492. He acknowledged that "Leon speaks only in

terms of good faith reliance on a facially valid search

warrant," but did not consider this dispositive:

                  Holding [U.S. officers] to a s t r i c t l i a b i l i t y
                  standard for failings of t h e i r foreign
                  associates would be even more incongruous
                  than holding law enforcement officials to a
                  s t r i c t l i a b i l i t y standard as to the adequacy
                  of domestic warrants. We conclude that the
                  good faith exception to the exclusionary rule
                  announced in Leon applies to the foreign
                  search.

Ibid./ But see United States v. Spilotro. 800 F.2d 959, 968

 (1986) (refusing to apply the "good faith" exception to facially

overbroad warrant).

        ^2/ At the hearings, however, Kennedy indicated that he would proceed
with caution in this area:

            Now whether or not [the good faith exception] should apply to
            warrantless searches in the United States is a question that I
            have not addressed, and I would want to consider very
            deliberately whether or not the rule should be extended to
            those instances because you then get, as you know, into the
            problem of objective versus subjective bad faith and you must
            by very careful to ensure that by the exception you do not
             swallow the rule.

        Judge Kennedy has upheld warrantless searches in a variety

of contexts, especially where there is no evidence of police

misconduct.^1/ In United States v. Alien, 633 F.2d 1282 (1980),

cert, denied. 454 U.S. 833 (1981), Kennedy held that a ranch

owner had no reasonable expectation of privacy in portions of his

property observed and photographed by a Coast Guard helicopter

conducting aerial surveillance to uncover evidence of drug

smuggling.^/ The Supreme Court subsequently upheld the

constitutionality of warrantless aerial surveillance. See

California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. , 90 L.Ed.2d 210 (1986).

Justice Powell, joined by Justices Brennan, Marshall and

Blackroun, dissented. Justice Powell's objections to the search

in Ciraolo are equally applicable to the search in Allen:

                 Here, police conducted an overflight at low
                  altitude solely for the purpose of discover-
                  ing evidence of crime within a private
                  enclave into which they were constitutionally
                  forbidden to intrude at ground level without
                  a warrant.

         6-2/ in a speech, Kennedy warned that "[T]he constitutional order today
 is under a tremerrious attack by criminal conspiracies that operate and profit
 from sale of illegal drugs," Rotary Club Speech, supra, at 2. He described
 some responses to this "drug invasion": "As for the drug traffickers
themselves, we have ruled that aerial photo intelligence, radar and infrared
 surveillance, and coastguard boardings for vessel inspection, whether inside
 or outside the territorial twelve mile limit, are lawful for the purpose of
 interdicting the drug trade." Id. at 3.

         6-2/ Judge Kennedy did note, however, that the court was not presented
with "an attempt to reduce, by the use of vision-enhdncing devices or the

                                                                                                            (continued...)

        When faced with instances of police misconduct or over-

reaching, however, Judge Kennedy has applied the exclusionary

rule, even where it means overturning convictions. In United

States v. Cameron. 538 F.2d 254 (1976), one of his earliest

opinions in this area, Kennedy reversed a drug conviction based

on evidence obtained by a body cavity search that included "two

forced digital probes, two enemas, and forced [administration of]

a liquid laxative." Id. at 258. Judge Kennedy recognized the

magnitude of the intrusion involved and concluded that

                  [i]n a situation thus laden with the poten-
                  tial for fear and anxiety, a reasonable
                  search will include beyond the usual pro-
                  cedural requirements, reasonable steps to
                 mitigate the anxiety, discomfort, and humili-
                  ation that the suspect may suffer.

Ibid. Finding that the procedures employed "were lacking in

these respects," Kennedy held that the search violated the Fourth

Amendment.4/ ibid.

         Similarly, in United States v. Rettiq, 589 F.2d 418 (1978),

Kennedy was willing to look behind a facially valid warrant, to

examine the circumstances under which it was issued and executed.

        ^ / The opinion expresses concern over the "excesses in both the
 incidence and the extent of body searches" conducted by the government, and
 insists that the government "keep careful statistics henceforth and make them
 available to the United States Attorney," so that the court can determine
 whether to adhere to its rule that a warrant is not always required in body
 search cases. 538 F.2d at 259-60. Bit see United States v. Shreve. 697 F.2d
 873 (1983) (applying circuit precedent, Kennedy upheld a warrantless X-ray
 search for body cavity smuggling).

Finding bad faith on the part of the government, he reversed
several drug convictions obtained as a result. The record
established that when DEA agents applied to a state court judge
for a warrant to search for evidence of marijuana possession,
they did not disclose the fact that a federal magistrate had
denied their application the day before, nor did they reveal the
true purpose of the search, namely, to obtain evidence of a
cocaine conspiracy. Kennedy ruled that,

                  [b]y failing to advise the judge of all the
                 material facts, including the purpose of the
                  search and its intended scope, the officers
                 deprived him of the opportunity to exercise
                 meaningful supervision over their conduct
                  and to define the proper limits of the
                 warrant.
Id. at 422. He found that because "the agents did not confine
their search in good faith to the objects of the warrant. ...
this warrant became an instrument for conducting a general
search." Id. at 423.
         Finally, in United States v. Penn. 647 F.2d 876, cert.
denied. 449 U.S. 903 (1980), a majority of the court reversed a
lower court decision granting the defendant's motion to suppress
a jar of heroin found in her backyard. The police had obtained
this evidence by offering $5 to the defendant's five-year-old
son. Although the court disapproved of this police tactic, it
nevertheless found that the action did not "shock the
conscience," id. at 880, and was not "unreasonable" under the
Fourth Amendment. Id. at 883. The court also found that the
police's interaction with the child did not violate any

legitimate expectation of privacy held by the mother. Ibid. It
found that "no "family1 interest of constitutional stature is

implicated here." Id. at 884.

        Judge Kennedy dissented. In his view,

                  [t]he question is whether the police can use
                 the search of a residence as the occasion
                  for a severe intrusion upon the relation
                 between a mother and a child who has not
                 reached the age of reason. Her relationship
                 to the child be]ongs intimately to the mother
                  . . . . To say that she has no standing to
                 complain of the stark intrusion upon it in
                 this case is to assume a negative to the very
                 question in issue, namely, to what extent
                 the law can protect the relationship from
                 disruption in the home.

Id. at 888 (citation omitted). He pointed out that courts have

protected the parent-child relationship "where the threat of

disruption is in some respects more attenuated than in the

circumstances of the case before us." Ibid. He concluded that

this police practice was "both pernicious in itself and dangerous

as precedent. Indifference to personal liberty is but the

precursor of the state's hostility to it." Id. at 889.

         Fifth Amendment

                  Self-Incrimination

         Judge Kennedy takes a narrow view of the kind and degree of

compulsion prohibited by the Fifth Amendment privilege against

self-incrimination. For example, in Ryan v. Montana. 580 F.2d

988 (1978), cert, denied. 440 U.S. 977 (1979), Kennedy concluded

that the Fifth Amendment does not require a state to grant a

probationer use immunity for testimony given at a probation

revocation and deferred sentencing hearing, when he is under

                                                     - 48 -
                                    840

indictment for the act that constitutes the probation violation.
Because no inference of guilt was or could have been drawn from
the defendant's silence at the probation revocation proceeding,
Judge Kennedy found that these procedures do not violate the
Fifth Amendment as construed by the Supreme Court. Judge
Kennedy's opinion did, however, question the wisdom of the
challenged practice:

                  If our opinion as to the wisdom of the
                 Montana rule were dispositive, we might
                 prefer the California procedure, ... which
                 provides use immunity for a probationer's
                 testimony if it is given at a revocation
                 hearing held prior to trial on criminal
                 charges which were the basis for the revo-
                 cation proceeding.
Id. at 994.
        Matter of Fred R. Witte Center Glass No. 3. 544 F.2d 1026
(1976), raised the question whether a taxpayer under
investigation by the Internal Revenue Service could decline to
produce his accountant's work papers. The majority held that
production was compelled under Fisher v. United States.^5/ Judge
Kennedy concurred. He emphasized that Fisher might not apply to
other papers, "especially those of a more private nature"; he
suggested that there was a "high probability that an order to
produce personal papers may compel assertions or communications
that fall within the [Fifth Amendment] privilege." Id. at 1029.

                 Miranda
        At the hearings, Kennedy characterized Miranda as "a
sweeping, sweeping rule," one which "wrought almost a
revolution."^/ He also questioned the soundness of the
decision: M[I]t is not clear to me that it necessarily followed
from the words of the Constitution. And yet it is in place now,
and I think it is entitled to great respect."2/ Despite these
reservations, as a court of appeals judge, Kennedy has generally
applied this precedent, even at the cost of reversing
convictions.
         In United States v. Scharf. 608 F.2d 323 (1979), for
example, Judge Kennedy reversed a conviction where Miranda
warnings had not been delivered during the course of what he
found to be custodial interrogations. He cited "[t]he intensity
of the surveillance, the repeated interrogations, and the fact
that [the defendant] had been subject to custodial interrogation
twenty-four hours before" as "factors that combine to render the
last interrogation a custodial one." Id. at 325.
         In Neuschafer v. McKay. 807 F.2d 839 (1987), the defendant
was convicted of murdering a fellow inmate and sentenced to
death. The district court dismissed his petition for a writ of
habeas corpus. In an opinion by Judge Kennedy, the Court of
Appeals remanded for an evidentiary hearing on whether

        / Hearing Testimarp, Dec. 15, 1987, at 142.
        S / ibid. Kennedy also testified that the rule established in Miranda
may have gone "beyond the necessities of the case." Id. at 143.

incriminating statements were obtained in violation of Edwards v.
Arizona.3/ Kennedy found that the district court's reliance on
the state trial court record was improper when the state's
highest court characterized the record as "unclear." He noted
that, in habeas corpus proceedings, "deference must be granted to
the findings of state appellate courts as well as state trial
courts." Id. at 841.52/ After an evidentiary hearing, the
district court concluded that the incriminating statements were
admissible under Edwards. This time the Court of Appeals, again
per Kennedy, affirmed. Neuschafer v. Whitley. 816 F.2d 1390
(1987).

        By contrast, Judge Kennedy affirmed a conviction in United
States v. Contreras. 755 F.2d 733 (1985), cert, denied sub nom.
Soto v. United States. 474 U.S. 832 (1985), which involved a
federal prosecution of prison gang members who had testified
under immunity in a state investigation. Federal agents gave the
standard Miranda warnings, but also advised defendants that the
state grants of immunity were not binding on the federal court
and did not apply in the federal investigation. Using a very lax
standard -- "we find no objective flaw and no necessarily
misleading inferences in the advice given by the federal agents"

       / 451 U.S. 477 (1981).
       2/ The remand provoked a sharp dissent from Judge Chambers, who
maintained that there could be no doubt as to Neuschafer's guilt. He read the
majority "as simply saying our district judge can make a better record and
 [we] should not indulge in a gamble by one of our en banes or risk the Supreme
Court handling the case now." 807 F.2d at 842.

-- Judge Kennedy concluded that the defendants had made a knowing

and intelligent waiver of their Miranda rights.2-2/ id. at 737.

        Similarly, in United States v. Edwards. 539 F.2d 689 (1976),

Judge Kennedy upheld a rape conviction based on a confession made

after the suspect had been in custody for more than six hours

without being taken before a magistrate. The decision recites

that the suspect had been "advised of his rights and signed a

waiver thereof." Id. at 691. Despite the delay in arraignment,

Judge Kennedy refused to exclude the confession:

                  Confessions given more than six hours after
                  arrest during a delay in arraignment are,
                 however, not per se involuntary. The delay
                  is only one factor, to be considered in light
                  of all the surrounding circumstances. The
                  trial court found that the delay in arraign-
                  ment was caused solely by a shortage of
                  personnel and vehicles to transport the
                  suspect a distance of 125 miles to Tucson,
                  the site of the nearest available magistrate.
                  There was no evidence that the defendant was
                  the subject of oppressive police practices
                  prior to the admission.

                  Double Jeopardy

         Judge Kennedy frequently dissents where the majority

reverses a criminal conviction on double jeopardy grounds. On

the facts presented in these cases, he saw no constitutional

impediment to reprosecution for a more serious offense or the

        22/ Judge Canby dissented. He found that tlie statements were "fatally
 misleading" because "[t]hey failed to make clear that federal authorities were
 precluded from making use of the statements that the defendants had already
 given under a promise or grant of immunity by state authorities." 755 F.2d at
 738.

imposition of cumulative sentences for convictions proscribing
the same conduct.

          For example, in Adamson v. Ricketts. 789 F.2d 722 (1986)
(en bane), rev'd. 107 S.Ct. 2680 (1987), a capital case, the
majority concluded that the double jeopardy clause barred repro-
secution for first degree murder of a defendant who pled guilty
to second degree murder and that the defendant had not waived his
rights under the terms of his plea agreement:. Judge Kennedy
dissented. He maintained that a conviction resting on a plea
agreement does not protect a defendant from trial for a more
serious of-rise if the plea is later set aside by reason of the
defendant's breach of the agreement. The Supreme court substan-
tially adopted Judge Kennedy's analysis.

         Arizona v. Kanypenny, 608 F.2d 1197 (1979), reyj.d, 451 U.S.
232 (1981), involved a st:te prosecution of federal border
patrolman, which was removed to federal court. The district
judge set aside the jury's guilty verdict and entered a judgment
of acquittal. The majority dismissed the state's appeal, finding
no federal statutory authority for appellate jurisdiction.
Judge Kennedy dissented. He maintained that

                  it was neither appropriate nor necessary for
                  Congress to speak to the authority of pro-
                  secutors who represent a separate state as
                 the sovereign initiating criminal charges.
                  That question is solely the prerogative of
                  the State of Arizona, and the State allows
                  appeals in cases such as the one before us.

 indictment for illegal re-entry after the defendant pled not guilty to a
 misdemeanor charge at an initial appearance before the magistrate. The

 prior record of illegal entry, which had not been available to the magistrate.
 In reversing the district court, Judge Kennedy explained:

                    When increased charges are filed in the routine
             course of prosecutorial review or as a result of continuing
             investigation, . . . there is no realistic likelihood of pro-
             secutorial abuse, and therefore no appearance of vindictive
             prosecution arises merely because the prosecutor's action was
             taken after a defense right was exercised.

        Sixth

                 Confrontation Clause

         Barker v. Morris. 761 F.2d 1396 (1985), cert, denied. 474

U.S. 928 (1987), is probably Judge Kennedy's most significant

Confrontation Clause decision. In Barker. he ruled that the

admission of videotaped testimony of a witness who subsequently

died did not violate the confrontation clause, despite the fact

that the defendant had no opportunity to cross-examine the

witness.^.2/ judge Kennedy found that the testimony had

"substantial and specific guarantees of trustworthiness and

reliability." Id. at 1401. He also recognized that the

confrontation clause is more than a guarantee of reliability:

                 Though reliability may be the crux of analy-
                  sis in determining both hearsay and Confron-
                 tation Clause violations, the Confrontation
                  Clause has acquired in our system a value
                  separate from the assurance of reliability.
                  In a basic sense, the Confrontation Clause is
                  one measure of the government's obligation to
                 present its case in a form subject to open
                  scrutiny and challenge by the accused, the
                 trier of fact, and the public.

Id. at 1400. Nevertheless, Judge Kennedy evaluated the taped

testimony almost exclusively in terms of its reliability and

found no confrontation clause violation. His decision, however,

is not inconsistent with current Supreme Court doctrine.2A/

         23/ ihe defendant was a fugitive at the time the testimony was given.
 The witness was extensively cross-examined by counsel for two co-defendants.
 See 761 F.2d at 1398.

        In Chipman v. Mercer. 628 F.2d 528 (1980), in contrast,
Kennedy upheld a d i s t r i c t court order overturning a s t a t e robbery
conviction. In t h i s case, the t r i a l court had refused to allow
cross-examination of the sole eyewitness to a robbery to show
bias, despite the fact that the witness had previously accused
residents of the f a c i l i t y for the mentally retarded where the
defendant lived of theft and had t r i e d to have the f a c i l i t y
closed. Kennedy noted t h a t , while

                  a t r i a l court normally has broad discretion
                  concerning the scope of cross-examination,
                  . . . a certain threshold level of cross-
                  examination i s constitutionally required, and
                  in such cases the discretion of the t r i a l
                  judge i s obviously circumscribed.

Id. at 530. He found that full cross-examination was particular-
ly important because t h i s witness1 testimony "was very s i g n i f i -
cant to the case." Id. a t 532. See also Burr v. Sullivan. 618

conviction where defense counsel was prohibited from asking
accomplices about juvenile offenses) .2s-/

 of unavailability; context provided adequate indicia of reliability).

        2/ Where Judge Kennedy has found the cross-exainination allowed to be
 adequate and effective, however, he has rejected claims that limitations on
 cross-examination violated that confrontation clause. See, e.g.. Bright v.
 Shimoda. 819 F.2d 227 (1987) (no violation for denial of cross-examination on
 a collateral matter); United States v. Kennedy. 714 F.2d 968, 973-74 (1983),
 cert, denied, 465 U.S. 1034 (1984) (no confrontation clause violation where
 cross-examination was only denied on collateral matters; jury received "ample
 presentation of appellant's theory").

                 Right to Counsel
        Judge Kennedy has written very few opinions on this subject.
While they tend to show a lack of receptivity to appeals based
on claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, no persistent
pattern emerges. In Satchell v. Cardwell. 653 F.2d 408, 414
(1981), cert, denied. 454 U.S. 1154 (1982), Judge Kennedy
concurred in the panels finding that defense counsels failure
to seek suppression of the fruits of a warrantless search did not
constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. The panel assumed,
without deciding, that Stone v. Powell^/ did not preclude habeas
review of an ineffective assistance claim grounded in failure to
make a Fourth Amendment argument.22/ In a concurring opinion,
Kennedy stated:

                 Even if we are permitted to circumvent Stone
                 v. Powell in this way, we should be cautious
                 about turning sixth amendment cases into
                  fourth amendment ones unless there is an
                 absolute necessity to do so. Based on the
                 trial court's observation of the trial coun-
                  sel's skill and the fact that the lawyer
                  studied the fourth amendment point and
                  researched it carefully, I would determine he
                 was competent without further discussion of
                 the fourth amendment issues.

Id. at 414.

         In United States v. Pederson. 784 F.2d 1462 (1986), Kennedy
also found no Sixth Amendment violation. He rejected the claim
that the district court's refusal to grant a continuance deprived

        26/ 428 U.S. 465 (1976).
       22/ ihis issue was later resolved by the Supreme Court in favor of
review. See Kimnelman v. Morrison. 477 U.S. , 91 L.Bd.2d 305 (1986).

the defendant of effective assistance of counsel, since he

continued to be represented by local counsel and substitute lead

counsel was familiar with the case. Similarly, in Greenfield v.

Gunn, 556 F.2d 935 (1977), cert, denied. 434 U.S. 928 (1977),

Kennedy refused to find that defense counsel was ineffective for

failing to raise defenses of insanity and unconsciousness.

However, he did express concern over the fact that the defendant

was represented by a series of different attorneys from the

public defender's office:

                  This type of horizontal representation may at
                  times be an inevitable result of workload and
                  budget constraints imposed on a public
                  defender's office. But unless each attorney
                  scrupulously acts to insure that all who
                  participate in the case are informed of every
                  aspect of that attorney's representation,
                  there is some danger that the defendant may
                  be deprived of effective legal assistance.

Id. at 938.

         Eighth

                  Death Penalty

         Judge Kennedy has published opinions in only a handful of

capital cases. Although he has been willing to uphold
convictions in capital cases,2s-/ it is difficult to predict how

        22/ Kennedy's opinions in two other capital cases, Adamson v. Ricketts.
 789 F.2d 722 (1986) (en bane), rev'd. 107 S. Ct. 2680 (1987), and Neuschafer
 v. McKay. 807 F.2d 839, after remand Neuschafer v. Whitley. 816 F.2d 1390
 (1987), are included in the discussion of the nominee's double jeopardy and
 Miranda decisions.

               On the second appeal in Neuschafer. Kennedy rejected two other
 claims raised by the defendant. First, he found it unnecessary to address the
 claim that one of the three aggravating factors, that the iwTr^r "involved
 torture, depravity of mind or the mutilation of the victim" used an arbitrary

                                                                                              (continued...)
                                                     - 58 -
                                    850

the nominee would vote in any particular capital case. On

balance, his opinions show a concern for procedural fairness and

a willingness to apply precedent favorable to capital defendants.

         For example, in Vickers v. Ricketts. 798 F.2d 369 (1986),

cert, denied. 107 S.Ct 928 (1987), Judge Kennedy granted habeas

relief to an Arizona death row prisoner convicted of first degree

murder. Although there was evidence from which the jury might

have found lack of premeditation, the trial court did not give an

instruction for second degree murder, a lesser included offense.

Even in the absence of a request for such an instruction,

Kennedy found that the omission violated due process principles
set forth in Beck v. Alabama7-^/ and Hopper v. Evans. &-/ Based on

the evidence, Kennedy stated that

                  [a] jury given the choice between first and
                  second degree murder might well return a
                 verdict of either first degree murder or
                  second degree murder. Under the Supreme
                 Court's decisions in Beck and Hopper. due

standard. Under state law, in the absence of mitigating factors, the presence
of either of the other two aggravating factors (which Neuschafer did not
challenge), would have permitted the jury to inpose the death sentence. 816
F.2d at 1393. Ihe second claim was that the sentence was disproportionate.
Citing Pulley v. Harris. 465 U.S. 37 (1984), Kennedy ruled that
"constitutional principles do not require the federal court in habeas corpus
proceedings[] to engage in any comparative proportionality review." Id. at
1394.

        2/ 447 U.S. 625 (1980). The Supreme Court held that in capital cases,
where the evidence would support conviction of a lesser included offense, the
jury must be instructed to consider that alternative.

        0/ 456 U.S. 605 (1982). This case reaffirmed Beck, but made clear that
a lesser included offense instruction was constitutionally mandated only if
 fairly supported by the evidence.

                 process required that the jury be given that
                 choice.
Id. at 373.
        At the hearings, Kennedy's testimony on the subject of the
death penalty was surprisingly reserved. To the apparent dismay
of some of the Judiciary Committee's conservative members, Judge
Kennedy refused to commit himself to the constitutionality of the
death penalty. In response to Senator Humphrey's concern over
the nominee's "unwillingness to recognize 200 years or so of
validation of capital punishment," Kennedy stated:
                 Well, I guess we have a disagreement as to
                 whether or not it [the constitutionality of
                 the death penalty] is well settled, Senator.
                 These decisions are very close. Some
                  justices have indicated that it is
                 unconstitutional, and I simply think that I
                  should not take a specific position on a
                  constitutional debate of ongoing
                  dimension.8-!/

         ACCESS TO THE FEDERAL COURTS
         Judge Kennedy has authored more than fifty opinions on
issues relating to access to the federal courts. Judge Kennedy
has consistently taken a strict view of statutes of limitations
and has upheld dismissals, even in civil rights cases, on the
ground that the suit is time barred. On the other hand, his
decisions tend to be narrowly tailored to the particular issue at
hand.

         Statutes of Limitations
         In Allen v. Veterans Admin.. 749 F.2d 1386 (1984), the
plaintiff mistakenly named the Veterans Administration as
defendant. By the time the suit was amended to include the
United States as defendant, the statute of limitations had
expired. Judge Kennedy's opinion affirmed dismissal of the case
as time barred. Likewise, in Hatchell v. United States. 776 F.2d
244 (1985), Judge Kennedy upheld the district court's dismissal
of a prisoner's complaint filed three days after expiration of
the statute of limitations. The prisoner had filed a claim,
which was denied. He then filed an action six months after
receipt of denial of the claim; the statute required that it be
filed within six months of the postmark.^/
         Pavlak v. Churchf 681 F.2d 617 (1982), vacated and remanded.
463 U.S. 1201 (1983), on remand, 727 F.2d 1425 (1984), involved a
civil rights challenge to an allegedly unlawful wiretap. In
Pavlakt the district court refused to certify a class action.
After denial of certification, a putative class member attempted
to file suit, contending that the statute of limitations had been
tolled while the certification issue was pending. The Supreme
Court had taken this position in Eisen v. Carlisle and Jacquelin.
417 U.S. 156, 157 n.13 (1974), stating " [commencement of a class
action tolls the applicable statute as to all class members."

within the time bar should not act as administrative res judicata when
plaintiff was unaware of implications of failure to appeal).

Characterizing the footnote in Eisen as "puzzling," 681 F.2d at

620 (citation omitted), Judge Kennedy refused to follow it. The

Supreme Court vacated and remanded. On remand, Judge Kennedy

applied the tolling rule, but refused to reinstate the claim.

Instead, he remanded to the district court for a factual

determination of when plaintiff could or should have discovered

her cause of action. 727 F.2d at 1428-29.

         The issue in Lynn v. Western Gillette. Inc.. 564 F.2d 1282

(1977), was when the 90-day period for bringing a private civil

action under Title VII begins to run. The statute makes clear

that EEOC notice or issuance of a formal right to sue letter

triggers t^e '"imp period. In Lvnn. the EEOC had delayed its
investigation of th^ r"1-*-ntiff's sex discrimination charges. It

then sent pi'inciff the wrong notice. As a result of EEOC

inaction ai.d error, almost three years passed from the time the

plaintiff filed charges and initiation of the lawsuit. Judge

Kennedy allowed the suit to go forward, but gratuitously offered

grounds for limiting plaintiff's relief:

                           Our determination of the type of notice
                  necessary to begin the period in which a
                  private action may be filed does not imply
                  that a plaintiff's lack of diligence in fil-
                  ing an action must be overlooked. ... The
                  complainant should not be permitted to pre-
                  judice the employer by taking advantage of
                  the Commission's slowness in processing
                  claims or by procrastinating while being
                  aware that the Commission intends to take no
                  further action. Under such circumstances, it
                  is proper for the district court, in the
                  exercise of its equitable discretion, to take
                  the plaintiff's lack of diligence into
                  account in determining the amount of back

                 pay, if any, to be awarded the plaintiff
                 should he prevail on the merits.
Id. at 1287-88.
         In EEOC v. Alioto Fish Co., 623 F.2d 86 (1980), the EEOC had
initiated suit 62 months after a complaint had been filed and
after many key witnesses had died. Judge Kennedy's opinion for
the court affirmed a dismissal on the basis of laches.
Nevertheless, in Coalition for Canyon Preservation v. Bowers. 632
F.2d 774 (1980), Judge Kennedy reversed the district court's
dismissal of an environmental suit on grounds of laches. He
stated: "Laches is not a favored defense in environmental
cases. Its use should be restricted to avoid defeat of Congress'
environmental policy." Id. at 779 (citation omitted) .&3-^
         Standing
         Judge Kennedy's most important standing case is TOPIC v.
Circle Realty. 532 F.2d 1273 (1976), cert, denied. 429 U.S. 859
(1976), in which he denied standing in a housing discrimination
case. Three years later, the Supreme Court rejected his view in
Gladstone Realtors v. Bellwood. 441 U.S. 91 (1979), a 7-2
decision with the majority opinion authored by Justice Powell.
         In TOPIC, teams of black and white couples posing as home
seekers determined that real estate brokers were practicing
racial steering. They brought suit under the Fair Housing Act
claiming they had been

                 deprived of the important social and
                 professional benefits of living in an
                 integrated community. Moreover, they have
                 suffered and will continue to suffer
                 embarrassment and economic damage in their
                 social and professional activities from being
                 stigmatized as residents of either white or
                 black ghettoes.

532 F.2d at 1274.

        Judge Kennedy reversed the district court's denial of the

motion to dismiss, contending, in effect, that only direct

victims of the steering practices had standing. The Supreme

Court, with Justices Rehnquist and Stewart dissenting, held that

standing under the Fair Housing Act is coterminous with Article

III. "Most federal courts that have considered the issue agree

...," Justice Powell wrote, "The notable exception is the Ninth

Circuit in TOPIC. ..." 441 U.S. at 108-09.

         By contrast, in Davis v. United States Dept. of Housing and

Urban Development. 627 F.2d 942 (1980), the Court of Appeals,

per Kennedy, reversed dismissal for lack of standing. In Davis,

low-income city residents challenged a Housing and Urban

Development block grant which they claimed would prevent

construction of low-income housing. Judge Kennedy wrote:

                  Causation sufficient to confer standing may
                  result from a defendant's acts or omissions.
                  Plaintiffs claim that they were injured by
                  the nonfederal appellees' failure to expend
                  housing assistance for low-income persons.

                  Municipal recipients of federal assistance
                  may not so easily avoid challenges to their
                  use of federal funds by threatening to opt
                  out of the program. It is sufficient for
                  standing purposes that the injury alleged

                 here "can be traced to the challenged action
                 of the defendant[s] and [is] not injury that
                 results from the independent action of some
                 third party not before the Court."
Id. at 944-45 (citations omitted).
         Subject Matter Jurisdiction
         In other circumstances, Judge Kennedy has narrowly
construed jurisdictional bars to suits in federal court. For
instance, in Mclntvre v. Mclntyre. 771 F.2d 1316 (1985), Judge
Kennedy reversed the district court's dismissal of a husband's
suit for money damages brought against his ex-wife because of her
interference with his child visitation rights. Judge Kennedy
wrote that the long-standing domestic relations exception to
federal diversity jurisdiction would not bar a claim of tortious
interference with visitation rights. See also Knudsen Corp. v.
Nevada State Dairy Commission, 676 F.2d 374 (1982) (affirming a
refusal of the lower court to abstain).
        Additionally, some of Judge Kennedy's opinions overturn
lower court decisions dismissing cases for failure to state a
claim upon which relief can be granted. In Western Waste
Service v. Universal Waste Controlr 616 F.2d 1094 (1980), cert.
denied. 449 U.S. 869 (1980), the district court dismissed an
antitrust suit against a waste disposal company. The Ninth
Circuit's decision, authored by Judge Kennedy, reversed the lower
court, holding that cases should be dismissed for failure to
state a claim only if on the most favorable reading of the
plaintiff's complaint it is clear that the plaintiff cannot
recover.

                                                    - 65 -

        Jones v. Taber. 648 F.2d 1201 (1981), involved dismissal of
a civil rights suit against prison officials for injuries
suffered as a result of a beating by prison guards. The prisoner
agreed to a settlement of the suit, but subsequently brought
suit in district court. The case was dismissed. Judge Kennedy,
writing for the court, reversed, concluding that the earlier
settlement did not constitute a voluntary release by the
prisoner. He noted that the coercion in the prison and the
inmate's lack of understanding of his rights made the settlement
highly suspect.4/

         DDE PROCESS
        Judge Kennedy has written only a handful of opinions which
specifically address the issue of procedural due process.
        He ruled in favor of fair process for federal employees in
Albert v. Chafee. 571 F.2d 1063 (1977), which involved discharge
of a civilian employee of the Navy dismissed for minor
misconduct. At the employee's disciplinary hearing, new charges

       Si/ There are instances in which Judge Kennedy dissented from Ninth
 Circuit decisions limiting access to the federal courts. In MsDonnell Douglas
 Corp. v. United States District Court for the Central District of California.
 523 F.2d 1083 (1975), the court of appeals reversed a decision certifying a
 class action for damages which resulted from an airplane crash. Judge Kennedy
 dissented, arguing that the class should have been certified and, in any
 event, contending that the case should have been heard en bane by the Ninth
 Circuit. See also Scharf v. United States Attorney General. 597 F.2d 1240
 (1979) (reversing district court's grant of suttraary judgment in favor of the
 government in a case involving the deportation of a minor alien).

              There are also, however, many decisions in which Judge Kennedy rules
 against federal jurisdiction. E.g.. Portland Police Ass'n v. City of
 Portland. 658 F.2d 1272 (1981) (dismissing as not justiciable suit by police
 association).

                                               - 66 -
                                    858

were levelled. The court held that failure to give advance
notice of all the charges violated due process and applicable
statutory and regulatory procedures. In a one-paragraph opinion,
Judge Kennedy concurred in a one-paragraph opinion: "In light of
the trivial nature of the stated charge and the severity of the
sanctions imposed, it was prejudicial to consider additional
charges of which he had no notice." Id. at 1069.

        Vanelli v. Reynolds School District No. 7, 667 F.2d 773
(1982), also involved the procedural protections afforded by the
due process clause when a public employee is dismissed. A
teacher was dismissed at the midpoint of a one-year contract
after female students complained of offensive conduct. The
school district dismissed without a pre-termination hearing. At
a post-termination hearing, the school district upheld its
earlier firing decision. Judge Kennedy found that a pre-
termination hearing was constitutionally required, noting that
"[t]here is a strong presumption that a public employee is
entitled to some form of notice and opportunity to be heard
before being deprived of a property or liberty interest." Id. at
778. Moreover,- Judge Kennedy remanded for a determination of
damages, finding that appellant could recover for injury to
liberty as well as property that resulted from his procedural
deprivation.

         On the other hand, Judge Kennedy rejected a due process
claim in Hazelwood Chronic & Convalescent Hospital v.
Weinberger. 543 F.2d 703 (1976), vacated on other grounds. 430

                                                    - 67 -
                                  859

U.S. 952 (1977), in which a hospital challenged retroactive
application of Medicaid reimbursement regulations for the
recapture of depreciation charges. Judge Kennedy reversed the
district court and upheld retroactive application. He stated,
"[t]he due process clause does not make unconstitutional every
law with retroactive effect. ... Only when such retroactive
effects are so wholly unexpected and disruptive that harsh and
oppressive consequences follow is the constitutional limitation
exceeded." Id. at 708.

        CONCLUSION
        This concludes our report on Judge Kennedy's judicial
philosophy and civil rights record. We believe it represents a
fair distillation of Judge Kennedy's major decisions in areas
involving civil rights and civil liberties, as well as his
unpublished speeches and testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.

THE TWENTIETH LEGISLATURE
SECOND SPECIAL SESSION

          SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

A SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION EXPRESSING THE SUPPORT OF THE
LEGISLATURE OF AMERICAN SAMOA FOR THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE
ANTHONY KENNEDY TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

WHEREAS,  President Reagan recently nominated Judge Anthony
          Kennedy of the United States Court of Appeals for
          the Ninth Circuit to be a Justice of the United
          States Supreme Court; and

WHEREAS, in the minds and hearts of the people of American
                   Samoa, a better choice could not have been made;
                   and

          Judge Kennedy has convincingly demonstrated supe-
          rior skills as a thoughtful judge in his term on
          the Court of Appeals, evidence of which has been
          displayed through his decisions as a member of
          the Appellate Division of the High Court of
          American Samoa; and

WHEREAS,  in addition to the knowledge gained as a member
          of our High Court, his Chairmanship of the Pacific
          Territories Committee of the Judicial Conference
          of the United States, further steeped Judge
          Kennedy in the culture and traditions of American
          Samoa, a rare addition to the knowledge and expe-
          rience of a Supreme Court nominee; and

WHEREAS,  Judge Kennedy's participation in local cases cre-
          ated opportunities to expand his wisdom and under-
          standing of how diverse cultures interplay with
          traditional American ideals and legal principles,
          making him more sensitive to social, moral and
          cultural issues of our time; and

WHEREAS,  the unpredictable, difficult issues which demand
          resolution in the United States courts are fre-
          quently rooted in social change and ethnic and
          cultural tensions, making purely legal analyses
          seem sometimes insufficient for addressing the
          real issues; ahd

                FRANK CARRINGTON,
                 ATTORNEY AT LAW
                  IN SUPPORT OF
THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY
    FOR THE OFFICE OF ASSOCIATE JUSTICE

                          OF
  THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,

                  DECEMBER, 1987
                                    867

Mr. Chairman: My name is Frank Carrington; I am an Attorney at Law; I
reside, and practice, at 4530 Oceanfront, Virginia Beach, Virginia, 23451;
office telephone: (804) 422-2692; home telephone (804) 428-1825.

        I appear, herein, as a private citizen, to urge that this Committee,
and the Senate as a whole, Advise and Consent to the nomination of Judge
Anthony M. Kennedy as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States.

        My frame of reference is the record of Judge Kennedy on certain
criminal justice issues, with particular emphasis on the rights and needs
of the victims of crime in America.

                 My credentials to speak on these issues can be summarized as
follows: I received and Ll.B. degree from the University of Michigan Law
School in 1960, and a Master of Laws degree, in Criminal law, from Northwestern
University Law School in 1970.

        The first ten years of my career were spent in active law enforcement
work on the federal and local levels, the next ten years were spent in
work in the private sector in support of professional law enforcement and
in support of the rights of the victims of crime; the past seven years
have been devoted almost exclusively, through my practice of law, private
sector work, and government service, to the rights of victims of crime.
Thus, I have been actively involved in the cause of crime victims for the
past 17 years.
                                   868

        I have served in the following capacities:
            - Member, President Reagan's Task Force on Victims of Crime.
            - Master, Attorney General's Task Force on Violent Crime.
            - Member, and Vice Chairman, Advisory Board, National Institute of
               Justice, United States Department of Justice.
            - Member, Vice Chairperson and Chairperson, Victims Committee,
               Criminal Justice Section, American Bar Association.
            - Former Member, Board of Directors, National Organization for
               Victim Assistance.
           - Assistant Director for Criminal Justice Pblicy Coordination,
               Reagan/Bush Transition Team (1980-81).
           - Member, National Law Enforcement Council. (1980-Current).
           - Consultant on Victims Issues, National Judicial College, Reno,
               Nevada (1983).

        I have authored, or co-authored, two books on the rights of crime
victims; 1 eve book documenting the case for capital punishment, ^ and one
book on evidence law for the police. I have written four law review articles
and a number of articles for professional journals on victims, ^ and
criminal justice issues, particularly on the exclusionary rule.5

        I have spoken, as a guest lecturer on criminal justice and crime
victims issues at, inter alia, the University of Michigan Law School, the
University of Richmond Law School, the National College of District Attorneys
at the University of Houston Law School, Suffolk University Law School and
the FBI National Academy at Quantico, Virginia.

                                                                                                      -3-

        I am currently Legal Consultant and Director of the Crime Victims
Litigation Project of the Sunny von Bulow National Victim Advocacy Center,
Fort Worth, Texas,6 and Executive Director of the Victims Assistance
Legal Organization, Virginia Beach, Virginia.

        The plight of crime victims in this country is a constant, pervasive
problem that should be addressed at the highest policy-making levels every
time that a national issue which is relevant to the rights and needs of
victims of crime comes to the fore. The instant proceedings: Hearings on
the nomination of Judge Kennedy for confirmation as associate Justice of
the Supreme Court, is clearly such an issue.

        It belabors the obvious to state that, if we did not have crime, we
would not have victims, and, as a consequence, we would not need a criminal
justice system. Unfortunately, the converse is true: we do have crime;
we do have victims; hence, the record and views of a Supreme Court nominee
on criminal justice issues becomes, a fortiori, an issue of major concern
to the victims of crime, and to those who represent them.

        The current situation of the "victims of crime", which term includes
a! 1 of us, actual or potential victims, was described in the Final Report
of the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime:

             Something iesidious has happened in America: Crime has made
        victims of us all. Awareness of the danger affects the way we
        think, where we live, where we go, what we buy, how we raise our
        children, and the quality of life as we age. The specter of vio-
        lent crime and the knowledge that, without warning, any person
        can be attacked or crippled, robbed, or killed lurks at the fringes
        of consciousness. Every citizen of this country is more impov-
        erished, less free, more fearful and less safe because of the
        ever-present threat of the criminal. Rather than altering a
         system that has proved itself incapable of dealing with crime,
         society has altered itself.''
                       870

        Indeed, even Justices of the Supreme Court, to which Judge Kennedy

has been nominated, have commented on the victims' perspective in criminal

justice issues. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for himself, Chief Justice

Rehnquist, Justice White and Justice O'Connor, in his dissenting opinion

                                                              Q

in Booth v. Maryland, stated:

Recent years have seen an outpouring of popular concern for

what has come to be known as "victims rights" - a phrase that

describes what its proponents feel is the failure of courts of

justice to take into account in their sentencing decisions not

only the factors mitigating the defendant's guilt, but also the

amount of harm he has caused to innocent members of society.

(Emphasis supplied.)'  ' ~ --  --

        Justice Scalia was speaking in the context of criminal sentencing;
however, from the perspective of the actual and potential victijns of crime,
I submit that he could have been speaking about most of the other important
criminal justice issues confronting this country today; and the same "out-
pouring of public concern" would be applicable to all of them.

        The foregoing statement by Justice Scalia was in a dissenting opinion.
Earlier on, however, in a majority opinion, the Supreme Court stated
specifically that: "in the administration of criminal justice, courts may
not ignore the concerns of victims.''10

        With all of this in mind, I will address the rest of my testimony to
the issue of whether Judge Kennedy, upon being elevated to the Supreme Court,
would continue this laudable (and long overdue) concern for the victims of
crime. From a reading of the cases in which he wrote the opinion, or
participated, while on the united States Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit, it is my firm conviction that Judge Kennedy would reflect the same
                                  871

concerns. Judge Kennedy's opinions on criminal justice issues, which are,
of necessity, of primary concern to crime victims, supports this assertion.

        I will not engage in a lengthy rehash of all of .Judge Kennedy's cases
on criminal justice issues; to do so would be redundant. This Committee
has studied them, can, and probably will, question Judge Kennedy about such
opinions, his judicial philosophy, and so on. Accordingly, I will only note
briefly his important cases as they may be perceived from the point of
view of the victims of crime.

        Or. issues of primary concern to crime victims, Judge Kennedy has taken
a forthright position that a balance must be struck between the rights of
victims and the rights of accused and convicted criminals. Such issues
include: 1) The Exclusionary Rule11; 2) Capital Punishment^; 3) Drug
Smuggling ; 4) Homicide , 5) Organized Pornography^; and, 6) Drunk
Driving^.

        Mr. Chairman, it is difficult to purport to speak for an amorphous
clientele such as victims of crime; however, I am sincerely convinced,
based on having represented and consulted with hundreds, if not thousands,
of crime victims over the past 17 years, that by far the greatest majority
cf such victims would enthusiastically endorse the confirmation of Judge
Anthony M. Kennedy for the position of Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the united States.

        With thanks for such consideration as the ConrcLttee may give to the
information contained herein, I am,

                                                                        Most Respectfully,

                                                                                    arrington

Hi>. en Rodnpot7-Tr                                         INTRODUCTION

     id Sctibner              The Center for Constitutional Rights is opposed to
                      the nomination of Judge Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme
'                   Court. We believe that a justice of the Supreme Court
                      must affirmatively demonstrate a commitment to civil
>. 'cutnr Dirtt lor  rights and civil liberties and not merely be "not as bad
M nhn BnvdM          as Judge Bork." We hope that members of Congress and
n S t .               organizations who opposed Judge Bork insist that the
                      American people have a right to a justice who will truly
    * Cherrv          do justice. Judge Kennedy is not such a nominee.
D a ' vid Cole
r n n l Deale                  Judge Kennedy repeatedly rules against
T e l iv DOench       constitutional and statutory rights asserted by women,
                      homosexuals. Blacks, Latinos, Indians, aliens and
^oinGiw.^             prisoners. His opinions express a strong pro-business,
                      anti-union and anti-employee bias. He favors the death
s*nu Man'TM,           penalty and has watered down the protection against
                       illegal searches and seizures protected by the Fourth
Wrnicc Miller
                      Amendment. He has been criticized for ignoring the
B^fiaMuiiMiTRoia       proper role of an appellate judge and substituting his

VUifatei Rainer        judgment for that of the trial court in order to reach
                       the result he desires. While he may not have espoused a
sl'^Riof*"1"           philosophy as pernicious as that of Judge Bork's, he

iiienwroIhVttk*"1'1

 Dorothv Zellncr
                            875

reaches similar retrograde results.
         In certain areas, such as the First Amendment, he

has not expressed unmitigated hostility toward
litigants' rights. This is true in selected criminal
cases as well. However, these limited exceptions do not
overcome a narrow view of civil and constitutional
rights which does not guarantee justice for all.

                                    WOMEN'S RIGHTS
         Two decisions in the area of women's rights are
particularly striking. In AFSCME v. State of
Washington. 770 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir. 1985) he reversed
 the trial court and held that a class of 15,000
 employees of the State of Washington failed to establish
 a Title VII sex discrimination claim despite
 overwhelming evidence that the women employees were
 receiving lower wages than men for comparable work.
 This was despite the State's admission that such
 discrimination had taken place. Judge Kennedy permitted
 such discrimination because, in his view, it was based
 upon the free market system and the law of supply and
 demand. In other words, if discrimination is rooted in
 the society it is allowable.
          Judge Kennedy concurred in a dissenting opinion in
  Gerdon v. Continental Airlines. 692 F.2d 602 (9th Cir.
  1983) applying a similar analysis to a claim by airline
  flight attendants that strict weight requirements for
  women and not for men were discriminatory. The
                          876

airlines' justification was not safety, but rather that
its passengers preferred being served by attractive
women. Fortunately, the majority refused to accept this
as a legitimate reason and held it discriminatory on its
face. However in another decision, White v. Washington
Public Power Supply Commission. 692 F.2d 1286 (9th Cir.
1982) he ruled, contrary to other courts, that section
1981 of the Civil Rights Act applied only to
discrimination against Blacks and did not protect women.
These decisions reflect actions in his personal life.
Until a short time ago he belonged to the Olympic Club
in San Francisco, a club that permitted no women
members. (He resigned because he knew he was being
considered for the Supreme Court.)

                              GAY AND LESBIAN RIGHTS
         Judge Kennedy, like Judge Bork, authored an opinion
upholding the right of the Navy to discharge personnel
who engaged in homosexual conduct. Beller v.
 Middendorf. 632 F.2d 78 (9th Cir. 190) Rather than
 decide whether such conduct was a fundamental aspect of
 the right to privacy, he accepted the claim of the Navy
 that military necessity justified the dismissal of
 homosexuals. While referring to the Supreme Court
 decisions protecting privacy and the right to abortion,
 notably absent was any affirmation that he affirmed or
 adopted the reasoning of those cases.
          In an earlier case, Singer v. U.S. Civil Service
                           877

Commission. 530 F.2d 247 (9th Cir. 1976). Judge Kennedy
signed on to an opinion which allowed a gay activist to
be dismissed from his government job for being,
according to the Civil Service Commission, "an advocate
for a socially repugnant concept." The Supreme Court
vacated the decision saying an employee cannot be
summarily discharged without some showing that his or
her homosexual conduct is likely to impair the
efficiency of the Civil Service. The Singer reversal
might well explain Kennedy's toned-down language in
Beller v. Hiddendorf. The result is the same --
mandatory dismissal -- but Kennedy reaches for language
 about the "special needs of the military" to justify the
 result.

                               RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
          Decisions in the area of racial discrimination
 demonstrate that Judge Kennedy has no understanding that
 laws protecting racial equality are to be broadly and
 liberally construed. His decision in Topic v. Circle
 Realty. 532 F.2d 1273 (9th Cir. 1976) denied access to
 the courts to a fair housing organization and homeowners
 against a group or realtors involved in racial steering.
 To reach this result he had to bend previous Supreme
 Court decisions and reject the reasoning of a number of
  other courts. Three years later, in an opinion by
 Justice Powell, the Supreme Court by a 7-2 margin
  rejected Judge Kennedy's position. In Spanqler v.
                          878

Pasadena Board of Education. 611 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir.
1979) a school desegregation case, Judge Kennedy
concurred in the result by writing a long opinion which
disregarded important principles of judicial fact-
finding and gave a narrow view of the constitutional
right to attend desegregated schools.

                                     VOTING RIGHTS
         In what could have been a disaster for voting
rights litigation, Judge Kennedy wrote a long
concurrence rejecting a challenge to at-large voting by
Latinos in California, Aranda v. VanSickler 600 F.2d
1267 (9th Cir. 1979) . His analysis not only set forth a
requirement of invidious intent for such challenges to
be heard, but determined facts in a manner that allowed
him to reach the result he desired. This decision
 essentially held up voting rights litigation in the 9th
 Circuit until 1982 when Congress, by legislation,
 overruled the narrow way in which Judge Kennedy and some
 other judges had read the Voting Rights Act.

                                   NATIVE AMERICANS
          Indians, like other minorities, have not fared well
 in cases decided by Judge Kennedy. In Oliphant v.
 Schile. 544 F.2d 1007 (1976), a case challenging the
 right of an Indian tribe to try non-Indians for offenses
 committed on the reservation, Judge Kennedy dissented
 from permitting the tribe such jurisdiction. He labeled
 the idea that Indian tribes had inherent sovereignty to
                         879

try such offenses as novel, and inconsistent with prior
practice. In Blackfeet Tribe of Indians v. State of
Montana. 729 F.2d 1192 (1984), Judge Kennedy joined a
dissent which demonstrated hostility toward the
principle that ambiguities in statutes are to be
resolved in favor of Indians. This is one of the
cardinal principles of Indian law.

         While Judge Kennedy claims to understand that
neither the Immigration and Naturalization Service nor
the Bureau of Indian affairs "inspire confidence", he
 refuses to do very much about their errors. Villena v.
 INS, 622 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1980). His position is
 that review of deportation proceedings should be quite
 narrow, that the courts should give deference to
 administrative proceedings and be primarily concerned
 with rules and procedures and not individual cases.
                          880

                                            IABOR
        His rulings in the labor area are particularly
egregious. His greatest number of dissents are from
decisions enforcing union rights. For example, when
union members lobbied congress to protect their jobs
from foreign competition, a position contrary to that of
the company's, he dissented from a decision upholding an
unfair labor practice against the company for
disciplining the employees. Kaiser Engineers v.
National Labor Relations Board. 538 F.2d 1379 (9th Cir.
1976).

                                         PRISONERS
         In United States v. Goveia. 704 F.2d 1116 (9th Cir.
1983), Judge Kennedy joined a dissent from a ruling
holding that prisoners had a right to counsel when they
had been placed in administrative detention when the
detention was due to a pending investigation or trial.

                                       ENVIRONMENT
         In Libbv Rod and Gun Club v. Poteat. 594 F.2d 742
 (9th Cir. 1979) , the court found that Congress did not
 authorize the building of a dam which would have caused
 environmental damage. Judge Kennedy dissented and found
 that congressional appropriations were sufficient to
 authorize the dam and that a specific authorizing
 statute was not necessary. This ruling has implications
 in other than environmental areas. For example, a
                          881

frequent claim by administrations is that congressional
funding is the equivalent of a declaration of war under
the Constitution. Apparently, Judge Kennedy would agree
with this reasoning.

                            INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CASES
         Judge Kennedy appears to have little compassion for
the individual asserting his or her rights and rarely
favors "the little guy." He often finds technical
grounds for getting rid of such cases.
         In EEOC v. Alioto Fish Co.. Ltd., 623 F.2d 86 (9th
Cir. 1980), he authored an opinion upholding the
dismissal of an employment discrimination case because
the EEOC did not file its law suit until 62 months after
 the employee filed her charges against the employer with
 the EEOC. The fact that the employee had no control
 over an EEOC office that was being gutted by the Reagan
 Administration did not prevent her from being penalized
 because of the EEOC's dereliction of its duties.
          In another case, Koucky v. Department of the Navy.
 820 F.2d 300 (9th Cir. 1987), the Court of Appeals,
 again in an opinion authored by Judge Kennedy, threw
 out a lawsuit against the Department of the Navy by a
 handicapped former naval employee because the lawsuit
 named the "Department of the Navy" as a defendant when
  it should have named the "Secretary of the Navy."
  Furthermore, the Kennedy court would not allow the
  claimant to amend his pleadings, deciding instead to
                           882

adhere to a rigid thirty day time bar. As a result, the
plaintiff was not allowed to litigate his case.

         In yet another civil rights case, a Native American
woman succeeded in winning a $161,000 award in an
employment discrimination case from a trial court.
Apparently convinced that the amount awarded was not
sufficient to cover compensatory and punitive damages,
back pay, and attorney's fees, she appealed to the Court
of Appeals. Focusing entirely on the arguments of the
employer. Kennedy wrote an opinion for the Court
overturning the monetary award and ordering the
plaintiff to try her case anew. Thus, in her quest to
obtain nore justice, the plaintiff was deprived of all
justice. See, White v. Washington Public Power Supply
System. 792 F.2d 1286 (9th Cir. 1982).

         The issue is not whether Judge Kennedy is as bad as
Judge Bork. Rather, it is whether we want a Supreme
 Court and Supreme Court Justice that will build on the
 civil rights and civil liberties gains of the past
 years. We at the Center for Constitutional Rights do.
 We feel that Judge Kennedy will not move us forward; we
 are fearful he will move us backward.

 Dear Senate Judiciary Committee Member,

          The Committee for the Preservation of Civil Rights is an ad
  hoc group of persons interested in the nomination of a Justice to
  the U.S. Supreme Court who will uphold the rule of law, respect
  the development of civil rights that has occurred in recent
  decades in the U.S. courts, and who will not decide cases with a
  slant toward any party. The members of this Committee include
  lawyers, law professors and community leaders who have been active
  in observing the U.S. Supreme Court confirmation process, and who
  believe that the Senate Judiciary Committee inquiry into the
  qualifications of Judge Robert Bork was a precedent-setting and
  worthwhile process, establishing a baseline for qualifications of
  U.S. Supreme Court appointees of any President. While the lessons
  of the Bork rejection should not be oversimplified, we believe
  that, at a minimum, it established that people in the U.S.A. want
  Supreme Court Justices who stand forthrightly in favor of the
  equal protection guarantee for all persons, especially
  historically oppressed groups such as women and minorities, who
  view the First Amendment's guarantees of free speech, association
  and religious exercise generously, and who take a humane and
  compassionate view of their role in dispensing justice.

           We write this letter because we believe that U.S. Supreme
  Court nominee Anthony Kennedy has some serious questions to answer
  about civil rights, the rule of law and the role of the courts in
  its preservation and advancement. We hope and intend that the
  questions and problems that we raise in this letter will be taken
  up in the hearings of the Committee as to Judge Kennedy's
  qualifications for Supreme Court appointment, which we understand
  are scheduled to commence on Monday, December 14, 1987.

           We also note that, although there has been widespread
  comparing of Judge Kennedy with Judge Bork, and a pervasive effort
  to short-circuit full inquiry into Judge Kennedy's qualifications
  because he is "better than Bork", we believe this is a false
  issue. Judge Bork is no longer in the Supreme Court picture, and
  the task currently facing the people and elected representatives
  of this nation is to determine whether Judge Kennedy should sit on
  the Supreme Court, in his own right and based upon his own
  qualifications, neither benefited nor prejudiced by the nation's
  particular experience with the rejected nominee, Robert Bork.

        The Committee for the Preservation of Civil Rights believes
that Judge Kennedy has a record of judicial decisions, speeches
and personal actions that raises serious questions about Judge
Kennedy's ideological patterning in making decisions as a ^udge,
his capacity to impartially hear all sides of the cases presented
to him, and his real and operative beliefs as to the function of
the courts and the meaning of the rule of law in deciding
important questions about civil rights. We have prepared this
letter to raise some of those questions, and to provide
information to those who have inquired about our views of Judge
Kennedy as a U.S. Supreme Court nominee, and about our opinion of
the process by which his qualifications should be scrutinized by
the U.S. Senate.

                                  INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION

         Judge Kennedy frequently has ruled in favor of allegedly
discriminating entities and persons, often reasoning that the
discrimination proved was not intentional, or not obvious enough,
or not shown to be based in malice; he shows extreme deference to
the status quo, where that status quo operates to discriminate
against women and minorities. See, for example, his decisions in
AFSCME v. Washington, 770 F.2d 1401 (1985) ("Neither law nor logic
deems the free market system a suspect enterprise", where the
"free" market pays women less than men for work of equal value);
Gerdom v. Continental Airlines, 692 F.2d 602 (1982) (in dissent,
Kennedy would permit airline to impose female-only personal
appearance requirements to satisfy purported "customer
preferences"); White v. Washington Public Power Supply System, 692
F.2d 1286 (1982) (Kennedy offered dictum as to the failure of
plaintiff American Indian to prove a "policy" of discrimination by
employer); Aranda y. Van Sickle, 600 F.2d 1267 (1979) (where
voting system results in demonstrable dilution of the value of
Mexican-American votes, restructuring it nonetheless would be an
"extreme" remedy).

         Judge Kennedy was a member of the Olympic Club until October,
1987, when he resigned, in his own words, to "prevent
 [his]...membership from becoming an issue" in the Supreme Court
confirmation process. He wrote in his application for federal
judgeship this year that the Olympic club exclusionary practices
were not the result of "ill-will", but might cause "real harm"
anyway. Judge Kennedy selected 35 law clerks from 1975-1987 to
work with him; none were black, Hispanic or Native American, while
1 was Asian, and 5 were females.

         The theme of Judge Kennedy's decisions and actions is that
discrimination that does not originate from provable malice is
 somehow less legally actionable and less harmful than the kind of
discrimination that wears an ugly face. Judge Kennedy should be
 searchingly questioned about whether the laws he is interpreting
 require the sort of malicious motivation he seems to be
 requiring. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act is supposed to
prohibit employment practices that discriminate in effect, as well

                                                                                               -3-

as those that discriminate in intent. Griggs v. Duke Power Co. ,
401 U.S. 424, 430-432 (1971), a unanimous decision by Chief
Justice Burger, established this rule. In his decisions and
personal actions about discrimination, is Judge Kennedy following
this rule, or applying his own narrower version? Why does Judge
Kennedy think "ill will" Is Important In the policy of the Olympic
Club? If the Club's policy was offensive to him, harmful to women
and minorities, and possibly unlawful, why did he not resign
regardless of his possible Supreme Court appointment?

                      THE RULE OF LAW AND ACCESS TO THE COURTS

         Judge Kennedy has spoken in favor of the idea that the
Constitution should be restricted to the intent of its framers,
and against the use of courts to resolve "political" questions.
 (Speech excerpted in NY_ Times p. 13, 12/1/87.) One outcome of such
views is to limit access of "new" (ie. more modern than the
founders' ideas and experiences of 200 years ago) claims by
oppressed groups. Judge Kennedy himself has written opinions
 limiting ting such claims. See, for example, his opinions in
Ostrofe v. H.S. Crocker Co., Inc., 740 F.2d 739 (1984)(Kennedy
dissents from h Jirig that employee had standing to sue under
Clayton Act when di%ohp"ged and boycotted for refusal to
participate in bid rigging scheme; Kennedy would limit standing to
 consumers cr competitors, stating that "the antitrust laws were
not intendei a.3 a balm for all wrongdoing in the business
 community'0, in Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, 611
F.2d 1239 (1979) (in lengthy concurrence, Kennedy rejected
 standing of group to complain of school resegregation effort, and
 found "there has been no showing of noncompliance", 611 F.2d at
 1243, omitting thirteen instances of noncompliance that were found
 by trial court), and in TOPIC v. Circle Realty, 532 F.2d 1273
 (1976), rejecting the right of black and white famillies together
 to go to court to challenge racial discrimination by realtors. It
 is noted that Judge Kennedy's opinion in TOPIC was severely
 criticized by Justice Powell and others in Gladstone Realtors v.
 Village of Bellwood (1979), for its lack of authority and its
 defiance of Supreme Court decisions.

          The fixed rule of appellate review of lower court decisions
 establishes that a trial court's finding of fact will not be
 reversed unless clearly erroneous. Yet Judge Kennedy reached out
 to reverse a judgment in favor of a female police officer who had
 proved discrimination by a preponderance of evidence below,
 despite the absence of any clear error; he invited and encouraged
 the defendant city to prove it would not have hired her anyway.
 Fadhl v. City of San Francisco, 741 F.2d 1163 (1984). This
 decision does not harmonize well with the rule of law as to when
 appellate courts are supposed to reverse trial courts.
 Is Judge Kennedy willing to undercut the standing and access to
 courts of minority groups, in the name of avoiding "political" "
 questions and conforming to "original intent"? Is the rule of"law
 a one-way proposition to him, such that where other courts'
 rulings displease him he will simply reject them?
                                     886

                                 FREEDOM OF SPEECH FOR WHOM?

        While Judge Kennedy has upheld the First Amendment's
guarantees of free speech and free press in several cases, such as
his rejection of the blatant effort to ban airing of a TV program
containing clearly protected expression, Goldblum v. NBC, 584 F.2d
904 (1978), he has not protected free speech in a number of less
traditional or less obvious cases. See, for example, his
dissenting opinion in Lynn y. Sheet Metal Workers International
Association, 804 F.2d 1472 (1986), where he would have upheld a
discharge of a union official whom Kennedy agreed was being
"penalize[d]...for his exercise of protected rights", because
Kennedy would distinguish penalizing a union official from
penalizing a union member, in terms of the danger to "continued
democratic governance" of the union of such penalties, and see
his opinion upholding a suspension of a public employee for
commenting on a matter after being told not to do so by the
employer. Kotwica v. City of Tucson, 801 F.2d 1182 (1986).

         Such decisions by Judge Kennedy raise the question: For whom
will the benefits of the First Amendment flow under Judge
Kennedy's interpretation of the Constitution at the Supreme Court
level? Does Judge Kennedy fully appreciate the cost to employees
of being disciplined and terminated for engaging in free speech?

                                     COMPASSIONATE JUSTICE?

         Along with the pattern of rulings against women and racial
minorities identified above, Judge Kennedy has ruled consistently
against the assertions of right of other severely oppressed
minority groups. See, for example, his decisions and votes in gay
rights cases: Sullivan v. INS, 772 F.2d 609 (1986)(upholding
deportation of gay Australian who proved that he would be outcast
and defiled if sent to Australia); Beller v. Middendorf, 632 F.2d
788 (1980)(authorizing Navy to discharge gay and lesbian members
per se, without regard to their service records, in part because
of military service people who 'despise/detest homosexuality' and
resulting hostility toward homosexuality in military service, 632 .
F. 2d at 811); Singer v. U.S. Civil Service Commission, 530 F.2d
247 (1978), vacated, 429 U.S. 1034 (1977)(Kennedy joined opinion
permitting discharge of EEOC employee for being gay and for
protected free speech, despite Civil Service Commission rule
banning such discharges). The harsh real-life results of these
types of decisions for whole classes of human beings are not
mitigated by the politeness of Judge Kennedy's language in
stripping them of rights.

         We expect that some of the most important civil and
constitutional rights questions of the next decades may concern
 the rights of other oppressed groups, such as gay people, disabled
people, impoverished people. Along with the survival of
affirmative action and procreative choice, Judge Kennedy may well

                                                                               -5-

be called upon to deciie, for Instances, about the
constitutionality of AIDS quarantine, about the legality of
municipal transportation systems that provide no access to
disabled persons, and about the constitutional implications of
sexuallly explicit speech in public school education programs
designed to curb child abuse. Is Judge Kennedy going to decide
these cases with an ideological slant toward "conservative" views
of the minorities involved in such cases, so that historical and
continuing discrimination against these groups is immunized
against Supreme Court review? What will Judge Kennedy, who has a
record of ruling against claimants of discrimination in many cases
today, oe most likely to~do with the civil rights questions of
Tomorrow?

                                                 CONCLUSIONS

         In light of the serious questions that Judge Kennedy's record
raises, the Committee for the Preservation of Civil Rights
recommends as follows:

1. The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing as to Judge
Kennedy's qualifications should be as searching and as open as
possible. The high standards for inquiry set in the Bork hearing
should not be lowered in favor of a quick appointment of Judge
Kennedy to the Supreme Court.

2. The particular questions raised by Judge Kennedy's decisions,
such as those articulated in this statement, should be asked by
the Senate Judiciary Committee. The people of this nation are
entitled to have Judge Kennedy be examined as closely and
carefully on his views, and on his apparent ideological slant
toward government and against claimants of discrimination, as
Judge Bork was examined.

3. Public views of Judge Kennedy's qualifications should be
 solicited from the millions of persons who have, by their
correspondence with the Senate, shown an interest in the filling
of this Supreme Court vacancy by a just nominee. Senators should
 be encouraged to hear from their constituents about this nominee,
and the public should be provided with the information and time
 necessary to make its views known.

         From the information currently available, the Committee for
 the Preservation of Civil Rights has profound reservations about
 the nomination of Anthony Kennedy to the U.S. Supreme Court. We
 request and hope that the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee will
 take these reservations fully into account, and that it will
 conduct the sort of meaningful inquiry into the background,
 qualifications and relevant attitudes of this nominee, Judge
 Anthony Kennedy, that the people of this nation deserve.

Senator Joseph Biden
United States Senate
Washington, D.C.

         It is an honor and a pleasure to write to you. I appreciate
your leadership in the senate and on the judiciary committee. Your
dedication and effectiveness is invaluable.

         In the present hearings to confirm Judge Kennedy as a Supreme
Court Justice a serious question has been raised a sufficient number
of times as to become a central issue in the matter. This question
raised by witness after witness, and by some of the committee mem-
bers as well, covers the apparent discrepancy between the Judge's
actual record of case findings and his verbal sentiments expressed
in his testimony in the current hearings.

         This central question as this: with respect to the historically
necessary, bitterly fought for, and ultimately agreed upen advances
in the elevation, promotion and protection of equal rights of those
classes of people, which had been traditionally and institutionally
oppressed with prejudice and discrimination; how does Judge Kennedy's
present verbal responses of assurance of moderation and sensitivity,
to the challenges of the committee membersystand up to his record
of action as an appelate judge which indicates, at best, impervious-
ness to such advances;effectively obstructing, retarding or rejecting
such critical social gains of the pa^t twenty-five years; gains
which not only redresses past injustices, but also, in reality,
promotes, in general, social harmony, and thus prevents the otherwise
kind of civil strife that we ha"e seen to rip and wound America'?
society and inherent strength.

         Hastily, I add that Judge Kennedy's recaord does indicate
awai*eness, compassion and advocacy when a given case concerned
the narrower issue of ldividual interests and where there were
clear procedural errors and/or violations. But almost every
case where there was at issue the interests of a class ofpeople,
as ]n the "San Fernando" case and the cases of the rights of privacy
for women, the Judge's finding were obstructive, or at the least
lmpeeding, to those interests and concerns. Witness after witness
on both the panels of neutrality and against vis a vis confirmation
with often eloquent, moving and persuasive arguments and testimony,
raised these crucial points.

         Which criteria, the Judge's verbal sentiments or his record of
                                   890

action, is to be considered having the greater weight in the
committee's deliberations as to whether the health, safety and
enhancement of our social fabric is to be entrusted to the hands,,
mind and heart of Judge Kennedy? One of the members of the
neutral witness panel commented that one of the great difficulties
facing most of us in society is the "encultration" and socializa-
tionencountered while growing up in our different social groups and
classes. I believe you were impressed by this comment as one of the
gems of the entire hearings.

         In short, the grej&fe concern in the deliberations for confirma-
tion on the part of the committee members and those classes of
people (the which being women and "minorties" might well number
150 million, a full three-fifths of our population) is: how will
Judge Kennedy perform as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court
and as the swing vote on the Court in these great nationally
impactful issues; Will there continue to be the advancement of
social harmony and progress 01 will there be a return to tragic
and costly civil strife and enormous pain to countless individuals?

         It is clear to me that these are not only questions of law,
but of conscience, morality and historic awareness and responsibility;
questions of underlying processes of reasoning and behavior. It
may be that the committee's efforts can be assisted by the testimony
of expertise in "enculturation" and behavioral patterns of indi-
viduals, groups and social stuctures in the social interactions.
Such testimony make be of valuable contribution to the committee
in its considerations of the complicated factors involved : n this
historic matter.

         Briefly, for example, patterns of behavior and reasoning are
generally predictable once a person has been enculturated and social-
ized. These dynamics interact with the person's intrinsic unique-
ness during the maturation and formative years. The person's
patterns of perception, intellectual processes and reasoning (quite
apart form one's quality of intellect), of moral perpective and
emotional reactance shape one's ultimate assumptions, general perspect-
ives, awarenesses and limitations of awarenesses and, finally,
resultant decisions,actions and behaviors. One's past actions
then become predictive of on ' e,'present and future actions and tend-
encles.

         Of course, the patterns o f individuals and even groups, can be
changed and influenced by great events, by serious and consis ten t
education, by crucial positive pressure and influence, by critical
existential priorities. Presid ent Nixon opened China to the wes t,
President Reagan - Scourge of the Soviet par ecellence , recently
signed the IBM with U.S.S.R. nd visibly softened his attitude
towards its present leader. . But elected officials are vastly more
susceptible, and immediately so, to public and world p ressure
and to the heart-cry of their constituencies. Elected officials have
far less time to respond to th eir own internal compuls ions of making
their personal mark and contributions to the public record. Thus,
elected officials are far more immediately instructed and conditioned
by the demands, expectations, sensitivities and expedi encief of their
respective offices.
891

         Supreme Court Justices, on the other hand, are by design
protected and immunized from the political pressures of society, and
only over great time and indirectly may such pressures influence
justices to varying degrees. Once ensconced, a Justice has life-time
tenure, free from constituency demand and obligation. Thus, meaningful
change in a Justice's viewpoint and reasoning processes may be
affected only indirectly and by subtle influences over slow moving
time .

         Of course, the interactions between the Justices themselves,
over time, can influence such changes. By the same token the patterns
of the individual Justices , as in any group, act to reinforce like
patterns, giving increased credibility, legitimacy and rigidity
to them. The greater number of like "minded" patterns the greater
and more entrenched do the patterns of each member becomes. Thus,
strong prediction, based on such factors, of general tendency
of an individuals's future performance may be made.

As a professional therapist, teacher, workshop and seminar

facilitator in just such dynamics of human conduct, reasoning and

behavior, over the last sixteen years, with all humility, I submit

this testimony, and to both the priviledge and duty to appear

before you as a witness before your  committee for its deeper

guestioning and probing. The momentout. and pivotal historic matter

at hand and the decision thereof which confronts the (fortunately)

capable and dsJicated members of your committee, require any Amer-

can with any pertinent expertise to do no less than to offer his/her

assistance to the service of the committee.

         There can be no minimizing the awesome historic and social
responsibility facing, first, the members of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, and then all Americans, actually. I am delighted to say
that the front line trench, manned by the members of your committee,
is in the hands of caring and nonorable servants of the people.
As one who is passionately in love with the American people and
principles (a model to the world) I can do no less chan to offer
my heart and learning for whatever service and value you may find
in them.

         Should circumstances prevent any more than off ering this letter

to the public record, and for your consideration, I must dutifully

state that based on all my learning and experience, bsaed on much
research and study on the part of multitudinous oth er behavior
and human processes researchers, Judge Kennedy's fu ture performance,
on or off,the Supreme Court, will tend strongly to follow the record
of his past performance, that is, to favorably advocate when possible,
for individual and narrow interests, and tc block or retard mamte-
nance and/or progress of the gains in civil and leg al rights of
women, minorities and of the poor; the just and his torically lmpera-
tive and unavoidable social progress critically nee essary for the
healthy survival of the fabric and framework of the American society
which we all cherish.

        This testimony on the nomination of Anthony M. Kennedy
is submitted on behalf of the Federation of Women Lawyers'
Judicial Screening Panel, a nationwide network of women
attorneys and law professors which, since 1979, has been
investigating and evaluating nominees to the federal judi-
ciary on the basis of their demonstrated commitment to equal
justice; and on behalf of the Women's Legal Defense Fund and
Equal Rights Advocates, civil rights organizations engaged in
litigation, public education and counseling with the goal of
securing equal rights for women. These groups share a deep
concern that the federal judiciary, and particularly the
Supreme Court, remain as the guarantor of constitutional
rights in the struggle for equal justice under law.

        With the confirmation hearings of Robert Bork, the
Senate Judiciary Committee set an exemplary standard, esta-
blishing the Senate as an equal partner in the confirmation
of federal judges and giving vitality to the process of
fulfilling its constitutional duty to advise and consent.
The arduous but intellectually rigorous hearings established
beyond any doubt a broad national consensus that the Supreme
Court properly plays a vital role in protecting the rights
and liberties of all of us, and that any aspiring Justice of
the Court must show a commitment to maintaining that special
role. It is in that spirit that we submit these comments on
the nomination of Anthony M. Kennedy.
                                 894

        Our deep concerns about Judge Kennedy's qualifications
for the Supreme Court are centered upon the question of
whether he has demonstrated a commitment to equal justice,
either in his role as a judge or in other facets of his life.
In particular, two distinct aspects of Judge Kennedy's
record give rise to our doubts about his commitment to equal
justice, and we shall explore each of them briefly.

I. Judge Kennedy's Judicial Record
         In his twelve years on the bench, Judge Kennedy has

decided numerous cases involving the civil rights of minori-
ties and women. Overwhelmingly, he has rejected their claims
-- often blocking access to the court house itself, by
denying that they have standing to sue. Of course, there
will be times in the careers of federal judges when they are
constrained by the law from ruling as their hearts might dic-
tate. However, the consistency with which Judge Kennedy
rules against these claims, and the unduly technical grounds
on which he does so, must give us pause when scrutinizing his
judicial record.

         His decisions in the area of sex discrimination in
employment seem to fly in the face of well-established
Supreme Court precedent. These cases involve "facial" sex
discrimination policies, pursuant to which women and men were
admittedly treated differently. While the Supreme Court has
consistently held that such policies are discriminatory under
                                   895

Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Judge Kennedy does
not recognize this. Instead, he seems to go out of his way
to find an excuse for the discriminatory policy, or a flaw in
the plaintiff's case.

         For example, in Gerdom v. Continental Airlines, 692 F.2d
602 (9th Cir. 1982), the airline imposed a maximum weight
requirement for its "flight hostesses," while men with simi-
lar duties had no such constraint. The majority of the
en bane panel held that the hostesses suspended or terminated
because of the weight restriction had obviously suffered
unlawful sex discrimination, and the Court granted them
summary judgment. Judge Kennedy, however, joined a remarkable
dissent, which reasoned that the airline's justification for
its facially discriminatory policy -- customer preference for
thin and attractive women -- created a disput.ed issue of fact
which required a trial on the merits.

         In a similar vein, Judge Kennedy reversed and remanded
White v. Washington Public Power Supply System, 692 F.2d 1256
(9th Cir. 1982), where there were admissions that the plain-
tiff, a Native American woman, was discriminated against in
hiring and promotion on the basis of her sex, as well as
ether strong statistical and factual evidence of bias. Finding

  that the trial court had incorrectly allocated the burden of
proof, Judge Kennedy remanded the case, despite the over-
whelming evidence of sex-based discrimination which clearly
would have sustained plaintiff's burden, even as corrected.
                                  896

The opinion totally failed to consider the supervisor's
admission that he wanted a man for the job. See also Fadhl v,
Police Department, 741 F.2d 1163 (9th Cir. 1984), where the
compelling evidence of gender discrimination included state-
ments by Fadhl's superviors that she was "too much like a
woman," and "very ladylike," which "may cause problems."
Nevertheless, Judge Kennedy reversed and remanded the Title
VII judgment and award, ostensibly because of a minor factual

                                            1/
error by the trial court.

         In perhaps the most famous of Judge Kennedy's sex dis-
crimination opinions, AFSCME v. State of Washington, 770 F.2d
1401 (9th Cir. 1985), he sounds another theme which seems to
pervade his attitude toward civil rights litigation: his
self-imposed requirement of discriminatory intent or ill
will. AFSCME, the "comparable worth" case, presented an
historical pattern of gender-based job segregation and resul-
tant wage discrimination. Nonetheless, Judge Kennedy
required, inter alia, a "discriminatory motive" before he
would find a Title VII violation. His stringent intent
requirement is not grounded in Supreme Court precedent; on
the contrary, if it were applied, it would effectively
vitiate many landmark Supreme Court cases articulating the

                                   897

proper standards for adjudicating sex discrimination claims.
This is because classifications which distinguish on the
basis of gender are usually enacted for reasons of
administrative conveaience or tha protection of women, rarely
out of malice or a desire to stigmatize women.

         Even in cases of racial discrimination, where there is
no pretense of "benefiting" the injured class, many claims
fail to meet Judge Kennedy's intent test. For example, in
both Aranda v. Van Sickle, 600 F.2d 1267 (9th Cir. 1979), and
Spangler v. Pasadena Board of Education, 611 F.2d 1239
(1979), he concurred in the panel's judgment, finding that
the defendants did not intend to discriminate. In Aranda, an
at-large city council districting plan utilized numerous
devices, including the location of polling places in the
homes of white voters, which predictably discouraged
Hispanics from voting and had produced only three Hispanic,
electoral victories in over 50 years. In Spangler, recently-
elected members of the Pasadena .school board, which had been
cited for non-complaince with a court-ordered desegregation
plan on 13 occasions, expressed their intent to revoke the
plan when the court terminated its jurisdiction and thereby

allow the school population to reflect the (segregated) resi-
                                             2/

dential housing patterns. Even assuming arguendo that the

     Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund

 (December 16, 1987), for a detailed analysis of these cases.
                                898

law required a finding of intent to discriminate before
granting the claims of civil rights plaintiffs in such cases,
the intent was evident from the extensive factual records
presented in these cases. However, as stated above, no such
requirement is imposed by the law. Judge Kennedy's crabbed
view of the remedial scope of the civil rights statutes is
deeply troubling to all of us who depend upon the Supreme
Court to vindicate the rights of women and minorities.

        During his confirmation hearings, Judge Kennedy
repeatedly attempted to reassure members of the Judiciary
Committee that he would respect Supreme Court precedent on
civil rights issues. We submit that his pledge to follow
precedent is not enough; Judge Kennedy must commit himself to
interpreting the civil rights laws generously. His past
record provides little concrete evidence of his inclination
to do so.

II. Judge Kennedy's Club Memberships
         Perhaps even more revealing of Judge Kennedy's tenuous

commitment to equal justice is his longstanding membership,
terminated just recently, in several discriminatory private
clubs. We say "more revealing" because, while a federal
appeals court judge's decisions are to some extent circum-
scribed by principles of law and precedent, his association
with such clubs is a matter of complete freedom of choice.
In Judge Kennedy's case, his membership in these clubs and
                                   899

his acquiescence in their policies are evidence of extreme
insensitivity to the rights of women and minorities. Judge
Kennedy joined the clubs while still a young man and long

                                                                              3/
before his appointment to the federal bench. However, he
retained his membership in two of them, the Olympic Club and
the Del Paso Country Club, until the eve of his nomination to
the Supreme Court. Whatever motivated his eleventh-hour
resignations, he continued to belong to these organizations
during an extended period when controversy swirled around the
issue of private clubs.

         Most importantly, the rules of the United States
Judicial Conference (adopted in 1981) and the American Bar
Association's Code of Judicial Conduct (adopted in 1984) made
it clear that a federal judge's membership in clubs which
invidiously discriminate was inappropriate. Unfortunately,
the meaning of the term "invidious discrimination" is not
defined in these documents, and its vagueness has been an
oft-cited loophole, particularly for those who claim that
male-only membership policies are, by definition, not invi-
dious. Judge Kennedy suggested that he subscribed to this
view, when, in answer to the Senate Judiciary Committee's
questionnaire, he stated that his clubs did not invidiously
discriminate because invidious discrimination is "intended

      memberships, please refer to the attached Appendix A,

                                                                          4/
to impose a stigma" on the excluded group. (However, he
also admitted in the same questionnaire that he was not
involved in the decision to limit membership and was there-
fore not competent to articulate the reasons for it. See
pp. 47-49.)

        Judge Kennedy's answers to Senator Kennedy's questions
at his confirmation hearings cloud the issue further. First,
he reiterated the position articulated in his questionnaire:
"In my view, none of these clubs practiced invidious discri-
mination." (Transcript of Proceedings, December 14, 1987,
p. 140) However, he subsequently admitted, as to the Sutter
Club, where everyone knew that he was a federal judge, "that
it was inappropriate for me to belong" (Tr., December 14, p.
142), and he resigned in 1980. Thus, he indicates some
sensitivity to the appearance of bias at that time -- but not
enough.

         In an apparent attempt to justify his continued member-
ship in the Olympic Club, wheie he was more anonymous, he
cited a California "rule" requiring "judges [to] remain in
those clubs and attempt to change their policies and resign

4/ Questionnaire, p. 50. One is reminded of Judge
     Kennedy's recurrent imposition of an intent re-
     quirement on the law in cases of discrimination on
     the basis of race or sex. This pattern reflects a
     fundamental misunderstanding of the realities of sex
     discrimination, in particular, which, more often than
     not, stems from outmoded notions of chivalry and
     protectionism rather than hostility or ill-will.

only when it becomes clear that those attempts are
unavailing." (Tr., December 14, p. 143) The origins of this
"rule" are unclear. The only California rule we have
discovered on the subject was promulgated in 1986 and is
similar to, though stronger than, the ABA Code of Judicial

                                                                                5/
Conduct in prohibiting such club memberships. Furthermore,
there is no record of Judge Kennedy's "attempts" to change
the Olympic Club's policies until August of 1987, twelve
years after his appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit!

         We are somewhat heartened by Judge Kennedy's belated
acknowledgment that discrimination can be invidious even
without ill-will or hostility:

           [I]t is clear to me that if a discriminatory
           barrier exists for too long, if it is visible, if
           it is hurtful, and if it is condoned, that the
           person who condones it can be charged with invi-
           dious discrimination. I would concede that.
           (Tr., December 15, p. 118)

         We fervently hope that Judge Kennedy's words signal a
new commitment to sensitivity on his part. However, it must
be said that he sat for twelve years, adjudicating
-- and usually rejecting -- the claims of American citizens
that they had been denied their rights because of sex or race
discrimination, while he remained a member of two

      Conduct is attached as Appendix B.
                                   902

organizations practicing flagrant sex and/or race discri-
mination. Surely we must question whether Judge Kennedy has
the requisite understanding of the meaning of discrimination
for a Supreme Court Justice.

Ill. Conclusion
        Finally, in reviewing the record of Judge Kennedy and

his confirmation hearings, we are struck by just how little
we know about his views on many of the great issues of our
recent past, issues which are destined to come before the
Supreme Court again in the near future. It is not too late
to require Judge Kennedy to clarify his views on the
law of discrimination, for example, and whether he is
indeed committed to equal justice under law. His approach to
Roe v. Wade, stated in answer to a question by Senator Heflin
(Tr., December 14, p. 211), is even more opaque. Rather than
articulating his views on the right to abortion or its basis
in the Constitution, he chose instead to focus upon stare
decisis, and particularly its limited applicability to con-
stitutional litigation. His response to this legitimate line
of inquiry truly raises more questions than it answers.

         We are left with serious concerns about Judge Kennedy's
commitment to equal justice. Despite all of his recent
verbal promises, the long history of his actions speak far
louder than his comforting words. Our profound doubts cannot
simply be assuaged by more abstractions. We must receive

                                                    10

genuine assurances that Judge Kennedy understands the vital
role of the Supreme Court in guaranteeing our civil rights
and liberties and that he will vigorously and aggressively
enforce our rights under the law. The stakes are too nigh
for the American people to be satisfied with anything less.

1962            Kennedy joins Olympic Club. (Bylaws
1963            restrict membership to "white males.")

Dec. 10, 1963   Kennedy becomes "full member" of Del Paso
Feb. 23, 1967   Country Club (had been a junior member
Jan., 1968      since 1958). Though not a written policy,
March , 1975    Del Paso has no black and few women members.

                Senator Strom Thurmond writes letter to
                judicial nominee from Sixth Circuit on
                behalf of Senate Judiciary Committee,
                stating that " ... it is inadvisable for a
                nominee ... to belong to a social club
                that engages in invidious discrimination."

                U.S. Judicial Conference adopts principle
                "that it is inappropriate for a judge to
                hold membership in an organization which
                practices invidious discrimination." Subse-
                quently asks ABA Ethics Committee opinion
                on the matter. (Judge Kennedy was a
                member of the committee which recommended
                adoption of this principle by the Judicial
                Conference.)

                Jaycees to admit woven members.

                ABA Commentary adopted by Rouse of
                Delegates:

                It is inappropriate for a judge to hold
                membership in aay organisation that prac-
                tices invidious discrimination on the
                basis of race, sex, religion or national
                origin. Membership of a judge in an
                organization that practices invidious dis-
                crimination may give rise to perceptions
                by minorities, women, aad others, that the
                judge's impartiality is impaired. Whether
                an organization practices invidious dis-
                crimination is often a complex question to
                which judges should be sensitive. The
                answer cannot be determined from a mere
                examination of an organization's current
                membership rolls but rather depends on the
                history of the organization's selection of
                members and other relevant factors. Ulti-
                mately, each judge must determine in the
                judge's own conscience whether an organi-
                zation of which the judge is a member
                practices invidious discrimination.

                With extensive press coverage, California
                amends its Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon
                2 to state:

                It is inappropriate for a judge to hold
                membership in an organization, excluding
                religious organizations, that practices
                invidious discrimination on the basis of
                race, sex, religion or national origin.

                U.S. Supreme Court decides Rotary Club
                case. Justice Powell writes the opinion

                women from membership.

        TEXT OF AMENDMENT TO CANON 2
    CAUFORNIA CODE OF JUDICIAL CONDUCT

        (Adopted September IS, 1986)

      "It is inappropriate for a judge to hold
membership in any organization, excluding
religious organizations, that practices invidious
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion
or national origin."

California Commentary

      "Membership in an organization that practices
invidious discrimination may give rise to
perceptions by minorities, women and others, that
the judge's impartiality is impaired. Whether an
organization practices invidious discrimination is
often a complex question to which judges should
be sensitive. The answer cannot be determined
from a mere examination of an organization's
current membership rolls, but rather depends on
the history of the organization's selection of
members and other relevant factors."

        In considering the nominee's judicial philosophy, close
scrutiny must be given to his view of precedent and the role
played by stare decisis in the deliberations of the Supreme
Court. Nothing in Judge Kennedy's Ninth Circuit opinions
or his pronouncements outside the court gives any indication of
how he views the role of a Supreme Court Justice. Judge
Kennedy's judicial philosophy cannot be fully ascertained by
studying his cases, numerous as they may be, because as a lower
court judge, he is bound to adhere to precedents set by the
Supreme Court.

        While we have not completed our review of his record, we are
troubled by Judge Kennedy's views as expressed in a number of his
judicial decisions involving issues of civil rights and women's
rights. In cases involving voting rights, access to the courts
to challenge housing discrimination, equal educational
opportunity, and equal employment opportunity. Judge Kennedy has
written or joined in opinions (1) imposing onerous requirements
on persons claiming to be the victims of discrimination in order
to establish violations of the Constitution or civil rights laws
or (2) placing curbs on the remedies needed to redress fully
discrimination that had already been established.1

         Judge Kennedy's restrictive interpretations of rights and
remedies in his judicial opinions are reinforced by some of his
other public statements, e.g., his response to the Judiciary
Committee on the question of his membership in private clubs ~
stating that invidious discrimination may be limited to practices
"intended to impose stigma on ... persons." Such a statement
raises questions about whether the nominee has an accurate
understanding of the history of deep rooted discrimination in
this country, its persistent effects and the measures that the
Congress and the courts have determined to be necessary to
eliminate the vestiges of discrimination and provide opportunity
to people who previously have been denied it.

         Further, it should be noted that members of the Leadership
Conference have concerns about other aspects of the nominee's
record, including cases involving the rights of working people
and trade unions. All of these issues warrant careful
questioning of the nominee by members of the Committee, and
answers that are less than complete and candid should not be
acceptable.

                  Cases that are of particular concern to us include
                 Aranda v. Van Sickle. 600 F.2d (9th Cir. 1979); Topic
                 v. Circle Realty. 532 F.2d 1273 (9th Cir. 1976);
                  Spanaler v. Pasadena Citv Bd. of Education. 611 F.2d
                  1239; AFSCME v. State of Washington. 770 F.2d 1401 (9th
                  Cir. 1987); Gerdom v. Continental Airlines. Inc.. 692

         In addition to our substantive concerns about the nominee's
views, the Leadership Conference has previously expressed our
dismay with the choice of the hearing date. This is the shortest
period between the nomination and start of the hearings for any
of this President's nominees. In this short space of time, we
have not completed our review of Judge Kennedy's entire record
and we doubt whether Senators.can feel fully prepared to discuss
Judge Kennedy's judicial opinions numbering over. 400, his many
speeches, and the background of his active law and lobbying
practice.

         It is still unclear whether Senators have at their disposal
all the relevant information with which to prepare for the
hearings. In particular, assertions by the Justice Department
that there were no communications between Judge Kennedy and the
Administration regarding his judicial philosophy on issues or
subjects that could come before the Supreme Court lack
credibility, especially in light of the open political jockeying
that took place before the Ginsburg and Kennedy nominations.

         Even if the preparation time were adequate, in the hectic
period just before adjournment, competing demands for the time
and attention of Senators are likely to prevent at least some of
the members of the Committee from giving these hearings their
full, careful and sustained attention. For these reasons we call
on the Committee not to foreclose the possibility of convening
further hearings after the recess as necessary to complete its
review and to hear testimony from interested parties.

       .The hearings held by the:Judiciary Committee on the Bork
nomination set a standard worthy of emulation in all future
Supreme Court nominations. Those hearings helped educate all of
us about the rights and responsibilities under our Constitution.
They provided an appropriate inquiry into the nominee's belief in
the role of the Supreme Court in safeguarding "fundamental rights
and liberties, without in any way intruding on the independence
of the Judiciary. These functions must be served in Judge
Kennedy's case as well. Full hearings would inform the
Committee, the American public, and, not least, the nominee
himself about the matters that underlie the great issues that
come before the Court.

         In our view the Committee can make an important contribution
by continuing to follow the extraordinary high standard of
fairness and thoroughness it established in the Bork nomination.
It must create a complete record by which the Senate and the
American public can decide whether Judge Kennedy has a commitment
to equal justice under the law and whether he understands the
role of the courts in protecting civil rights and individual
liberties. It is on that record that the Leadership Conference
must rely to complete our evaluation of the Kennedy nomination.

              It continues to be our view that the December hearing was ill-timed
both in following too soon after the nomination for full preparation
and in attempting what is in nature an essentially probing and thoughtful
process at a time of maximum distraction, pressure, and fatigue -- the
concluding days of a congressional session. Many Committee members manifestly
sought to do justice by the task before them. But true discussion and
the development of lines of inquiry were victims of the calendar and
the clock. Thus, for example, many important questions were put to the
nominee in writing, following the hearings. This meant no opportunity
for follow-up questions, once the nominee had responded, and this is
particularly unfortunate since those responses contained some especially
pertinent comments that should have been explored further.

       For example, a question from Senator Simon (Q. 10) sought to ascertain
the role Judge Kennedy feels "custom and tradition" should play in reviewing
sex discrimination cases. In his response, Judge Kennedy said that "custom
and tradition could [not] form the basis for legitimate employment criteria
if those criteria were used as a pretext to discriminate on the basis
of sex." This response raises several questions. The introduction of
the notion of "pretext" suggests that under Title VII as in several other
areas of the law, Judge Kennedy is wedded to the notion that intent to
discriminate must be established before a violation can be found -- a
notion that, as the Supreme Court has made clear in Griqgs and subsequent
cases, has no place in Title VII. Further, the implication of Judge
Kennedy's answer is that there are circumstances under which weight requirements
for flight attendants, all of whom are women, could be justified as nondiscnnpnatory
and "legitimate," i.e. serving a business necessity. But he does not
explain what those circumstances are and it is hard to conceive what
they might be. The ability to question the nominee in person on these
and other important issues might have yielded answers that would be of
material assistance to Senators in voting on his nomination.

       Moreover, statements by Chairman Biden and other Senators on the
concluding afternoon of the nearing evidencing real concern about the
nominee's depth of understanding of the situation of disadvantaged minorities,
and women in this country were statements that should have been heard
by the nominee and to which his response should have been solicited in
a live face-to-face situation -- but that was precluded by the imminent
ending of the Session and the Committee's inability to reconvene at the
start of the new year. The "advice" component of the Committee's role
vis-a-vis nominations entails advice not only to the President but also
to the nominee before it as to the Committee members' understanding of
the present nature of the society and the nature, scope and flavor of
the problems in the society that will inevitably come before the nominee,
embodied in the particulars of cases, if he is confirmed.

       By way of illustration, many of the reservations held by civil rights
organisations about the nominee stem from the crabbed construction that
Judge Kennedy has given to civil rights statutes in such cases as TOPIC
and Gerdom. One may hope that exposure to the views and questioning
of members of the Judiciary Committee has given Judge Kennedy a better
                             913

understanding of the broad remedial purposes that Conqress seeks to accomplish
through these laws.

       If more opportunity for dialogue had been provided, Senators might
have received greater assurance that Judge Kennedy appreciates the needs
that gave rise to the civil rights laws and is prepared te give practical
content to his statement that "civil rights statutes should not be interpreted
in a grudging, timorous or unrealistic way to defeat congressional intent
or to delay remedies necessary to afford full protection of the law to
persons deprived of their rights." (Answer to Q. 8 of Senator Simon).

       2. As indicated in the earlier statement of Messrs. Hooks and Neas
(Statement attached, p. 2 ) , and in the preceding paragraphs of this statement,
the Leadership Conference is troubled by views and the constricted approach
manifested in Judge Kennedy's opinions in a number of cases involving
civil rights and women's rights. We will not unnecessarily add to the
record by elaborating on the disturbing aspects of the cases noted in
that statement (p. 2, n. 1) which have been discussed extensively in
testimony before the Committee by member organizations of the Leadership
Conference and others -- cases concerning fair housing litigation, school
desegregation, voting rights, and gender discrimination in employment.
Rather, we would here simply associate ourselves with the eloquent statement
of the President of one of our member organizations, and the Vice Chairperson
of the Leadership Conference, Antonia Hernandez of the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), in her appearance before the
Committee. We do not suggest that Judge Kennedy has a purpose to limit
the rights and opportunities of minorities or of women. What we fear
is that he lacks a full perception of their situation -the world as it
looks from the perspective of a woman or of a person of color and as
it acts upon them, the impact of barriers they face because they are
dark-skinned or otherwise different from the majority, or because they
are females seeking to live in equality with males.

       The Leadership Conference agrees with Judge Kennedy that the "highest
duty of a judge is to use the full extent of his or her power where a
minority group or even a single person is being denied the rights and
protections of the Constitution." (Answer to Q. 4 of Senator Simon.)
For a judge to perform this "highest duty", s/he must have the capacity
to understand the situation of someone whose background and circumstances
are very different from the judge's own, and this capacity must be unimpeded
not only by intentional or active bias, but by "indifference" or "insensitivity"
(to use Judge Kennedy's words in response to a question from Senator
Levin). Nothing less can assure that a Court whose membership includes
Judge Kennedy will continue to perform its essential role of safeguarding
fundamental rights and liberties.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee:

The undersigned, members of the faculty of the McGeorge School of
Law, University of the Pacific, enthusiastically endorse the
nomination of Judge Anthony M. Kennedy as an Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court of the United States.

Judge Kennedy has taught Constitutional Law at the McGeorge School
of Law for twenty-two years. During the last twelve years, he has
also served as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit, where he has decided many significant cases
involving constitutional issues. His commitment to, love of, and
respect for the Constitution is manifest.

We have come to know Judge Kennedy well here at the McGeorge
School of Law. He has the intellect, experience, and temperament
necessary to make significant contributions to the Supreme Court
and to the country.

For these reasons, we support his nomination and hope that the
Senate Judiciary Committee will promptly recommend to the full
Senate that Judge Kennedy be confirmed as the next Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

                                        INTRODUCTION

                The record of Supreme Court nominee Anthony M.
Kennedy fails to demonstrate a forceful commitment to civil
liberties and civil rights. The Nation Institute, a founda-
tion dedicated to protecting constitutional rights, is deeply
concerned by certain aspects of Judge Kennedy's record,
particularly in the area of discrimination, where his deci-
sions reveal insensitivity to women and minorities.

                We have studied Judge Kennedy's decisions in eight
areas: (1) employment discrimination; (2) discrimination in
education, housing, voting rights and criminal law; (3) the
right to privacy; (4) criminal procedure; (5) capital punish-
ment; (6) freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the
Freedom of Information Act; (7) freedom of religion; and
(8) prisoners' rights.

                 The record in each of these areas leaves uncertain
Judge Kennedy's willingness to protect constitutional rights
and freedoms. While Judge Kennedy at times decides in favor
of protecting constitutional rights, he does net do so
consistently. Based on our study, Judge Kennedy's record in
civil rights and civil liberties appears undistinguished at
best.

                 Judge Kennedy does not bring a comprehensive
philosophy to his decision-making, but rather employs a
                                   920

case-by-case method. In his usually short opinions, he
reveals little of his thinking or general approach to the
area of law at issue. Perhaps Judge Kennedy writes in this
manner because he feels constrained by his role as an appel-
late judge. As a Supreme Court Justice, however, Judge
Kennedy may not feel similarly constrained.

                 For all these reasons, it is imperative that the
Senate Judiciary Committee carefully explore the nominee's
judicial philosophy and those cases where he has limited
constitutional protections. To this end, a list of suggested
questions is annexed to this Introduction.

                Depending on what is learned, the Senate may have
to decide whether an undistinguished record in the areas of
civil liberties and civil rights qualifies a nominee to serve
on the Supreme Court, the guardian of those liberties and
rights.

                A summary of Judge Kennedy's views and highlights
of some of his more disturbing decisions in the eight areas
studied follows:

A. Employment Discrimination
                 Judge Kennedy's worst record is in the discrimina-

tion area. Judge Kennedy's opinions indicate little
                                    921

sensitivity to the victims of employment discrimination, and
even less understanding of the serious consequences of such
discrimination in lost wages, benefits, and opportunities.

                Judge Kennedy drastically weakens enforcement of
the discrimination laws by unduly narrow interpretations and
by denying access to the courts based on overly strict
application of procedural rules.

                 One example: Judge Kennedy joined a dissent that
would excuse an employer's gender discrimination based on
customers' preferences.--' Such a rule would open up a
loophole that would eviscerate the discrimination laws. In
this case, the dissent stated that airline passengers'
perceived preferences for slender stewardesses might permit
the airline to impose strict weight requirements on women but
not on men. The majority of the court rejected this view.

                 In addition, Judge Kennedy has considered two
issues in the forefront of discrimination law -- comparable
worth-^ and homosexual rights-^ -- and soundly rejected
claims in both areas.

1/ Gerdoro v. Continental Airlines, Inc.. 692 F.2d 602 (9th
        Cir. 1982) (en bane), cert, dismissed. 460 U.S. 1074
         (1983) .

2/ AFSCME v. State of Washington, 770 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir.
        1985).
                                                                                    (Continued)
                                   922

                Moreover, Judge Kennedy failed to resign from the
exclusive Olympic Club in San Francisco until his name was
floated as a Supreme Court nominee. The Club bars membership
by women and previously barred non-whites. Judge Kennedy
also recently resigned from the Del Paso Country Club of
Sacramento, which has no non-white members out of 670 mem-
bers.

                 Judge Kennedy retained his membership in the
Olympic Club despite a 1984 ABA Code of Judicial Conduct
canon stating that it is inappropriate for judges to hold
memberships in private clubs that practice invidious discrim-
ination. Judge Kennedy's club membership indicates a lack of
understanding for those whose opportunities, in a land of
opportunity, are limited by discrimination.

B. Discrimination in Education, Housing,
        Voting Rights and Criminal Law
                 Outside the employment context, Judge Kennedy

continues to resist rigorous enforcement of the discrimina-
tion laws. His record indicates a lack of zeal in remedying
the profound inequalities between the races and sexes in our
society.

(Continued)
3/ Beller v. Middendorf. 632 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1980),

        cert, denied, 454 U.S. 855 and 452 U.S. 905 (1981).
                                   923

                Judge Kennedy too readily applies very narrow
interpretations of procedural rules to deny discrimination
claimants access to the courts. In one case, Judge Kennedy
denied access to the courts to an organization working to
eliminate race discrimination in housing.-47/ The organization
sued real estate brokers for racial steering -- directing
prospective home buyers only to neighborhoods of their own
race. That practice was uncovered by members of the organ-
ization posing as home buyers. Judge Kennedy held that the
organization had no standing to sue despite their allegations
of deprivation "of the important social and professional
benefits of living in an integrated community."-^ This
unduly narrow construction of the standing requirements was
rejected by the United States Supreme Court in an opinion by
Justice Powell.-7 Hence Judge Kennedy interpreted the
discrimination laws more narrowly than Justice Powell who he
has been named to replace.

                 In addition to narrow procedural rulings, Judge
Kennedy has exhibited insensitivity to the victims of

4/ TOPIC v. Circle Realty. 532 F.2d 1273, 1274 (9th Cir.),
        cert, denied. 429 U.S. 859 (1976).

6/ Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood. 441 U.S. 91

         (1979) .
                                    924

discrimination when denying relief on the merits of discrimi-
nation claims.

                 For example, Judge Kennedy affirmed a grant of
summary judgment against Mexican-Americans who alleged that
their city's at-large election system for the city council
violated their constitutional right to vote.--' The Mexican-
Americans claimed: that no polling places were located in
the private homes of Mexican-Americans, but were often in
homes of white people; that Mexican-American poll watchers
were harassed; and that despite Mexican-Americans' comprising
over fifty percent of the population, very few Mexican-
Americans ever were elected. Despite these allegations,
Judge Kennedy's concurrence denied the Mexican-Americans the
opportunity to present their complaint at a trial.

                 In the same case, the lower court had ruled against
the Mexican-Americans. Among the insulting statements from
the lower court was the conclusion that, "[t]he failure of
Mexican-American voters to elect Mexican-American candi-
dates . . . is attributable, largely, to apathy of the
Mexican-American voters."-' While Judge Kennedy's

7/ Aranda v. Van Sickle. 600 F.2d 1267 (9th Cir. 1979),
        cert, denied. 446 U.S. 951 (1980).

8/ Idj. at 1273.
                                   925

concurrence stated that certain of the lower courts con-
clusions "remain troubling", he affirmed this decision of the
lower court.

                   Indeed, Judge Kennedy has shown little enthusiasm
for enforcing the discrimination laws. While he often gives
the benefit of the doubt to the person accused of engaging in
discrimination, he is not similarly generous to the victims
of discrimination. For example, in a school desegregation
case, where the school board had previously been found to
have practiced intentional race discrimination, Judge Kennedy
decided to relinquish court oversight of the schools.-9/7
Judge Kennedy accepted the school board's resolution that it
would pursue affirmative action, and rejected evidence
indicating that the school board would reinstate neighborhood
school policies that would worsen segregation.

                   Judge Kennedy's acceptance of the resolution
adopted by the school board previously found liable for
intentional discrimination indicates a lack of conviction in
enforcing the discrimination laws as a remedy for the dis-
crimination that is entrenched in parts of our society.

                Moreover, Judge Kennedy refused to depart from
gender stereotypes by imposing a harsher sentence for for-
cible sodomy on a man than for rape of a woman.*--'
Judge Kennedy denied an equal protection challenge to the
forcible sodomy sentence. He stated that the two crimes
could be distinguished based on "traditions and community
values that have prevailed for centuries," without recogniz-
ing that the equal protection clause prohibits gender dis-
crimination despite contrary community values.

                 In all, Judge Kennedy exhibits a lack of commitment
to enforcing the discrimination laws. He interprets the laws
unduly narrowly, limiting their ability to remedy discrimina-
tion.
C. Privacy

                Judge Kennedy's view on the right to privacy is
difficult to discern.

                 On the one hand he recognizes a generation of
Supreme Court privacy decisions as precedents, including Roe

10/ United States v. Smith. 574 F.2d 988, (9th Cir.), cert,
        denied. 439 U.S. 852, (1978).
                                    927

v. Wade and Griswold v. Connecticut. However, he does not
comment on these precedents.--'

                On the other hand, in the same case in which he
cites these Supreme Court precedents, he denied the plain-
tiffs' privacy claims through a distorted method of reasoning
under privacy law. In that case, Judge Kennedy upheld the
Navy's discharge of personnel who engaged in homosexual
activity. This holding was later supported by the Supreme
Court in an unrelated case. But Judge Kennedy's method of
reasoning ducked the threshold question of whether there
existed a fundamental right to privacy that encompassed homo-
sexual activity. Generally, this would be the first step in
any privacy analysis. In Beller. Judge Kennedy relies
heavily on the military context of the case. Therefore,
whether his refusal to consider the threshold question of a
right to privacy portends a negative view of privacy rights
is difficult to predict.

                 Judge Kennedy was similarly cryptic about his views
on privacy in a speech he gave at Stanford University in
1986. There, he noted that certain "fundamental rights"

11/ Beller v. Middendorf, 632 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1980),
        cert, denied. 454 U.S. 855 and 452 U.S. 905 (1981) .
                                    928

                                                                                                             10

including privacy "should exist in any just society. "/ But
he also said that not all of these rights are enforceable
under the Constitution. Once again, Judge Kennedy simply
casts doubt on his willingness to recognize a right to
privacy without clearly stating his views.

D. Criminal Procedure
                 There are serious questions regarding Judge Kennedy's

record in criminal procedure. For example, Judge Kennedy has
occasionally expanded exceptions to the exclusion rule. This
rule excludes from criminal trials illegally obtained
evidence. He has generally respected the principles of
Miranda that require that a criminal suspect be informed of
his constitutional rights but only to strictly enforce the
literal warnings that the Supreme Court requires. He has
also rejected some meaningful claims based on the double
jeopardy rule, the right to counsel, and the right to face
one's accusors.

                 In the searches and seizures area, Judge Kennedy
has expanded the Supreme Court's recent decision--' that

created a narrow "good faith" exception to the exclusionary
rule.^' He held that the government ay use evidence that
it accepted on the representation of a foreign government the
evidence was untainted when in fact, it had been obtained
illegally. He has also expressed frustration with what he
terms the "rigidities of the exclusionary rule"^--' and its
"iron logic."--^ On the other hand, when Judge Kennedy
believes the police conduct has been egregious, as in one
case where a policeman paid a child $5 to reveal where his
parent kept illegal drugs, Judge Kennedy has forcefully
argued application of the exclusionary artale.^-^

                Whether Judge Kennedy will continue to carve out
exceptions to the exclusionary rule should be asked of him
before any confirmation vote.

E. Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press
        and FOIA (The Freedom of Information Act)
                 In the First Amendment area, including freedom of

speech and press, Judge Kennedy has a mixed record. At times
he has supported First Amendment freedoms with strong and
emotional language. At other times he inexplicably denies
First Amendment rights placing undue restrictions on the
rights. No overriding philosophy seems to reconcile these
conflicting viewpoints.

                As an example of the dichotomy, in one case Judge
Kennedy upheld the broadcasting on television of a film about
a person convicted of securities fraud without prior judicial
review.--' The convict had argued that the film would jeo-
pardize his release on parole. Judge Kennedy overturned the
district court's prior restraint on the film stating: "A
procedure thus aimed toward prepublication censorship is an
inherent threat to expression, one that chills speech."1--9'/

                 On the other side, Judge Kennedy joined in an
opinion, now vacated by the Supreme Court, upholding the
firing of a homosexual for being active in the Seattle Gay
Alliance, displaying homosexual advertisements in his auto-

Judge Kennedy declined to protect the employee's claimed
rights of association and expression.

F. Freedom of Religion
                Judge Kennedy has participated in very few cases

addressing issues arising under the religion clauses of the
First Amendment. In deciding these cases, he has relied
heavily on Supreme Court precedents. What he will do if
confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice cannot be determined.

G. Prisoners' Rights
                 Similarly, Judge Kennedy has decided few cases

involving prisoners' rights. He has supported prisoners'
claims when presented with facts clearly indicating official
misconduct, but appears unwilling to expand legal doctrines
to allow prisoners greater rights than those previously
established.

cerns about his opinions in several areas, particularly
discrimination, in many ways he is still a question mark.
For this reason, it is particularly important that the Senate
take the opportunity of the hearings to carefully question
Judge Kennedy.

                Suggested questions follow.

                  Twenty Questions the Senate Should Ask

Discrimination in Employment
                 1. Do customers' gender preferences excuse

employment discrimination?
                 In Gerdom v. Continental Airlines. 692 F.2d 602

(9th Cir. 1982) (en bane), cert, dismissed. 460 U.S. 1074
(1983), Judge Kennedy joined a dissent stating that airline
passengers' perceived preferences for slender flight atten-
dants might permit the airline to impose strict weight
requirements on women but not on men. A majority of the
Ninth Circuit rejected this view.

                 2. Under what circumstances, if ever, is affirma-
tive action, including hiring goals, a proper remedy for
discrimination in employment?

                 3. Are the courts powerless to remedy wage
disparities between men and women in government jobs requir-
ing comparable education, skills, and effort?

                 In AFSCME v. State of Washington. 770 F.2d 1401
(9th Cir. 1985), Judge Kennedy denied relief to women employees
with low wages compared to men, based on both the controversial
comparable worth theory and traditional disparate impact
analysis.

                                                                                                              16

Discrimination in Housing
                 4. Should access to the courts be granted freely

to those with complaints of discrimination?
                 In TOPIC v. Circle Realty. 532 F.2d 1273 (9th

Cir.), cert, denied, 429 U.S. 859 (1976), Judge Kennedy
decided that investigators who uncovered real estate brokers
engaging in racial steering practices -- steering prospective
home buyers to communities of their own race -- did not have
standing to sue. This narrow interpretation was expressly
rejected by the Supreme Court in another rase in an opinion
written by Justice Powell. See Gladstone, Realtors v.
Village of Bellwood. 441 U.S. 91 (1979).

Discrimination by Private Clubs
                 5. Why did Judge Kennedy resign from the Olympic

Club in San Francisco, which bars women and which previously
barred blacks, only after his name was floated as a possible
Supreme Court nominee?

                 The ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2 commen-
tary (1984) states that it is inappropriate for a judge to
belong to a private club that practices invidious discrimina-
tion. Does Judge Kennedy think that the Olympic Club prac-
tices invidious discrimination?

                                                                                                 17

Discrimination in Education
                6. When racially segregated neighborhood schools

are caused by racially segregated neighborhoods, are the
courts powerless to intervene?

                In Spanaler v. Pasadena City Board of Education.
611 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1979), Judge Kennedy concurred in the
termination of court supervision of a school board that had
been found liable for intentional race discrimination. Judge
Kennedy said that neutral school assignment systems in
already racially segregated neighborhoods may not represent
illegal discrimination by the school board.

                 7. Under what circumstances, if ever, is school
busing a proper remedy for racially segregated schools?

Discrimination in Criminal Law
                 8. Is the crime of rape of a woman less reprehen-

sible than the crime of forcible sodomy of a man?
                 In United States v. Smith. 574 F.2d 988 (9th Cir.),

cert, denied sub nom. Williams v. United States. 439 U.S. 852
(1978), Judge Kennedy stated that a harsher sentence could be
imposed for forcible sodomy than for rape based on traditions
and community attitudes. He found no equal protection
violation for the different sentences.
                                     936

                                                                                                              18

Right of Privacy
                 9. Is there a constitutional right of privacy

that protects marriage, contraception, and procreation? What
are the boundaries of any such right?

                 In a 1986 speech titled f:Unenuiaerated Rights and
the Dictates of Judicial Restraint," Judge Kennedy noted that
certain "fundamental rights" such as privacy "should exist in
any just society," but he said that not all of these rights
are enforceable. What does this mean for privacy rights?

Criminal Law
               10. Should the exclusionary rule, that excludes

from criminal trials evidence obtained through police miscon-
duct, be limited further?

                 In United States v. Leon. 468 U.S. 897 (1984), the
Supreme Court created an exception to the exclusionary rule
when police officers relied in good faith on a facially
deficient warrant. In United States v. Peterson. 812 F.2d
486 (9th Cir. 1987), a case that had nothing to do with a
deficient warrant, Judge Kennedy expanded the "good faith"
exception to include situations where American officials
incorrectly relied on the assertion by foreign officials that
their overseas search was not illegal. How broadly does
Judge Kennedy interpret the "good faith" exception? In what
                                    937

                                                                                                 19

additional circumstances other than a facially deficient
warrant would he apply this exception?

               11. Does Judge Kennedy agree with the Supreme
Court's pronouncements that because death is different in its
severity and finality from all other sentences, the imposi-
tion of capital punishment must be attended by procedural
safeguards that might not be guaranteed by the Constitution
in other contexts?

               12. Should the police ever be required to supply
additions to the standard Miranda warnings if a suspect's
special circumstances suggest he may unknowingly waive his
constitutional rights?

                 In United States v. Contreras, 755 F.2d 733 (9th
Cir.), cert, denied. 476 U.S. 832 (1985), Judge Kennedy
affirmed convictions of defendants who mistakenly thought
their statements were taken under a grant of immunity.

               13. What sorts of errors by criminal defense
counsel suggest that he is providing less than the constitu-
tionally required "effective assistance" of counsel?

                 In United States v. Medina-Verduoo. 637 F.2d 649
(9th Cir. 1980), Judge Kennedy held that "counsel need not be
infallible" but only reasonably competent.

               14. Should an appellate judge defer in all circum-
stances to a trial court's determination of effective assis-
tance of counsel?

                Judge Kennedy suggested extreme deference in

(Kennedy, J., concurring), cert, denied. 454 U.S. 1154
(1982) .

Freedom of Speech and Association
               15. To what extent do government workers have

First Amendment rights?
                 In Singer v. United States Civil Service Commission.

530 F.2d 247 (9th Cir. 1976), vacated. 429 U.S. 1034 (1977),
Judge Kennedy joined in an opinion, later vacated by the
Supreme Court, supporting the termination of a government
employee for publicly asserting his homosexuality. The
employee was active in the Seattle Gay Alliance, had dis-
played homosexual advertisements in his automobile, and
publicly announced his homosexuality.

Judicial Philosophy
               16. To what extent should the courts, in inter-

preting the Constitution, move beyond the framers1 initial
conceptions of its provisions to a more flexible reading of
the ideals and goals it expresses? How does Judge Kennedy's
philosophy in this area affect the resolution of issues faced
by the Supreme Court that were beyond the contemplations of
the framers?

               17. To what extent should principles of federalism
affect the abilities of civil rights litigants to seek
redress in the federal courts?

                Judge Kennedy has often advocated judicial re-
straint and vigorous assertion of various principles of
federalism, such as abstention, that require that federal
courts not hear cases in which state courts are already-
involved. For example, in World Famous Drinking Emporium v.
Citv of Tempe. 820 F.2d 1079 (9th Cir. 1987), Judge Kennedy,
in a concurrence, stated that federal courts should not hear
this First Amendment challenge that was also litigated as a
zoning dispute in the state courts. In this case, the owner
of a dance club challenged zoning requirements and other
state laws that would have restricted his club.

               18. Does the nominee believe it would be constitu-
tional, as some have proposed, to limit the jurisdiction of
Article III courts to eliminate cases involving sexual and
racial discrimination, habeus corpus, prisoner civil rights
complaints, social security cases, and environmental cases
with only limited possibility of review?

Religion
               19. Is a short morning prayer conducted in public

elementary schools constitutional?

                                                                                                             22

               20. To what extent must employers and unions
modify their rules and methods to accommodate an employee's
religious practices?

                 Judge Kennedy's opinion in International Association
of Machinists & Aerospace Workers v. Boeing Co.. Nos. 86-4345,
86-4373 (9th Cir. Nov. 27, 1987) (available Dec. 2, 1987 on

                              EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION

Introduction
                Judge Kennedy's judicial record on employment

discrimination raises serious questions about his sensitivity
toward the victims of discrimination. His opinions indicate
little understanding of the serious damage done by employment
discrimination -- in lost wages, lost benefits and lost
opportunities. While he occasionally rules in favor of
plaintiffs in employment discrimination matters, this is not
generally the case.

                Judge Kennedy has not developed a coherent overall
philosophy regarding the employment discrimination laws, but
his case-by-case approach leans toward restricting their
application. Judge Kennedy's decisions have often failed to
support employment discrimination claims based on unduly
narrow interpretations of the laws or overly technical
readings of the procedural rules.

                 In addition to denying discrimination claims based
on unduly narrow or technical readings of the discrimination
laws, when presented with a claim that requests expanding
current discrimination theory, Judge Kennedy invariably
denies the claim. Judge Kennedy has ruled in at least two

                                                                                                             24

areas in the forefront of employment discrimination theory:
comparable worth and homosexual rights. In each of these
areas, he refused to extend the reach of current
discrimination laws.

A. Sex and Race Discrimination in Employment
                Analysis of Judge Kennedy's judicial record in

employment discrimination cases shows that he frequently
denies discrimination claims based on unduly restrictive
interpretations or on technicalities, and that when he
reaches the merits of a claim he generally rules against the
plaintiff, as follows:

                 In Gerdom v. Continental Airlines. Inc..--' a group
of female flight attendants sued the airline over a policy
requiring strict weight limits for female "flight hostesses,"
but not for male "directors of passenger service" with
similar duties. The airline's policy required women who were
5 feet 2 inches tall to weigh no more than 114 pounds; an
additional five pounds were permitted for each inch above
that height. The flight attendants were weighed monthly, and
any excess weight had to be reduced by two pounds weekly.

Failure to lose the requisite weight resulted in suspension,
and then termination.

                Judge Kennedy joined a dissent from the Ninth
Circuit en bane decision holding that the airline policy was
illegal sex discrimination. The court in reversing summary
judgment noted that the "exclusively female classification in
this case typifies the then prevailing pattern [in the
1970's] in the airline industry of restricting job oppor-
tunities and imposing special conditions on the basis of
gender stereotypes."-' The court found that the airline's
sole reason for imposing the weight restriction exclusively
on the female job category was to cater to a perceived public
preference for slender women. The airline never claimed that
its weight policy impaired the functions of flight attendants
regarding flight safety or food service. The court, follow-
ing well-established law, held that customer preferences
unrelated to ability to perform the job does not justify
gender discrimination.-^ Judge Kennedy joined in a dissent
that disagreed, and would have remanded for a trial on the
merits, stating, "the degree of customer contact with flight

hostesses dictated that they maintain a more attractive
appearance."--4'/

                 The dissent's view that customer preferences can
legitimize gender discrimination not only contradicted
contemporary law,--' but would have created a loophole in the
employment discrimination laws that would have eviscerated
those laws. Allowing an employer to rely on customers'
gender preferences, might permit employers to hire exclu-
sively female flight attendants, secretaries, and nurses, and
exclusively male pilots, doctors, and chauffeurs, with impu-
nity. Such hiring based on gender, as opposed to individual
abilities, was precisely the sort of discrimination our laws
were intended to wipe out.

                 Further, the Gerdom decision is a good example of
the integral role the courts can and should play in changing
past patterns of employment discrimination. Before Gerdom.
in 1971, the Fifth Circuit held that the exclusive hiring of
women as flight attendants was a discriminatory employment
practice.-7 In 1973, the year following the commencement of

the action in Gerdom. Continental began hiring men as well as
women as flight attendants. At that time, the strict weight
requirement at issue in Gerdom was abolished and replaced by
a direction that weight be maintained in some "reasonable"
correlation to height for both male and female flight atten-
dants. In 1977 Continental abolished the weight requirements
entirely.

                 Judge Kennedy failed to participate constructively
as the courts worked to end the employment discrimination
that was deeply entrenched in the airline industry.

                 Judge Kennedy's dissenting vote in Gerdom shows his
willingness to accept requirements imposed on women's occupa-
tions which are unthinkable in similar male fields.

                 Judge Kennedy's sympathies are no greater for a
lone woman attempting to break into a traditionally male
occupation. Nancy Fadhl brought a Title VII sex discrimina-
tion suit when she was terminated nine weeks into her
required fourteen week field training program to become a
police officer. Fadhl v. City and County of San Francisco.-^
The district court ruled in favor of Fadhl awarding her over
$80,000 in damages. Judge Kennedy's review of the evidence
recognized a substantial record from which discriminatory

treatment could be found, including specific sexist comments
and "numerical scores given to Fadhl on her daily reports
[that] were lower than scores given to men whose performance
was similar or worse, and that her scores at times did not
correspond to the written scoring guidelines." Nonetheless,
Judge Kennedy remanded the case to the district court because
the district court erroneously found that Fadhl had not
attended her termination hearing -- even though Judge Kennedy
noted that he was "uncertain" whether this error would affect
the district court's ruling.

                 On remand, the district court simply deleted any
mention of Fadhl's presence at the hearing, and on the second
appeal to a new panel of the Ninth Circuit not including
Judge Kennedy, the panel affirmed the district court.--'
While Judge Kennedy has a reputation of "sticking to the
facts," here he appeared to invent a factual problem that the
court below did not see as significant and then used it to
disregard otherwise overwhelming evidence of deliberate
discrimination.

                 Judge Kennedy also remanded another Title VII
disparate treatment case, this one involving a Native Ameri-
can woman who was awarded over $60,000 in damages for

discrimination in job promotions and harassment based on her
race and sex. In White v. Washington Public Power Supply
System.-^ Judge Kennedy wrote an opinion remanding the action
and ordering a new trial in part because the district court's
findings of fact and conclusions of law required too high a
burden of proof from the defendants in their rebuttal case,
although the district court's oral decision applied the
correct burden of proof.--' While this holding could have
been dispositive, Judge Kennedy also relied in part on his
view of the weakness of plaintiff's factual case. As he
wrote, "[t]he trial court's finding of discrimination was
tainted not only by the application of the incorrect burden
of proof, but also by the use of dubious factual
premises."--'

                 Judge Kennedy stepped beyond the proper role of an
appellate court by indicating his view of the facts, particu-
larly his view of the lack of credibility of White's expert
witness based solely on this expert having once complained to
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over alleged
discriminatory treatment when rejected for a job by WPPSS.

The weight to be given factual evidence, and in particular
the credibility of witnesses, are issues traditionally within
the province of the trial court. By commenting on the facts
in this way, Judge Kennedy usurped the trial court's preroga-
tive.

                 Further, Judge Kennedy's doubt regarding the
factual basis of White's case, along with an error in a legal
technicality, led him to remand the action. Here again, as
in Fadhl, Judge Kennedy stretched to find a reason to believe
that'-the employer did not discriminate.

                 In addition, White is noteworthy because
Judge Kennedy goes on to comment on his view of the proper
application of various discrimination laws on remand. Among
other views, he writes that section 1981--' prohibits only
race discrimination, not sex discrimination. This narrow
interpretation of section 1981 has been rejected by at least
one other court.1-3/

                In Laborde v. Regents of University of
California.--' Judge Kennedy joined a majority opinion
affirming the dismissal of a discrimination claim in which
the defendant was not held to such an exacting standard as
the plaintiffs in White and Fadhl. Alice Laborde, a tenured
assistant professor of French and Italian at the University
of California at Irvine, was denied a promotion to full
professorship on the ground of "inadequate scholarship."--'
The panel d..jeu her claim of discrimination despite
recognizing her impressive number of scholarly publications
as well . i the "many favorable comments" in her academic
file. The panel also noted that Laborde made out a prima
facie showing of discriminatory treatment, including showing
that "men with similar qualifications have been promoted to
full professor."--' Nonetheless, the majority failed to find
an error necessary for reversal.

                 Judge Ferguson of the Ninth Circuit, dissenting
from a denial of an en bane vote, lambasted the panel for
failing to find discrimination:

        The panel presents the strongest case possible that
        Alice Laborde is the victim of invidious sex discrimina-
        tion.
        The opinion states in clear language that men with
        qualifications similar to hers have been promoted to
        full professor positions.
        Yet the opinion concludes that she is not entitled to
        promotion because she failed to meet the University's
        standards for scholarship and research.
        The logical conclusion of that analysis is that men who
        do not meet the standards of scholarship and research
        will be promoted but women will not unless they meet the
        standards. Title VII prohibits that type of discrimina-
        tion. JJJ

                 Judge Kennedy also joined in the majority in
Senqupta v. Morrison-Knudsen Co.--' that rejected a claim of
race discrimination under a Title VII disparate impact
theory. Sengupta had worked as a senior engineer on a shale
oil project in a 28-person department of large company.
Adverse economic conditions forced the company to lay off a
number of workers. Of the 5 employees laid off in Sengupta's
unit, 4 were black.

                 The Senqupta court held, affirming a grant of
summary judgment, that the appropriate group to use for
statistically proving a prima facie case of discrimination
was not plaintiff's 28-member department but rather all

281 employees in this division of the company. This holding
precluded Sengupta from requiring defendant to proffer
business reasons for the discrimination and from the opportu-
nity to rebut those reasons. A more generous interpretation
of the discrimination laws might have led to a different
result in this case. While 28 workers is a small group, 4
out of 5 lay-offs of blacks is a suspiciously high enough
proportion perhaps to warrant requiring the employer to offer
a neutral explanation for this apparently discriminating act.

                 In several discrimination cases where the issue was
whether complaints were timely filed in the district court,
Judge Kennedy has ruled against the plaintiff. Kouckv v.
Department of the Navy--' (handicapped former federal
employee, required to file complaint within 30 days of
receipt of negative EEOC decision and name head of agency in
suit, had suit dismissed because he filed 5 days after

pattern of using technical legal devices to lessen the
availability and enforceability of the discrimination laws.

into to correct racial discrimination by the previous

pany.

                   The lack of concern for people subjected to race
and sex discrimination displayed in Judge Kennedy's decisions
is mirrored in his extrajudicial life. Right before his
nomination to the Supreme Court, Judge Kennedy resigned from
two clubs with histories of excluding blacks and women.
Judge Kennedy joined The Olympic Club of San Francisco when
its bylaws permitted membership to "only white male citi-
zens." The Olympic Club dropped the whites-only rule in
1968, but no women or blacks are among the more than 4,000
current members. Judge Kennedy also resigned from the Del
Paso Country Club of Sacramento. Of the 6?0 members, none is
black,^

                   The Commentary to Canon 2 of the American Ear
Association Code of Judicial Conduct states:

          in any organisation that practices invidious discrimina-
         tion on the basis of race, sex, religion or national
          origin. Membership of a judge in an organization that

Judge Kennedy appears to have been in violation of this tenet
of judicial ethics until just before his nomination to the
Supreme Court.

B. New Theories of Employment Discrimination Law
                 Judge Kennedy seems unwilling to extend the reach

of current employment discrimination laws to embrace new
doctrines. Judge Kennedy has ruled in at least two areas on
the forefront of employment discrimination law -- comparable
worth and homosexual rights -- and in each of these areas he
has denied the plaintiffs' claims.

        1. Comparable Worth
                 Judge Kennedy has decided one landmark Title VII

case, American Federation of State. County  Municipal
Employees ("AFSCME") v. State of Washington.^ In AFSCME,
the first case before any Court of Appeals based on the
doctrine of comparable worth, Judge Kennedy, writing for a
unanimous panel of the Ninth Circuit, rejected application of

the doctrine in that case but held out the possibility that
it might apply in another situation. The comparable worth
theory rejected by Judge Kennedy holds that government jobs
requiring comparable education, skill, and effort should pay
the same. This theory is an attempt to remedy the low pay
that many women in traditionally female occupations receive
compared to men in less skilled occupations.

                 In AFSCME. a class of 15,500 state employees of the
State of Washington working in job categories composed of at
least 70% female workers alleged sex discrimination in
salaries and sought injunctive and monetary relief dating
back to 1979. Plaintiffs sought relief under the theory of
comparable worth, arguing that jobs "impos[ing] similar
responsibilities, judgments, knowledge, skills, and working
conditions" should pay similar salaries.--'

                 Based on reports done for the State of Washington
in 1974 and updated in 1975, 1976, and 1980, it was found
that there was "an average salary difference of 20 percent,
favoring men over women for work of similar complexity and
value. . . . The update revealed that since salary increases
have been established on a percentage basis, the inequality

gap between men's and women's salaries for similar work has
now increased."--'

                 Faced with the overwhelming disparity between the
salaries earned by women and those earned by men in
comparable jobs, the district court noted the national
interest in eliminating employment discrimination.^^ The
district court focused on the "broad remedial policy behind
Title VII," quoting the Supreme Court:

        "As Congress itself has indicated, a 'broad approach' to
        the definition of equal employment opportunity is
        essential to overcoming and undoing the effect of
        discrimination. S. Rep. No. 867, 88th Cong., 2d Sess.,
        12 (1964). We must therefore avoid interpretations of
        Title VII that deprive victims of discrimination of a
        remedy, without clear Congressional mandate."--'

                Accordingly, the district court found that the wide
disparity in salaries between jobs with similar skills was
discriminatory and a violation of Title VII. Judge Kennedy,
writing for the panel on appeal, reversed, for reasons that
show the narrow view he takes of the role of discrimination
laws.

                Comparable worth is an admittedly new theory in
search of an elusive, but noble, goal -- correcting the
massive economic disparity that has historically existed, and
currently exists, between women and men in this country. Not
once in his review of the district court decision does Judge
Kennedy acknowledge that the ambitious reach of the compar-
able worth theory is aimed at mending and changing an enor-
mous economic, and ultimately social and political,
imbalance.

                 Significantly, Judge Kennedy stated that "Title VII
does not obligate [the Washington legislature] to eliminate
an economic equality that it did not c r e a t e . " -- B u t
Title VII was promulgated to fight the effects of prior
discrimination, woven into and out of the fabric of our
society, that most of us were not responsible for creating.
Title VII is not concerned only with the creation of discrim-
inatory inequalities, as Judge Kennedy seems to claim, but
with their perpetuation as well. It is ambitious because it
needs to be.

                 Instead of analyzing the legal sufficiency of the
record before him, Judge Kennedy simply asserted that the
entire market system is on trial and that "a compensation

                                                                                                             40

system, the result of a complex of market forces, does not
constitute a single practice that suffices to support a claim
under disparate impact theory."3--3'/

                Moreover, Judge Kennedy gave short shrift to
possible application of a more traditional and accepted
discrimination doctrine -- disparate impact analysis. While
it is debatable whether comparable worth in a Title VII case
is an appropriate legal theory for remedying past discrimina-
tion, it is wrong to assert, as Judge Kennedy does about the
discriminatory patterns of economic inequality suffered by
plaintiffs in AFSCME, that "[t]he instant case does not
involve an employment practice that yields to disparate
impact analysis."3--4'/

                The courts have instituted a three-tiered test to
prove disparate impact cases under Title VII. First, plain-
tiff must show that a facially neutral employment practice
has a substantial discriminatory effect upon a protected
class. Then, the employer may rebut by showing that the
discriminatory practice is justified by a legitimate business
necessity. Finally, the plaintiff must show that the reason
offered is merely a pretext for discrimination. Discrimina-

plaintiff's prima facie case.--
                Notwithstanding the large class of plaintiffs in

AFSCME and the wide-ranging alleged discrimination,
Judge Kennedy could have applied traditional disparate impact
analysis under Title VII to the facts of AFSCME even without
opening the door to the broader questions potentially posed
by comparable worth theories. The plaintiffs undertook
extensive factual investigations and offered these to the
court to prove the first prong of their case. The district
court found that the State of Washington "failed to produce
credible, admissible evidence demonstrating a legitimate and
overriding business justification."--'

                 While in other cases Judge Kennedy pored over the
factual record to find minor questions tending to show the
absence of discrimination, here he simply rejects the factual
record and again finds no discrimination.

        2. Homosexual Rights
                 In another area in which proponents are recently

attempting to expand the scope of the discrimination laws --

homosexual rights -- Judge Kennedy has opted for a more
restrictive approach.

                 In Beller v. Middendorf. ----* Judge Kennedy faced
Navy regulations prohibiting homosexual acts. Plaintiffs,
with otherwise untarnished performance records, admitted
engaging in private homosexual activity and were discharged
from the Navy. They brought suit alleging due process

                  38/
violations.--'

                Judge Kennedy concluded that substantive due
process analysis (i.e.. privacy analysis), and not equal
protection analysis, was appropriate because the appeals were
not presented as implicating a suspect class but rather as
implicating an aspect of the fundamental right to privacy.
However, he grafted onto this privacy analysis elements
traditionally considered part of equal protection analysis,
stating that this case fell somewhere between the compelling
state interest test and the rational relationship test of
equal protection law.--' He conceded that some kinds of
consensual homosexual behavior might face "substantial

that deference accorded the military outweighed whatever
heightened solicitude was appropriate for consensual private
homosexual conduct.--' Judge Kennedy upheld as sufficient
governmental interests the Navy's concerns

         about tensions between known homosexuals and other
         members who "despise/detest homosexuality"; undue
         influence in various contexts caused by an emo-
         tional relationship between two members; doubts
         concerning a homosexual officer's ability to
         command the recpect and trust of the person he or
         she commands: .and possible adverse impact on
         recru it ing. -'--

                  Judge Norris, writing in dissent from the Ninth
Circuit's refusal to rehear Beller en bane, fully exposed the
analytical fl&cs m Judge Kennedy's opinion.4--2'/ As Judge
Norris pointed out, Judge Kennedy gave no critical scrutiny
to the relationship between the Navy's asserted interests and
its regulations. The Navy offered nothing "to indicate that
maintenance of such discipline war-readiness requires th-it

Intolerance is not a constitutional basis for an infringement
of fundamental personal rights."4--3'/

                 Judge Norris demonstrated that none of the Navy's
asserted problems was in any way confined to homosexual
activity. The Navy had experienced tension and hostility
between members of different racial groups. Emotional
relationships occur between male and female Navy personnel.
The Navy could fear that blacks or women might be unable to
gain the respect of certain personnel. Yet women and blacks
could not be discharged from service on these bases
constitutionally. Parents of recruits would be more
concerned about their children's association with persons who
use dangerous illegal drugs than with homosexuals, yet drug
use was not grounds for mandatory discharge. The Navy did
not not have a legitimate interest in protecting the
sensibilities of intolerant persons in foreign countries.--'

                 Lastly, Judge Norris criticized as disingenuous the
Beller panel's conclusion that individual fitness hearings
could not be a less restrictive alternative. The Navy

already used individual fitness hearings extensively for
conduct other than homosexuality.4--5/

                Judge Kennedy's lack of zeal in protecting the
rights of homosexuals is further demonstrated by Singer v.
United States Civil Service Commission.--' Singer concerned
the discharge of a homosexual Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission employee. The plaintiff, who disclosed his
homosexuality at the time he was hired, was discharged for
"immoral and notoriously disgraceful conduct" under the Civil
Service regulations. That conduct consisted of embracing a
male at his prior place of employment; indicating by dress
and demeanor that he intended to continue homosexual conduct;
applying for a marriage license with another man; being the
subject of publicity in which he identified himself as an
EEOC employee; being active on the Board of Directors of the
Seattle Gay Alliance, through which his name and place of
employment were mentioned in the planning of a symposium; and
displaying homosexual advertisements on his car windows.--'

                Judge Kennedy joined in the opinion of the court
upholding the dismissal of plaintiff's civil rights suit.
The court held that the discharge of a homosexual was justi-
fied by a finding that his conduct affected the efficiency of
the Civil Service.---/ The court accepted the Civil Service
Commission's findings that the plaintiff:

         openly and publicly flaunt[ed] his homosexual way
        of life and indicat[ed] further continuance of
        such activities, while identifying himself as a
        member of a federal agency . . . 'impeded the
        efficiency of the service by lessening public
        confidence in the fitness of the Government to
        conduct the public business with which it was
        entrusted. '--'
The court also concluded that the government's interest in
promoting the efficiency of the public service outweighed the
plaintiff's interest in exercising his First Amendment rights
through "publicly flaunting and broadcasting his homosexual
activities."--J The Supreme Court vacated this opinion in
light of a new position by the government.--'

                As Judge Norris noted about the Navy, the Civil
Service "is not in the business of promoting its own moral

views . . . . Intolerance is not a constitutional basis for
an infringement of fundamental personal rights."5--2'/ The
Singer court never questioned why the Civil Service Commis-
sion could label homosexuality "immoral and notoriously
disgraceful conduct." Clearly the court agreed with this
characterization, because it too used the word "flaunt" to
describe the plaintiff's openness about his sexual persua-
sion. Nor does the court ever explain why plaintiff's
conduct would affect the efficiency of the Service, other
than by lessening public confidence. The court, like Judge
Norris, should not have "accepted that the [Civil Service]
has a legitimate interest in protecting the sensibilities of
intolerant persons . . . ."--' The court, with which Judge
Kennedy joined, displayed its own intolerance.

                 In yet another case, Judge Kennedy failed to
support the rights of homosexuals. One year before Singer
was decided, a district court struck down Civil Service
Commission regulations excluding all active homosexuals as

unsuitable for government employment.5--4'/ The court granted
summary judgment for the plaintiff, awarded him backpay and
reinstatement, and held that the suit was a proper class
action. However, the court denied reinstatement with backpay
for other class members.

                The Ninth Circuit, in a per curiam opinion, upheld
the denial of retroactive relief for the class:

        The court's rationale would invalidate discharge
        for homosexual activity only where such activity
        had no rational bearing on the individual's job
        performance. Thus the issue of liability would
        have to be separately litigated for each person
        who claimed to be a class member . . . . It would
        be burdensome to discover class members and give
        notice of their right to recover, making the
        action for reinstatement and backpay difficult to
        manage.--'
The panel cut off retroactive class relief even where the
unlawfulness of the service's regulations was clearly esta-
blished, implying that most class members would not be able
to show that their homosexuality had no rational bearing on
job performance.

                 Overall, Judge Kennedy has exhibited a lack of
conviction in enforcing the discrimination laws.

                    DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION, HOUSING,

                         VOTING RIGHTS. AND CRIMINAL LAW

Introduction
                Outside of the employment context, Judge Kennedy

has further demonstrated a resistance to acknowledging and
remedying discrimination. A review of his decisions in the
areas of education, housing, voting rights, and criminal law,
exposes a lack of sensitivity to discrimination plaintiffs
and an unwillingness to give them the opportunity to develop
their cases in the courts.

A. Discrimination in Education
                Judge Kennedy has authored or joined in opinions in

discrimination in education cases that have prevented plain-
tiffs from developing their cases in the courts. He has
terminated existing jurisdiction, denied standing, and upheld
summary judgment for defendants. Among the more noted of
these decisions is Spanaler v. Pasadena City Board of Educa-
tlon.^

                 In Spangler. the district court had retained
continuing jurisdiction over the Pasadena City Board of

1/ 611 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1979).
                                  968

                                                                                                              50

Education ("the Board") to remedy racial segregation in
public schools held to be unlawful in 1970. The Board
claimed to be in compliance with court orders and to have
remedied racial segregation in the schools to the extent of
its power, and applied to the district court to relinquish
jurisdiction. The district court refused to do so, based on
evidence indicating that the Board would allow resegregation
to occur.*'

                 A Ninth Circuit panel vacated the district court's
decision and ordered the district court to terminate the
case. The court held that the Board's present compliance
with the desegregation plan and its representation that it
would continue to engage in affirmative action required an
end to jurisdiction.--' Judge Kennedy concurred in an
opinion joined by Judge Anderson (making it a de facto second
opinion of the court), writing separately "to give emphasis
to certain aspects of this case."-'

                 Judge Kennedy recognized that the effects of a
constitutional violation and proper duration of the remedy

are difficult to measure.^ fie also .recognized that from
1970 to 1977, the Board was not n compliance with the
desegregation plan on thirteen occasions.-^ Nevertheless,
Judge Kennedy was willing to err on the side of "underestimat-
ing the proper duration of -the remedy, concluding that the
Board had been in "substantial compliance" with the plan, and
that the effects of the Board's discrimination had been
eliminated.-^

                 The district court had found that if jurisdiction
terminated, the Board intended to reinstitute the neighbor-
hood school pattern existing before 1970, which would recre-
ate the pre-1970 racial percentages in the schools. Board
members had made public statements criticizing the
desegregation plan and endorsing neighborhood schools. The
Board had explored alternative student assignment methods
that would increase racial imbalance. Judge Kennedy responded:

                 I assume, without deciding, that the likelihood a
        school board will engage in new acts of intentional
        discrimination may be considered by a court as one
        factor in favor of retaining jurisdiction to insure the
        effects of a past violation are eliminated . . . . The

        district court's conclusion, -nevertheless, is clearly
        erroneous based on this record..8/
Judge Kennedy rejected the district court's conclusion, based
on hard evidence, regarding the Board's intention to allow
resegregation, accepting instead the Board's "official
resolution promising not only to engage in no acts of
intentional discrimination, but also to adopt and maintain
affirmative -action programs designed to improve racial
integration among students, faculty and administrative staff
xsf the District. '"^

                 Judge Kennedy conceded that M[t]he Board's future
actions may at some date be held unconstitutional,"--' but
potential plaintiffs would -then have to commence a new civil
action.--' It would have been consistent with the strong
policy of ensuring that constitutional violations be reme-
died, and with the interests of judicial efficiency, for
Judge Kennedy to allow the court's supervision, already in
place, to continue -until the threat of future unlawful
resegregation was eliminated. Instead, Judge Kennedy made it

necessary to invoke the court's processes all over again in
order to attack continuing violations of the Board.

                Judge Kennedy too easily accepted a mere promise by
a Board that only nine years before was found guilty of
intentional race discrimination in its schools. He was
undisturbed by clear evidence that as soon as jurisdiction
terminated, the Board would reinstitute neighborhood schools
causing resegregation. He was willing to accept nine years
as plenty of time to remedy the effects of a racially dis-
criminatory school policy that must have existed for a much
longer period of time. Judge Kennedy rationalized as fol-
lows:

        Where the court retains jurisdiction, a board may feel
        obliged to take racial factors into account in each of
        its decisions so that it can justify its actions to the
        supervising court. This may make it more, rather than
        less, difficult to determine whether race impermissibly
        influences board decisions, for the subject is injected
        artificially into the decision process, and the weight
        that racial considerations might otherwise have had is
        more difficult to determine.12/
The whole point of continuing jurisdiction is to ensure that
the violator takes race into account in its decision-making
in a permissible and judicially mandated way; there is no
need to determine the weight that racial considerations
otherwise might have had. Judge Kennedy's obfuscatory

rationale displays a resistance to remedying past discrimina-
tion, even when the judicial machinery to do so is already in
place.

B. Discrimination in Housing
                 In the housing context. Judge Kennedy interpreted

civil rights legislation strictly so as to deny access to
courts to : _>je discrimination plaintiffs. In TOPIC v. Circle
Realty.--' an association of black and white families
("TOPIC") sued three real estate brokers for racial steering,
defined a& "directing non-white home seekers to housing in
designated minority residential areas, and directing white
hone seekers to housing in designated white residential
areas."1--4'/ TOPIC used teams of black couples and white
couples posing as home seekers to uncover racial steering
practices. TOPIC'S alleged injuries were;

        being deprived of the important social and professional
        benefits of living in an integrated community . . .
        embarrassment and economic damage in their social and
        professional activities from being stigmatized as
        residents of either white or black ghettoes . . . .15/

                Judge Kennedy wrote the opinion of the Ninth
Circuit holding that TOPIC and its members did not have
standing under the Fair Housing A c t -- ' to bring their suit
because they were not actual home seekers subjected to racial
steering. Judge Kennedy distinguished a similar case,
Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Insurance C o . , ^ in which
the Supreme Court held that tenants of an apartment complex
had standing under the Fair Housing Act to challenge their
landlord's allegedly discriminatory renting practices. Judge
Kennedy held that section 3610 of the Fair Housing Act, under
which Trafficante was brought, allowed suits to vindicate the
rights of third parties, but section 3 612, under which TOPIC
was brought, did not allow such suits.^*

                 Section 3612 provides that "[t]he rights granted by
[the Fair Housing Act] may be enforced by civil actions" in
federal or state courts. Judge Kennedy read into this broad
language a restriction allowing access to the courts "only
to . . . those who are the direct objects of the practices
[the Fair Housing Act] makes unlawful.^--^ Judge Kennedy

further restricted the reach of the Fair Housing Act by
defining "the direct objects11 as those who "make bona fide
efforts to buy or rent housing."^-' Thus, Judge Kennedy
concluded that TOPIC did not have standing because its
members were not real home seekers and therefore were not the
direct objects of any unlawful practices.

                 Judge Kennedy reasoned that H[s]ection 3610 contem-
plates the resolution of disputes in the slower, less adver-
sary context of administrative reconciliation and mediation,"
while "[s]ection 3612 has no pre-conditions to suit."^*'
While section 3612 may provide "preferential access to
judicial processes,"--' Judge Kennedy did not explain why
this leads to the conclusion that it provides no access for
plaintiffs like TOPIC.

                Judge Kennedy's reasoning and holding in TOPIC were
expressly rejected by Justice Powell writing for the Supreme
Court three years later in Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of
Bellwood.--' In Gladstone, residents of a neighborhood used
testers to uncover racial steering by real estate agencies

and brought suit under section 3612. The Supreme Court found
that "[n]othing in the language of [section 3612] suggests
that it contemplates a more restricted class of plaintiffs
than does [section 3610]."^-^ Legislative history indicated
that "all [Fair Housing Act] complainants were to have
available immediate judicial review. The alternative,
administrative remedy was then offered as an option to those
who desired to use it."--'

                 The Supreme Court went on to hold that the claim of
residents that the transformation of their neighborhood from
an integrated to a predominantly segregated community deprives
them of the social and professional benefits of living in an
integrated society is injury sufficient to satisfy the
constitutional standing requirement.2--6'/ Judge Kennedy
implied the opposite in TOPIC by distinguishing Trafficante
because it involved residents of an apartment building rather
than of a community.2--7'/ As the Supreme Court made clear,
"[t]he constitutional limits of respondents' standing to
protest the intentional segregation of their community do not

vary simply because that community is defined in terms of
city blocks rather than apartment buildings."2--8'/

                Judge Kennedy has also displayed a lack of zeal in
remedying race discrimination in housing in other cases. For
example, in Fountila v. Carter.2--9'/ a landlord was found
guilty of refusing to rent a single family house to plain-
tiffs because they were a black family. The jury awarded $1
in actual damages and $5,000 in punitive damages.--

                 Judge Kennedy joined in the opinion of the Ninth
Circuit on the landlords appeal. The court held that the
jury was entitled to conclude from the evidence that the
defendant discriminated in conscious and deliberate disregard
of the plaintiff's rights,--' and that the issue of punitive
damages was properly submitted to the jury.---^ The court
recognized that "an otherwise supportable verdict must not be
disturbed on appeal unless 'grossly excessive,' 'monstrous,'
or 'shocking to the conscience.'"--'

                Notwithstanding these findings, the court vacated
the $5,000 punitive damage award. The court found the

limitation on punitive damage awards in the Fair Housing Act
did not apply, the jury should have been instructed to take
it into account in determining the appropriate award.--*

of punitive damages.--' The court, searching for some means
of justification for its acts, even considered the landlord's

Aranda v. Van Sickle.--' members of the San Fernando Mexican-
American community brought suit against the city of San
Fernando, its Mayor and members of the city council, alleging
that the at-large election scheme to elect the city council
was unconstitutional. Since 1911, only three Mexican-Americans
had been elected to the city council despite the fact that
Mexican-Americans comprised approximately fifty percent of
the population. Mexican-Americans comprised only twenty-nine
percent of the registered voters. The barrio was a geograph-
ically distinct community organized along racial lines.
Neither members of the city council nor the mayor had lived
in the barrio for the ten years prior to the suit.3--9'/

                Mexican-American poll watchers were harassed by
police during the 1972 elections. Private homes of citizens
were often used as polling places; without exception, none
were Spanish-surnamed households. A very small percentage of
Spanish-surnamed persons participated in the operation of
elections. Mexican-Americans were sparsely represented on
city commissions. The city employed many more whites than

Spanish-surnamed persons, and Spanish-surnamed persons
comprised the vast majority of the lower paid employees.--'

                Plaintiffs alleged examples of the city being
unresponsive to the needs of the Mexican-American community.
They also cited examples of discriminatory campaign tactics
used in elections in which there were strong Mexican-American
candidates, and a city letter that implied that a district
election system would produce no qualified Mexican-American
candidates. 4--1'/

                The district court granted summary judgment for
defendants, issuing findings of fact that can only be de-
scribed as shallow and insulting. For example, the district
court found that the concentration of Mexican-Americans in
the barrio "is the result of individual desire of the
Mexican-Americans to associate with those with similar racial
and economic status."--' The district court also found that
"[t]he failure of Mexican-American voters to elect
Mexican-American candidates to the council in proportion to
their population in the city is attributable, largely, to
apathy of the Mexican-American voters and not to racially

court's findings and agreed with the district court that
there was "no proof whatsoever of any restrictive electoral
system."^7'

                Although Judge Kennedy found that "[c]ertain
conclusions of the trial court do remain troublesome,"--' he
concurred in the judgment and approach of the circuit court-
He acknowledged that the necessary element of intent could be
inferred from evidence showing that the political processes
leading to nomination and election were not equally open to
participation by the group in question. Nevertheless, Judge
Kennedy concluded that the evidence could not support such an
inference.--'

                Judge Kennedy was satisfied (and presumably
expected fifty percent of the population to be satisfied)
with the fact that Mexican-American candidates campaigned in
recent elections, and "a Mexican-American candidate was
almost elected to the council in 1974."--' Judge Kennedy

concluded that location of all private polling places in
white homes outside the barrio did not deny access to politi-
cal processes. He denied plaintiffs the chance to develop
this fact at trial, never considering why Mexican-Americans
from the barrio would be systematically deterred from
exercising their fundamental right to vote by being forced to
encroach upon a white middle or upper class private domain in
order to do so.

                 Judge Kennedy rejected the district court's finding
that low Mexican-American representation on the council and
commissions was due to low civic awareness as a result of
high unemployment and low levels of education and not as a
result of racial discrimination. He stated that it was not
proper on summary judgment to conclude that this was not the
product of deliberate bias. Instead of reversing summary
judgment, however, Judge Kennedy merely stated that restruc-
turing the election system was not necessarily the appropri-
ate remedy. *--'

                 Judge Kennedy also dismissed as insufficient
plaintiffs' evidence showing that Mexican-Americans were
employed primarily in nonprofessional and lower paid

categories.4--9/ He emphasized San Fernando's small size and
long-standing policy of at-large elections.--' Here too
Judge Kennedy concluded that a finding of intentional
discrimination could be made on the facts, but because
plaintiffs requested invalidation of the at-large election
system, he would not reverse summary judgment.--'

                 Judge Kennedy clearly was troubled by the district
court's shallow, insensitive findings. He also believed that
summary judgment was not appropriate on the issue of inten-
tional discrimination. His reasoning could have allowed him
to give the plaintiffs a chance to develop their facts at
trial and he could have suggested alternative appropriate
remedies. Instead, he allowed the district court's findings
and conclusion to stand on the ground that the requested
remedy might not be appropriate.

and city councilmen. The California licensing authority
initially denied the application based on the protests by the
city officials, but later granted it on the plaintiffs1
administrative appeal.--^ Plaintiffs won a jury verdict in
their civil rights suit against the police chief, Mayor, and
city councilmen, for damages caused by the delay in granting
the licenses.

                 Judge Kennedy, writing for the Ninth Circuit on the
defendants' appeal, upheld the verdict. The evidence against
the defendants was overwhelming. Of the five applications
for licenses made in the period involved in the suit, the
only two contested were of Mexican-Americans planning to
serve a Mexican-American clientele. The three others were
not. All five applications were for the same neighborhood.
No application by a non-Mexican-American owner to serve a
non-Mexican-American clientele had ever been protested. The
city council had insisted on an ad hoc rather than uniform
protest policy. There was also clear evidence of statements
by defendants invoking racial stereotypes. These facts
completely belied defendants' rationale that they were
protesting to prevent undue concentration of licenses, to

promote temperance, and to prevent aggravation of an existing
police problem.5--4'/

                Judge Kennedy concluded that the evidence was more
than sufficient to support the finding that defendants acted
with the intent to discriminate on the basis of race.5--5'/ He
went on to hold that an official forfeits qualified immunity
if he acts with proscribed discriminatory intent.--'

                 The facts in Flores, as Judge Kennedy noted, were
nearly as extreme as those in Yick Wo v. Hopkins.---' the
seminal case holding that the effect of a law may be so harsh
against a particular race as to require an inference of
intent to discriminate.--' In such a case, Judge Kennedy
seems willing to enforce a remedy against the wrongdoers. In
a case like Aranda. however, Judge Kennedy is not willing to
give plaintiffs a chance even to develop their case. Defen-

types and who practice more subtle and invidious forms of

Kennedy.

D. Discrimination in Criminal Law
                  As discussed above, Judge Kennedy's treatment of

sex discrimination in employment displays lack of sensitivity
to, and resistance to enforcement of, the constitutional
rights of women. Two cases outside the employment context
follow that trend.

                   In United States v. Smith.--' three male inmates of
a federal penitentiary were found guilty of committing
forcible sodomy on another male prisoner. They were con-
victed under the federal Assimilative Crimes hct^ by
application of a Washington statute that defined the offense
of rape to include homosexual sodomy.^' The federal rape
statute only applied to the rap* of a female.-^*'

                   The defendants argued that application of the
Washington statute denied them equal protection because
conviction under that statute carried a twenty-year minimum

sentence while conviction under the federal rape statute
carried no such minimum.--' Defendants argued that Congress
acted with reference to homosexual rape when it enacted the
federal rape statute.

                Judge Kennedy, writing for the court, held that
equal protection was not violated when Congress punished one
offense by assimilation of a state statute but provided its
own definition and punishment for a rationally distinguish-
able offense.--' To reach that holding, Judge Kennedy
concluded that rape of a female and homosexual sodomy were
rationally distinguishable offenses. Judge Kennedy wrote:

        It is rational to determine that the harm, both physical
        and mental, suffered by victims of these two crimes are
        of a different quality in each instance. These distinc-
        tions are reflected in traditions and community atti-
        tudes that have prevailed for centuries, and penal laws
        may properly take account of such differences by assign-
        ing a separate generic classification to each
        offense.65/

                The implication of Judge Kennedy's opinion is
clear: Rape of a male is a more heinous crime than rape of a
female. Judge Kennedy's opinion subjected the defendants to
a stricter statute than they would have been subjected to had

they gang-raped a woman. He pointed out that the Washington
statute, which defined rape of a female and sodomy as the
same offense, was an exception among the states and the Model
Penal Code.^' He supported the distinction between hetero-
sexual and homosexual rape with "traditions and community
attitudes that have prevailed for centuries," traditions that
have given short shrift to the seriousness of heterosexual
rape.

                Judge Kennedy could have commended the state of
Washington for recognizing that the rape of a man is no more
heinous than the rape of a woman. He could have ruled that
the federal rape statute must be interpreted to apply to male
rape victims as well as female rape victims or be uncon-
stitutional. Instead, he propagated the myth that the rape
of a woman is somehow more natural than the rape of a man.

                 In United States v. Flores.--' Judge Kennedy joined
in a per curiam opinion that reviewed the sentences of a
husband and wife who were both found guilty of the same
federal drug violations. The husband was sentenced for a
three year internment with a subsequent three year special

parole. The wife was sentenced as a young adult offender to
a three year term of probation.6--8'/

                The trial judge made the following statement before
sentencing:

        With respect to Marcela Flores, I'm also convinced that
        she is just as guilty as is her husband. And, but for
        one factor, I would feel obligated to impose upon her
        the same sentence imposed upon her husband. But she
        does have a child and is expecting another one. And I
        just don't think the interests of justice require the
        Government to take both parents away from these chil-
        dren . 69/
The husband claimed that the unequal sentence based upon
pregnancy constituted unlawful sex discrimination.

                 The Ninth Circuit, with virtually no analysis,
concluded that the wife's preferential treatment based upon
"her condition" was rational and within the discretion of the
trial court, and that the husband's rights were in no way
prejudiced.-- The court noted that there is no requirement
that two people convicted of the same crime receive identical
sentences. The court stated that the Supreme Court has held

that discrimination based on pregnancy is not invidious and
therefore does not violate equal protection.--'

                This opinion can be characterized as nothing short
of disgraceful. The Constitution may not require that two
people convicted of the same offense receive the same sen-
tence, but surely a judge cannot constitutionally give a
black man or a woman a lengthier sentence simply because of
his race or her sex. The judge made clear that the only
reason he was able to avoid being "obligated" to impose
identical sentences was the fact that the wife was pregnant
and that "she" already had one child.

                 Contrary to the court's implication, the Supreme
Court did not hold that the Constitution permits discrimi-
nation based on the mere fact of pregnancy. The court in
Flores cited without analysis one Supreme Court case, and
ignored another one, Cleveland Board of Education v. La

                 The court reinforced the stereotype that women are

court made clear its bias when it stated that "she [not

for female plaintiffs who hope that Judge Kennedy will look
upon them as equal to men. The lack of any analysis of this
blatant judicial enforcement of sexual stereotypes indicates
that the court did not consider this a very serious issue.

                                    RIGHT TO PRIVACY
Introduction
                Judge Kennedy's views on the right to privacy are
difficult to discern. Moreover, his philosophy regarding
important fundamental rights, such as the right to privacy,
not specifically stated in the Constitution is murky. As in
other areas, Judge Kennedy seems extremely hesitant -- even
in a speech on the subject -- to give much more than an
oblique statement of his theoretical approach to what he
calls "unenumerated rights."--'
                A close reading of Judge Kennedy's sparse writings
on privacy reveals a few disturbing points. His only
significant privacy decision, Beller v. Middendorf--' .
employed a dubious method of analysis that both avoids the
hard issues and dilutes the right of privacy as defined by
the Supreme Court. In this case, Judge Kennedy upheld the
Navy's discharge of servicemen for homosexual activity.

However, Judge Kennedy did cite the generation of Supreme
Court privacy decisions as precedent in Seller.

                 Further, Judge Kennedy indicated in his speech that
he considers privacy the least legitimate of the "unenumerated
rights" recognized by the Supreme Court. He ultimately
questions the legitimacy of all of these rights based on his
personal philosophy of the role of the Constitution.-^

Analysis
                 In Beller, Judge Kennedy's most important privacy

decision, Judge Kennedy upheld a Navy regulation mandating
the discharge for homosexual activity regardless of an
individual's fitness for naval service. In highly question-
able analysis, Judge Kennedy stated he did not have to
address the important question of whether consensual private
homosexual conduct is a fundamental right. Traditional
privacy analysis is under the "due process clause" of the
Fifth Amendment which prohibits deprivation of life, liberty
or property without due process of law. This analysis asks
whether the conduct in question is a fundamental right, and
then as a second step asks whether the infringement of the
right by the government would further "compelling state

interests" and whether the infringement required be narrowly
tailored to further those interests. Judge Kennedy recog-
nized that this is the analysis used in Supreme Court privacy
decisions such as Roe v. Wade.--4'/ However, Judge Kennedy
inexplicably glossed over the privacy analysis engaged in by
the Supreme Court in favor of a new balancing approach.^

                Judge Kennedy's balancing approach grafted what is
traditionally equal protection analysis onto due process
analysis. Courts structure the first, "fundamental right,"
question posed under substantive due process analysis
differently when using an equal protection approach. The
question becomes the government's action against
the protected class of individuals, i.e. homosexuals, must
pass the higher strict scrutiny test or some other more

        Cleveland. 431 U.S. 494 (1977), supported a substantive
        due process analysis that balanced the nature of the
        individual interest allegedly infringed, the importance
        of the government interests furthered, the degree of
        infringement, and the sensitivity of the government
        entity responsible for the regulation to more carefully
        tailored alternative means of achieving its goals. 632

        supported by the full Court. Miller v. Rumsfield. 647

forgiving test such as the rational basis test. Judge
Kennedy was unable to fit consensual homosexual conduct into
either a strict scrutiny or rational basis category, using
instead a special intermediate tier for homosexuals. Judge
Kennedy then concluded that under this intermediate test, the
Navy's regulation was constitutional. In so concluding,
Judge Kennedy relied heavily on the military context of the
case, and the special deference given the military.

                 By inexplicably using a method of analysis that
departs from traditional privacy analysis, Judge Kennedy was
able to duck answering the hard question of whether there is
a right to privacy for homosexual activity.

                 Further, Judge Kennedy acknowledged the existence
of "substantial academic comment" in favor of including
homosexual conduct in the right to privacy and was willing to
"concede" -- but only "arguendo" -- that some kinds of
government regulation of homosexuals may face "substantial
constitutional challenge."-^ Judge Kennedy failed to state
his views any more definitely.

                However, Judge Kennedy let the alleged interests of
the Navy override the "heightened solicitude" he had just
conceded may be due consensual homosexual conduct.

                He gave uncritical deference to the Navy without
examining the legitimacy of the Navy's claims, including the
claim that:

        a substantial number of naval personnel have feelings,
        based upon moral precepts recognized by many in our
        society as legitimate, which would create tensions and
        hostilities, and that these feelings might undermine the
        ability of a homosexual to command the respect necessary
        to perform supervisory duties.-'
Similar "feelings" about members of a particular race or
religion would not be considered legitimate under the Consti-
tution.--' This shows the lack of scrutiny Judge Kennedy gave
to the regulation in question.

                Although the Supreme Court recently refused to
extend privacy protection to private consensual homosexual
conduct in Bowers v. Hardwick (which upheld Georgia's crimi-
nal sodomy statute)j-9/7 as did Judge Bork in an earlier case
on facts very close to those in Beller (which reached the
same result as Kennedy did),^--S both of these decisions

Court's privacy decisions extended to private consensual

homosexual conduct. Similarly, Justice Powell, whom Judge
Kennedy was nominated to replace, addressed the fundamental
rights question in Moore v. City of East Cleveland^' in
deciding that he would extend the privacy cases to invalidate
a zoning ordinance that in essence required the break-up of
extended families. Moreover, in City of Akron v. Akron
Center for Reproductive Health. Inc.."' Justice Powell noted
for the Court, that "restrictive state regulation of the
right to choose abortion, as with other fundamental rights
subject to searching judicial examination, must be supported
by a compelling state interest."--' Judge Kennedy did not
follow this approach in Beller.

                   In short, Beller is an analytically confusing
opinion. Whether Judge Kennedy's dubious approach is the
result of his discomfort with the right to privacy and
unenumerated rights altogether, is not clear.

                   In addition to Beller. Judge Kennedy decided a few
other opinions that touched on the issue of right to privacy.
None of them clearly indicate Judge Kennedy's views on
whether such a right exists under the Constitution. For

example, Judge Kennedy joined an opinion denying a privacy
claim finding that the right to privacy did not prevent a
city from requiring that the viewing areas of public estab-
lishments containing film or videotape viewing devices
(booths where sexually explicit films were shown) be visible
from a continuous main aisle.--'

                Also, in a self-described "emphatic dissent" in a
criminal procedure case, United States v. Perm,1--5'/ Kennedy
relied in part on two privacy cases, -- Moore--' and Pierce
v. Society of Sisters--' -- in criticizing the majority's
acceptance of a police officer's bribe of a five-year-old
child in order to procure evidence against the child's
mother. Characterizing the "parent-child union" as an
"essential liberty" that has a "fundamental place in our
culture," Kennedy stated that the bribe constituted a severe
and manipulative intrusion into this union.1--8'/ He would have

excluded the evidence discovered using the bribe. Interest-
ingly, he nowhere mentions the concept of "privacy."

                  Accordingly, Judge Kennedy's decisions neither
expressly accept or reject a constitutional right of privacy.
However, it is of particular concern in the privacy area that
his Beller opinion did not explain, affirm, or expressly
adopt the reasoning of Griswold. Roe, and other privacy
cases.

                   Concerns raised by Beller only deepen upon a
reading of Judge Kennedy's 1986 speech at Stanford Universi-
ty, "Unenumerated Rights and the Dictates of Judicial Re-
straint."1^

                   In "Unenumerated Rights", Judge Kennedy said that
the "constitutional text and its immediate implications,
traceable by some historical link to the ideas of the Fram-
ers, must govern the judges."--' He further suggested that
the essential rights in a "just" system are not coextensive
with the essential rights of the American constitutional
regime,^^ noting that despite the "spacious" language of the
Bill of Rights and the Civil War amendments, it is the

legitimacy, to determine the "attributes of a just

                These views ultimately led him to question the
legitimacy of fundamental rights, in particular the right to
privacy. While he noted that it "forts constitutional
dynamics, and it defies the [precedential] method to announce
in a categorical way" that there can be no unenumerated
rights,--' he also noted that the exercise of enumeration has
been fraught with "persistent difficulties"1-^ and put the
judiciary in a "tentative position."--' For Judge Kennedy,
the most plausible justification for such rights is to find
some foundation for them in the structure of the constitu-
tion -- the right to travel, he suggests, plausibly may be
justified as inherent in a system of federalism, while the
right to vote can be explained as a necessary reenforcement
of state political processes.

                Kennedy could find no such "plausible" justifica-
tion for the right of privacy, however.--' Indeed, in
discussing the right that has been characterized as "the most
comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by
civilized men . . . the right to be let alone,"*--' Kennedy
relies almost exclusively on Bowers. the 5-4 Supreme Court
sodomy decision that is the most critical of the idea of a
right to privacy.

                Moreover, Roe v. Wade and the many subsequent
decisions explicitly affirming it are not discussed; Griswold
is merely mentioned in passing. The results in Meyer v.

relationship they bear to freedom of expression under the
First Amendment.--'

                 Most importantly, however, Kennedy seems to suggest
that at least the right to engage in homosexual conduct may
be one of the rights best left to the "just," rather than the
"constitutional" society:

        Many argue that a just society grants a right to
        engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is
        accepted, the Bowers decision in effect says the
        State of Georgia has the right to make a wrong
        decision -- wrong in the sense that it violates
        some people's views of rights in a just society.
        We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's
        right to be wrong in matters not specifically
        controlled by the Constitution is a necessary
        component of its own political processes. Its
        citizens have the political liberty to direct the
        governmental process to make decisions that might
        be wrong in the ideal sense, subject .to correction
         in the ordinary political process.--'

Thus, as the right to travel and to vote are "plausible"
because they bear some relationship to the necessities of the
constitutional system, a right to engage in private consensu-
al homosexual conduct may not be justified because the
structure of the political process requires this result.

Kennedy's apologia for Bowers fits neatly with his "plausi-
bility" test for fundamental rights.

                 As he did in Beller. Judge Kennedy simply casts
doubt on his willingness to recognize a right to privacy, but
does not clearly state his views.

                                    CRIMINAL PROCEDURE
Introduction
                 Judge Kennedy's record in criminal procedure cases
reveals several areas of concern. He has narrowly interpreted
rights established for criminal defendants under the Fourth,
Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution. However, it
must be noted that his respect for precedent -- including the
oft-maligned exclusionary rule and Miranda warnings -- has
caused him to uphold, occasionally begrudgingly, many consti-
tutional claims.
                 In Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases, Judge
Kennedy has sought, loopholes in the exclusionary rule and has
limited the areas in which we all can claim a legitimate
expectation of privacy, but he has argued for suppression of
evidence in egregious cases.
                 His approach to Fifth Amendment issues such as
Miranda warnings and double jeopardy is often mechanical, and
at times is disturbingly narrow in its view of constitutional
protection for the accused. He tends to give these protec-
tions a very technical application, thus declining to address
the potential harm unforeseen and unintended by the creators
of those protections.
                 Likewise, in Sixth Amendment decisions on the right
to counsel and the right to confront adverse witnesses, he

                                                                                                   86

has charted a narrow course. He has been unsympathetic to
claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and has been
willing to uphold convictions in which significant Sixth
Amendment considerations were arguably compromised.

A. The Exclusionary Rule
                 Despite infrequent gripes about its inflexibility,

Judge Kennedy has generally followed precedent in applying
the exclusionary rule. He has, however, recently demonstrated
a willingness to expand loopholes to that rule. In United
States v. Peterson.^ Judge Kennedy went beyond the limits
set out by Supreme Court precedent and expanded the "good
faith" exception to the exclusionary rule as enunciated by
the Supreme Court in United States v. Leon.** This exception
allows admissal of evidence when the police act in good faith
based on a facially valid, but technically deficient, warrant.
Judge Kennedy seized on the rationale of Leon to allow
admission of evidence seized in an illegal search that,
unlike Leon, had nothing to do with a deficient warrant. In
Peterson, the defendants were arrested based on evidence
gathered in part from overseas wire-taps conducted illegally

by Filipino law enforcement agents and represented to United
States agents as legal under Filipino law,

                 Conceding that Leon addressed only good faith
reliance on a facially valid search warrant, Judge Kennedy
argued that "the exclusionary rule does not function as a
deterrent in cases in which the law enforcement officers
acted on a reasonable belief that their conduct was legal."-37/
He then expanded the good faith exception to include objec-
tively "reasonable" reliance on foreign law enforcement offi-
cers1 representations that they have complied with their own
laws. This expansion is quite troubling, for Kennedy's
analysis reveals the seeds of possible emasculation of the
exclusionary rule and its twin values of deterring police
misconduct and preserving the integrity of the judicial
system.

                 Fear of a crusade against the exclusionary rule by
this judge must be tempered somewhat, however, as Judge
Kennedy has not seen fit to apply the exception at every
opportunity presented to him. In United States v. Spilotro.-^

district court suppression order and specifically declined to

apply the good faith exception of Leon to an instance where a
warrant was overly broad. The warrant in question did not
describe the items to be seized with sufficient particularity.
Instead, it listed as items to be seized any evidence of a
violation of thirteen broad statutes. Unlike the unique
situation later presented in Peterson. the Leon decision
specifically addressed this scenario. Thus, Kennedy held
that this overbreadth rendered the warrant "so facially
deficient -- i.e., in failing to particularize the place to
be searched or the things to be seized -- that the executing
officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid. "-^ It
remains to be seen (and the Committee should inquire) as to
when, in other cases involving tempting situations not
previously addressed by the Supreme Court, Judge Kennedy
would again expand the exception.

                 Once hesitant to fashion or invoke exceptions to
the exclusionary rule, Judge Kennedy has seemingly grown more
venturesome in recent years. In one of his earlier criminal
procedure opinions, United States v. Rubalcava-Montoya.--'
Judge Kennedy declined to take an opportunity to expand the
'emergency circumstances" exception to the exclusionary rule.

The court reversed two convictions, finding that a customs
agent had insufficient cause to search the trunk of a defen-
dant's car, a search that resulted in finding five illegal
aliens. The government argued that although the officer
lacked probable cause to search, his good faith belief that
human life might be in danger justified a search. In a
footnote, Judge Kennedy admitted that "[t]he invitation to
recognize that a policeman should be encouraged to act in
emergency circumstancss [absent probable cause] . . . is
tempting."-77/ He declined to accept that invitation, however,
because "such a rule would be a clear extension of existing
precedents . . . . --'

stances" exception to uphold a conviction obtained by a
cursory warrantless search of the upper level of a house in
which a suspect had just been arrested, on the premise that
there had been individuals in the house who posed a danger to
the officers present. And in a concurrence in Satchell v.

                      Judge Kennedy wrote that a police officer's
opening of defendant's screen door was "reasonable and
necessary" under the exigent circumstances and thus did not
merit application of the exclusionary rule. The court
affirmed the district court's denial of the habeas corpus
petition.

                 Judge Kennedy has demonstrated a troubling tendency
to limit the scope of the Fourth Amendment right to be free
from unreasonable searches and seizures, a threshold issue
under the exclusionary rule.

                 In United States v. Sledge,-^--' Judge Kennedy upheld
convictions based on the warrantless search of an apartment
that appeared to have been abandoned, when in fact the
defendants may have intended to return. Defendants had given
the landlord notice of their intent to vacate their apartment
by the end of the month. Two days prior to the end of that
month, the landlord observed that the front door of the
apartment was left wide open for several hours. The next day
the landlord returned to the apartment, where he found a note
he had left still on the door. Entering the apartment, he

found it virtually empty of defendants1 belongings, although
there were five or six items of their clothing still there.
Concluding that the defendants had vacated their apartment,
the landlord began to clean it, whereupon a shotgun and
paraphernalia connected with the manufacturer of PCP were
discovered. The landlord then called an agent of the DEA, to
whom he explained his actions of the previous few days. He
told the agent he had retaken possession of the apartment
because he thought the tenants had vacated. The agent then
seized several items of evidence in the apartment.

                 Judge Kennedy found for a divided panel that the
officer had reasonable grounds to conclude that the premises
had been abandoned by the defendants. Thus, they had no
legitimate Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the apart-
ment, and any evidence seized in it was not subject to the
exclusionary rule.

                 In a dissent, Judge Fletcher opined that defendants
had exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy in the
apartment, and thus a warrant should have been obtained.

opinions in his response to the Judiciary Committee Interrog-
atories, Judge Kennedy premised his decision on minimizing
the appellants1 expectation of privacy. In that case,
customs agents had become suspicious of ongoing activities on
defendant Allen's property near the coast of Oregon. A
warrantless helicopter surveillance was conducted, in which
photographs of the ranch property were taken through a
telephoto lens. One agent carried out on-site surveillance
when he accompanied two officials of the Bureau of Land
Management who were visiting the ranch to seek a public
easement across the ranch for fishermen and hunters. He
declined to identify himself as an agent when challenged by
Allen. Several officers trespassed on Allen's property in
search of evidence, although none was taken at that time.
Seismic sensors to monitor vehicular activity in and around
the property were placed at the entrances to Allen's ranch.

                 Notwithstanding the questionable tenor of this
aggressive investigation, Kennedy wrote the opinion upholding
the convictions. While conceding that one need not construct
"an opaque bubble over his or her land in order to have a
reasonable expectation of privacy,11^' Judge Kennedy wrote
that several factors existed to reduce Allen's expectation of

privacy in this instance. Those factors included the fact
that the ranch was virtually on the United States seacoast
border where Coast Guard helicopters routinely traversed the
nearby air space, thus diminishing any subjective privacy
expectation.

                 Judge Kennedy held that the customs agents con-
cealment of his identity on the visit to the ranch did not
violate the Fourth Amendment. Judge Kennedy also expressed
"doubt" that the trespass by agents onto the ranch during the
course of the surveillance violated the Fourth Amendment, but
since no evidence resulted from that action, no further
consideration was needed. In addition, while Allen's chance
arrest on a nearby road 37 hours after the agents raided the
ranch was admittedly illegal, Judge Kennedy held that it was
not a basis for reversing the conviction.

                 In United States v. Sherwin.--' Judge Kennedy held
for an en bane court that a search made of broken cartons
containing allegedly obscene books by the manager of a
trucking terminal was not a "search" within the aegis of the
Fourth Amendment, and that subsequent FBI review of the
materials displayed to them by the manager was not a "seizure'
under the Fourth Amendment. The key issue on this appeal

from a suppression order was whether the subsequent review of
those books by the FBI, without a warrant, was legal. Judge
Kennedy found it was, because "once a private search is
completed, the subsequent involvement of government agents
does not retroactively transform the original intrusion into
a governmental search."1--5'/

                 In Sherwin. Judge Kennedy specifically declined to
follow a recent decision in United States v. Kelly.--' which
held that the government's subsequent acquisition of books
discovered in a private search constitutes a "seizure" in
violation of the Fourth Amendment. In Walter v. United
States.1--7'/ a case presenting a factual setting similar to
Sherwin and Kelly, the Supreme Court adopted the latter's
reasoning -- not Kennedy's -- in holding that the Fourth
Amendment required FBI agents to obtain a warrant before
viewing allegedly obscene films from a private citizen who
had mistakenly received the shipment of films and opened the
film containers.

                While not out of the judicial mainstream, Kennedy's
opinions in Sledge, Allen, and Sherwin reveal a limited view
of the scope of the Fourth Amendment right to privacy.

                 Judge Kennedy appears more likely to grant the
government the power to conduct warrantless searches under
the "administrative" or "regulatory11 exception to the warrant
clause. In a dissent to United States v. Piner.--' Judge
Kennedy argued that random safety checks of private boats by
the Coast Guai~ i.. * not unreasonable within the meaning of
the Fourth Amendment. The majority held that the random
stopping a1 ,1 coarding of a vessel after dark for safety and
registration inspection, where there is no cause to suspect
noncompliance, was not justified by any governmental need to
enforce compliance with safety regulations and thus consti-
tuted a violation of the Fourth Amendment. It therefore
upheld a suppression order. Citing what he termed the long
history of Coast Guard boarding authority and the exception
for administrative searches, Judge Kennedy, dissenting,
implied that operators of vessels at sea had a lesser expec-
tation of privacy, at least with regards to Coast Guardsmen
boarding their decks. In United States v. Villamonte-

Marquez.--' an unrelated case, the Supreme Court held that a
warrantless and suspicionless stop of a vessel was reasonable
under the Fourth Amendment, thus implicitly vindicating Judge
Kennedy's reasoning.

                 Moreover when confronted with instances of police
practices he deems egregious, Judge Kennedy has been forceful
in applying the exclusionary rule.

                 In United States v. Penn.--' Judge Kennedy dissented
from an en bane decision that permitted the government to
introduce as evidence a jar of heroin pointed out by the
defendant's five-year old son after the police had offered
the child $5 to show them its location. The majority held
that although they "disapprove[d] of the police tactic used,"
there was no constitutional ground on which to suppress the
evidence.

                 Judge Kennedy emphatically disagreed. He condemned
the tactic used by police as an assault on the parent-child
relationship, labeling it "pernicious in itself and dangerous
as precedent."21--/ To allow the fruits of such a search to be

admitted as evidence "distorts the idea of reasonableness"
under the Fourth Amendment, even assuming the police were
acting in good faith.^* In one of his most eloquent (if
rare) defenses of civil liberties, Kennedy wrote: "Indif-
ference to personal liberty is but the precursor of the
state's hostility to it."23/

                 In United States v. Rettia.--' Judge Kennedy
authored an opinion overturning the convictions of two
alleged cocaine smugglers on the grounds that Drug Enforce-
ment Agency ("DEA") agents had "substantially exceeded any
reasonable interpretation" of the provisions of a search
warrant.2--5'/ In that case, a federal magistrate denied a
search warrant to investigate cocaine smuggling but issued an
arrest warrant, which the DEA then executed. Agents arrested
one of the defendants, with marijuana in his possession, at
his residence. Agents then obtained a search warrant from a
state court judge, ostensibly to discover and seize evidence
to support the charge of marijuana possession. No mention
was made to the state judge of the previous day's denial of a

search warrant or of intent to search for evidence of the
cocaine conspiracy.

                 Judge Kennedy determined that the breadth and char-
acter of the search conducted by the DEA indicated that it
was in effect a search for evidence pertaining to the cocaine
charge and not to the marijuana charge. The nondisclosure of
the search's true objective "deprived [the judge] of the
opportunity to exercise meaningful supervision over their
conduct and to define the proper limits of the warrant."--'
Thus, the fourth amendment safeguard -- having a neutral and
detached magistrate oversee a search -- was abrogated, and
the warrant was transformed into an instrument for conducting
an illegal general search. Judge Kennedy's sanction for this
tactic was severe: all evidence was suppressed.

                 In United States v. Cameron.--' Judge Kennedy
reversed a conviction where he held for the court that the
procedures used by the police in carrying out the body cavity
search of a drug smuggling suspect were unreasonable and in
violation of the Fourth Amendment. Judge Kennedy harshly
criticized the insensitive and oppressive methods used by the
officers, who subjected Cameron to two forced digital probes,

to two enemas, and to forced consumption of liquid laxative,
despite his continued protest. "Any body search, if it is to
comport with the reasonableness standard of the fourth
amendment, must be conducted with regard for the subject's
privacy and be designed to minimize emotional and physical
t r a u m a . " -- F i n d i n g that less intrusive means of obtaining
the evidence could have been considered, including holding
the suspect until a warrant (not required, but a positive
factor in assessing reasonableness) was obtained, Kennedy
applied the exclusionary rule to suppress the evidence.
Although a quantity of heroin was ultimately found in this
instance, he expressed skepticism about whether such tactics
are even effective.

B. Miranda Warnings
                 Judge Kennedy's opinions reveal a technical ap-

proach to issues arising under Miranda v. Arizona.*--' a case
that requires police to tell suspects their rights. Not
unlike other jurists, Judge Kennedy has applied the rule of
Miranda as a "bright line" test; if the police advised a
defendant of the Miranda warnings when required, ensuing

incriminating statements were ruled admissible. Conversely,
if the police had failed to so advise a defendant, any
incriminating statement was ruled inadmissible.

                 The Miranda warnings were crafted to provide a
prophylactic means to insure that any incriminating statement
made by a defendant was made voluntarily and intelligently
and was not the product of police coercion. While adhering
to a faithful technical application of Miranda. Judge Kennedy
has displayed little inclination to apply the precepts
underlying the Miranda decision to situations where similar
concerns suggest it may be advisable.

                 For example, in United States v. Contreras,--'
Judge Kennedy, writing for the court to affirm the convic-
tions, appeared to rely on the fact that Miranda warnings
were duly recited to defendants as satisfaction of the
underlying premises of Miranda, and declined to scrutinize in
depth whether or not the incriminating statements made were
in fact voluntarily and intelligently given. In Contreras.
the defendants had been given a state grant of immunity in
exchange for certain information about a California crime
gang. After the defendants had been granted their state

immunity, they were interviewed by federal agents whom the
state investigators kept regularly informed about devel-
opments in the investigation of the gang. Before being
interviewed by the federal agents, the defendants were each
advised of their Miranda rights. Each defendant later testi-
fied before a grand jury, again after being advised of his
Miranda rights. Defendants were subsequently indicted and
convicted in federal court for violations of various RICO
provisions.

                 The defendants challenged the district court's
finding that the waivers were knowing and intelligent,
arguing that the Miranda warnings should have been expanded
to include advice that the testimony they had given under the
grant of state immunity could not be used against them in a
federal prosecution. The interrogation should not have
begun, defendants argued, until they were given explicit
advice that their previous state testimony could not be used
in any manner. The fact that they were not so warned meant
that their waivers were not intelligently given, and the
statements made should therefore be suppressed. The dissent
agreed with the contention that the defendants had not made a
knowing and intelligent waiver of their Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination "because the advice of
the agents would have reasonably led the defendants to

                                                                                                 102

believe that, for purposes of the federal prosecution, their
silence had already been broken."--'

                 Judge Kennedy disagreed. "The Miranda warning, now
so central for law enforcement in every jurisdiction, would
be unworkable if lower courts were to begin drafting required
supplements to it for various types of cases."^^ He opined
that the "ordinary sense of the agents1 remarks"^/ was such
that there was no objective flaw or misleading inference in
the advice given by the federal agents. Judge Kennedy
declined to investigate further the voluntariness issue once
the warnings were found to have been given. "The Miranda
warnings given by the agents and their explicit warnings that
federal prosecution could be commenced were all that the
circumstances of this case required."--'

                 Judge Kennedy has applied the same technical
approach when granting defendants relief for police failure
to read Miranda rights. In United States v. Scharf.3--5'/ Judge

Kennedy demonstrated his technical approach to the rule of
Miranda when the police failed to comply with the procedures.
In that case, police officers suspected that defendant
Coolidge was somehow involved in a bank robbery. Over the
course of several encounters, Coolidge was questioned by the
police on the highway, at the site of the robbery, while
sitting in a police car, and several times ir> his home. At
no time was any Miranda warning given.

                 In focusing on the encounters in which incriminat-
ing statements were made by Coolidge, the court determined
that the questioning had taken place in a custodial setting,
thus requiring the Miranda warnings be given. Judge Kennedy's
opinion for the court focused on the considerable time
Coolidge had spent talking to police, the pervasive presence
of police officers and police cars near his home, and the
intensity of surveillance of the defendant to conclude that
"the suspect in the circumstances faced significant restraints
and . . . was not free to leave. His statements were the
product of police interrogation conducted without the Miranda
warnings required by his custodial status, and they must be
suppressed."--'

a divided panel that remanded a petition for habeas corpus to
the district court for an evidentiary hearing to determine
whether a confession was legally obtained. Neuschafer, who
had been convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a
fellow inmate, contended that his constitutional rights were
violated by use of a confession derived from an interrogation
begun four days after he had requested a lawyer and none was
provided.

                 Citing the controlling precedent of Edwards v.
Arizona,--' which bars the use of any confession after a
suspect has requested a lawyer unless the suspect has initi-
ated the interview leading to his confession and has know-
ingly and intelligently waived his rights to counsel before
confessing, Judge Kennedy determined that the issue of
whether Neuschafer initiated the conversation that led to his
confession remained unresolved. One member of the panel
disagreed, chiding the majority for prolonging a case in
which it was clear that the defendant was guilty.

                 The case returned to the Ninth Circuit after the
evidentiary hearing by the district court. The lower court

found that in the course of the investigation about the
murder Neuschafer had requested an attorney, who was not
provided. Several days later, still not having been provided
with an attorney, Neuschafer handed a note to a prison guard
requesting a meeting to talk about the murder. Neuschafer
was then read his Miranda rights. He indicated that he
understood his rights, did not request an attorney, and
proceeded to give an incriminating statement eventually
introduced into evidence at trial. Based on the district
court's findings, Judge Kennedy found for the panel that the
conditions of Edwards v. Arizona were satisfied and that the
confession was admissible.--' The court denied habeas
relief.

C. Double Jeopardy
                 The double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment

guarantees that no person will twice be required to defend
himself against accusations regarding the same crime. Judge
Kennedy has often limited the doctrine, generally taking a
narrow approach, especially where the offense in question is
a serious felony.

                 In Brimmaqe v. Sumner.4--0'/ a state court convicted
Brimmage of robbery and felony first-degree murder. He was
sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of
parole for the murder and to a concurrent 15-year sentence
for the robbery. He contended in his habeas corpus petition
that the robbery sentence constituted a multiple punishment
for the same offense and should be overturned.

                 Although Judge Kennedy conceded that such a punish-
ment normally constitutes double jeopardy, his opinion for
the court found no violation here. Citing Supreme Court
precedent for the proposition that where the legislative
record clearly indicates an intent to impose cumulative
punishments, such imposition does not offend the double
jeopardy clause,--' he then deferred to a series of Nevada
Supreme Court decisions suggesting that the Nevada legisla-
ture intended multiple punishments for the defendant's
crimes.--' In so finding, Judge Kennedy conceded that those
Nevada decisions did not explicitly state such an intent, but
only that it was reasonably inferable. In a strong dissent,
Judge Boochever stated that there is no "indication that the

                   Judge Kennedy's disturbing dissent in Adamson v.
                         an important double jeopardy decision, is based

on a legally defensible but morally dubious stance. Charged
with a car-bombing murder, Adamson entered into a plea
agreement under which he would testify against two other
individuals and plead guilty to second degree murder with
actual incarceration time of 20 years. A superior court
judge accepted the plea, and Adamson cooperated fully. On
the basis of his testimony, the other defendants were con-
victed of first degree murder.

                   While their convictions were pending on appeal,
Adamson's sentence was imposed. When the other defendants'
convictions were reversed and remanded for new trials, the
state sought to secure Adamson's testimony at the new trials.
He refused, saying he had met his obligation and requested
additional consideration. In response, the state, treating
Adamson as having breached his plea agreement, prosecuted and
convicted him for first degree murder.

                 The state argued that this did not constitute
double jeopardy because the first conviction was for second
degree murder while the second was for first degree murder.
A majority in the Ninth Circuit soundly rejected that
approach. If accepted, the court noted, such reasoning would
entirely vitiate double jeopardy clause protection.

                 Judge Kennedy dissented, arguing that the protec-
tion of the clause does not extend where a plea-based convic-
tion is properly set aside. He went on to say:

                 The defendant took a risk not without some
                 attractions for him. He was serving a
                 twenty-year sentence. If the state elected
                 to try him for first degree murder, conceiv-
                 ably he might have won an acquittal. It is
                 hardly surprising that one as depraved as
                 Adamson would shrink from a breach of
                 contract and a gamble on the results. The
                 court errs in not .recognizing his defiance
                 for what it is.^157
Judge Kennedy's dissent is insensitive to fundamental notions
of inherent unfairness that the majority intuitively dis-
cerned in the state's treatment of Adamson.
                 On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed the en bane
majority, though on the narrower ground that Adamson waived

the court sharply dissented.

D. The Rights to Counsel and to Confront
        Prosecution Witnesses
                 Judge Kennedy's opinions demonstrate a very conser-

vative approach to both the Sixth Amendment right to counsel
and to confront and cross-examine witnesses. He has been
unsympathetic to appeals based on complaints of ineffective
assistance of counsel, and joined in a dissent from a ruling
that expanded the rights of prisoners suspected of committing
crimes while in prison. Judge Kennedy has also held that the
admission of video-taped testimony of a witness who died
before he could be cross-examined by a murder defendant did
not violate the confrontation clause.

         1. Judge Kennedy Exhibits a Conservative View of the
                 Right to Counsel.
                 In United States v. Gouveia,--' the majority of an

en bane panel held that where a federal prisoner is suspected
of committing a crime while in prison and is placed in
administrative detention pending trial, he is constitutionally

                                    1028

                                                                         no

entitled to an attorney prior to an indictment. The majority
distinguished the circumstances in a prison case from those
in which the Supreme Court had held that the right to counsel
does not attach until adversary proceedings are initiated
(i.e., at indictment or preliminary hearing). The majority
ruled that if an inmate is held after the maximum discipli-
nary period has expired (90 days), he should be allowed an
attorney to assist him in the preparation and preservation of
a defense.

                 The dissent, in which Judge Kennedy joined, called
the majority's ruling an "unprecedented expansion of the
right to counsel"--' and reiterated that the right to counsel
attaches only when adversarial judicial criminal proceedings
are initiated. Citing numerous instances in which the
Supreme Court has declined to extend the right to counsel to
indigent suspects, the dissent concluded that the "extra-
ordinary safeguard of the right to counsel is unnecessary to
protect against such abuse. Suspects are amply protected by
the 'ethical responsibility1 of the prosecutor and due
process standards."--^ The Supreme Court agreed with the

prisoners were not entitled to appointment of counsel until
adversarial judicial proceedings had been initiated against

                 In Portland Police Ass'n v. City of Portland.
Judge Kennedy ruled for the court and used procedural grounds
to decline addressing the constitutionality of a departmental
order requiring police officers to prepare reports after
"major incidents" with no guarantee that the officers would
have the right to consult with an attorney. Finding that
because no officer had yet suffered injury due to the order,
Judge Kennedy held that the complaint failed to present a
justiciable controversy and should be dismissed for lack of
jurisdiction. The court vacated a district court ruling on
the merits of the case against the plaintiffs. Judge Reinhardt,
in dissent, argued that a court should address the "serious
and substantial" constitutional question presented.^* While
this case was decided on procedural grounds, it reflects a
hesitancy on the part of Judge Kennedy to provide relief to
those seeking to assert the right to counsel.

        2. Judge Kennedy Has Been Unsympathetic to Claims of
                 Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.
                 Defendants1 appeals based on claims of ineffective

assistance of counsel have failed to sway Judge Kennedy. In
United States v. Medina-Verduqo.--^ Judge Kennedy wrote for
the court that while the Sixth Amendment requires that
suspects be afforded reasonably competent and effective
representation, "counsel need not be infallible."--' Id. at
653. Kennedy determined that the defendants' trial counsel
had a reasonable basis for the tactics he employed at trial
and labeled the defendants1 contention "unconvincing."
Kennedy reached a similar decision earlier, in Greenfield v.
Gunn,--' where he affirmed the denial of a writ of habeas
corpus based on a claimed deprivation of effective assistance
of counsel -- an alleged failure by defendant's attorney to
explore a potential defense.

                 Judge Kennedy has written that the Sixth Amendment
right to counsel does not afford the right to representation

by a non-lawyer of the defendant's choice.--' He also would
apparently defer to the observations of the trial court on
questions of the competence of the trial attorney.--'

                 Judge Kennedy's approach to the effective assist-
ance of counsel issue appears to be within the regime estab-
lished by the Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington.--'
which was decided after the decisions written by Judge
Kennedy above. Strickland held that a defendant must show
that counsel's assistance was not within the range of compe-
tence demanded of counsel in criminal cases and that the
defendant suffered actual prejudice as a result.

        3. Judge Kennedy Is Reluctant to Recognize
                 Claims Involving the Right to Confront
                 and Cross-Examine Witnesses
                 In Barker v. Morris,--' Judge Kennedy held that

admission of the videotaped testimony of a witness who
subsequently died did not violate the confrontation clause
where the testimony in the murder trial was necessary and

possessed particular guarantees of trustworthiness. The
witness, a Hell's Angel member dying of throat cancer, testi-
fied against several suspects on videotape. Defense counsel
for those suspects in custody at the time conducted extensive
cross examination, all of which was recorded on the video-
tape. Defendant Barker, a fugitive at the time of the
hearing, had no attorney present at the videotaping. Barker
was subsequently arrested, tried, and convicted of murder in
a state trial in which the videotape was presented as evi-
dence. A state appellate court later held the videotape
inadmissible under California's evidence code, but upheld the
conviction on "harmless error" grounds.

                 In reviewing the petition for habeas corpus, the
Ninth Circuit panel addressed directly whether the introduc-
tion of the videotape violated the Sixth Amendment confronta-
tion clause. Judge Kennedy analyzed the confrontation clause
in terms suggesting its sole purpose is to ensure accuracy,
and diminished the importance of cross-examination by the
defendant. He wrote that the videotaped testimony was
analogous to several well-established hearsay exceptions, but
one his analogies, the "dying people don't lie" rule, is
much-criticized, and the state courts had specifically held
that the videotape was inadmissable hearsay. Furthermore, he
implied that the defendant did not deserve his Sixth Amendment
rights, noting that any lack of opportunity to cross examine
                                  1033

                                                                                                             115

the witness was "directly attributable to Barker's fugitive
s t a t u s . " -- J u d g e Kennedy also noted that the tape was
strongly supported by independent corroboration for each of
its essential elements, and the witness had been subjected to
extensive cross examination by other defense attorneys.--'
The court found no violation of the confrontation clause.

                 Judge Kennedy will grant confrontation clause
relief where the facts are compelling. In Chipman v.

              62 /
Mercer,--' the trial court refused to permit cross-examina-
tion for bias by the defendant Chipman of the sole eyewitness
to the burglary of which he was accused. When counsel
undertook to cross-examine the witness on the subject of her
known dislike for a relative of defendant and her possible
hostility to defendant, the trial court did not permit the
questions to proceed. The district court granted a habeas
petition, and Judge Kennedy's opinion affirmed the district
court.

                 At the outset, Kennedy announced that confrontation
questions must be treated on a case-by-case basis. In his
view, "the confrontation clause applies to the essentials of

cross-examination, not to all the details of its implementa-
tion,"--^ and, as such, the clause "should not become the
source of a vast and precise body of constitutional common
law."--' He also would grant broad deference to trial court
rulings.---^

                 On the facts of this case, Judge Kennedy believed
that the potential bias was of sufficient import that rever-
sal was required. Weighing the crucial significance of this
eyewitness1 testimony, and the reasonable likelihood that the
alleged bias may have existed and may have impacted on the
witness1 truthfulness, Judge Kennedy felt constrained to rule
in the defendant's favor. He commented in closing that the
seeming harshness of a rule requiring reversal where a
confrontation clause error is established is diminished by
the fact that such error is only establishable where the
violation prevents cross-examination in an area of particular
relevance, that is, where the error is likely to have materi-
ally affected the outcome of a trial.--'

                 In Burr v. Sullivan.--' Judge Kennedy held for the
court that a habeas petitioner was denied his Sixth Amendment
right to confrontation when the state trial court prohibited
his attorney from cross-examining a prosecution witness about
possibly impeaching circumstances. The Sixth Amendment
included the right to cross-examine the witnesses as to their
possible bias or self-interest in testifying. Judge Kennedy
held that the defendant's need to cross examine principal
government witnesses about burglaries to which they had
admitted in prior juvenile proceedings outweighed the need of
the state to maintain confidentiality of its juvenile records,
and thus the state trial court's striking of that cross
examination was constitutional error.

                                    CAPITAL PUNISHMENT

Introduction
                 Judge Kennedy has had fev cases involving capital

punishment. He has demonstrated that he will not expand the
constitutional requirements that ensure that capital punish-
ment is imposed rationally. He has also demonstrated,
however, that he is reluctant to affirm an improperly imposed
death sentence on an "obviously" guilty defendant or deny
that defendant habeas corpus review. Dicta in Judge Kennedy's
capital punishment opinions suggest that he will narrowly
interpret and apply thoM constitutional wafeguards that
ensure that only the most heinous murderers are executed.

Analysis
                 Judge Kennedy's most substantial capital punishment

opinion is his separate opinion in Adamson v. RicXetts.-^
There, Judge Kennedy joined a dissent and wrote a separate
dissent that would have upheld a death sentence imposed on
defendant Adamson for first degree murder, even though
Adamson had previously pleaded guilty to second degree murder

for the same crime and received a lengthy prison sentence.
Adamson agreed to plead guilty to the noncapital crime in
exchange for his testimony at other trials. The dissenters
narrowed the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution which
protects citizens from being tried twice for the same crime.
The Supreme Court, in a five-four decision with Justice
Powell in the majority, ultimately reversed the Ninth Circuit,
but did not wholly adopt the reasoning of Judge Kennedy
concerning double jeopardy.

                  Judge Kennedy's Adamson opinion represents an
uncharacteristic foray into analysis not necessary to the
resolution of a case. The Ninth Circuit divided on whether
defendant Adamson's plea agreement constituted a waiver of
double jeopardy protection. Judge Kennedy's separate dissent
was initially premised on a theory that the jeopardy that
attaches upon conviction based on a guilty plea is different
than the jeopardy that attaches upon conviction based on a
trial. According to Judge Kennedy, a defendant who breaches
a plea agreement cannot invoke the double jeopardy clause as
a bar to prosecution for an offense more serious than the one
for which he was originally convicted. The Supreme Court
reversed on the narrower ground that Adamson waived his

double jeopardy protection by the terms of his plea agree-
ment. In sharp dissent, four members of the Supreme Court
explained that Adamson had not violated his plea bargain and
had not implicitly waived his double jeopardy rights.

                 In Adamson. Judge Kennedy used a cramped construc-
tion of the double jeopardy clause to affirm a death sentence
imposed on a defendant who had complied with the terms of his
plea bargain by testifying in fourteen court appearances in
five separate cases resulting in seven convictions.-^ For
reasons not related to Adamson's testimony, two of these
convictions were reversed after Adamson began serving his
sentence. Adamson temporarily balked at retestifying, but
subsequently offered to continue to testify. Judge Kennedy's
double jeopardy analysis wholly ignored the fact that the
state had substantially received the benefit of its bargain
with Adamson and had previously determined that the death
sentence need not be imposed.

                 Judge Kennedy's pronouncements on th double
jeopardy clause that unduly restrict double jeopardy protec-
tion raise serious concerns. That he would make these
pronouncements in a case involving life and death raises
questions about the care he takes in such cases.

                 In two other cases, however, Judge Kennedy has
demonstrated some sensitivity to the constitutional rights of
those sentenced to death. But even in these cases,
Judge Kennedy's statements on points of law not directly
relevant to the disposition of the case suggest that he will
limit the rights of the condemned.

                   In Vickers v. Ricketts.4/ Judge Kennedy reversed a
conviction for premeditated murder and vacated a death
sentence where the jury had not been instructed that it could
convict the defendant of a lesser noncapital offense of
unpremeditated murder. Although Judge Kennedy noted that
there was "abundant, clear, and persuasive" evidence that the
murder was premeditated, the defendant had introduced some
testimony that he suffered from a "brain disorder" that
caused him to become uncontrollably violent.-/

                 In analysis not relevant to the court's holding,
Judge Kennedy suggested that the defendant's failure to
request jury instructions on the lesser noncapital offense
might have prevented him from raising his claim in the
federal courts if a state court had determined that his claim

was procedurally barred from further consideration.-^ In a
separate concurrence, Judge Reinhardt pointed out that, under
Ninth Circuit precedent in similar circumstances, the Consti-
tution required a trial court to inform the jury that it
could return a conviction for a noncapital offense even if
the defendant's attorney did not request such an instruction.
Accordingly, failure to request such an instruction could not
prevent federal court review of the error.--' Judge Kennedy's
erroneous suggestion that the fundamental right to have a
jury consider an offense less than a capital one could be
lost through procedural misstep is disturbing.

                 Similarly, in Neuschafer v. McKay,--' Judge Kennedy
reversed a lower court's refusal to hold an evidentiary
hearing on a death row inmate's claim that his confession was
involuntary and remanded the case for a hearing.
Judge Chambers dissented from the remand on the grounds that
there was no doubt that the death row inmate was guilty.

could show that his sentence was harsher than those imposed

claim for federal relief. This ruling limiting defendants'
rights was not necessary to the disposition of the appeal.

             FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF THE PRESS, AND

                    FOIA (the Freedom of Information Act)
Introduction

                 If confirmed by the Senate, Judge Kennedy may play
a crucial role in the development of jurisprudence relating
to many First Amendment concerns, especially freedom of
speech and of the press. The importance of his role derives
in part from Justice Powell's central position on these
issues during his tenure. Justice Powell voted in the
majority in all eleven First Amendment free speech cases
decided by the Supreme Court during the 1986-87 term, and he
provided the decisive, majority vote in six of those cases
where the vote was 5-4, more than any other Justice.-^
Unfortunately, none of Judge Kennedy's opinions on First
Amendment concerns provides a clear indication of his stance
on the most difficult and controversial cases now reaching
the Supreme Court.

                 Judge Kennedy has been generally supportive of the
media in free press and libel decisions. The cases before
him were generally uncontroversial, and decided by unanimous

panels, so this support may be the result of his strict
adherence to settled precedents. Judge Kennedy is at times
less supportive of First Amendment rights of free speech by
individuals or organizations. If this portends a pattern in
his opinions, it would limit the free speech rights of those
with the least resources for publishing their views --
non-media speakers.
A. Freedom of Speech

                 Judge Kennedy has not had the opportunity to
determine such issues as what constitutes a public forum and
what are the boundaries of speech (i.e. where does speech end
and unprotected behavior begin). Judge Kennedy, however, has
at times determined that speech was outside of the guaranteed
protection of the First Amendment. He has also ruled on
several ancillary issues regarding obscenity.

                 In Singer v. United States Civil Service Commis-
sion. --^ a federal government employee was fired for, among
other things, being active in the Seattle Gay Alliance,
displaying homosexual advertisements in his automobile window
and publicly indicating his homosexuality. Judge Kennedy

joined in an opinion, supporting the termination, even though
the employee had disclosed his homosexuality before he was
hired. The employee alleged that the firing violated his
First Amendment rights of free speech and association. The
majority opinion ruled against the employee based on the
government's right to regulate its workers. The Supreme
Court vacated this opinion at the request of the government
after the employing agency changed its regulations to
prohibit blanket terminations of homosexual employees.^

                 In another context, Judge Kennedy also ruled
against the free speech rights of a government worker. In
Kotwica v. City of Tucson,4/ Kotwica, a city employee asked
for and received permission to speak to a reporter on the
condition that she would not discuss a particular subject,
the development of a competitive gymnastics team in Tucson.
When she spoke about the topic she was suspended for a day.
Although Judge Kennedy, writing for the court, admitted that
the comments were speech, he concluded that public employees'
First Amendment rights must be balanced with the state's
interest in a responsible and efficient governmental system.
For Judge Kennedy, it was easy to reverse the grant of

4/ 801 F.2d 1182 (9th Cir. 1986).

                                                                                                             127

summary judgment to the employee. Kotwica had misstated the
government's position. The government's stake in having its
position stated accurately so that the public can evaluate it
was stronger than Kotwica's First Amendment rights, said
Judge Kennedy. Therefore, Kotwica "could be disciplined not
only because she was insubordinate but also because her
speech disserved the first amendment interest of others [i.e.
the governaent nd the public]."--' How would Judge Kennedy
have acted ij. Kotwice '? a'' accurately represented the
government'e position, thus furthering the government's and
public's interest in awareness of the government position?

                 In Kotwica. Judge Kennedy relied upon two Supreme
Court decisions, Connick v. Myers--' and Pickering v. Board of
Education.-^ but expanded the weight given to the govern-
ment 's interest so that the test was skewed in favor of the
state. Aside from the fact that Kotwica was told not to
speak on the topic, the case is indistinguishable from
Pickering where the court said:

                 What we do have before us is a case in
                 which a teacher has made erroneous
                 public statements upon issues then
                 currently the subject of public

                                                                                                 128

                 attention, which are critical of his
                 ultimate employer but which are neither
                 shown nor can be presumed to have in any
                 way either impeded the teacher's proper
                 performance of his daily duties in the
                 classroom or to have interfered with the
                 regular operation of the schools gener-
                 ally. In these circumstances we con-
                 clude that the interest of the school
                 administration in limiting teachers'
                 opportunities to contribute to public
                 debate is not significantly greater than
                 its interest in limiting a similar
                 contribution by.any member of the
                 general public.-7^

Hence Judge Kennedy went beyond Supreme Court precedent to
deny First Amendment rights.

                 Outside the governmental context, Judge Kennedy
would have denied free speech rights of a worker who spoke
against union leadership. In a labor law case, a panel of
the Ninth Circuit ruled that sections 411 and 412 of Title 29
of the United States Code protect the speech rights of an
elected official of a union so that he could not be fired

from his job, even though kept as a union member, for
expressing views in opposition to the union leadership.--9'/

rights to appointed officials. Judge Kennedy dissented from
this part of the holding, stating that Finnecran controlled,
that federal judges should exercise restraint with respect to
internal union affairs, and that there is no protection if
union officials must Mlchoos[e] between their rights of free
expression ... and their jobs.1"-"'

                 Judge Kennedy found no free speech rights in a
criminal tax case. In United States v. Freeman.--' Freeman
claimed as defense to a charge that he had aided and abetted
violation of the tax laws the fact that he had only advocated
tax noncompliance and that this was speech protected by the
First Amendment. Judge Kennedy stated that the First
Amendment did not bar prosecution but conceded where there is
some evidence that the purpose of the speaker or the tendency
of his words are directed to ideas or consequences remote
from the commission of the criminal act, a First Amendment
defense would be a legitimate matter for the jury's
consideration. Writing for the court, he affirmed the
convictions on two counts where the court felt no First

Amendment activity was implicated but reversed twelve counts
where the court should have instructed the jury on the issue.

                 Judge Kennedy addressed the issue of obscenity only
indirectly in United States v. Sherwin;^-' In this case, a
magistrate ordered the seizure of a shipment of allegedly
obscene materials after receiving an affidavit describing the
shipment and specifying that the shipment included an
allegedly obscene magazine, Private No. 8, whose contents
were described in the affidavit. Judge Kennedy held for the
en bane court that no prior adversarial hearing was
necessary, even though materials arguably protected by the
First Amendment were to be seized. Instead, following Heller
v. New York.--' all the Constitution required was a personal
examination and determination of probable cause for obscenity
by a neutral magistrate. The defendants are entitled to a
hearing after the seizure, but Judge Kennedy was silent on
what constitutes obscene material and how a magistrate should
evaluate materials.

                 In a footnote in Sherwin. Judge Kennedy observed
that when materials are seized in violation of the First
Amendment, the appropriate remedy is the return of the seized

property, but not its suppression as evidence.---* However,
in a related case,-^-' where Judge Kennedy sat on the panel
and concurred in the result, the court held that other
magazines seized simultaneously with Private No. 8 were
improperly seized because they were not identified in the
search warrant. Since these magazines were arguably pro-
tected by the First Amendment, the nexus and plain view
exceptions to the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against
unreasonable searches and seizures were irrelevant. As a
result, both the police officer's affidavit to the magistrate
and the magistrate's seizure order must be specific to
prevent police officers from making ad hoc determinations of
obscenity.

                 In a difficult decision regarding political
contributions, Judge Kennedy agreed that Congress could limit
the contributions. In California Medical Ass'n v. Federal
Election Comm'n.^-^ Judge Kennedy upheld for the en bane
court the constitutionality of the Federal Election Campaign
Act (the MFEC") from challenges that its limitation on

contributions to a political action committee ("pac")
infringed First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court had
previously held that it was constitutional to limit
individual contributions to candidates. Judge Kennedy
concluded that if persons could make unlimited contributions
to pacs, which in turn could make contributions to
candidates, the limitation an individual contributions to
candidates could easily be evaded. Relying on Buckley v.

          18/
         ,-*-^ Judge Kennedy indicated that such contributions,
unlike limitations on expenditures, are really symbolic acts
of support rather than articulation of ideas. Limitations on
contributions do not significantly diminish the effectiveness
or quantity of speech since the FEC does not foreclose
unlimited spending by individuals on their own. However, as
Judge Wallace observed in partial dissent, the limitations
upon contributions to candidates by individuals is intended
to thwart the corruptive quid pro quo of a direct gift to a
candidate; this concern is irrelevant with a contribution to
a pac.

                 Some of Judge Kennedy's cases raise concerns about
his willingness to restrict rights of free speech. He has
several times gone beyond Supreme Court precedent to do so.

B. Freedom of Speech vs. State and Local Lavs
                 In two cases touching free speech issues Judge

Kennedy has sought to block the requested relief by invoking
strict application of abstention principles, whereby the
federal court dismissed the case and relegated the plaintiff
to state court proceedings.

                 In World Famous Drinking Emporium. Inc. v. City of
Tempe.--' the owner of a go-go dancing club challenged zoning
and nuisance laws as violative of his civil rights under the
Federal Constitution. Prior to commencing the federal
action, the owner had sued and had been sued by the City of
Tempe in the state courts. The majority affirmed the dis-
missal of the federal suit on abstention grounds, under
Younger v. Harris2--0'/ which permits federal courts to abstain
when: there are on-going state proceedings; important state
interests are implicated; and there is an adequate
opportunity to raise federal issues in the state proceedings.
Judge Kennedy concurred in the judgment, stating that Younger
and the related Huffman v. Pursue. Ltd.^^ controlled.

                 In a different municipal ordinance case concerning
billboards, Judge Kennedy wrote for a unanimous court that
the federal statute under which the advertiser sought relief
did not create a private right of action. Ordinarily the
court could then stop and remand the case, as it did, to see
if the advertiser might also win on its state law claims.
However, the court through Judge Kennedy raised on its own
the question whether abstention was appropriate under another
line of Supreme Court cases. The court left this issue open,
but it implicitly forced the issue in the district court
during the proceedings on remand.2--2'/

                 Hence, in two cases, Judge Kennedy used a
procedural ground -- abstention -- to decline to rule on
First Amendment rights.

C. Rights of the Press and Libel Law
                 In contrast to the Free Speech cases above, Judge

Kennedy has generally shown himself sympathetic to the media,
protecting it from prior restraints and the chilling effects
of libel suits. He does not think courts should interfere
with their editorial function and grants them deference.

Corp.,--3-/ Goldblum, who had been imprisoned for his
participation in a securities fraud, attempted to enjoin NBC
from televising a film about him. Goldblum argued that the
film would jeopardize his release on parole and his right to
a fair trial in a pending civil action. Judge Kennedy held
for the court that a district court's order to submit the
film for prior review was a prior restraint and therefore
presumptively unconstitutional. Judge Kennedy supported the
fundamental principle of the First Amendment that the press
may not be required to justify or defend what it prints or
says until after the expression has taken place in strong
language writing:

                 We find no authority which is even a remote
                 justification for issuance of a prior
                 restraint . . . . The order not only created a
                 reasonable apprehension of an impending prior
                 restraint, it was also a threatened interference
                 with the editorial process.^
                 Judge Kennedy has also ruled in favor of the press
in libel cases. In Church of Scientology of California v.
Adams,--' the Church of Scientology of California sued a St.

Louis newspaper for libel regarding a series of articles
about Scientology. The action was brought in California
although the newspaper's contact with California was minimal.
Less than 200 copies of the newspaper reached California.
Judge Kennedy concluded for the court that this contact was
insufficient to make it appropriate for a court in California
to hear the case. Conceding that copies of most major
newspapers will be found throughout the world, Judge Kennedy
stated that he did not "think it consistent with fairness to
subject publishers to personal jurisdiction solely because an
insignificant number of copies of their newspapers were
circulated in the forum state."--' He therefore affirmed the
district court's dismissal. Judge Kennedy cited no support
for this proposition, which is inconsistent with Buckley v.
New York Post Corp.^--' and Anselmi v. Denver Post. Vac A--'

                 Instead, according to Judge Kennedy, the test for
defamation jurisdiction was "whether or not it was foresee-
able that a risk of injury by defamation would arise in the

forum state." In a conclusory statement, he decided it was
unforseeable.

                 In another libel decision, Judge Kennedy also ruled
in favor of the press. In Koch v. Goldvay,^--^ the mayor of
Santa Monica attacked U s e Koch, a German national and
opponent of the mayor, by allegedly saying "there was a
well-known Nazi war criminal named U s e Koch during World War
II. Like Hitler, U s e Koch was never found. Is this the
same U s e Koch?" Asserting that a statement is defamatory
only if it is a statement of fact (and not merely an
opinion), Judge Kennedy concluded for the court that the
statement was not factual since the plaintiff had been born
in the 1940s1 and thus could not be the war criminal.
Instead the mayor's statement was only a vicious slur and
thus not libel. Despite apparent disgust toward the mayor,
Judge Kennedy concluded that the plaintiff had no redress and
agreed with the district court that summary judgment for
Goldway was proper.

                 In another of Judge Kennedy's media decisions,
Judge Kennedy ruled that CBS had a right of access to docu-
ments filed in connection with criminal proceedings. Judge
Kennedy conceded that the press's right of access has limits.

Private property interests and the right to a fair trial
might overcome the right to access, but the interests oppos-
ing access must be specified with particularity and the
denial of access must be narrowly tailored to serve that
interest. However, in the instant case the government had
not done this, and the court issued the requested writ of
mandamus.--'

                 Overall Judge Kennedy has supported First Amendment
rights of the press.

D. Commercial Speech
                 Judge Kennedy has recognized that limitations on

the speech rights of businesses raise First Amendment con-
cerns. In FTC v. Simeon Management Corp..--' he wrote a
unanimous opinion affirming the denial of a preliminary order
banning unfair and deceptive practices by Simeon pending a
final resolution of the FTC's contentions. Simeon ran
several weight-loss centers whose clients used a legal drug
as part of the program, even though the FDA had not
specifically approved the drug for that purpose. The opinion
emphasized the narrow scope of appellate review of such an

order and noted the necessity of judicial review of any FTC
determination affecting First Amendment rights. He also
argued that it was dangerous to ban speech relating to
underlying activities that are themselves legal.

                 In another case the FTC found false some advertis-
ing for a gasoline additive and broadly banned future decep-
tions by the advertising agency that produced the advertise-
ments and the oil company that manufactured the product. A
unanimous opinion by Judge Kennedy affirmed the FTC findings
but narrowed the order to the particular product reviewed.
To allow the FTC to reviev all future claims by either
company regarding any product they promote, wrote Judge
Kennedy, amounts to an oppressive prior restraint on pro-
tected s p e e c h . ^

E. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
                 Judge Kennedy has limited FOIA when confronted with

conflicting statutes. In United States v. United States
District Court.*--* John DeLorean had made a FOIA request for
documents relating to his activities. Judge Kennedy held for
a unanimous court that, because DeLorean was a criminal

defendant at the time and the documents were for his defense,
he was limited by the requirements of Rule 16 of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure specifying the discovery permis-
sable in criminal cases. Judge Kennedy wrote that FOIA could
not be used as an alternative discovery mechanism. Therefore,
the court vacated the district's order to supply the informa-
tion. This decision places a restriction on FOIA requests
not stated in the statute and hampers the ability of any
criminal defendants to discover the nature of the charges
against them.

                 On the other hand, in Long v. I R S .3--4'/ Judge Kennedy
wrote for a unanimous panel rejecting various objections by
the IRS to information requests in order to fulfill the
stated congressional policy mandating the fullest possible
disclosure. Burden on the government, as long as not totally
unreasonable, was irrelevant. When the IRS still refused to
comply, Judge Kennedy joined a unanimous opinion reversing
the district court and ordering compliance by an injunc-
tion.--' In a concurrence joined by the other members of the

                                    FREEDOM OF RELIGION

Introduction
                 Judge Kennedy's record on the religion clauses of

the First Amendment is extremely limited. Judge Kennedy has
had only two cases that directly implicate First Amendment
issues. While Judge Kennedy has sat on a few additional
panels that raised issues relating to the religion clauses,
these issues were not central to those decisions.

                 Due to the paucity of decisions, it is impossible
to discern Judge Kennedy's views in this area. Further,
Judge Kennedy has not enunciated a systematic approach to
interpretation and application of the religion clauses but
instead addresses these issues on a case by cases basis.
Perhaps because he has not developed a methodology,
Judge Kennedy follows precedent closely. Judge Kennedy's
predelictions as a Supreme Court Justice, when he is less
bound by precedent, or when confronted with a case of first
impression, are difficult to discern.

Analysis
                 Judge Kennedy's most notable opinion is Graham v.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service.-^ In Graham,
members of the Church of Scientology ("the Church") appealed
a decision of the United States Tax Court that they were not
entitled to deduct from their taxes as charitable donations
certain payments made to the Church. Church members argued
that denial of certain charitable contribution deductions
violated their rights under the free exercise and establish-
ment clauses of the First Amendment. These clauses state:
"Congress shall make no law respecting on establishment of
religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Addi-
tionally, the Church members alleged that the Commissioner
had selectively enforced the tax laws against them, and not
against other churches.

                 The Tax Court found that, as part of its religious
training, the Church provided numerous services to its
adherents in a commercial manner. The Tax Court held that
payments made by Church members to the Church were not
contributions or gifts but, rather, transfers made with the
expectation of receiving a commensurate gift in return.

U 822 F.2d 844 (9th Cir. 1987).
                                  1062

                                                                                                 144

                 Three issues were raised on appeal: (1) did the
payments to the Church qualify for treatment as charitable
deductions under the Internal Revenue Code; (2) was there a
free exercise violation; and (3) was there selective enforce-
ment of the laws against the Church.

                 Relying on recent Supreme Court precedent,^
Judge Kennedy, writing for the court, held that where a
contributor "expects a substantial benefit in return, then
the contribution cannot be deducted."^ Because the facts in
Graham evidenced an expectation, a quid pro quo, of some
service from the church, the payments to the Church were not
entitled to charitable deduction treatment under I.R.C.
 170.

                 Addressing the free exercise issue, Judge Kennedy,
again relying on explicit Supreme Court precedent, held that
to show a free exercise violation, the Church member has the
burden of demonstrating that a "governmental regulatory
mechanism burdens the adherent's practice of his or her
religion by pressuring him or her to commit an act forbidden
by the religion or by preventing him or her from engaging in

conduct or having a religious experience which the faith
mandates."--' Judge Kennedy reasoned that the fact that
government does not "subsidize" a religious practice does not
"create a burden" on the free exercise of religion.--'
Moreover, Judge Kennedy held that the government was a com-
pelling state interest in promoting charitable gifts and
contributions and in the maintenance of a uniform tax system.
This interest justified any possible burden on the exercise
of the taxpayers' religion.

                 Judge Kennedy's opinion easily dispensed with the
appellant's establishment clause argument by pointing out the
neutral application of I.R.S. rules for charitable deductions
and, even assuming that the tax law, although neutral in its
purpose, "has the effect of treating Scientologists more
harshly than other religions, this disparate effect is not
unconstitutional, for the reason that the government has a
sufficient and compelling justification for its rule, in the
context of tax law."--'

v. Boeing Co..--' Judge Kennedy joined an opinion addressing
the accommodation of religion in the workplace. Boeing Co.
was only the second Court of Appeals decision to consider
these issues after the Supreme Court's decision in Estate of
Thornton v. Caldor. Inc.--' which struck down a Connecticut
law requiring employers to respect any Sabbath day off
requested by employees.

                 In Boeing Co.. Nichols, a Boeing employee, refused
to join the Machinists Union, which was required for her job.
Nichols asserted that union membership and support of labor
organizations were contrary to her religious convictions.
Instead she offered to contribute a sum equal to her union
dues to charity. The Machinists union rejected the offer and
requested that she be discharged. Boeing asserted that
discharge would violate the discrimination laws -- Title VII
-- which require employers to take reasonable steps to
accommodate the religious beliefs of their employees.--'

                 Relying on Ninth Circuit and Supreme Court prece-
dent, the court in Boeing, joined by Judge Kennedy held that

substitution of a charitable contribution in lieu of joining
or supporting a labor union was a reasonable accommodation
under the discrimination laws.

                 The court further held the provisions of the
discrimination laws were constitutional under the establish-
ment clause of the First Amendment because they were enacted
to promote the secular purpose of prohibiting discrimination
in the workplace. The substituted charity allows the adher-
ent to work without violating his religious beliefs and
without increasing or decreasing the advantages of membership
in a religious faith; and the accommodation would not result
in excessive governmental entanglement with religion because
a court's only task is to determine the sincerity of the
adherent's beliefs. In reaching this conclusion, the court
relied on the Lemon v. Kurtzman.--' test repeatedly embraced
by Supreme Court precedent.

                 The court in Boeing Co. correctly distinguished
Estate of Thornton v. Caldor. Inc.. a recent Supreme Court
opinion invalidating a Connecticut law requiring an unquali-
fied accommodation to an employee, on the ground that there
was a complete failure to take into account the interests of
the employer and other employees in accommodating the

were considered. The court in Boeing Co. reasoned that if
there had been a greater hardship upon the union, through a
widespread refusal to pay union dues, for example, the chari-
table contribution might have been disallowed.

                                     PRISONERS' RIGHTS
Introduction
                 Judge Kennedy has decided very few cases involving
prisoners' rights -- prisoners' civil suits for damages or to
obtain better conditions in prisons. In these few decisions
he relies heavily on prior precedent, where available. He
will support the prisoners' claims when presented with facts
clearly indicating official misconduct. But he appears
unwilling to expand legal doctrines to allow prisoners
greater rights than those previously established. He has
also restricted prisoners' rights based on unduly narrow
readings of procedural rules.

Analysis
                 Judge Kennedy at times is reluctant to decide

prisoners' rights cases, when he can avoid doing so on

Judge Kennedy denied as moot a claim of a former maximum
security prisoner regarding allegedly undue restrictions on
his access to a prison law library. The prisoner has been
transferred from a maximum security facility to a vocational

                                                                                                 150

school while his suit was pending. Judge Kennedy decided
that this mooted the Claim, vacating the lower court's
injunction requiring better access to the library.

                 In deciding the mootness issue Judge Kennedy used
the traditional test of whether the issue was "capable of
repetition yet evading review." Judge Kennedy, rejecting the
possibility that the prisoner could be transferred or con-
victed again, stated that the case was moot because there was
no reasonable expectation that the claimant would be sub-
jected to the same action again.*' He further held that the
claim was not one that would evade review because it had been
reviewed in the prisoner's suit for damages and other prison-
ers could bring it. He further stated that the exception was
limited to extraordinary cases where the challenged action is
of limited duration.^ The dissent, written by Judge
Fletcher, criticized Judge Kennedy for not remanding the case
to the trial court for fact finding to determine the applic-
ability of this fact-based exception to the mootness bar.^
The dissent noted the possibility that prisoners may be
transferred after claims are brought and that maximum

security is often of limited duration, thus making claims
less likely to be reviewable.-^ Judge Fletcher further
stated that it was not "absolutely clear," as the Supreme
Court requires, that there was no reasonable expectation of
repetition because the prisoner was in fact awaiting trial on
charges brought against him while on parole.--' Judge Kennedy's
interpretation of the mootness doctrine was unduly narrow and
not required by Supreme Court precedent.

                 In another case, Judge Kennedy took a middle ground
between upholding prisoners' rights and denying them. In
Spain v. Procunier.--' Judge Kennedy modified the lower
court's finding that certain practices of the San Quentin
prison guards violated the inmates' constitutional rights.
These practices included the use of tear gas to remove
uncooperative prisoners from their cells, the requirement
that the prisoners wear various mechanical restraints, and a
denial of outdoor exercise. On the one hand, while Judge
Kennedy's opinion upheld the lower court's finding that the
denial of outdoor exercise violated the Eighth Amendment, and

modified the lower court's ruling to enjoin the Department of
Corrections from violating their new regulations regarding
mechanical devices.--' On the other hand, Judge Kennedy
finding a split in the precedents regarding tear gas, decided
to allow its use in certain circumstances, and remanded the
case to the district court for the formulation of specific
standards.-^ Judge Kennedy permitted the use of low doses of
tear gas on prisoners in their cells, despite allegations
that it caused anguish to prisoners in adjacent cells who
were cooperating with prison officials.

                 In addition, Judge Kennedy has several times upheld
the rights of prisoners when he found obvious official
misconduct. For example, in Jones v. Taber.^--' a convicted
felon awaiting sentencing in prison was taken from his cell,
stripped, gagged, bound, chained to a wall, doused with cold
water, and beaten with a night stick for three to five hours.
He was then put into a special segregation facility for 19
days and subsequently signed a release of his civil rights
claims. Judge Kennedy, reversing and remanding summary
judgment, ruled in favor of the prisoner. He held that the

voluntariness of the release was to be determined with
reference to the coerciveness of atmosphere, including the
factors of a lack of counsel, the prisoner's testimony that
his refusal to sign would lead to harsher treatment, a
minimal attempt to explain nature of waiver, and the prison-
er's placement in special segregation for over two weeks
before the release was offered. Judge Kennedy did note that
voluntariness did not require the presence or assistance of
counsel although the lack of it was a consideration.--'

                 In another case of particularly egregious official
misconduct, Judge Kennedy also ruled in favor of the prisoner.
In Bouse v. Bussev.--' Judge Kennedy joined in a per curiam
decision reversing the district court's dismissal of a prison
inmate's suit against prison guards for forceably taking a
sample of the inmate's pubic hair without a warrant. The
decision found that while "some investigative procedures
designed to obtain incriminating evidence from the person are
such minor intrusions upon privacy and integrity that they

invasion upon the most intimate parts of [plaintiff's]
anatomyn^* were subject to constitutional protections. The
court, citing United States v. Cameron.^-' held that a
search, in order to comport with the Fourth Amendment reason-
ableness requirement, must minimize emotional and physical
trauma.*--' Finding that the search at issue did not meet
that standard, the court reversed and remanded.

                 Another example of Judge Kennedy supporting prison-
ers1 rights is Akao v. Shimoda.1--7'/ There he joined a per
curiam opinion reversing the trial court's dismissal of a
complaint by prisoners without a lawyer ("pro se" complaint)
that alleged that prison overcrowding violated the prisoners'
right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. The
prisoners alleged that due to population increase, there was
an increase in stress, tension, communicable diseases and
confrontations between inmates. The lower court held that
the prisoners failed to state a claim under the Eighth Amend-
ment. The Ninth Circuit held that while it is true that the

allegation of overcrowding without more does not state a
claim under the Eighth Amendment, the complaint had alleged
more than this and should not have been dismissed without
permitting the prisoners the opportunity to file an amend-
ment.^1^ The court stressed that a pro se complaint was to
be held to a less strict standard than complaints drafted by
attorneys and that dismissal was only appropriate if it was
"beyond a doubt" that prisoners could prove no set of facts
that would entitle them to relief.-^--' It remanded the case
to the district court to allow the prisoners to file an
amendment.

                 Further, in Bartholomew v. Watson.--' Judge Kennedy
joined an opinion written by Judge Alarcon holding that
prison procedures that precluded an inmate from calling
another inmate or a prison staff member as a witness before a
disciplinary committee in all cases involving institutional
security violated minimal due process. Noting that such
testimony is usually the most relevant evidence a prisoner
could offer, the court stated that it could not be barred
absent a case-by-case determination of the potential hazards

                      Washington, D.C. 20510

                      Dear Senator Biden:

                      Two weeks ago, Audrey Feinberg testified on behalf of
                      The Nation Institute before your Committee on the
                      record of Judge Anthony Kennedy. As she stated, the
                      Institute concluded after extensive research that
                      aspects of Judge Kennedy's civil rights record, par-
                      ticularly in the area of discrimination, were deeply
                      troubling. Moreover, Judge Kennedy's case-by-case
                      method, and his usually short opinions, made it
                      difficult to ascertain his views on key constitutional
                      issues.

                      Judge Kennedy's testimony did little to allay the Insti-
                      tute's fears. Judge Kennedy avoided making substantive
                      responses to questions in some important areas, and was
                      not questioned at all in ether areas. Unless our con-
                      cerns are addressed by Jucge Kennedy, The Nation Institute
                      cannot endorse his nomination.

OAI> nr Tti ISTEES  Our written testimony included twenty suggested questions
                      for the Senate to ask Judge Kennedy. Many of these ques-
Haywood Bums _ --     tions remain unanswered. Moreover, the hearings raised
Uslie-Dmibar ~ ~ ~    additional concerns. As a result, we have attached an

When our panel was testifying before the Committee., you
commented:

             I have grave doubts about Judge Kennedy;
             grave doubts. And quite frankly, if I
             was certain that he was going to rule on
             the bench in the Supreme Court exactly
             how he has been for the last fifty-two
             years of his life, I do not see how I
             could vote- for him, to tell you the
             truth; it would be awfully tough.

  We appreciate the honesty of your statement and we share
  your doubts. We believe, however, that the burden of
  proof should be on the nominee to relieve these doubts.
  You and your Committee should not have to guess about a
  nominee's sensitivity to civil rights and civil liber-
  ties .issues; failure to satisfy doubts in these critical
  areas would be doing yourselves and the American public
~a great disservice.

iln this spirit, we hope that you will make certain that
 the many remaining concerns about Judge Kennedy axe
 fully examined. A position on the Supreme Court is too
 important to leave to guesswork.

Ifaank you.                         .

                                1077

              Questions the Senate Should Ask Judge Kennedy

Discrimination ir Employment
           1. Do customers" gender preferences excuse employment

discrimination?
                   In Gerdom v. Continental Airlines, 692 F.2d 602

(9th Cir. 1982) (en bane), cert, dismissed, 460 U.S. 1074
(1983), Judge Kennedy joined a dissent stating that airline
passengers' perceived preferences for slender flight atten-
dants might permit the airline to impose strict weight
requirements on vcr^n but not on men. A majority of the
Ninth Circuit rejected this view.

           2. Can Congress require affirmative action as a remedy
for intentional discrimination?

           3. Are the courts powerless to remedy wage disparities
between men and women in government jobs requiring comparable
education, skills, and effort?

                   In AFSCME v. State of Washington, 770 F.2d 1401
(9th Cir. 1985), Judge Kennedy denied relief to women employees

         ljBW- wages compared to men, based not only o n the contro--
           i"comparable worth theory, but also based on

traditional disparate impact analysis.
                                 1078

Discrimination in Voting Rights
            4. In Aranda v. Sickle, 600 F.2d 1267 (9th Cir. 1979),

cert, denied, 446 U.S. 951 (1980), why didn't Judge Kennedy
allow the Mexican-American plaintiffs to go forward and try
to prove discrimination at a trial?

                   Judge Kennedy testified that the remedy the plaintiffs
sought was not proper. But judges have the authority to
decide cases in two steps: liability and remedy. Also,
judges often substitute more appropriate remedies for the ones
requested by plaintiffs.
Discrimination in Private Clubs

           5. Does Judge Kennedy think that the Olympic Club
practices invidious discrimination? What is his definition
of invidious discrimination?

                   The ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 2 commen-
tary (1984) states that it is inappropriate for a judge to
belong to a private club that practices .nvidious discrimina-
tion.

Discrimination in Education
           6. When racially segregated neighborhood schools are

caused by racially segregated neighborhoods, -are the courts'
powerless to intervene?
                  1079

         In Spangler v. Pasadena City Board of Education, 611
F.2d 1239 (9th Cir. 1979), Judge Kennedy concurred in the
termination of court supervision of a school board, that had
been found liable for intentional race discrimination. Judge
Kennedy said that neutral school assignment systems in
already racially segregated neighborhoods may not represent
illegal discrimination by the school board.

           7. Under what circumstances, if ever, is school busing
a proper remedy for racially segregated schools?

Discrimination in Criminal Law
           8. Is the crime of rape of a woman less reprehensible

than the crime of-forcible sodomy of a man?
                   In United States v. Smith, 574 F.2d 988 (9th Cir .) ,

cert, denied sub nom. Williams v. United States, 439 U.S. 852
(1978), Judge Kenr3dy stated that a harsher sentence could be
imposed for forcible sodomy than for rape based on traditions
and community attitudes. He found no equal protection
violation for the different sentences.

Right of Privacy  :i :

_J  9. Is there a constitutional_right of privacy that ;_

protects marriage, contraception, and procreation? What are

the boundaries of any such right?
                    1080

Criminal Law
         10. Should the exclusionary rule, that excludes from

criminal trials evidence obtained through police misconduct,
be limited further?

                   In United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984), the
Supreme Court created an exception to the exclusionary rule
when police officers relied in good faith on a facially
deficient warrant. In United States v. Peterson, 812 F.2d
486 (9th Cir. 1987), a case that had nothing to do with a
deficient warrant, Judge Kennedy expanded the "good faith"
exception to include situ.. Lons where American officials
incorrectly relied on the assertion by foreign officials
that their overseas search was not illegal. How broadly
does Judge Kennedy interpret the "good faith" exception?
In what additional circumstances other than a facially
deficient warrant would he apply this exception?

11. Does Judge Kennedy agree with the Supreme Court's

pronouncements that because death is different in its

severity and finality from all other sentences, the imposi-

tion of capital punishment must be attended by procedural

safeguards that might not be^guaranteed by the Constitution

In other contexts?  .- . ~ -. - -
                                1081

         12. Should the police ever be required to supply
additions to the standard Miranda warnings if a suspect's
special circumstances suggest he may unknowingly waive his
constitutional rights?

                   In United States v. Contreras, 755 F.2d 733 (9th
Cir.), cert, denied, 476 U.S. 832 (1985), Judge Kennedy
affirmed convictions of defendants who mistakenly thought
their statements were taken under a grant of immunity.

         13. What sorts of errors by criminal defense counsel
suggest that he is providing less than the constitutionally
required "effective assistance" of counsel?

                   In United States v. Medina-Verdugo, 637 F.2d 649
(Uth <;ir. 1980), Judge Kennedy held that "counsel need not
be infallible" but only reasonably competent.

         14. Should an appellate judge defer in all circumstances
to a trial court's determination of effective assistance of
counsel?

                   Judge Kennedy suggested extreme deference in
Satchel 1 v. Cardwell, 653 F.2d 408, 414 (9th Cir. 1981) -(Kennedy,
J., concurring), cert. denied, 4 54 U.S. 1154 (1982K -

Freedom of Speech and Association
         15. To what extent do government workers have First

Amendment rights?
                                  1082

                   In Singer v. United States Civil Service Commission,
530 F.2d 247 (9th Cir. 1976), vacated, 429 U.S. 1034 (1977),
Judge Kennedy joined in an opinxon, later vacated .by the
Supreme Court, supporting the termination of a government
employee for publicly asserting his homosexuality. The
employee was active in the Seattle Gay Alliance, had displayed
homosexual advertisements in his automobile, and publicly
announced his homosexuality.

Judicial Philosophy
         16. To what extent should :>ie courts, in interpreting

the Constitution, move beyond the framers^ initial conceptions
of its provisions to a more flexible reading of the ideals and
goals it expresses?

         17. To what extent should principles of federalism
affect the abilities of civil rights litigants to seek
redress in the federal courts?

                   Judge Kennedy has often advocated judicial re-
straint and vigorous assertion of various principles of
federalism, such as abstention, that require that federal
courts not hear cases in which-state courts are already --
involved. For example, in World Famous Drinking Emporium
v. City of Tempe, 820 F.2d 1079 (9th Cir. 1987), Judge
          1083

Kennedy, in a concurrence, stated that federal courts should
not hear this First Amendment challenge that was also litigated
as a zoning dispute in the state courts. In this case, the
owner of a dance club challenged zoning requirements and other
state laws that would have restricted his club.

         18. Does the nominee believe it would be constitutional,
as some have proposed, to limit the jurisdiction of Article
III courts to eliminate cases involving sexual and racial
discrimination, habeus corpus, prisoner civil rights complaints,
social security cases, and environmental cases with only
limited possibility of review?

Religion                            

19. Is a short morning prayer conducted in public

elementary schools constitutional?

         20. To what extent must employers and unions modify
their rules and methods to accommodate an employee's
religious practices?

                   Judge Kennedy's opinion in International Association
of -Machinists  Aerospace Workers v; Boeing Co., Nos. 86-4345,
86-4373 (9th Cir. Nov. 27, 1987) (available Dec. 2, 1987 on
LEXIS, Genfed library, Usapp file), upheld a worker's objection
to paying union dues on religious grounds.

        Mr. Chairman, Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it is an honor to
present you with the following testimony concerning the nomination of Judge Anthony
Kennedy to the United States Supreme Court. I am Kate Michelman, and I present
this testimony on behalf of the National Abortion Rights Action League, a
grassroots political organization with a state and national membership of over
250,000 women and men. I am NARAL's Executive Director.
         The June 26, 1987 resignation of Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. left the Supreme
Court divided on many critical issues, including the constitutionality of state
laws proscribing or limiting women's access to safe and legal abortion. In the
almost 15 years since the Roe v. Wade decision, popular acceptance of women's
rights has increased dramatically; yet many state legislatures have continued to
deny that their female citizens ought to have the right to control their
fertility.* Therefore, the willingness of the United States Supreme Court to
protect women's reproductive liberty remains crucial to the health and independence
of American women.
         The nomination of Anthony Kennedy -- who believes that modern constitutional
jurisprudence has improperly distorted the Founders' original design, and who has
shown marked insensitivity to the nuances df gender-based discrimination -- should
be unsettling to those concerned with the health and legal status of women in
America. Much like Robert Bork, Kennedy aims his criticisms not at social
injustice but at modern civil rights law; in his words, "judicial power without
rational restraints is simply the exercise of raw will, the arrogance of power."^
In practice, this rejection of what he calls "judicial activism" has amounted to an
abdication of judicial responsibility to protect individual rights. Because for
women reproductive freedom is an essential guarantor of all other rights and
liberties, the National Abortion Rights Action League finds Anthony Kennedy a
                                       1086

deeply disturbing candidate for the United States Supreme Court.

A. The Constitutional Stakes Remain High
         In the thirty-three years since the Brown v. Board of Education decision, a

generation has been raised with the inspiration of a Supreme Court devoted to
principles of racial equality and respect for individual integrity. And due to the
vast improvements in women's legal status, many of us rightfully expect that our
government will be rational, fair, and accountable -- that irrespective of our
status as female citizens, we will be treated with respect.

         The 1973 Roe v. Wade^ and Doe v. Bolton** decisions were among the most
significant and symbolic of these improvements. In Roe and Doe, the Supreme Court
stated clearly that women's interest in privacy and personal liberty is
constitutionally protected and that states may not abridge the traditional common
law right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy without violating women's fundamental
rights. In the fourteen years since then, in nearly two dozen cases, the Court has
systematically reaffirmed that "few decisions are more personal and intimate, more
properly private" than those concerning reproduction.*

         Regaining the legal authority to make conscientious decisions about child-
bearing, without fear and without degradation, radically altered the lives of
American women. For the ability to control fertility determines whether women can
govern their lives; without that power, women spend roughly half their years as
slaves to biology and captives of chance. Even when women use the most reliable
contraception available, conscientiously, statistics indicate that almost half of
them will become pregnant at least once during their reproductive years, without
intending to do so and in spite of their best efforts/*

          And control over reproduction is more than just a matter of biology; it

                                                                                                                   4
empowers women with the knowledge that they need not live in fear of another
pregnancy, that they have options. Seeing herself less as an incubator and more as
an independent, capable person, each woman is free to develop her own sense of
identity and self-esteem, and to lead a life of self-determination and dignity.

         Often there is a misapprehension that support for reproductive choice,
including abortion rights, is selfish, "unnatural," and incompatible with a concern
for the well-being of families. In reality, quite the opposite is true. Women are
the primary caretakers in our society, and enhancement of the well-being of women
is integral to the stability and well-being of their families. Families benefit
when women choose to have abortions in order to care adequately for existing
children. Families benefit when women choose abortion in order to get education
and employment that will allow them to become better providers. Women exercise
their reproductive choices in an effort to create the quality family lives that
should be possible for all people in our society -- women, men and children
equally. They may choose to enlarge their families or not to bear children -- but
it is their choice to make.

          Because of Roe and Doe, women no longer need to submit to the hazards and
 terrors of illegal abortions, as history shows they inevitably do when safe and
 legal abortion services are denied.7 Thus, both analytically and practically, the
 right to choose abortion is for women an essential guarantor of all other basic
 rights and freedoms.

          However, our future as a nation devoted to the principle of respect for
 individual integrity is no longer clear; and for women this is especially
 frightening. If federal constitutional protection of reproductive decision-making
 were to be nullified, women could not be secure that state legislatures would
 respect their reproductive privacy. The states have proven intransigent on the
                                       1088

                                                                                                                   5
issue of abortion rights, despite the fact that the vast majority of Americans
consistently supports women's privacy."

         NARAL's recent study of state abortion laws indicateed that if Roe is
overturned, physicians in many states will face criminal abortion statutes with
renewed enforceability. Litigation will be necessary in most jurisdictions; in at
least half of the states, access to legal abortion will be uncertain. In addition,
new restrictive legislation is very likely to be enacted; states will vary
substantially in the end, as they did prior to 1973, with many women again
suffering the health hazards and cost of interstate travel, and septic abortions.

         The array of restrictive laws now on the books leads us to fear that if the
Supreme Court grants the states greater authority to limit abortion, the action
will be taken as approval of such restrictions and as an invitation to enact them.
Those state legislators who have been nominally pro-choice because they tend to
favor the status quo may then support a restrictive law because they perceive the
new Supreme Court standard as a strong suggestion of what is constitutionally
appropriate.

         Our basic rights are a matter of principle. They must never be made
vulnerable to either the shifting tides of arbitrary public opinion or pork barrel
politics. But beyond the fact that it is constitutionally impermissible for the
basic rights of any group to be auctioned by a legislature, it is important to note
that state legislatures have been and are still peculiarly undemocratic on the
subject of women's reproductive rights.

         State lawmakers consistently ignore their pro-choice majority constituents.
As in the Southern state legislatures following Brown v. Board of Education, state
legislative activity is often characterized by hostility to women's rights and a
resentment of federal authority. Again like the civil rights struggle of Black
                                       1089

                                                                                                                   6
Americans, there has been an organized resistance to women's achievement of basic
rights. The strategy of the anti-choice forces has been to sponsor a plethora of
restrictive laws, and to flood the courts with legal challenges to Roe v. Wade.1^

         Those who oppose women's right to choose abortion often claim that it was
undemocratic for the courts, rather than the legislatures, to have established this
rule. In fact, the opposite is true. The history of Connecticut, where the anti-
contraception law prompted the Griswold case, illustrates how a majority can fail,
despite facially democratic procedures, to influence the legislature when
reproductive issues are concerned. The nineteenth-century anti-contraception
statute in Connecticut was first targeted for repeal in 1923. Repeal bills were
unsuccessful in every session of the legislature for forty years, until finally
birth-control proponents lost heart and tried another method -- the courts. Yet
Connecticut had one of the lowest birth rates in the nation, indicating widespread
use of contraceptives. The resolution of this paradox seems to be that the
Catholic Church was powerful enough to threaten reprisals against legislators who
were not themselves Catholic.1' Thus, as late as 196S, Connecticut women had to go
to clinics in New York or Rhode Island for contraceptives;12 and until 1973 they
went to New York for legal abortion services, with hazardous delay often resulting
from the long-distance travel.^

         The Founders were wise in not entrusting our liberties to one branch of
 government only. The system of checks and balances has, on the issue of repro-
 ductive privacy, assured that women would not be at the mercy of doctrinaire
 minorities who may from time to time control the legislative branch of government.
 The protection of reproductive rights by the Court is an appropriate exercise of
 their constitutional power.

          Judge Kennedy has stated his belief that during the past generation an
                                      1090

                                                                                                                   7
"activist" federal judiciary has improperly distorted our constitutional structure.
Like Robert Bork, he believes that it is the province of the legislative branch to
define the attributes of a "just" society; if citizens find their rights violated
by "unjust" laws, that injury should simply spur them to greater participation in
the political process.14 Yet, those who have witnessed with deep sadness and
frustration the increasing feminization of poverty and the rejection of the Equal
Rights Amendment, as two examples, find such reliance on the legislative process
disturbing.

         As the Court's 4 - 4 ruling of this past Monday, December 14 in Hartican v.
Zbaraz. regarding Illinois' restrictions on minors seeking abortion services, made
clear, the role of the federal courts as protectors of individual rights and
liberties is at stake. The Court is similarly split on a variety of other
difficult constitutional questions, including remedies for race and sex
discrimination, imposition of the death penalty, and the rights of gay people. The
nomination of Anthony Kennedy warrants the same careful scrutiny given the rejected
Bork nomination.

B. The Reagan Administration's Standards for Judicial Candidates Cause Concern
         Careful scrutiny of the Supreme Court nominee is especially important in view

of the Reagan Administration's stated goal of politicizing the judicial selection
process. President Reagan has twice run for the presidency on a platform that
pledged to " . . . work for the appointment of judges . . . who respect traditional
family values and the sanctity of innocent human life."15 From the outset, his
administration has made good on that promise - systematically selecting for the
federal bench judges who are loyal to the Reagan social agenda and join his
hostility to abortion.

  90-878 - 1133
                                         1091

                                                                                                                   8
        Unlike administrative branch appointments, this purposeful skewing of the
federal court system will be a lasting legacy because federal judges are appointed
for life. At present, forty-four percent of all current federal judges (333 of
761) are Reagan appointees.16
         The 1980 and 1984 elections have been falsely cited by the Administration as
implying broad public support for Reagan's anti-abortion, anti-family planning
policies; polls on reproductive choice consistently show strong public support for
the right to choose abortion. Reagan's pledge to remake the Supreme Court was the
centerpiece of his 1986 campaign efforts on behalf of Senate Republicans; the
voters soundly rejected the candidates and the platform, and transferred control of
the Senate back to the Democrats. The Bork confirmation battle showed that
Americans overwhelmingly support personal privacy, reproductive choice, and a
judiciary that will protect them.
         Judge Kennedy stated in his testimony before this committee that he has no
"set agenda" with respect to abortion rights. Without questioning his sincerity,
NARAL suggests that there may nonetheless be significance in Kennedy's history of
pro bono work for the Catholic Church,'7 and the endorsements he has received from
such opponents of legalized abortion as Senator Jesse Helms,18 the National Right
to Life Committee and the Pro-Life Action Network. Each Senator should satisfy him
or herself regarding Judge Kennedy's intellectual independence from the Justice
Department's social agenda before voting on this nomination.

C. Understanding of Kennedy's Judicial Philosophy is Essential
          Appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States is not an entitlement,

 it is a privilege to be conferred only after a demonstration of fitness in the
 fullest sense of the word. The burden of proof is on the nominee to show that his

       90-878 0 - 8 9 - 3 6
                                         1092

                                                                                                                    9
judicial philosophy is appropriate for our nation at this time.

         Perception of Kennedy as a moderate, compromise candidate must not be allowed
to overshadow his actual record. The Bork hearings established that proper
discharge of the Senate's duty to "advise and consent" requires a thorough review
of the record -- and that takes time. The White House packaged Robert Bork as a
moderate; a full 70 days of careful review proved that label wrong.

         A United States circuit judge since 1975, Kennedy has ruled in more than 1400
cases, and has written 450 opinions. Generally, these opinions have been brief and
narrow; he has carefully limited himself to the facts of the case before him, and
has avoided broad statements and commentary. Unlike Robert Bork, his views appear
primarily in these opinions -- there are no published articles and few speeches.
As a result, again unlike Robert Bork, Kennedy's overall judicial philosophy has
not been immediately obvious. To be fair to both Judge Kennedy and the American
public, the Senate must take adequate time to analyze Judge Kennedy's work.

         Although he has not had occasion to rule directly on questions of abortion,
reproductive rights or personal privacy, Judge Kennedy's decisions in other areas
do raise questions about how he views constitutional guarantees of equal justice
and women's rights. Upon first reading, the language of his rulings in the civil
rights area generally appears mild and receptive to claims of discrimination.
Frequently, his decisions have turned on procedural issues, and he has avoided
speaking harshly about the merits of a case. In rejecting the argument made by a
civil rights plaintiff, he has quite often added that alternative reasoning might
prove more promising. And, instead of throwing the case out of court, he has
frequently sent it back to the trial court for reconsideration.

          Yet, his overall record on race and sex discrimination, criminal law, labor,
and other areas is quite disturbing. First of all, women and minorities are able
                                       1093

                                                                                                                                  10
to prove their cases very rarely. In his court, their burden of proof is extremely
high, and he often rejects the trial court's factual findings. Second, in certain
of his controversial decisions, he explicitly -- and broadly -- bases the result or
his view that marketplace economic forces and business practices are presumptively
legitimate.19 Although the current nominee lacks Judge Bork's harsh language,
Kennedy's actions may prove comparable to Bork's in too many cases.

         Judge Kennedy has avoided disclosing whether or not he believes that Roe v.
Wade was correctly decided; his record shows him to be cautious and careful about
speaking solely to those issues before him. Nonetheless, he has stated that
justices should readily reconsider constitutional cases they believe to have been
wrongly decieed. T l iwise, he has not disclosed whether he would be reluctant to
overturn or erode Roc. Erosion could well be just as damaging as overturning Roe:
either way, the health and well-being of millions of Americans would be adversely
affected.

         Moreover, the right to choose abortion does not exist in a constitutional
vacuum. The Court is charged with producing a coherent theory of individual rights
that applies not only to abortion and contraception, but also -- as only a few
examples -- to forced sterilization,2^ state restrictions on marriage,21 and
interference with parental rights.22 The principles that have vindicated abortion
rights in more than a dozen Supreme Court cases also undergird the landmark
decisions securing American citizens from arbitrary state interference with private
relationships. Supreme Court abandonment of these principles would present the
horrifying specter of our crowded, high-technology society stripped of its most
elementary protection of personal integrity. It is incumbent upon each Senator to
 be sure that Judge Kennedy's views on the range of "fundamental" individual rights
include adequate protection for the family and personal lives of twentieth century
                                       1094

                                                                                                     n

Americans.
         In addition, it must be noted that this area of law has continued to develop

at a fast-pace in recent years. We are therefore unable to be reassured by
predictions that the Court would hold back from overruling Roe. Without explicitly
rejecting the right to privacy, or necessarily' disturbing other constitutional
principles in the family law area, the Court could effectively nullify women's
reproductive autonomy in various ways. For example, the Court could alter the
standard of review such that states would face a lesser burden of justification for
their anti-abortion laws; alternatively, the Court could find an increased
constitutional interest in fetal life, which states would be permitted to protect.

         Of these two possibilities, the second is especially threatening to women
because it could encourage, or even require, states to favor fetal interests over
the interests of adult women in a host of extreme ways. State police power might
be employed to ensure that women adhere to whatever medical, dietary, exercise, or
scheduling regimes a third party deems in the best interests of a developing embryo
or fetus. Recent state court interventions in medical contexts to order treatment
that pregnant women patients emphatically do not desire,^ and state criminal
prosecutions for "prenatal child abuse"24 -- on the grounds that a woman failed to
follow her doctor's orders -- show that such concerns are not far-fetched.

Conclusion
         The National Abortion Rights Action League wishes to impress upon each Senator

the seriousness of their constitutional charge in this judicial confirmation
process. Although it inspired the founding of our nation, Anthony Kennedy seems to
minimize the importance of ensuring that government respects and guarantees the
rights of individuals -- the counterbalancing role that the courts must play.
                                        1095

                                                                                                                                                        12

Given our nation's history of institutionalized injustice, he must be seen --
irrespective of his measured language -- as a reactionary when he champions the
majoritarian process of state legislatures,

         Although he has readily criticized the role of the courts. Judge Kennedy has
concealed his views on particular lines of cases. True judicial conservatives
honor precedent except in rare cases where they see no justifiable alternative. It
is imperative to know how "conservative" Kennedy would be on the high court.

         For women in our society, reproductive self-determination is an essential
guarantor of all other freedoms. The National Abortion Rights Action League is
deeply concerned that Judge Anthony Kennedy's record shows limited sensitivity to
the systemic injustices facing women in our society, and the essential role that
the federal courts have played and must continue to play in curbing the excesses of
legislative majorities. If Anthony Kennedy were to create a majority that no
longer recognizes and protects women's right to make personal decisions about
childbearing without coercive state interference, his appointment would place the
health and well-being of millions of American women and their families in jeopardy.
Before making him an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, therefore, each
Senator must be satisfied that he or she has faithfully discharged the duty owed to
the millions of female citizens whose lives and dignity are at stake. NARAL urges
each member of the Senate to withhold consent to this nomination unless and until
he or she is convinced that Judge Kennedy's commitment to the "rule of law"
includes a commitment to equal justice that guarantees female citizens their
fundamental rights. The Senate cannot afford to be wrong.

         damaging experience for women, it is also dangerous and often fatal. In 1962
         nearly 1,600 women were admitted to Harlem Hospital Center, in New York City,
         for incomplete abortions; 701 women were admitted to the University of
         Southern California-Los Angeles County Medical Center with septic abortions.
         In 1965, 20% of pregnancy-related deaths nation-wide were due to illegal or
         self-induced abortion. Six years prior to the Roe v. Wade decision, in 1967,

Courts, directed by Lynn Hecht Schafran, Esq. These Programs
enable judges to understand how stereotypes, myths and biases
about the nature and role of women and men affect fact-finding
and decision-making and courtroom interaction. They were the
catalysts for the establishment of about 15 task forces by
state chief justices throughout the nation to document gender
bias in their own court systems and to recommend ways to
eliminate it.

               NAWJ is very proud of its involvement with this
Project from the Project's inception, supporting it with funds
from the Women Judges Fund for Justice, and with the personal
participation of members.

              American Bar Association (ABA> Judicial Canons

               Another project to which many members have devoted
time and energy, is the effort to get the ABA to amend its code
of judicial conduct relating to membership in clubs with
discriminatory membership policies. This long, tedious,
on-going struggle to date has resulted in the ABA's adoption of
only a Commentary to its judicial Canon 2.

               Canon 2 proclaims "A JUDGE SHOULD AVOID IMPROPRIETY
AND THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY IN ALL HIS [SIC]
ACTIVITIES." The Commentary thereto states:

                "It is inappropriate for a judge to hold membership in
any organization that practices invidious discrimination on the
basis of race, sex, religion or national origin. Membership of
a judge in an organization that practices invidious
discrimination may give rise to perceptions by minorities,
women, and others, that the judge's impartiality is
impaired. . . . "

               The NAWJ strongly believes the ABA should embrace a
canon similar to the one adopted by the California judiciary in
1986.

                  Modification of California Judicial Canons

               California has some 1400 judges, almost all of whom
belong to the California Judges Association. Its judiciary
boasts a substantial and growing contingent of women judges,
the majority of whom are members of the NAWJ. These persons,
in cooperation with like-minded male judges, finally were able
at the annual conference in 1986 to convince the California
Judges Association membership to adopt the following canon:

                "C. It is inappropriate for a judge to hold
membership in any organization, excluding religious
       1100

organizations, that practices invidious discrimination on
the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin."

                               Judge Kennedy's Position

                 Because of the NAWJ's commitment to the fair
administration of justice and because of Its leadership
role, it is incumbent on the Association to express its
concerns with Judge Kennedy's recent, albeit past,
membership in at least one all-male club in California.

                 Be was a member of long standing in the Olympic
Club, which refuses to admit women members, until shortly
after his name was circulated for the Supreme Court vacancy.
Such lengthy membership raises questions as to his
sensitivity in the area of gender bias.

                 The MAWJ fervently hopes this Honorable Committee
will make a thorough and complete inquiry of Judge Kennedy
on this subject and satisfy itself in the premises.

                 Indeed, the Association would urge similar
inquiries on the matter of gender bias to be put to all
federal judicial nominees coming before this Committee.

                                           Conclusion

                 The NAWJ appreciates the opportunity to express
these views to this Committee. The Association further
looks forward to continuing its pursuit of a bias-free
judiciary, and its efforts to increase the numbers of women
in the federal judiciary, hopefully, with the assistance of
this Honorable Committee.

RE: CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY
           AS ASSOCIATE JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT

Dear Senator:

       I submit herewith my testimony on the confirmation
proceedings.

       The nomination of Judge Kennedy occurs at a point the
world is in the opening phases of the biggest financial
collapse in history. If the follies of the Hoover
administration and Congress, during the years 1929-1932, were
to be repeated, the magnitude of the financial collapse will
reach levels by sometime during not later than 1989, plunging
the world into an economic depression comparable to that
Europe has not suffered since the fourteenth century, with a
potential impact on the United States comparable to that
which afflicted Weimar Germany during the years 1929-1932.

       It is commonly assumed, from legends of the 1930s, that a
deep economic depression must follow such a deep financial
collapse, as night follows day. That assumption is in error.
Financial collapses do not cause economic depressions;
rather, depressions are caused by the blunders, both of
commission and omission, committed by governments in response
to a financial crash.

       The United States has suffered financial calamities
before; indeed, our present form of Federal government was
first inaugurated in the midst of what seemed to many a
virtual state of national bankrupcty. We have escaped from
each of these crises, to levels of prosperity greater than
ever before.

       There is no reason that the present financial collapse
should be an exception to that. Each time, we met and
overcame the crisis without proof of need to tamper with any
provision of our Constitution, or by any abrogation of our
 liberties. There is no need to do so now.
                                    1102

       Nonetheless, in the sheer magnitude of the present crisis,
there is a danger. The danger is, on the one hand, that some
may be tempted to copy forms of austerity seen during the last
years of Germany's Weimar Republic, leading our nation down the
road to some hideous tyranny, as occurred in Germany then. The
second danger is, that the three branches of our Federal
government might become engaged in a quarrel over required .
measures, and that out of the floundering into which we might
be plunged so, a combination of actions and inactions might
foster that spirit of desperation in which some tyrannical
folly might be fostered.

       In such circumstances, more than ever before during the
post-war period to date, we require an appropriate composition
of the justices of our Supreme Court. I set forth summarily,
the manner in which I see this connection more concretely.

       Any crisis of the sort into which we have entered now, is,
by its very nature, the outcome of an accumulation of wrong
policies by our government up to the point at which the crisis
has erupted. The challenge to government at such a point, is
either to uproot and replace the policies which have fostered
the calamity, or to attempt to defend those wrong policies, and
thus plunge the nation into disaster. So, government is faced
with the choice, either to make such relatively drastic changes
in long-embedded policy, and that in a brief span of time, or
to court incalculable disaster for refusing to do so.

       Any such sudden reversal in the mass of accumulated
monetary, economic, and fiscal policies over the recent twenty
years, threatens to become a constitutional crisis. Although,
in the present instance, no innovations are needed which are
contrary to the clear intent of the founders of our republic,
the mere fact that we have become accustomed to present
monetary, economic, and fiscal policies for so long, tends to
color them with an assumed force of precedent in constitutional
law. The next President, and the next Congress will be
confronted with the latter form of crisis.

       In this circumstance, it is urgent that the composition of
the justices of our Supreme Court tend to view the matter in
the way I have indicated. In short, they must place the lesser
weight on precedents of the recent twenty years, and find the
preponderance of authority in the traditions which preceded the
past twenty years, our original and prolonged tradition as a
nation committed to scientific and technological progress in a
capital-intensive, energy-intensive mode.

       There are three leading errors in policy-making,
accumulated over the recent twenty years, whose correction, or
absence of such correction will decide whether our nation
avoids a deep economic depression, or slides into the worst
calamity in our history. These are the introduction of a
                                   1103

neo-malthusian drift toward what is often called
"post-industrial society," the replacement of the pre-1968 form
of a gold-reserve monetary system of relatively stable
parities, by what is called a "floating exchange-rate" monetary
system, and an anti-scientific, anti-technology bias
contributed by a growing radical counterculture. Many
precedents in statute and judicial decisions have embedded
these three innovations into our official practice and
doctrine; these are the precedents which are threatening to
destroy our nation during the period ahead.

       If justices of the Supreme Court view these matters so, and
also view these matters from the standpoint of intent of our
Declaration of Independence and Federal Constitution, that
Court will be no obstacle to the necessary actions of President
and Congress, to the degree these necessary actions are indeed
consistent with the original intent of the law of our
republic. If the Court is of a contrary opinion, that contrary
view could foster a national catastrophe.

       Judge Kennedy appears a man qualified in his profession and
of good character, I know of no fault in him on that account.
His appointment to that body roust be assessed on two principal
grounds. First, his philosophy of constitutional law: does he
embrace the elaboration of natural law embodied in the
Declaration of Independence and Constitution, and with such
efficiency that he were disposed to uphold the overriding of
faulty precedents accumulated during the past twenty years?
Second, is he likely to become an effective advocate of that
persuasion among his peers on the Court?

       Ordinarily, great weight must be given to a President's
nomination of a justice of our Supreme Court. However, at this
juncture our President remains a stalwart advocate of those
policies which have brought us into the present financial
crisis, to such a degree that his views on these matters must
tend to color his judgment in selecting an appointment. This
matter must be examined, in the view that we can not mortgage
the future to those ideological habits from the recent past now
being discredited in fact. As the Preamble of our Constitution
instructs all who take the oath, it is to our posterity we are
indebted as much as to present and recent opinion.

                                                             Respectfully Yours,

                                                             Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr.

               ON THE NOMINATION OF
                 ANTHONY M. KENNEDY

  TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT
                                  1105

                                    INTRODUCTION
        The National Lawyers Guild and the Center for
Constitutional Rights are opposed to the nomination of
Judge Anthony Kennedy to the Supreme Court. We believe
that a justice of the Supreme Court must affirmatively
demonstrate a commitment to civil rights and civil
liberties and not merely be "not as bad as Judge Bork."
We hope that members of Congress and organizations who
opposed Judge Bork insist that the American people have
a right to a justice who will truly do justice. Judge
Kennedy is not such a nominee.
        The National Lawyers Guild is an organization of
9,000 members that has for 50 years worked for the
ideals of justice, equality, fairness and human dignity.
We have supported: the struggles of blacks, latinos,
women and other minorities to achieve full and equal
citizenship; working men and women in their efforts to
achieve the basic right to organize into unions, to
bargain collectively and to a fair wage and safe working
environment; the rights of gays and lesbians to equal
protection of the laws and to be free from the
imposition of intolerant legislatures' moral views; the
rights of the accused to due process and the right for
all citizens to be free from arbitrary and coercive
police practices; the full protection of our rights to
free expression, association and political change; and
the independence of lawyers who challenge governmental
                                  1106

policies.
        We are proud to represent the many lawyers who are

involved in the constant struggle to achieve a fair,
just and equitable society and we are proud to have
played a role in protecting the rights of those
courageous people who have participated in the great
social and legal struggles of our times.

        The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) is a
non-profit legal and educational organization dedicated
to advancing and protecting the Rights guaranteed by the
United States Constitution and the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. Founded in 1967 to aid the southern
civil rights movement, the CCR soon became an important
legal force in challenging unconstitutional government
conduct and in protecting the civil rights of oppressed
groups. Today, CCR litigates scores of civil rights
cases on behalf of women, Blacks, Latinos, Indians, Gays
and Lesbians. CCR's voting rights project in the South
has filed numerous cases challenging at-large elections
and other schemes for diluting minority strength.

                        WHY WE OPPOSE JUDGE KENNEDY
        Judge Kennedy repeatedly rules against
constitutional and statutory rights asserted by women,
homosexuals, Blacks, Latinos, Indians, aliens and
prisoners. His opinions express a strong pro-business,
anti-union and anti-employee bias. He favors the death
penalty and has watered down the protection against
                                 1107

illegal searches and seizures protected by the Fourth
Amendment. He has been criticized for ignoring the
proper role of an appellate judge and substituting his
judgment for that of the trial court in order to reach
the result he desires. While he may not have espoused a
philosophy as pernicious as that of Judge Bork's, he
reaches similar retrograde results.

        In certain areas, such as the First Amendment, he
has not expressed unmitigated hostility toward
litigants1 rights. This is true in selected criminal
cases as well. However, these limited exceptions do not
overcome a narrow view of civil and constitutional
rights which does not guarantee justice for all.

                                   WOMEN'S RIGHTS
        Two decisions in the area of women's rights are
particularly striking. In AFSCME v. State of
Washington. 770 F.2d 1401 (9th Cir. 1985) he reversed
the trial court and held that a class of 15,000
employees of the State of Washington failed to establish
a Title VII sex discrimination claim despite
overwhelming evidence that the women employees were
receiving lower wages than men for comparable work.
This was despite the State's admission that such
discrimination had taken place. Judge Kennedy permitted
such discrimination because, in his view, it was based
upon the free market system and the law of supply and
demand. In other words, if discrimination is rooted in
                                  1108

the society it is allowable.
        Judge Kennedy concurred in a dissenting opinion in

Gerdon v. Continental Airlines. 692 F.2d 602 (9th Cir.
1933) applying a similar analysis to a claim by airline
flight attendants that strict weight requirements for
women and not for men were discriminatory. The
airlines' justification was not safety, but rather that
its passengers preferred being served by attractive
women. Fortunately, the majority refused to accept this
as a legitimate reason and held it discriminatory on its
face. However in another decision, White v. Washington
public Power Supply CojngniffpiQn. 692 F.2d 1286 (9th Cir.
1982) he ruled, aontrary to ether courts, that section
1981 of the Civil Rights Act applied only to
discrimination against Blacks and did not protect women.
These decisions reflect actions in his personal life.
Until a short time ago he belonged to the Olympic Club
in San Francisco, a club that permitted no women
members. (He resigned because he knew he was being
considered for the Supreme Court.)

                            GAY AND LESBIAN RIGHTS
        Judge Kennedy, like Judge Bork, authored an opinion
upholding the right of the Navy to discharge personnel
who engaged in homosexual conduct. Beller v.
Middendorf. 632 F.2d 788 (9th Cir. 1980) Rather than
decide whether such conduct was a fundamental aspect of
the right to privacy, he accepted the claim of the Navy
                                   1109

that military necessity justified the dismissal of
homosexuals. While referring to the Supreme Court
decisions protecting privacy and the right to abortion,
notably absent was any affirmation that he affirmed or
adopted the reasoning of those cases.

        In an earlier case, Singer v. U.S. Civil Service
Commission. 530 F.2d 247 (9th Cir. 1976). Judge Kennedy
signed on to an opinion which allowed a gay activist to
be dismissed from his government job for being,
according to the Civil Service Commission, "an advocate
for a socially repugnant concept." The Supreme Court
vacated the decision saying an employee cannot be
summarily discharged without some showing that his or
her homosexual conduct is likely to impair the
efficiency of the Civil Service. The Singer reversal
might well explain Kennedy's toned-down language in
Beller v. Middendorf. The result is the same --
mandatory dismissal -- but Kennedy reaches for language
about the "special needs of the military" to justify the
result.

                             RACIAL DISCRIMINATION
         Decisions in the area of racial discrimination
demonstrate that Judge Kennedy has no understanding that
laws protecting racial equality are to be broadly and
liberally construed. His decision in Topic v. Circle
Realty. 532 F.2d 1273 (9th Cir. 1976) denied access to
the courts to a fair housing organization and homeowners
                               1110

against a group or realtors involved in racial steering.
To reach this result he had to bend previous Supreme
Court decisions and reject the reasoning of a number of
other courts. Three years later, in an opinion by
Justice Powell, the Supreme Court by a 7-2 margin
rejected Judge Kennedy's position. In Spanaler v.
Pasadena Board of Education. 611 F.2d 1239 (9th Cir.
1979) a school desegregation case, Judge Kennedy
concurred in the result by writing a long opinion which
disregarded important principles of judicial fact-
finding and gave a narrow view of the constitutional
right to attend desegregated schools.

                                   VOTING RIGHTS
        In what could have been a disaster for voting
rights litigation, Judge Kennedy wrote a long
concurrence rejecting a challenge to at-large voting by
Latinos in California, Aranda v. VanSickle. 600 F.2d
1267 (9th Cir. 1979). His analysis not only set forth a
requirement of invidious intent for such challenges to
be heard, but determined facts in a manner that allowed
him to reach the result he desired. This decision
essentially held up voting rights litigation in the 9th
Circuit until 1982 when Congress, by legislation,
overruled the narrow way in which Judge Kennedy and some
other judges had read the Voting Rights Act.
                                   1111

                                NATIVE AMERICANS
        Indians, like other minorities, have not fared well
in cases decided by Judge Kennedy. In Oliphant v.
Senile. 544 F.2d 1007 (1976), a case challenging the
right of an Indian tribe to try non-Indians for offenses
committed on the reservation, Judge Kennedy dissented
from permitting the tribe such jurisdiction. He labeled
the idea that Indian tribes had inherent sovereignty to
try such offenses as novel, and inconsistent with prior
practice. In Blackfeet Tribe of Indians v. State of
Montana. 729 F.2d 1192 (1984), Judge Kennedy joined a
dissent which demonstrated hostility toward the
principle that ambiguities in statutes are to be
resolved in favor of Indians. This is one of the
cardinal principles of Indian law.

                                      IMMIGRATION
        While Judge Kennedy claims to understand that
neither the Immigration and Naturalization Service nor
the Bureau of Indian affairs "inspire confidence", he
refuses to do very much about their errors. Villena v.
INS. 622 F.2d 1352 (9th Cir. 1980). His position is
that review of deportation proceedings should be quite
narrow, that the courts should give deference to
administrative proceedings and be primarily concerned
with rules and procedures and not individual cases.
                                  1112

                                          LABOR
        His rulings in the labor area are particularly
egregious. His greatest number of dissents are from
decisions enforcing union rights. For example, when
union members lobbied congress to protect their jobs
from foreign competition, a position contrary to that of
the company's, he dissented from a decision upholding an
unfair labor practice against the company for
disciplining the employees. Kaiser Engineers v.
National Labor Relations Board. 538 F.2d 1379 (9th Cir.
1976) .

                                       PRISONERS
        In United States v. Goveia. 704 F.2d 1116 (9th Cir.
1983), Judge Kennedy joined a dissent from a ruling
holding that prisoners had a right to counsel when they
had been placed in administrative detention when the
detention was due to a pending investigation or trial.

                                     ENVIRONMENT
        In Libbv Rod and Gun Club v. Poteat. 594 F.2d 742
(9th Cir. 1979), the court found that Congress did not
authorize the building of a dam which would have caused
environmental damage. Judge Kennedy dissented and found
that congressional appropriations were sufficient to
authorize the dam and that a specific authorizing
statute was not necessary. This ruling has implications
in other than environmental areas. For example, a
                                  1113

frequent claim by administrations is that congressional
funding is the equivalent of a declaration of war under
the Constitution. Apparently, Judge Kennedy would agree
with this reasoning.

                           INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CASES
        Judge Kennedy appears to have little compassion for
the individual asserting his or her rights and rarely
favors "the little guy.1* He often finds technical
grounds for getting rid of such cases.
        In EEOC v. Alioto Fish Co.. Ltd.. 623 F.2d 86 (9th
Cir. 1980), he authored an opinion upholding the
dismissal of an employment discrimination case because
the EEOC did not file its law suit until 62 months after
the employee filed her charges against the employer with
the EEOC. The fact that the employee had no control
over an EEOC office that was being gutted by the Reagan
Administration did not prevent her from being penalized
because of the EEOC's dereliction of its duties.
         In another case, Koucky v. Department of the Navy.
820 F.2d 300 (9th Cir. 1987), the Court of Appeals,
again in an opinion authored by Judge Kennedy, threw
out a lawsuit against the Department of the Navy by a
handicapped former naval employee because the lawsuit
named the "Department of the Navy" as a defendant when
it should have named the "Secretary of the Navy."
Furthermore, the Kennedy court would not allow the
claimant to amend his pleadings, deciding instead to
                                       1114

adhere to a rigid thirty day tine bar. As a result, the
plaintiff was not allowed to litigate his case.

         In yet another civil rights case, a Native American
woman succeeded in winning a $161,000 award in an
employment discrimination case from a trial court.
Apparently convinced that the amount awarded was not
sufficient to cover compensatory and punitive damages,
back pay, and-attorney's fees, she appealed to the Court
of Appeals. Focusing entirely on the arguments of the
'employer. Kennedy wrote an opinion for the Court
overturning the monetary award and ordering the
plaintiff to try her case anew. Thus, in her quest to
obtain more justice, the plaintiff was deprived of all
justice. See, White v. Washington Public Power Supply
System. 792 F.2d 1286 (9th Cir. 1982).

         The issue is not whether Judge Kennedy is as bad as
Judge Bork. Rather, it is whether we want a Supreme
Court and Supreme Court Justice that will build on the
civil rights and civil liberties gains of the past
years. We at the Center for Constitutional Rights do.
.We feel that Judge Kennedy will not move us forward; we
are fearful he will move us backward.

   Anntnttrnk, Vtrjuua                     TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF THE NOMINATION OF
    Springfield Virginia                           THE HONORABLE ANTHONY M. KENNEDY
Fred FnednMn, P C
tfakolm N Flcmini                                TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

  San Dl*go California    During his twelve (12) year tenure as a Judge on the United
  Salt Dtgo Calljonria    States District Court of Appeals, the Honorable Anthony M.
                          Kennedy has participated in over one thousand four hundred
                          (1,400) decisions and has authored over four hundred (400)
                          opinions. He has served a distinguished career on the
                          Federal bench, and, as a result of his experience, his legal
                          abilities, and his integrity, he has gained the support of a
                          wide spectrum of individuals and organizations for his
                          nomination.

                          As you part-take in this confirmation process, I urge you, as
                          a representative of the citizens of your state, to take into
                          consideration the experience, abilities, and integrity of
                          Judge  Kennedy. I pray that you will not be swayed by the
                          attacks on Judge Kennedy by those who oppose any nominee to
                          the United States Supreme Court that is put forth by
                          President Reagan. During the retention election for the
                          California State Supreme Court in 1986, cries were heard from
                          all over the State of California that then Chief Justice Rose
                          Bird and Associate Justices Cruz Peynoso and Joseph Grodin
                          should be voted upon on the basis of their abilities, and not
                          on the basis of their ideological beliefs. I would
                          respectfully suggest that these cries be heeded in this
                          instance and that you vote to confirm Justice Kennedy as an
                          Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court.

                          Respectfully Submitted,
